 Mr. Speaker, the chairman has done a wonderful job as the  chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and I know that you are working  together to bring people together. One of the things that I most admire  about Chairman Scott is that he wants to have a bipartisan result  coming out of his committee, and I think in this bill he has.   Mr. Speaker, every day Americans across the country must contend with  [[Page H5626]]  the rising prices caused by inflation. Whenever they pull up to the gas  pump, they face the repercussions of Vladimir Putin's criminal invasion  of Ukraine, which has made gas prices skyrocket--not just because of  the sanctions, not because of Russia's production, but because of the  lack of confidence in the future that this war has caused.   Whenever our people go to the grocery store, they suffer the  consequences of the havoc that the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted on  global supply chains. Unfortunately, we cannot erase the past crises  that led to our current economic situation.   I say to the Members of this Congress that we can take the meaningful  steps today to lower prices for consumers and to stimulate America's  economy in the weeks and months to come. That is why House Democrats  are focusing all week on easing inflation and bringing costs down. I  know that is what my Republican colleagues want to do as well.   While this may not be a perfect alternative--there are no perfect  alternatives--this is a positive step toward decreasing the costs to  our people of things that they must buy: fuel and food. To support that  mission, I am proud to bring the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act to the  floor today, at Mr. Scott's request.   America's farmers and ranchers have long fed our Nation, and indeed,  much of the world. Despite their essential work, however, they have  often struggled to turn a reliable profit in recent years because of  rising expenses, associated particularly with fertilizer--the costs of  which have gone up very substantially as a result of the crisis that we  confront.    By making fertilizer more affordable and by improving farmers' access  to loans for precision agricultural technology, this legislation will  help lower these production costs, which burden smaller farmers and  contribute to higher consumer food prices.   Additionally, this bill will lower gas prices by increasing biofuel  adoption and investment, and by giving consumers greater fuel choices  at the pump.   Lack of competition in the meat and poultry processing industries has  also jeopardized many of our family farmers and the people they feed.  Competition is the essence of a free market. Competition is the essence  of establishing prices that are reasonable and fair, both to producers  and to consumers.   Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help level that  playing field for small and independent producers trying to break into  the industry, which will both boost our meat processing capacity and  stoke healthy competition and innovation, which both sides of the aisle  believe is the way we have created this extraordinary economy we know  as the American economy: competition and free markets.   Similarly, this bill establishes a dedicated office within the  Department of Agriculture to strengthen enforcement of existing  antitrust authorities to consult on trade practices, ensuring a fairer,  more competitive industry that works better for consumers.   We know that if just a few producers have a monopoly--and that is one  of the problems with oil prices. We have OPEC nations who have  constricted supply when demand was up. What inevitably happens in a  free market? Prices rise.   This is about free markets. This is about competition. This is about  fair pricing for consumers. These reforms will enable our farmers to  produce food more efficiently, driving down costs for Americans at the  grocery store.   Not only will this legislation help us respond to the ramifications  of crises like the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, but they will also  make our agricultural sector and our economy more resilient to future  shocks.   This legislation is a crucial step toward reducing inflation. I thank  Representative Spanberger, Representative Craig, and Representative  Axne, and my friends on the Republican side who have worked on this,  and my friends on the Democratic side who have worked on this.   This is an important piece of legislation for the people--all of  them. All of our Members listened closely to the concerns of their  constituents and took a collaborative approach to come up with  legislation that addresses some of the most pressing needs of the  American people.                                time  1030    I thank the ranking member of this committee for his thoughtfulness  in approaching this issue.   Today, every Member of this House has an opportunity to do something  to ease inflation. Every Member has an opportunity to vote to ease  inflation today. We are eager to take that action, which is why we are  bringing this to the floor and voting to pass it.   I hope all of our Members will join us so we can show our  constituents that their Congress is addressing inflation and working  together on their behalf, not on our political behalves, but working  together to pass this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: vote ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, before I start on the colloquy and go  through the schedule, I was just talking to the Republican whip, my  friend, Mr. Scalise. We were talking about a friend of ours, his name  is John Bresnahan; he is  [[Page H5633]]  a reporter. He has covered Capitol Hill since 1994, I believe, is the  note I had. He is an excellent reporter.   He reports the facts. He reports the truth. As I know Mr. Scalise  agrees, reporters who do that not only serve us, but more importantly,  their major purpose is to serve the American people because we know  that a free press telling the facts and the truth to the American  people give them the opportunity to make solid decisions for our  democracy.   I wish John Bresnahan a happy 60th birthday, and hope that he has  many, many more. I have had 23 more than that, so I appreciate the fact  that he is still going strong.    Madam Speaker, I want to tell Mr. Bresnahan that he made  the same promise to me, which is why we did this. If he was going to  sing it, I was a little reluctant to do this, and he didn't. I join the  whip in wishing John Bresnahan, a friend, a very careful and honest  reporter, the very best 60th birthday and many more to come.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until  6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   Madam Speaker, on Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business.   On Monday, we will be celebrating Juneteenth as a Federal holiday for  the second time in American history. Juneteenth is the day on which the  last slaves who were in Texas learned of their new status as free  Americans, an extraordinary day in the history of our country,  eliminating one of the great blights on the history of America. As de  Tocqueville pointed out, we tried to heal our wounds and tried to heal  our wrongs, and we are still working on that.   Last year, the Congress took the historic step of enacting  legislation to recognize Juneteenth as a Federal holiday, at long last.  I look forward to celebrating as we pay tribute to freedom to all men  and women being created equal in the image of God. We celebrate the  history of the African-American perseverance and triumph over injustice  and adversity.   I say triumph--it has been a triumph--but there are battles yet to be  won. Juneteenth not only looks back but it looks forward to winning  those battles.   Madam Speaker, I see Mr. Green on the floor, who has a resolution on  the recognition of the blight of slavery. I thank him for that  resolution and look forward to having that considered.   On Monday, we will be celebrating that holiday, but we will be  celebrating it as we do Martin Luther King's birthday, as we ought to  be in celebrating Washington and Lincoln's birthday, and committing  ourselves to the realization of the principles for which they stood.   Madam Speaker, the House will consider bills under suspension of the  rules. The complete list of those suspension bills will be announced at  the close of business tomorrow.   Next week, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 7666, which is  titled Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act, a  bipartisan package of bills led by Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member  McMorris Rodgers, to address the mental health and opioid abuse crisis.   The legislation expands access to treatment for opioid use disorders,  promotes behavioral health integration, and reauthorizes critical  programs to support mental health and substance use disorder,  prevention, treatment, and recovery, including in our children.    Madam Speaker, the House will also consider legislation under  suspension from Chairman  Bobby Scott and members of the Education and  Labor Committee to address the mental health, addiction, and suicide on  college campuses, which is far, far too prevalent.   Our young people have faced stresses by the pandemic, stresses within  our Nation, the divisions on which prey on their minds, so this is a  very important piece of legislation. I hope it will be--and I believe  it is going to be--bipartisan.   The House will also take up H.R. 6411, the Veterans Affairs'  Committee Chairman Mark Takano's STRONG Veterans Act, again, bipartisan  legislation to combat veterans' suicide and address mental health, and  help our Nation meet its commitment to those who risk their lives and  safety for our country.   Additionally, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 5585,  Representatives Eshoo's ARPA-H Act. This legislation would establish  the Advanced Research Project Agency for Health, an independent agency  tasked with accelerating biomedical innovation and making  transformative breakthroughs in the fight against the most challenging  diseases confronting our people.   This agency will oversee the next steps in the Cancer Moonshot  program and help meet the President's goal of cutting the cancer death  rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and hopefully  sooner.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Pride Month, the House will consider  H.R. 4176, the LGBTQ Data Inclusion Act.   Madam Speaker, I anticipate that the House will vote on a  compromised, bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring  Our PACT Act, after the Senate takes action on the version agreed upon  in May. As the whip knows, that Act was a bipartisan act that dealt  with those who were exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances of  which they did not know while they were serving on bases, both here and  around the world.   This bill, we believe the Senate will take action on, a version  agreed upon in May, which preserves much of the House-passed  legislation to care for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic  chemicals during their service.   In addition, the House will consider other bills under suspension of  the rules, the complete list of suspension bills will be announced by  the close of business tomorrow. Additional legislative items are  possible.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H5634]]    I would simply observe, as I observed the other day, that we all want  to make sure that our Justices are safe.   Let me say, Madam Speaker, there is a very important reason for that.  We want to keep all our people safe. But nine Justices of our Supreme  Court represent that we are a nation of laws. They are one of the three  branches of our government. Just as I was extraordinarily and remain  extraordinarily concerned about the attack on this institution, the  Congress of the United States, as we were preparing to elect a  President of the United States, an attack on the Supreme Court and the  lives of the Supreme Court Justices are an attack on our democracy, on  a separate branch of government that is charged with continuing to make  us a nation of laws.   So, very frankly, the Supreme Court Justices, under existing law,  were protected. There were security people there. Luckily, there were  security people there. But the gentleman is absolutely right. We want  to make sure whether we agree or disagree with the individuals, whether  we agree or disagree with the opinions or the judgements that Congress  makes, we are a nation of laws, and the way to resolve our differences  is not through violence but through the democratic process.   I thank the gentleman for his observation.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We continue to talk about this as if this were the President's fault.  First of all, in a much wider range, this is a result of the pandemic.   Why is it the result of the pandemic?   Not solely the pandemic but let me take the pandemic first. Everybody  stayed home--this body and businesses across America.   What did that mean that they stayed home?   They stopped buying gas.   What did the oil companies do?   They shut down some of their production, a very substantial reduction  in production. But then as the prices went up, they were making as much  money or much more money. So in making much more money, they didn't  increase production, as the gentleman says will be an answer to the  question, in a country that does, in fact, have regulations and does  have rules, and because of those regulations and rules the production  of our energy is, in fact, as the gentleman asserts, more efficient and  more environmentally considerate.   The oil companies--acting from what they thought was good business  practice, demand was down, but prices were going up--were making  profits. They bought back stock, which, of course, increased the value  of the stock that remained. They increased dividends, which, of course,  encouraged people to invest in them. It made people happy about their  investments.   But they didn't increase production. They didn't have to increase  production. They were making good profits and making, from their  standpoint, good business decisions.   As I indicated in the last colloquy that we dealt with this problem,  there were millions of leases put on the market by this administration,  as I recall, some 80 million acres. Approximately 2 percent of the  leases were bid on, and then the Court said that this was not a legal  process.   But it is interesting how small was the interest in additional  production at that time irrespective of what happened subsequently.   The gentleman mentions a bill, as he has done in the past, H.R. 6858,  the American Energy Independence from Russia Act.   But before I say that, let me say, I hope the President is going to  Saudi Arabia to talk privately, not publicly trying to embarrass or  harangue, and certainly not to beg. The United States of America  doesn't need to beg any nation in the world, and this President is not  begging anybody.   This President should say, however, Madam Speaker: Saudis, stop  controlling the supply unreasonably and driving the prices up of your  product.   Yes, they are making more money, and they have a cartel. That is  called a monopoly. That cartel has made sure that the lack of supply  drove up the international market price. And then Russia went to war.   Now, Russia going to war has affected to some degree the supply of  oil, but, very frankly, buying Russian oil supports their criminal war  effort, their vicious and murderous war effort. We are all against  that. So we agreed that we would not take any oil, and we urged our  European allies not to rely on it either.   Now, what did that create?   It created a lack of confidence in the stability of the market.   What happens when you have lack of confidence in the stability of a  market?   Prices go up because it is a bet on what is going to happen with the  price of that product in the future that the market really reflects.   Now, the reason I say it that way is because these are not Biden  prices. Even if tomorrow we snapped a finger and said: ``Okay, go  ahead,'' nothing would happen tomorrow, nothing would  [[Page H5635]]  happen next week, and nothing would happen next month. It would take a  substantial period of time because the oil companies, based upon the  lack of demand, shut down, nor did they pursue further production.   Now, let me say something about the price of oil. The national price  of oil now does not reflect the increase as part of the market response  to what is called the West Texas Intermediary, which I am sure the  gentleman from Louisiana, an oil-producing State, knows much more about  than I do.   But let me say this: In 2008, that benchmark for crude oil peaked at  $147.02 in July of 2008. Adjusted for inflation, that is $199.57 today.   In that time, 2008, the average U.S. gasoline peaked at $4.14 per  gallon. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $5.62 today.   So, in other words, in 2008, otherwise known as the last year of the  Bush administration, gasoline prices were higher than they are today  notwithstanding the fact that the world price was $31 less.   Excuse me, yesterday, June 15, that West Texas Intermediary oil--the  benchmark for crude oil prices--was $116 a barrel, $31 less, without  accounting for inflation, which would make it greater than it was in  2008. That wasn't George Bush's fault. It was the international  market's fault and also this cartel that controls a large part of the  supply of the oil in our country.   Now, my point--I still have to deal with H.R. 6858. One of its tenets  is to approve the Keystone pipeline. The problem with that is, for  whatever reason--and I understand my friend will have a response, Madam  Speaker, as to well, because you disapproved it, meaning the Obama  administration. They want to open the Keystone pipeline. The problem is  the company that had the Keystone pipeline has abandoned it. Even if it  were approved, they would have to get back in business and we would be  well over a year--well over a year.   Now, I happen to have agreed that we should have approved that  pipeline. I have said that publicly. I said that to the press. That  didn't happen. But it would not solve the problem. And particularly,  when you look at the figures that I just gave with respect to the world  market price, we are paying a lot more now than we did in 2008 when it  was higher.   So I would say to my friend, he also had a provision that expedites  the LNG facility approval process. One of the problems we had is 20  percent of the LNG export capacity is now shut down.                                time  1230    It was shut down because the regulations that the gentleman speaks  of, correctly, were not followed, and the LNG plant had an explosion.  It shut down because it violated regulations that were imposed upon it.   What I would say to my friend--I have talked to the committee about  his bill. The LNG process is working. As I told him, I have an LNG  export plant in my district, which has changed from substantial exports  to the Pacific region, and now, 80 percent is going to Europe to try to  bridge that gap as the Europeans retreat from being dependent upon  Russian oil.   I tell my friend, with all due respect--and I am not going to plead  with him, but I am going to suggest to him--we are going to Saudi  Arabia, I hope, to tell them in private: Look, this is not a game you  want to be playing. You are making our consumers pay far more.   We have acted. We acted, and we passed, some time ago, a bill that  said you cannot have gas prices that are set at unreasonable levels,  which we know as gouging. It is like you have a flood in your city and  80 percent of the grocery stores are wiped out, and the grocery stores  that remain triple their prices. That is called gouging. We passed that  bill.   We also passed a bill today which, unfortunately, most Republicans  voted against--``most,'' I say, not all--which will, again, seek to  bring the price down at the pump. How? By utilizing American products  to supplement and expand the supply of gas and, we believe, bring the  price of a gallon down some 40 cents--that is what the experts say--if  we continue to use a mix of fuel.   But let me say in closing, on these remarks, which I know have been  relatively lengthy, we are in this together, Republicans and Democrats.   FOX News criticized me for saying we are at war. We just sent a  billion dollars for a war we are not in because we believe in freedom.  We believe in international law.   We believe that we have a dictator, a dangerous dictator, who is  committing war crimes through his men and women in eastern Ukraine in  particular and did it in western Ukraine as they came into Kyiv.   We are in this together, one Nation, one America, on behalf of  freedom. We have taken tough action. As part of that, we are paying the  price at the pump because of that invasion.   The pandemic shut down production and shut down the purchase of  gasoline by people because they didn't go to work. They didn't need to  get in their cars. They didn't need to commute.   I would simply say to my friend that we are on the same team. Our  President is leading our effort to defeat this despot, to stop this  war, to ensure the freedom not only of the Ukrainian people but of all  people, and to ensure that we respect international law.   I looked at the gentleman's bill. I would be glad to talk about other  ways, including maybe some of the things that are in his bill. But I  will tell the gentleman, the first couple that I looked at, the  Keystone pipeline is not going to be reopened. The gentleman and I may  lament that as a policy because I was publicly, during the Obama  administration, for the approval of that pipeline. So, I am prepared to  work with the gentleman to see what we can do.   But we have done today's bill. It may not be perfect. It may not  work. But it is certainly worth a try, to try to bring these awful  prices down at the pump because I know all of our constituents, whether  they live in Louisiana or Maryland, are struggling because they have to  use their cars. They have to use that gasoline. They don't have an  alternative. And they don't have an alternative to buying food.   Both of those are tough, and we need to act together to try to see if  we can solve that problem in the context of an extraordinary pandemic,  a historic pandemic that shut down the world, and we are just trying to  get back.   We are trying to get supply chains going, including gasoline  pipelines, which is why the President is going to Saudi Arabia, not to  beg, but to assert the economic fact of the ramifications of the  cartels stifling supply.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all of that  information.   It continues to befuddle me why our Republican friends would much  prefer to blame President Biden and so avoid placing blame on Mr.  Trump's friend, Mr. Putin. I don't understand that, Madam Speaker. It  is not a nation indivisible.   Now, Madam Speaker, I used a statistic some weeks ago that I have  heard not at all disputed. The Biden administration has approved more  drilling permits on public land in 2021, in 1 year, than the Trump  administration did each year during its first 3 years in office.                                time  1245    Not compared to the combined 3 years, just compared to each  individual year. Number one.   Number two: Domestic oil production is greater today than it was  under Trump. Not a whole big difference, 10,968 versus 11,185, but  nevertheless, it speaks to the fact that the representation that  somehow Biden has shut down the industry, and therefore, he is to  blame.   We don't want to talk about the pandemic that shut down oil  production. In Trump's last year--in Trump's last year--refineries in  the U.S. reduced their capacity by more than 800,000 barrels. So, under  the Trump administration, production was decreased.   Maybe they will look at the records and see whether or not that  representation is accurate, and if it is not, I stand to be corrected.  But those are the figures I have.   I notice that my friend did not respond to my representation that  prices were higher under George Bush in 2008 than they are today. Now,  because of inflation, the number is different, and compared to the  world price, prices are higher.   So, I will say to my friend, we had at least 80 million acres, 2.5  million taken. As the gentleman pointed out before, the court said, No,  that wasn't legal, so it was never effected. But we have those 800,000  that are not back online.   Don't blame them, though. Don't blame Putin. Don't blame the  pandemic. Politically, let's blame Biden.   Now, I'm not sure why Bush had the higher price. Maybe it was that he  was shutting down the oil business, the President from Texas. Maybe.  [[Page H5637]]    But there is more today being produced. Not by enough. Still, there  are 800,000 barrels shut down. That is per day, by the way; not just  800,000--per day.   So we can argue back and forth on this. We are passing legislation.  Our Republican friends, for the most part, voted against it. It won't  work. It won't do.   I don't know whether they are right or wrong, but it is worth trying.  It is worth trying because our consumers are hurting.   People at the grocery store--I go to the grocery store every weekend,  Madam Speaker. I live alone. I don't buy a lot of groceries because  they will go bad, so I go every weekend.   I see the shelves that are empty. I see the price of bacon has gone  up now over $10. I see the price of the eggs I get, the price of the  half and half I buy, or the orange juice I buy. It is going up.   I am in the fortunate position where I can pay for it without it  binding me someplace else. But I know that a whole lot of people that I  see shopping, they have got that list out, and they are very worried  about their costs.   I don't know whether this bill we just passed is going to solve  that--certainly, not overnight. I don't know whether a month from now  it will help somewhat, 5 cents or 10 cents on a pound of bacon or a  dozen eggs.   I don't know that, but it was worth a try, and we passed this bill.  We got some Republican support, including, I think, the ranking member  of the committee that reported the bill out.   We are not technically at war, but we are spending a lot of money on  behalf of freedom, and we ought to be together. We ought not to be  carping about our President who is doing everything he can think of to  try to get a handle on this, both on inflation, on the cost to  consumers, and on the supply of a product that we all need.   So, I would simply make a request that let's work together to try to  get this problem solved. Saudi Arabia is not the answer, but it is part  of the answer. The cartel is part of the answer. The Russians are part  of the answer.   Maybe none of them are the entire answer. But when you understand  that this administration has given more leases on public land than the  prior administration did in its first 3 years, it is hard to say that  this administration is the reason for this. Other than politically, it  is a very salient argument, but that is all it is.    Oh, okay. Sorry.    Would the gentleman yield?    What I said was, in Trump's last year, refineries in the  U.S. reduced their capacity by more than 800,000 barrels. That didn't  have anything to do about leases.   That had to do with an economic decision, which probably made sense  because what happened is the economy was contracting.   Madam Speaker, 2.8 million net jobs were lost during the 4 years of  Trump, and 8.7 million have been gained.   As they have been gaining, people are getting back in their cars.  They are getting back and driving. They are spending on the economy.  But what happened?   The pandemic had shut down supply lines. And the oil companies,  rationally, when demand went down, they reduced capacity. They don't  need a new lease to go back up to the 800,000. They were doing it under  the present authorization that they have.   That was my point. It continues to be my point. The companies have  made a decision and they are not moving ahead rapidly to try to get  more production.   One of the reasons is--I get it--they are making a lot of money. Some  oil companies have got 300 percent greater profits now than they had  some years ago. 300 percent.    So, why do we need to do more product? We are making great money.  Chevron says it had the most successful year in 2021 than it has ever  had. It may be another oil company. I may be wrong on that.   Was it Chevron? I am asking somebody who probably knows the answer  better than me. One of the oil companies reported that.   I am not criticizing them for that. What I am saying is, this is a  multifaceted challenge that confronts us, and we ought to address it in  a way that it deserves, and that is in a bipartisan way that will have  effect.   I am going to work with the gentleman. As I said, I was for Keystone.  I was not for shutting Keystone down. I was approving it to go ahead. I  thought it made sense. Our friends in Canada have an extraordinary  supply.   As the gentleman observes, though--interestingly, because I think  many of your colleagues oppose those rules and regulations--it is  cleaner. It is better for the environment to produce it here.   Why? Because we adopted regulations--either the administration  adopted or we passed them in legislation, and very frankly, I think  that many of those were opposed by--I don't know whether you, but many  in your party, so it is better to do it here.   So I don't want to dispute that, but it is also necessary to have  production, particularly among the cartel countries, and Russia has no  interest--Russia has an interest in additional production.   Why? Because that is how they are funding this war. But we ought to  spend time on criticizing Putin and his war and the crimes that are  being committed in his name in Ukraine, and our determination to make  sure the Ukrainian people who have displayed extraordinary courage, and  Zelenskyy, who has displayed extraordinary leadership, make sure they  know that we are focused on them. And we are focused against Putin, not  our own President, any more than I did when, you know, George Bush was  President.   Very frankly, I supported, as the gentleman probably knows, the trade  bills. I thought it was good to do business. A lot of our people didn't  support him on that. I supported him on that.   So I think we need to be not so critical of our President. We have  one President at a time. We had a pandemic. It wasn't on his watch we  got a pandemic. It was on his watch that we got a handle on the  pandemic.   On his watch, he has been giving more access to public lands than his  predecessor did. We can debate the nuances of differences, but we ought  to focus on why we have this crisis.   The gentleman knows these prices in many ways reflect the confidence  and the stability, or the lack of confidence and the lack of stability  in the market, and the war directly relates to that issue.
