 Madam President, I come to the floor first to associate  myself with the remarks of the distinguished senior Senator from Texas,  and I agree completely with his comments regarding what is happening  right now in Ukraine on the ground and what is happening with energy in  America and our need to become energy independent again. To go from  this current position of what had previously been energy dominance to  now energy dependence--we need to return to the days of energy  dominance for the United States because it is not just about our  national security, it is about security for our friends and allies  around the world so they don't have to be dependent on the likes of the  killer and the thug Vladimir Putin.   So I come to the floor today to talk about what is going on in  Ukraine and the war in Ukraine and the global implications thereof.   Right now, the world is watching in horror as Vladimir Putin  continues  [[Page S1038]]  with his onslaught. Russia has now shelled two nuclear facilities.  Russia continues to attack civilian targets. Russia has allegedly used  cluster bombs near schools and hospitals. We know that dozens of  children have been killed. Russian troops have even attacked an  orphanage and a kindergarten. It is heartbreaking, and it is also  barbarism straight out of Hell.   The world is right to be outraged by these vicious attacks, and we  know how these attacks have been paid for. We know how Vladimir Putin  has funded his aggression. These atrocities were all paid for through  Russian energy. Energy is the reason that Vladimir Putin can afford to  invade Ukraine. It is the cash cow that drives his military--oil and  gas from Russia. Half of Russia's economy is based on energy, and  nearly half of Europe's imports of energy come from Russia. So, as I  said, energy is the cash cow that has funded the war.   Russia is the No. 2 producer of crude oil in the world, and Putin is  the No. 1 rival to the United States in terms of energy production.  Well, under Joe Biden as President, there has been a lot less  competition for Vladimir Putin. It is not for lack of American energy  resources, and it certainly is not for lack of American energy workers.  No, it is because of the reckless policies of President Joe Biden and  this administration.   On Friday last week, I was in Cheyenne, WY, at the State capital,  where I spent 5 years as a State senator prior to coming to the U.S.  Senate. Every member of the Wyoming Legislature, Republican and  Democrat alike, understands fully that the resources we need to power  our country are here in the United States. We have the energy in the  ground. Yet this administration is not allowing us to use it. We have  the workers ready to go, plenty in Wyoming and around the country. The  Biden administration continues to block us from producing more American  energy.   Those legislators I talked to on Friday--they know. Every one of them  knows that on Joe Biden's first day in office, he killed the Keystone  XL Pipeline. They know because they follow the news, and they know  because Joe Biden bragged about it. He said: Look at me, I am going to  kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. And he did with an Executive order on  day No. 1.   Since then, he has blocked oil and gas leases on public land. Quarter  after quarter after quarter--we are now in the fifth quarter in a row  where he has blocked all oil and gas leases on public land. No auctions  for those leases have been held.   He also stopped exploration in the Arctic. The Russians are exploring  for energy in the Arctic, but, no, not Joe Biden. Nope. After you, Mr.  Putin. You go get it and sell it. And we know how he is using the  money. So Joe Biden decides he wants to handcuff America from doing the  same thing--exploring for energy in the Arctic.   At the same time, it has become nearly impossible to build a natural  gas pipeline in the United States. You say: No, it can't be possible.  Well, the President's lackeys--lackeys--on the Federal Regulatory  Commission recently decided to change their approval process for  natural gas pipelines. As Putin's army surrounded Ukraine, Joe Biden's  lackeys on the FERC changed the way they approved pipelines. They did  it as inflation hit record-high numbers, with war looming in Europe. It  is astonishing. Joe Manchin called them, as did I, as the chairman and  ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee--called them in front of  the committee last week, a hearing last Thursday--and asked them to  explain themselves, why this attack on American energy.   You know, our country produced lots of oil before COVID. We are  producing some now, but we are still a million barrels a day below  where we were during the peak prior to COVID. So when supply and  production at home is down, prices go up.   Earlier today, gasoline prices hit the highest price ever--ever--but  prices were way up even before Russia invaded Ukraine. The day Joe  Biden took office, gas prices were $2.38 per gallon nationwide. Today,  the average is $4.17. It cost more than $5 a gallon in leftwing  California. They may be happy to pay the price. People in Wyoming are  not, where they drive lots of miles to and from work. In Wyoming, the  number of miles driven is the highest per capita anywhere in the  country.   We know what happens to families when gas prices go up and they have  to put more money in the tank that could have otherwise been used for  food, for clothing, for school supplies for the kids.   I understand that a gallon of gas in Los Angeles now is at $7.   Last year, a typical working family paid about $1,000 more to fill  their tank over the course of the year than they did the year before  Joe Biden became President. It is a direct result of the policies of  this administration. And this year, it is likely to be a lot higher  because this administration's policies, environmental-extremist driven,  are making energy at home much more expensive.    So today, after 2 weeks into the war, Joe Biden has announced a ban  on Russian oil. It is about time.   On Saturday, a number of us were in a Zoom call with President  Zelenskyy, the brave, heroic, courageous President of Ukraine. He said:         If [we] had started sanctions months ago, there would not       have been a war.    Now the question is, What is going to replace the Russian oil?  Because up until today, Joe Biden was eager to buy Russian oil--eager.  So the question is, What is going to replace the Russian oil? Well, it  darn well ought to be American oil. Democrats have basically floated a  couple of proposals. Buy it from Iran, they say; buy it from Venezuela,  they say; or don't buy any at all.   On Thursday, the Secretary of Transportation said a possibility was  ``working out something with Iran.'' Remember those people? They are  the ones who every Friday have a demonstration where they chant ``death  to America'' and burn the American flag. He wants to work something out  with them.   Let me remind the people who are watching that Iran is the No. 1  state sponsor of global terrorism. Iran is on the verge of a nuclear  weapon. Now Democrats want to give Iran a windfall of American dollars.   The last time Democrats bribed Iran, the Secretary of State was John  Kerry. He admitted right out that some of the money would go to  terrorists, and we know that some of it did. Democrats signed the check  anyway. Pallets of cash were delivered to Tehran. Now Democrats are  talking about doing it all over again.   Oh, and think about John Kerry. What did he say in an interview with  the BBC just a week and a half ago, as Russian troops were on the  border surrounding Ukraine? He said he hoped that what was happening  there ``did not distract''--``did not distract''--from the climate  agenda. Oh yeah, we wouldn't want the death of all those people to  distract from your agenda, Mr. Kerry, former Senator Kerry, former  Secretary of State. But he is not just the former, he is the current  climate spokesman for this administration. He is the voice of climate  in this administration. So that must mean that Joe Biden doesn't want  it to distract from his climate agenda either.   It is time to wake up.   Over the weekend, the Biden administration officials went to  Venezuela. According to media reports, they discussed easing sanctions  on Venezuelan oil.   Nicolas Maduro is one of the world's biggest cheerleaders for you  know who? Vladimir Putin. He supports Russia's war in Ukraine. He  apparently called the Kremlin to say that just this past week.   This means that the Biden administration is actually actively  considering and pursuing, as they were on Saturday, replacing oil from  Russia with oil from a Russian client state in our own hemisphere. It  is bad energy policy. It is bad foreign policy. It almost seems to be  something out of ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Yet, it still makes more  sense than the third idea that Democrats are floating: Let's just let  energy prices go higher and higher.   The White House Press Secretary said that we should just stop using  oil altogether. She says the solution to high gas prices and war in  Europe is just stop using gas. This is delusional. The idea that we can  immediately transition away from oil and gas is a fairy tale. It is a  dangerous fairy tale at that.   None of these three solutions proposed by the Democrats is in the  best  [[Page S1039]]  interest of our Nation, our Nation's energy security, or our Nation's  national security. Oil from Iran and oil from Venezuela is just as  dangerous as oil from Russia. Changing our entire economy overnight is  not an option in the real world.   There is only one answer that works, and that is the answer that the  American people are pleading for. The solution to Russian oil is more  American oil. We must replace Russian oil with American energy. To do  that, we need to produce more. We have the resources. We have the  workers. We have the expertise. What we need is the leadership out of  the White House in Washington, DC, and we are not getting it.   We ought to produce enough American energy to supply our allies and,  above all, to bring down prices for people here at home. That is why I  have introduced legislation called the ESCAPE Act, to escape what is  happening with this control of our energy and the increase in prices.  It stands for Energy Security Cooperation With Allied Partners in  Europe. This bill expedites the sale of American natural gas to our  NATO allies.   I also led a letter with every Republican on the Energy Committee and  sent it to President Biden the morning after his State of the Union  Address. Our letter details 10 specific plans, 10 specific actions the  President can take today to produce more American energy.   We are much better off producing and selling energy to our friends  than being forced to buy it from our enemies.   What President Biden and the Democrats don't seem to believe is the  undeniable truth that energy security is national security. For  ourselves and for our allies, we need more American energy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
