 Mr. President, section 20l(f) of the unemployment  extension provisions of the bill we are considering this evening  contains language limiting retroactive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance  compensation for applicants that had not applied by the date of  enactment of this bill.   It is my understanding that this provision is intended to cover  individuals who have known for months of their eligibility for benefits  but failed to apply in a timely manner. However, it is also my  understanding that this provision is not intended to apply in cases  where the individuals have only recently learned they would be eligible  for PUA and a State unemployment office had previously advised those  individuals not to apply for benefits. This is the case, for instance,  for secondary schools students in Minnesota, who were advised by the  State that they were not eligible for PUA, but a court recently  determined that the students were indeed eligible earlier this month.   It is also my understanding that this provision is not intended to  apply to individuals who have filed a regular State unemployment  insurance claim that remains in adjudication, who later find out that  they are ineligible for regular unemployment compensation and must  apply for PUA instead.  [[Page S7927]]    Senator Wyden was the lead Democratic negotiator on the unemployment  provisions of this bill. Does he share the same understanding of the  intent of this provision?    Thank you for the clarification and for your work in  drafting the unemployment compensation language in this bill.
