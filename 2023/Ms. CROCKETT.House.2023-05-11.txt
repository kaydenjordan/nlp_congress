 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in memory of the eight  Texans who lost their lives last weekend during a shooting in Allen,  Texas. These eight Texans should be the future of Texas: Young,  diverse, full of life and promise. Instead, they represent the tragedy  of Texas today: A Texas where a family must prepare for a trip to the  mall as if it is an active war zone. A Texas where lives of  kindergartners have less value than the right of Neo-Nazis to own AR- 15s.   Mr. Speaker, I rise and ask the question: Aren't you tired of  grieving? Is this what your constituents sent you here to do, to send  thoughts and prayers?   Texans are tired of grieving.   El Paso, Uvalde, Cleveland, Allen, and the list goes on. We simply  can't accept this. For the eight lives lost in Allen, we will not  accept this. For the five lives lost in Cleveland, we will not accept  this. For the 19 children and two teachers murdered in Uvalde, we will  not accept this. For the 23 lives lost in El Paso, we will not accept  this.   We must honor our fellow Texans with action. It is the very least  that we can do.                            ____________________
