 Mr. Chairman, I thank my esteemed colleagues for raising  the issue, but it is more an issue of accuracy than anything else.   As we look at this, Mr. Chairman, it is real easy to look at CBO and  realize that they are the one group that makes a weatherman's 10-day  forecast look accurate. They consistently miss it all the time.   When you look at the 2002 farm bill, they missed it by $137 billion.  The 2008 farm bill, they missed by $309 billion. Eventually, it adds up  to real money.   But even with that, let's look at the sale of 64 million barrels of  oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve. They actually said that there is no  income from that and that it costs the government to get rid of 64  million barrels of oil. What kind of analysis does that?   So if my friend opposite wants to debate this over the accuracy, I  welcome it.   Mr. Chair, it is time that we deal with this.
