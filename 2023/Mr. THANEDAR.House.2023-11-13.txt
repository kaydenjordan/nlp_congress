 Mr. Speaker, in Congress, our mission is clear: to  serve the people. However, a pattern has emerged that is troubling.   We are seeing an endless cycle of censure resolutions and impeachment  measures from some factions within the Republican Party.   This isn't just about disagreement. It is about distraction.   These actions are eating up valuable time and resources, resources  that should be spent on solving real issues facing our constituents.   I call on my colleagues across the aisle: Let's rethink this path.  Our duty to govern, to really serve our people, must come before  personal promotion or political posturing. We are here to work for the  well-being of our Nation and its citizens.   I urge my friends on the other side to put an end to this relentless  brinkmanship. It is not about backing down. It is about stepping up to  our responsibilities.                            ____________________
