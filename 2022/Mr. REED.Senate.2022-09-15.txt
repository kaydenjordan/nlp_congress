 Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Cortez Masto  in introducing the Private Markets Transparency and Accountability Act,  a bill that will address a disturbing trend in our capital markets.  Increasingly, some of America's largest and most important companies  are exploiting weaknesses in our securities laws to stay or go dark;  that is, they are avoiding requirements to enter the public markets,  where disclosure and transparency are required under law. Instead, they  are remaining indefinitely in the private markets, where there is less  visibility into the health and activities of the company.   Why should average Americans care? First, they are invested in these  companies through pension plans and mutual funds. Second, transparency  is the lifeblood of fair and efficient markets. And third, these  companies have incredible influence over our society and way of life.   This legislation will address this disturbing trend by requiring the  Nation's largest and most important private companies to register with  the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. Requiring registration  would put these companies on par with publicly traded corporations with  regard to ongoing public disclosure about their business practices and  financial condition.   The most significant development in the capital markets over the last  decade has been the explosive growth of the private markets. According  to consulting firm McKinsey, annual private market fundraising reached  a record of almost $1.2 trillion worldwide in 2021 up from $380 billion  in 2011. More money has been raised in the private markets than in the  public markets each year over the past 10 years. Many large companies  find the allure of virtually no public transparency or oversight that  is available in the private markets irresistible. Under current law,  they find that it is all too easy to stay private forever.   Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act, a private  company  [[Page S4641]]  must register with the SEC after reaching 2,000 shareholders ``of  record.'' But this requirement is easily circumvented because a single  Wall Street broker or bank, which holds securities on behalf of  thousands of underlying investors, is counted as one recordholder. The  SEC estimates that under this threshold, 89 percent of public companies  could choose to transition to the private markets and go dark tomorrow.   This threshold desperately needs reform. Former SEC Chairman Mary  Schapiro has testified before the Banking Committee that ``since the  definition of `held of record' was put into place, a fundamental shift  has occurred in how securities are held in the United States.'' And  Harvard Law Professor John Coates recently testified before the  committee that ``there is much to be said for revisiting the thresholds  that are built into the [Exchange] Act, thinking about them in a  different way, [and] not simply counting numbers.''   It should be alarming when private companies can become extremely  large and influential in our economy and raise unlimited amounts of  capital from an unlimited number of investors, while circumventing the  basic disclosure and governance requirements that Congress sought to  apply. That is what is happening today. A central feature of the  Exchange Act has effectively been gutted.   Again, these are not small or inconsequential companies. Former SEC  Commissioner Allison Herren Lee has observed that very large private  companies are ``notable not just for their size, but for their  transformational impacts on our way of life. They have, for example,  changed the transportation and travel habits of millions across the  globe, spawned billions of dollars in litigation, changed the legal  underpinnings of entire markets, and launched civilians into space.  Yet, despite their outsize impact, there is little public information  available about their activities. They are not required to file  periodic reports or make the disclosures required in proxy statements.  They are not even required to obtain, much less distribute, audited  financial statements. This has consequences for investors and  policymakers alike, which in turn may have consequences for the broader  economy.''   The Private Markets Transparency and Accountability Act would restore  the Exchange Act in order to provide the public with the essential  insight it needs to make informed decisions. Under our legislation,  private companies would be required to register with the SEC if they  either reach a valuation of $700 million, excluding shares held by  affiliates, or have at least 5,000 employees and $5 billion in  revenues. These companies would enter the public disclosure system that  Congress established in the Exchange Act and would have powerful  incentives to conduct public stock offerings and list their shares on  stock exchanges.   Our legislation would provide mom-and-pop investors in the private  markets with nearly all of the same protections that they are entitled  to in the public markets. Pension plans that invest in companies  through private equity funds would finally be able to obtain basic  information about those companies, such as their audited financial  statements, and employees who get compensated with company stock and  options would be able to determine the true value of their shares. They  would no longer need to fly blind when deciding whether to take another  job and face the potentially enormous financial consequences of  relinquishing their stock or options.   By mandating that very highly valued or large companies register with  the SEC, our legislation would raise the bar on governance for  companies that control huge swaths of our economy. The ability to stay  private forever has directly led to the dramatic rise of ``unicorns,''  or private companies with at least a $1 billion valuation. At the start  of December 2021, the United States had nearly 473 unicorns. Some of  these unicorns have been plagued by scandals and toxic cultures,  without needing to comply with governance requirements for public  companies designed to curb waste and force management accountability.  Still others have been exposed as outright frauds. In these situations,  investors suffer losses while fund managers keep their fees and company  executives keep their bonuses. Arguably, greater transparency would  have protected investors from unnecessary losses. Indeed, some unicorns  that received sky-high valuations in the opaque private markets saw  those valuations tumble when they faced the discipline and scrutiny  that comes with public market transparency.   Finally, our legislation helps markets allocate capital more  efficiently. When risks are obscured in dark corners of our markets,  then capital may not be directed towards the most deserving companies.  When similar companies in similar industries of similar size are  subject to wildly different disclosure requirements, market  participants have less information to value those companies. That means  the shares of many public companies may not be accurately priced.  Without accurate prices, retail investors cannot have confidence that  they are getting reasonable returns on their hard-earned savings.   Our capital markets depend on disclosure and transparency. As more  companies remain private indefinitely or go dark, we lose those  features and weaken the foundational strengths of our economy. We need  to restore these bedrock requirements and ensure that they apply to all  major companies whether they are in the private or the public markets.   I thank the bill's supporters, including the AFL-CIO, the Consumer  Federation of America, the North American Securities Administrators  Association, the Healthy Markets Association, Public Citizen, former  SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson, Columbia Law Professor John Coffee,  and Harvard Law Professor John Coates.   I would like to thank Senator Cortez Masto for working with me on  this legislation, and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting  the Private Markets Transparency and Accountability Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 4864. A bill to amend the Natural Gas Act to bolster fairness and  transparency in the consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline  permits, to provide for greater public input opportunities in the  natural gas pipeline permitting process, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
