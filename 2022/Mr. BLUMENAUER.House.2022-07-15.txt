 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 8351) to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the  United States to suspend temporarily rates of duty on imports of  certain infant formula products, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8351         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Formula Act''.       SEC. 2. TEMPORARY DUTY SUSPENSIONS FOR INFANT FORMULA.

(d) Entry Requirements.--In seeking to enter articles of       infant formula duty-free under this Act, importers shall       provide the applicable tariff classification for such       articles under chapter 19 or chapter 21 along with the       anticipated tariff classification under subchapter III of       chapter 99 (as added by subsection (a)) on applicable customs       entry documents.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The news about supply chain disruptions have filled the news, but  none is more compelling and urgent for communities across America than  facing challenges due to the infant formula shortage. This is an urgent  issue for our families.   Between supply chain issues due to the pandemic and the closure of a  Michigan infant formula plant, out-of-stock rates have reached perilous  levels. The out-of-stock rate was 31 percent in mid-April and rose to  90 percent in 10 States by the end of May. In my State, Oregon, we  faced an out-of-stock rate higher than 85 percent.   While these numbers alone tell a horrific story, there is no number  that can capture the fear and frustration felt by families who are  searching for formula to serve their babies. As a parent and  grandparent, I can assure you that there is nothing as anxiety- and  anger-  [[Page H6630]]  inducing as not being able to properly care for your child.   I have heard stories of families going store to store or posting on  social media asking for help as they try to find the formula their  family needs. Families have enough to worry about without worrying  about how to feed their baby.   The Federal Government must provide the support needed to help these  children and families and explore every possible option. This  administration and Congress has made significant progress by invoking  the Defense Production Act, increasing flexibility for the WIC program,  and easing restrictions on imports to fill supply chain shortages.   While the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion to increase  imports, imported infant formula remains subject to high tariffs. These  tariffs, which increase the cost of the formula imports by an estimated  27 percent, only exaggerate the suffering families face at this time.   It is unacceptable that families would be taxed on a product that  they need and have no other way of getting in the midst of this crisis.  Our Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee is committed to leveraging our  jurisdiction to reduce these costs.   I especially appreciate my colleague Suzan DelBene for her  partnership and leadership on this legislation. She was integral to  this effort, and we wouldn't be here today without her.   The Formula Act reaffirms Congress' constitutional authority to  regulate commerce from foreign nations by temporarily suspending  tariffs on imported infant formula through the end of this year. This  change should help make formula more affordable and accessible to  families in every State.   I am grateful for the support of Chairman Neal; Ranking Member Brady;  Ranking Member Smith, who is managing the bill for the Republicans; and  the Ways and Means Committee in bringing this bipartisan legislation to  the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a committee member  and a leader on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a senior member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the partnership with my good friend, Mr. Smith. We have  been able to move this expeditiously. I do appreciate his observation  that there are challenges that we meet, and we would hope that our  government and the various agencies that are involved are able to  respond quickly. That, of course, is something that we need to empower  them to do, these partnerships.   Sometimes there is a little tension about the role and nature of  government agencies, but this is an example, admittedly, where we want  to get ahead of the curve, and the powers that agencies have can be  used constructively.   I am pleased that our committee, for example, sprang into action  dealing with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia to suspend tariff  advantages for Russia, and we moved that quickly on a bipartisan basis.  Particularly in this case we have 26 members of the Ways and Means  Committee who are cosponsoring this legislation, and it was able to  move quickly.   Unlike what often happens with things we pass in the House that  linger in the Senate, it looks like the Senate is poised to be able to  act quickly in response to our action here today.   So I hope we come together. I hope we have a unanimous vote that  would suspend this 27 percent additional cost on families struggling to  meet the needs of their children. I hope that we can continue to look  at areas where we need to refine tools to make sure that things like  this don't happen again and we work together to try to hit the right  balance.   In the meantime, I think we have hit the right balance with this  legislation. I appreciate the partnership, and I look forward to its  passage today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I want to begin to acknowledge the  pain that people have experienced in the wake of being stripped of  their rights and being thrust into legal limbo.   We have already seen the impact this horrific decision has had on  increased wait times in clinics, and doctors forced to consult with  lawyers because of State restrictions, while patients may be dying on  operating tables.   The barbaric treatment of the 10-year-old child, a victim of rape,  made into a media circus, and the prospect of the doctor who provided  her care being subjected to legal action.   We know the Supreme Court has put us all on the wrong side of  history. These appalling stories reinforce the fact that denying  fundamental healthcare has dire and unforeseen circumstances far beyond  the slogans that have been bandied around.   I believe it is our duty to take responsibility to make progress in  even these difficult circumstances to provide a path forward. This  legislation does that.   We owe it to American families to make progress, to protect them and  improve access to this right, and spare them government intrusion into  the most sensitive and personal matters. Our rage must be productive.
