 Madam Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of  September 29, 2021, I call up the bill (H.R. 5305) making continuing  appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for  providing emergency assistance, and for other purposes, with the Senate  amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R.  5305.  [[Page H5578]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Extending Government Funding  and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act. By extending government  funding through December 3, this bill provides tens of billions of  dollars to support working families who live paycheck to paycheck.   It ensures that vital education, health, housing, and public safety  programs continue to serve those who rely on them. And at a time of  economic devastation in many parts of our country, we need a government  that looks out for the middle class, for working families, for small  businesses, and the vulnerable who work hard.   The funding in this bill will grow opportunity and lift up  hardworking American families. It will support our early childhood  education programs, our schools, and our high-quality job training. It  will continue to help the hungry put food on the table and keep food  safety inspectors on the job.   It will safeguard our consumers from product safety hazards and  protect our environment from polluters, and it will ensure the most  vulnerable remain healthy and housed with access to lifesaving  resources and support services that they need.   As I have made clear, this bill is not a permanent solution. I look  forward to soon beginning negotiations with my counterparts across the  aisle and across the Capitol to complete full-year government funding  bills that reverse decades of disinvestment.   In addition to the temporary funding extension, this bill responds to  recent emergencies such as hurricanes, storms, wildfires, extreme heat,  and severe drought. Thousands of Americans across the United States are  still suffering from the impact of these many recent disasters. That is  why this bill provides $28.6 billion in desperately needed Federal aid  to all corners of our Nation, including $7.5 billion for Hurricane Ida  so that struggling families, small businesses, and hard-hit communities  can get back on their feet and rebuild their lives and their  livelihoods.   Further, in addition to responding to these recent natural disasters,  this bill addresses the humanitarian needs resulting from the end of 20  years of war in Afghanistan.   Today, we are providing $6.3 billion for urgent humanitarian  assistance in the region, including assistance for vulnerable  populations, including women, girls, and minorities. And it honors our  commitments to our Afghan allies and their families who are now in the  United States.   This bill supports temporary housing, security screenings, and long- term resettlement of these Afghan evacuees, and it paves the way to  ensure that people who risk their lives for us can make a new life here  where they will contribute richly to the fabric of our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I am proud of this bill. The moral test of government  is defined by how we treat those who need our help. Investing in our  citizens and delivering relief where it is needed lays the groundwork  to build back better from the devastation of the pandemic.   The American people are worth the investment. The American people are  capable of building a future that is stronger and more prosperous as  long as they have the tools they need to do it. This bill helps ensure  that they have those tools.   Madam Speaker, I especially thank the hardworking staff on both sides  of the aisle of the Committee on Appropriations for their work on this  bill, including majority staff director, Robin Juliano; deputy, Matt  Washington; the front office staff, and the clerks of the 12  subcommittees; and the communications team.   I thank Ranking Member Granger for her partnership and the work of  the minority staff, including staff director, Anne Marie Chotvacs, and  deputy, Johnnie Kaberle.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This has  been a bipartisan and a bicameral agreement in an effort of which we  are proud.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I really am pleased that we are here this afternoon to  take up the continuing resolution bill.   I would just make one point. It is a bill where the debt limit is not  attached. My colleague on the other side of the aisle brought up the  issue of the debt limit. It is very hard for me really to understand  the reluctance of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, both in  the House and in the Senate, for their willingness to raise the debt  limit. The debt limit is a shared responsibility of both parties. In  the past, Democrats have voted to increase the debt limit under  Republican Presidents, because it certainly should be well-known here-- maybe the general public doesn't understand it--but I do it because  when they incur bills and the bill comes in the mail, they don't have  the luxury of saying, I am opposed to paying my bills, and I will not  do it.   Ordinary people in this country understand that when you incur debt  that you have to pay for it. You don't have the luxury of saying no.  Maybe our colleagues in both the House and the Senate believe that this  is a luxury that they can just say no. But throwing the United States  into default and destroying the full faith and credit of the United  States is not governing. It is not a shared responsibility or shared  principle of values and who we are.   As it turns out, just because the prior administration was in the  hands of my Republican colleagues, 97 percent of that debt was incurred  under the prior administration, Republican administration. So this is  not about paying for--as some of my colleagues would like to say-- spending going forward. It is not the case. It really is not the case.  It is about paying for what we have already incurred.  [[Page H5579]]    And in a bipartisan way, I might add, we did incur debt. We passed  what was necessary, in a bipartisan way, to address the issues of the  greatest economic and healthcare crisis that this Nation has  experienced in a generation with the pandemic.   And we came forward with CARES packages, with a rescue package, and  we said it is a necessity. We have to make sure that we have an airline  industry. We have to make sure that restaurants can stay open. We have  to make sure that we have childcare facilities. We have to make sure  that our hospitals can cope with what is coming in the door. We have to  move to testing, and we have to look at how we are able to get people  in this country vaccinated. And we came together to incur that kind of  a debt. Now it is time for us to recognize that we need to raise that  debt ceiling in order to do that.   I just might add--and I will speak personally about this--when the  prior administration instituted the tax cut, $2 trillion in a tax cut  that went to the richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this  Nation, I was opposed to that. I couldn't support it. I spoke out  against it here on the floor of the House, in my own community.   But yet, when President Trump called for an increase in the debt  limit, I said yes, because I believed it was my duty. It was my  responsibility to make sure that the full faith and credit of the  United States was addressed. So I still do not understand the  reluctance, except maybe for political reasons, but nevertheless, we  are here today.   Madam Speaker, I would also make a comment on the Iron Dome, and as  we pointed out last week, as I did, that we needed to, in fact, always  really be there for our ally in the Middle East, our trusted ally in  Israel, and we moved forward with a freestanding bill and a suspension,  which we passed. And it is my understanding that the Senate is going to  move in the same direction.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Energy and Water Development.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Agriculture.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I said a moment ago that the bill before us delivers  to the survivors of recent disasters.   One of things I am most proud of with this bill--and we did work on a  bipartisan basis in this effort--is understanding that all parts of  this Nation have suffered, whether it is a drought, whether it is a  hurricane, or whether it is a wildfire, whatever it is, we have  experienced these disasters all over our country. That was what was  most important when we looked at how we wanted to address this, which  is why we put in $28.6 billion in disaster relief. All over this  country we are experiencing difficulty, and so this bill addresses  that.   If I take a look at where we are overall, agriculture has been  mentioned. We have got $10 billion to cover the losses from natural  disasters that occurred in 2020 and 2021. We do $275 million for  emergency watershed protection programs to help the communities address  the damages that were made to infrastructure caused by natural  disasters, and that impaired watersheds.   When we talk about our Commerce-Justice-Science we look at--and my  colleague from Florida talked about this--$22 million for  investigations into building collapses. We saw the horror of those  scenes every day and every night in the sadness of families who were  not able to say goodbye to loved ones who were caught in the rubble of  that collapse. But the funding is there. It is the proper role for the  Federal Government to help to reduce the risk of future similar  building failures.   Again, with legal services as it applies to disaster relief; $25  million to cover unanticipated Hurricane Ida-related costs.   In defense, we had damages to our defense industry, our Air Force  facilities, in which case we have put in funding to address that  effort.   Our colleague, Congresswoman Kaptur, spoke about the Energy and Water  Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee; $100 million to study  potential projects in order to reduce risk from future floods and  hurricanes. Army Corps of Engineers, $3 billion to accelerate  construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects to reduce  risk from future floods and hurricanes. The Army Corps of Engineers,  Mississippi River tributaries, to look at flood and storm damage  reduction projects. It is vast. The central Utah project, $10 million  to address damages from wildfires.   Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of  Energy--Small Business Administration disaster loan programs; $1.2  billion to support $6.2 billion in low-interest loans to help  businesses, nonprofit organizations. Homeowners, renters, helping them  to recover from disasters that are beyond their control.   This is the proper role for the Federal Government to be engaged and  involved in these efforts.   We have Federal highways; $2.6 billion to reimburse States and  territories for damage from natural disasters to roads and bridges in  our National Highway System. Community Development Block Grant, which  is a lifeline to our communities; $5 billion, long-term disaster  recovery relief. It is restoration of housing and infrastructure,  economic revitalization, and mitigation measures.   As I said years ago in the aftermath of Katrina, a journalist wrote  that government had a covenant, if you will, with our communities in  the face of natural disaster. And when he wrote about Katrina, he said,  when the levees broke, that covenant was broken.   We do not want to break that covenant again because of a natural  disaster. We want to make sure that we can help to rebuild our  communities and make sure that they have what they need in order to  move forward.   Again, as I mentioned, this helps to deliver for the survivors of the  needs of Afghan refugees and evacuees. This is, as I have often said,  really about our moral responsibility and imperative to be with those  who helped us with sacrificing their lives and the lives of their  families.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time to close.   Madam Speaker, again, as I try to point out over and over again,  besides natural disasters and besides Afghan evacuees, the critical  services that have to do with healthcare, with education, and with  nutrition are carried over in this bill. And this is for people who  live paycheck to paycheck.   Today let us send this bill to the President's desk and keep  government open and serving those in need.   Tomorrow let us continue the fight for funding bills that deliver for  the people and truly build back better prioritizing working families  who have been left behind by decades of disinvestment.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
