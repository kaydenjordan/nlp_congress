 Mr. President, this Congress, I have the great privilege  of cochairing the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control with  the senior Senator from California, Dianne Feinstein. As more families  across the country lose their loved ones to the scourge of opioids, the  work of this caucus could not be more important.   Today, people in our country are more likely to die from an opioid  overdose than a car crash, but that hasn't always been the case. Our  country's opioid abuse epidemic began in the 1990s when pharmaceutical  companies promoted aggressive pain management, assuring the medical  community that patients would not become addicted to these drugs. As a  result, doctors began to prescribe more and more of them. We know what  happened next. In the decades since, we have faced a steady increase in  opioid abuse and have undertaken aggressive efforts to address this  epidemic.   There has been a concerted effort across the country to attack  overprescribing of opioids in the hope of preventing more people from  becoming addicted. But that alone cannot be our sole focus. Of the more  than 70,000 overdose deaths in America in 2017, more than half were the  result of heroin and synthetic opioids, not prescription drugs.   The more we step up our efforts to limit prescription opioid  diversion, the higher the demand for other illicit drugs, many of which  are funneled into our communities by criminal organizations operating  across international borders. These groups run sophisticated drug  trafficking operations, moving vast amounts of cocaine,  methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and other illegal drugs through  Central America and Mexico and into the United States. With Customs and  Border Protection personnel spread thin because of the current  humanitarian and security crisis at the border, these criminal  organizations have no problem exploiting the security gaps.    I can say confidently that without coordinated government response,  the problem is going to get worse and worse, which means more and more  Americans will die as a result of drug overdoses.   In the past, this caucus has examined everything from prescription  drug abuse, to the expansion of fentanyl, to trafficking across our  southern border. As these and other hearings have illustrated, there is  no single contributor to this crisis and no silver bullet.   The opioid epidemic is called a crisis for a reason: It is pervasive  and all-encompassing. We can't look at the problem through a soda  straw, focusing only on how the drugs get here or how to more  effectively treat those who are already addicted. We need to take a  more holistic approach that focuses on reducing supply by reducing  demand and eliminating the myriad of factors that fueled this fire.   The International Narcotics Control Caucus will hold a hearing this  afternoon to examine how the U.S. Government can expand our  international efforts against drug abuse and narcotics trafficking and  take the first step toward developing a comprehensive strategy.   Our first witness will be the Secretary of State, Secretary Pompeo,  whose Department works across the U.S. Government and with our partners  around the world to combat this transnational crime. We look forward to  hearing from him, as well as other experts on the second panel about  the growing epidemic and what Congress must do, working in a bipartisan  effort, to address it.   As I said earlier, our whole-of-government strategy must focus on  supply and demand. Last Congress, we passed landmark legislation to  combat the opioid crisis, which President Trump called ``the single  largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of the country.''  Through the collaboration of 70 bipartisan proposals in the Senate,  this law aims to not only stem the tide of drugs coming across the  border but to offer some support and hope to those suffering from drug  addiction. It was a major bipartisan accomplishment and one that I hope  we can continue to build on in this Congress because a great deal of  work remains to be done.   Beyond supply and demand, we need to take aim at the criminal  organizations that traffic drugs and engage in a whole host of criminal  activity. As others have pointed out, these criminal organizations are  commodity-agnostic--they will engage in human trafficking, migrant  smuggling, money laundering, counterfeit goods, public corruption, and  the list goes on and on. What they are really about is making money.  They don't care anything for the migrants or the people affected by  their crimes. The real kicker here is that while these criminal  organizations are  [[Page S3306]]  perpetuating the opioid epidemic, fueling a cycle of violence, and  abusing innocent civilians, they are growing richer and richer by the  minute.   Targeting these organizations means more than stopping the flow of  drugs into our country; it means ending a cycle of crime and violence  and working together with Mexico and Central American countries to help  them escape the savage grip of these criminal organizations.   Additionally, we need to strengthen security cooperation with our  international partners so that they are able to more effectively fight  side by side with us. Mexico and Central and South American nations  often lack the ability to adequately counter the trafficking occurring  within their borders, and corruption serves as a major roadblock in  efforts to stop criminal activity.   There are a number of programs in place already--many of which began  through the Merida Initiative--which have yielded positive results, but  we need to look at all of these and make sure we understand what works  and what does not work so we can justify the expenditure of U.S.  taxpayer dollars in this fight. By strengthening and expanding these  operations, we can help our southern neighbors fight drugs, crime, and  corruption within their own borders, which would more effectively  reduce the flow of drugs and other illicit goods moving across our  southern border.   Finally, if we want any of these efforts to be sustainable, we can't  just focus on law and order; we must look at ways to invest in economic  development to help these countries build stronger economies. These are  beautiful, vibrant countries that are also victims of endemic crime in  the region. Helping them promote economic security will carry immense  benefits for the entire region, and it is something we need to discuss  more in the coming months.   Senator Feinstein and I have worked together in the past on  legislation to address the drug epidemic, such as the Substance Abuse  Prevention Act, which is now the law of the land. This Congress, we  will continue our important work together on the International  Narcotics Control Caucus. I look forward to hearing from our  distinguished witnesses this afternoon and engaging in a larger  discussion--hopefully a nationwide discussion--about how we can reverse  the devastation caused by the opioid crisis and drug overdoses in  America.
