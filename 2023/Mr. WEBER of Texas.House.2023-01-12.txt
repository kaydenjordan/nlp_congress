 Mr. Speaker, I have paid attention to the SPR  since 2008 when I got elected to the Texas House. As you know, 60  percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is housed in my district.   I am pleased to announce that the Independent Petroleum Association  of America endorses this legislation put forth by House Republicans  aimed at reining in the administration's misuse of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, as we call it.   The SPR was not intended to be used as a political tool to bring down  gasoline prices in an election year. Next thing you know, the President  will be giving away free college tuition. Oh, he did that, too. This is  only a Band-Aid on the overarching situation.   The long-term solution is to enhance, rather than hinder, America's  leadership in natural gas and oil production. Our true domestic natural  gas and oil reserves, from production to pipelines and through the  supply chain, are ready to work, and Republicans' legislation puts them  and our American allies at the forefront.
