 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a group of courageous  Federal employees: Matt Nordquist; Janet Hartman, now Schmautz; Jake  Gibson; Carren Crossley; Virginia Mueller, now Partridge; Jordan  Haverly; Joy Henrichs; Perry Ford Stamp; and Molly Mackenzie Harris.   There is no more difficult job in Washington than that of a  congressional scheduler. My thanks and apologies go to those who served  in my office these past 24 years.   For me, being away from home was the worst part of the job. Who  booked the flight and told me I had to get back to D.C.? The scheduler  did. Who would meet me in the office at 7:30 a.m. to get me to a  breakfast meeting at 8 a.m.? Who would hang around to pick me up at 9  a.m., just to race me to the Hill for a 9 a.m. meeting? The scheduler  did. Who received an irate call from me wondering why no one was at the  meeting in HC-5, only to be told that if I had looked at my schedule, I  would have seen that the meeting location had changed to the Capitol  Hill Club? The scheduler did.   Who took the frustrating call asking how I can be in a meeting in the  Capitol from 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., and then in my office in the  Rayburn Building for an 11 a.m. meeting? The scheduler did. Who took  the blame when I finally cried out that I needed a bathroom break after  consecutive 30-minute meetings? The scheduler did. Who picked me up  after votes at 6:30 p.m. to hit a reception at 6:45 p.m., another  [[Page H4646]]  one at 7 p.m., and then dinner at another location at 7:30 p.m.? The  scheduler did.   Who scheduled the flight to get me home, and then had to sweat as to  whether I could make the early flight or not? Who received my  continuous calls asking them if I thought I could make it? The  scheduler did. Who waited in the car for that final vote just to see me  run down the stairs and tell them, let's go, just to get caught in  traffic in the plaza, traffic on Independence Avenue, and traffic on  Interstate 395? The scheduler did.   Who had to put up with the worst backseat driver in Washington, D.C.?  The scheduler did. My schedulers took the brunt of my frustration as we  tried to fit 36 hours of work into a 24-hour day. They took the barbs  of criticism when I missed my family.   If there was ever a single group that I need to apologize to, it is  them. Having said this, this group of workers professionally conducted  their job with poise, confidence, efficiency, and compassion. I can say  without hesitation that because of me, the toughest job in my office is  that of the scheduler. Matt, Janet, Jake Carren, Virginia, Jordan, Joy,  Perry, and Molly, I thank you.                            ____________________
