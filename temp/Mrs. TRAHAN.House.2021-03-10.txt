 Mr. Speaker, there is a rampaging public health  emergency that has been with us for far too long. And there have been  countless chilling examples of what happens when we fail to act, or  only take half measures, anodyne placebos. Each time, more lives are  lost.   Moreover, we have seen a particular community unjustly suffer scorn  for this emergency. They have been scapegoated rather than recognized  as the fellow victims of this crisis. But there is no question that the  harms of this crisis haven't fallen evenly, and the disparate harm  offers all the more reason for actual solutions, not mere talk. By now,  my colleagues know that I am not talking about COVID. I am referring to  gun violence.   Today, the most commonsense, broadly popular, and impactful thing  that we can do is pass H.R. 8, and bolster our pitifully weak  background check system in the United States. Keeping deadly weapons  out of the hands of those fueled by hate is as common sense as it gets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 8.
