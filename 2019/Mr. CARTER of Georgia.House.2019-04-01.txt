 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Dick Williams, who retired last month from Fox 5's ``The Georgia Gang''  in Atlanta.   The brother of Representative Roger Williams of Texas, Mr. Dick  Williams is truly one of the stalwarts of news in the State of Georgia.  He has worked for 53 total years across various types of journalism,  including TV, radio, and print. For the last 25 years, he has been the  moderator of ``The Georgia Gang,'' Georgia's longest running public  affairs broadcast.   Mr. Williams and ``The Georgia Gang'' covered seemingly every topic  imaginable, ranging from local politics, the 1996 Summer Olympics in  Atlanta, scandals at city hall, missing children, and so much more.   The final taping of ``The Georgia Gang'' was March 5, but Mr.  Williams will always be remembered as one of the most trusted figures  in Georgia journalism.   Thank you, Mr. Williams, for your work in keeping our State informed.                            ____________________
