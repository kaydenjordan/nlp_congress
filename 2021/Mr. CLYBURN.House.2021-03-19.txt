 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, last March, as the tragic failure of the  Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic was  becoming very apparent, the House Democratic Caucus held a conference  call to discuss the crisis. Recalling the lessons of history, like the  aftermath of World War I, the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, and  World War II, that it is usually the least of these among us that are  the hardest hit during the crises and the last to recover after these  crises are over, if they are able to recover at all; I expressed at  that time to the Caucus that the legislation before us offered a  tremendous opportunity to restructure things in our vision. I was  referring then, as I often do, to the vision expressed in our Pledge of  Allegiance to our Nation's flag of liberty and justice for all.                                time  1315    Shortly after the media reported these comments, Senator McConnell,  the majority leader of the Senate, derided them on the Senate floor.  Referring to me by position, he declared: ``This is not a political  opportunity. It is a national emergency.''   I wholeheartedly agree with the now-minority leader of the Senate  that the coronavirus pandemic was and remains a national emergency. But  because the previous administration and Senate Republicans failed to  address it with appropriate urgency and a vision of liberty and justice  for all, the American people, through the political process last  November, entrusted Democrats with an opportunity to build back with a  better and more equitable vision for the future of our great country.   The American Rescue Plan has begun that process, and it is enjoying  widespread, bipartisan support across the entire spectrum of the  country. It did not get a single Republican vote in the House or the  Senate. Because of the use of the budget process commonly called  reconciliation, Republicans were not able to block by filibuster the  American Rescue Plan, and that is proving to be a good thing.  [[Page H1606]]    But the Senate minority leader and several of his colleagues seem to  be hellbent on using archaic Senate procedural rules to allow the  minority in the Senate to block any legislation designed to protect the  voting and civil rights of our country's minority citizens as we  continue our pursuit toward the fulfillment of liberty and justice for  all.   We have been here before. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Senate  filibuster was used to kill civil rights legislation and protect Jim  Crow laws. Today, Senate Republican leaders are employing the same  tactics to obstruct voting rights and civil rights legislation. Their  efforts are designed to gain power for their party by suppressing  political participation by minorities.   The minority leader has threatened that if Senate Democrats modify  the filibuster rules to do to him as he did to President Obama, he will  resort to scorched-earth tactics. This threat of scorched-earth tactics  by the Senate minority leader in defiance of American democracy is  reminiscent of ``Mississippi Burning,'' which highlighted the lynching  of three civil rights workers who were simply registering Black voters  in Mississippi in June 1964. They were murdered by the KKK, with the  cooperation of law enforcement officials, to keep them from assisting  minority citizens who simply wanted to vote. It was 44 days before  their bodies were located and four decades before anyone faced legal  consequences for their deaths.   Today, Republicans are using the big lie about the 2020 elections as  a pretext to advance a litany of minority voter suppression laws. They  know that our vision of liberty and justice for all enjoys majority  support among voters, so they seek to suppress enough votes so that  their oppressive policies and bankrupt ideas can prevail. The minority  leader wants to allow a minority of his minority to block measures that  would prevent a return to bygone days.   To confront this threat, the Senate must eliminate the 60-vote  threshold to end a filibuster on voting rights and civil rights  legislation. Just as Mississippi Burning was met with the Civil Rights  Act and Voting Rights Act, the threat of scorched earth must be met  with the For the People Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.   I didn't march in the streets and spend nights in jail as a young man  to find myself fighting the same battles generations later, but it  appears the minority leader and his Republican colleagues are preparing  to retread old ground, and I am prepared to stand my ground.   To the minority leader and his colleagues, I say: This is not a  political opportunity. This is a national emergency.   Since this country's inception, equal rights for people of color have  been restricted by those in power who seek to hold on to power by using  their power to deny the greatness of this country to those who do not  look like them.   Extending debate on legislative issues is one thing, but when it  comes to rights rooted in the Constitution, the filibuster has no  place.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
