 Madam Speaker, as we mourn the victims of another  senseless mass shooting in America, I rise to recognize two police  officers in my district: Jeffrey Johnson and Michael Pollack of the  Westfield Police Department, who prevented a potential mass shooting in  my district in 2019.   On June 13 of that year, Officers Johnson and Pollack responded to a  call at Tamaques Elementary School in Westfield, where they were met  with a man armed with a .45-caliber gun, hollow-point bullets, and 130  rounds of ammunition; an arsenal much of which is not legal in New  Jersey, but which he had obtained legally in another State.   The officers disarmed and arrested the man, potentially saving the  lives of teachers, staff, and kids. The officers recently received the  Hero Award from our Union County Prosecutor's Office, and I continue to  honor their heroism here on the House floor today.   This incident is another reminder that while we have strong gun laws  in New Jersey and one of the lowest rates of gun violence fatalities in  the country, as a result, many of our neighboring States do not. As  long as our gun laws are inconsistent across State lines, those who  wish to commit mass murder will find the means to do so.                            ____________________
