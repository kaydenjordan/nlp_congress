 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 830 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 830         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5192) to       authorize the Commissioner of Social Security to provide       confirmation of fraud protection data to certain permitted       entities, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Ways and Means now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-68 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 830 provides for  consideration of H.R. 5192, the Protecting Children From Identity Theft  Act. The resolution calls for a closed rule, as no amendments to the  bill were submitted.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation is designed to reduce  identity fraud by allowing financial institutions to verify the  accuracy of a name, Social Security number, and date of birth before  passing that information to credit bureaus.   This legislation is designed to target something known as synthetic  identity fraud. This begins when a criminal combines a real Social  Security number with fictitious information, such as a name and date of  birth, to apply for credit with a financial institution that passes  information to credit bureaus for a credit check.   Credit bureaus create a record based on the fraudulent credentials.  Over time, this creates a synthetic identity based on the valid Social  Security number but a false name.   Currently, children and other vulnerable individuals are more likely  to be victims of synthetic identity theft because they do not drive,  work, or establish credit. This makes it easier for an identity thief  to misuse the Social Security number of a child without being detected.   Reports indicate that over 1 million children have their identity  stolen each year. Studies show that children are 50 times more likely  than adults to be a victim of identity theft.   This is a real and serious issue that is only becoming more and more  common. According to TransUnion, a record $355 million in outstanding  credit card balances was owed by people who it suspects didn't exist in  2017. That is up more than eightfold from 2012.   This type of fraud can saddle children with unintended debt and a  flawed  [[Page H3354]]  credit history sometimes before they can even walk or drive a car.   That is why this bipartisan legislation is so important. The bill  would require the Social Security Administration to create a  verification system to match the name, Social Security number, and date  of birth submitted by permitted entities against their official  records.   This would allow financial institutions to verify the accuracy of the  customer's personal information in order to guard against synthetic  identity fraud.   Importantly, the bill requires that users of the verification system  pay the full cost to limit any costs to taxpayers. Also, the bill  ensures that the provisions do not distract the Social Security  Administration from their core duties and responsibilities.   It is also important to note that the bill includes protections to  ensure the verification system is secure and not subject to abuse or  misuse. The consumer must also consent before their information could  be subject to an inquiry.   This is bipartisan, commonsense legislation that solves a real-world  problem, but I bet it will never get the attention that it deserves.  This bill went through regular order. It passed out of the Ways and  Means Committee on a 38-0 vote, and I hope it receives a similar vote  here on the House floor.   Despite what some in the national news media would have you to  believe, this type of bipartisan legislation actually happens all the  time here in the House. The vast majority of bills we pass receive  bipartisan support, and while that may not make for the best  television, it is the reality of the work we do on a daily basis.   So I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the Protecting  Children From Identity Theft Act, and let's work to solve a problem  impacting Americans each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 830 and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from Florida.  I do want to note the presence on the floor of our newest member of the  Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres). We  welcome her to the committee.   I do think there are bipartisan things that we can do. The gentleman  said one that I think is very important; that is, infrastructure. He  and I have had this discussion before. The President wants us to do an  infrastructure bill, and I think all of us want to do an infrastructure  bill. I think there is some time here we need to take to make sure that  we do get a bipartisan bill in that regard. I don't think it will pass  without a bipartisan agreement, so I hope we do that.   On the gun issue, as I think the gentleman knows, the bump stock rule  was actually something put in place by ATF under the Obama  administration, and President Trump has asked the ATF essentially to  rescind it, and they are in the process of doing that. So I hope  they'll do that.   We did pass, and this body is part of our appropriations bill for  this fiscal year that has gone to the President and been signed, the  Fix NICS bill. So there are gun legislation things, addressing these  issues, that are moving forward.   He also brought up the very important issue of immigration. The  President, I think, has made some very bold moves in that regard to try  to get a discussion going so that we can have some bipartisanship here.  It is clear that that is not going to pass both the House and the  Senate without that. I hope that those negotiations and those  discussions can somehow resume because they clearly hit a very bad  spot. The President has shown his good faith. I hope the rest of us can  reach back and find a way to address this issue.    But this issue is not just the Dreamers. It is also border security.  If we are not willing to talk about that and chain migration and the  others, we are not really talking about immigration reform; we are  talking about one piece of it.   With regard to the AUMF, Authorization for Use of Military Force, I  am a strong advocate, as I think the gentleman knows, for a new AUMF.  Actually, I am a cosponsor for one of the bills that would provide for  that. I have said, going back several years, that I think we have been  operating in certain parts of the world without adequate authorization.  And whether it is constitutionally required or not, I think it is the  right thing to do.   However, I do not think the President had to have prior congressional  authorization before the strike that was launched Friday night against  Syria in conjunction with France and Great Britain. He clearly has that  authority under Article II of the Constitution, to protect our  servicemen and -women who are in Syria right now. So I applaud what the  President did. I applaud the way he did it. But I am clear in my  thinking that he did not need prior authorization from Congress to go  there.   Now, I hope that we will get a strategy in general for Syria that  fits into our overall strategy to the Middle East. We have been  stumbling around in Syria for several years now. President Obama put  out the so-called red line, and then the Syrians walked across it and  used chemical weapons against their people. And we did nothing. All  that did was encourage further bad behavior like what we saw in this  horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians in Syria.   At least President Trump is doing something. And I hope that that  something that he has done will send a loud message, not just to the  Assad regime in Syria but also to Russia and to Iran, that the  civilized world is not going to tolerate that sort of activity. And we  don't care who does it; we are going to take appropriate action. The  President had the authorization to do it, and I am glad that he did it.   We are not done legislating this year. I think the gentleman suggests  that we are, but we have got some big bills coming before us. This week  we will take up a major IRS reform bill. I am looking forward to that,  this being tax day for so many of us. A good tax day for the vast  majority of the people in America, by the way.   We will be taking up a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation  Administration. We will be taking up another farm bill. We will be  taking up the National Defense Authorization Act that comes out of the  Committee on Armed Services that I am in.   We have a host of legislation that we will be doing, and I think  doing successfully, between now and when we have these midterm  elections in November. So we are not done legislating by any means.   I look forward to continuing to debate these issues, but today we are  talking about a very important bill that did come through committee in  a bipartisan fashion and, I believe, is going to get broad bipartisan  support here in this body, once more showing the American people that  we can get the people's work done in the right way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my good friend from Florida.  I certainly hope that there can be some further discussions and we can  have something that comes forth on this floor that is truly bipartisan  on the issue of immigration reform, including border security.   I know that there are some people, not including my friend from  Florida, who would like to pass legislation that would repeal the  Second Amendment. I hope that that legislation doesn't come to the  floor because I do not think it would meet with the approval of the  vast majority of the people of America.   I do strongly believe at some point we should be debating on this  floor a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. But I will say  again, the President did not need that authorization for what he did on  Friday night, not because he was presuming to act under an old  authorization, but because he had the inherent power to do that under  Article II of the Constitution. If he is acting under that authority,  he doesn't need extra authorization from us.   This bill, however, that we are talking about today is something we  can all agree on, is something that is important for protecting young  children and, yes, for protecting people who have just become immigrant  citizens of this country. So I applaud the fact that we have come  forward with this legislation. It shows that we are working together. I  look forward to the debate on the floor of this House.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  830 and the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid upon the table.                            ____________________
