 Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maine for  the recognition. I appreciate it very, very much.   I will be very brief. I ask for up to 5 minutes, which I will use  less than that.   Today is a historic day. Today, the Senate has agreed to move one  step forward to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson PACT Act of  2022. I want to thank Ranking Member Moran and Senators Boozman and  Heinrich for working with me to help deliver this bipartisan solution.  It is the most comprehensive toxic exposure package for our veterans  that Congress has ever delivered in this country's history. Frankly, it  is one that has been years in the making. Actually, it has been decades  in the making.   Named after a veteran who died from exposure to a toxic burn pit,  this bill will address decades of inaction and failure by the U.S.  Government to do the right thing by delivering toxic-exposed veterans  their long-overdue healthcare and benefits.   This bill spans generations of veterans. It expands the presumption  of Agent Orange exposure for those who served in Vietnam. Yes, that is  right. That is what I said. We still haven't done right by the Vietnam- era veterans, but this bill makes it right. It adds new service- connected conditions to Agent Orange, including hypertension.   This bill also expands healthcare for more than 3\1/2\ million post- 9/11 combat veterans and service-connects two dozen conditions caused  by burn pit exposure, from cancers to lung disease.   To pull this off, we have to give the VA the resources it needs to  better serve vets. This bill does that by funding more employees to  process claims, upgrading claims processing technology, authorizing  innovative ways to hire and retain VA healthcare staff, and investing  in VA facilities across the country.   Passing this bill in Congress and getting it to the President's desk  is the only way to keep our end of the bargain to our All-Volunteer  military. This cannot be overstated: Freedom is not free. There is a  price to pay. We send men and women in uniform off to fight wars on our  behalf. You don't have to be a veteran exposed to Agent Orange and burn  pits to understand that price.   The fact is that hundreds of thousands of veterans in my State and  across this country are already paying for it, and they can no longer  wait. So now is the time, folks. We are going to get back from Memorial  Day. We are all going to be at Memorial Day events, and we are going to  be celebrating the folks who gave the ultimate sacrifice. When we come  back, we need to vote and celebrate the folks who have survived but yet  have the impacts of toxic exposure.   I would encourage your support for this bill when we get back the  week of June 6.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to share a few words  today to honor an outstanding Montana educator who is retiring at the  end of this school year.   Kirk Miller has dedicated his career to bettering the lives of the  next generation of Montanans. Over the years, Kirk served as a teacher,  a principal, and a superintendent before being appointed to the Montana  Board of Public Education where he later served as chair. I first got  to know Kirk Miller when I was a State senator, and he was the  superintendent of schools in Havre, MT. I found him to be somebody who  was dedicated above all to the kids' education, somebody who knew the  value of public education and always did his best to make sure our kids  got an education that would allow them to compete in the worldwide  economy. As Bozeman schools superintendent, Kirk played a key role in  improving infrastructure for students for years to come. He championed  numerous successful initiatives that supported that strengthened public  education in the region and serve as a template for other communities  to follow.   At the end of this year, Kirk will be retiring from his most recent  position as executive director of the School Administrators of Montana,  where he has worked tirelessly to support administrators and educators  across the State. Those who have been lucky enough to work with Kirk  recognize that he has a knack for connecting with people, even those  who have different views than his own. And his passion for public  education shines through in everything he does.   Under Kirk's leadership, the School Administrators of Montana  established the Leaders Professional Learning Program, or SAM LPLP, a  mentorship program that brings administrators from across the State  together to receive student-focused, solution-based professional  development training. The SAM LPLP has served more than 500  administrators to date. As a former public school teacher I commend  Kirk for his steadfast commitment to improving our school system from  the top down.   In addition to his work, Kirk has a lot to be proud of--in  particular, the wonderful family he has built with his wife of 42  years, Nan.   A lifelong educator and a dear friend to many, Kirk has shown through  his  [[Page S2751]]  kindness and work ethic that he is truly dedicated to bettering the  lives of the next generation of Montanans.   Thank you for your service, Kirk; our Montana schools are better  because of you.                            ____________________
