 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Elizabeth Bruner of Blairsville, Pennsylvania. Elizabeth was recently  honored by the National 4-H Shooting Sports Teen Ambassador program.   4-H has a storied past across the country--in rural America in  particular--and has created youth programs that have fostered  agricultural innovation.   Some of Elizabeth's favorite 4-H activities include breeding and  market livestock, wildlife, forestry, and her favorite: shooting  sports.   Elizabeth was selected as one of two individuals by a committee of 4- H educators from across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to be a teen  ambassador for Pennsylvania to promote 4-H and 4-H shooting sports.  Ambassadors receive training that they can take back to their  communities to advocate for 4-H at the county, regional, and State  level.   During her experience as an ambassador, Elizabeth will further her  skills in public presentation, citizenship, community service, as well  as many other areas.   I am certain Elizabeth will represent this organization and promote  its purpose well.                            ____________________
