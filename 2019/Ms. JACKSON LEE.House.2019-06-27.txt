 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California for her leadership.   There is not a time that I go home that they don't ask me how we will  secure our elections. I am proudly supporting the Securing America's  Federal Elections Act, the SAFE Act, and I am asking why our colleagues  are fighting against Americans having the right to vote.   The SAFE Act authorizes a $600 million Election Assistance Commission  grant program. It provides States with $175 million in biannual  sustainment funding to help maintain election infrastructure.   Voting machines are required to be manufactured in the United States.  States are mandated to conduct risk-limiting audits.   Another very important feature of the SAFE Act is that it requires  accountability for election technology vendors and sets cybersecurity  standards.   As a member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, recognizing what  happened in 2016, I want to make sure that the Russian adversaries, the  Russian military, are not our poll watchers, are not our secretaries of  states, are not the vendors for our machines.   I want to make sure for minorities, every vote counts, and for every  American, every vote counts.   I want to end voter suppression. The way we do this is to have safe  elections.   I am very proud of this legislation, and I am proud of this Speaker,  proud of the leadership, to say that we are going to be first on the  line to tell America we believe in safe, equal, and fair elections.   I ask my friends to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2722, the  ``Securing America's Federal Elections Act'' or SAFE Act.   I strongly support this legislation because the linchpin of  representative democracy is public confidence in the political system,  regime, and community.   That confidence in turn rests upon the extent to which the public has  faith that the system employed to select its leaders accurately  reflects its preferences.   At bottom, this means that all citizens casting a vote have a  fundamental right and reasonable expectation that their votes count and  are counted.   This concern is particularly salient because of the unprecedented  interference by a hostile foreign power to secure victory for its  preferred candidate in the 2016 presidential election and the  determination of that hostile power to repeat its success in future  American elections.   That is why it is necessary to pass H.R. 2722, the SAFE Act, so  comprehensive election security reform measures can be implemented.   Specifically, the SAFE Act authorizes a $600 million Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) grant program to assist in securing  election infrastructure and a $5 million grant program to study and  report on accessible paper ballot voting systems.   The bill provides grants to State and local election officials to  replace aging voting machines with voter-verified paper ballot voting  systems and grants to support hiring IT staff, cybersecurity training,  security and risk vulnerability assessments, and other activities to  secure election infrastructure.   The bill also provides states with $175 million in biannual  sustainment funding to help maintain election infrastructure and, to  ensure States can maintain security gains, provides each State with no  less than $1 per voter who participated in the most recent election to  maintain election security.   Under the legislation, voting machines are required to be  manufactured in the United States and states are mandated to conduct  risk-limiting audits, a critical tool to ensuring the integrity of  elections.   These audits, which involve hand counting a certain number of ballots  and using statistical methods to determine the accuracy of the original  vote tally, are effective at detecting any incorrect election outcomes,  whether caused by a cyberattack or something more mundane like a  programming error.   The SAFE Act also directs the National Science Foundation to  administer a $5 million grant program to study and report on accessible  paper ballot verification mechanisms, including for individuals with  disabilities, voters with difficulties in literacy, and voters whose  primary language is not English.   Madam Speaker, another salutary feature of the SAFE Act is that it  requires accountability for election technology vendors and sets  cybersecurity standards and prohibits wireless and internet  connectivity on systems that count ballots or upon which voters mark  their ballots or systems are configured.   The SAFE Act also limits state expenditures on goods and services  with grant monies provided under this Act to purchases from ``qualified  election infrastructure vendors.''   The EAC, in coordination with DHS, establishes the criteria for  achieving the status of ``qualified election infrastructure vendor,''  which includes maintaining IT infrastructure in a manner consistent  with the best practices provided by the EAC and agreeing to report any  known or suspected security incidents involving election  infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, there is compelling reason for the Congress to pass  the SAFE Act by overwhelming margins in the House and Senate because to  date the President and his Administration has shown little interest or  inclination in taking effective action to deter and prevent  interference by foreign powers in American elections.   Let us remember that the Intelligence Community Assessment (``ICA'')  of January 2017 assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered  an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election  in which Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S.  democratic process, denigrate Democratic presidential candidate and  implacable foe of Vladimir Putin, former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, facilitate the election of Vladimir Putin's preferred  candidate, Donald J. Trump.   Russia's interference in the election processes of democratic  countries is not new but a continuation of the ``Translator Project,''  an ongoing information warfare effort launched by Vladimir Putin in  2014 to use social media to manipulate public opinion and voters in  western democracies.   Instead of supporting the unanimous assessment of the U.S.  Intelligence Community, the President attacked and sought to discredit  and undermine the agencies and officials responsible for detecting and  assessing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as  well as those responsible for investigating and bringing to justice the  conspirators who committed crimes against the United States our law  enforcement.   And to add shame to insult and injury, at a meeting in Helsinki,  Finland, rather than embracing the conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence  Community, the President of the United States sided with Russian  President Vladimir Putin in heaping scorn on the IC's assessment  regarding Russian interference and called the U.S. Justice Department  investigation into Russia's interference led by Special Counsel Robert  Mueller ``the greatest political witch hunt in history.''   As the Mueller Report concluded, ``The Russian government interfered  in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.''   In his only public remarks made since he was appointed Special  Counsel, Robert Mueller reiterated at his farewell press conference  held at the Department of Justice on May 29, 2017, the ``central  allegation of our indictments--that there were multiple, systematic  efforts to interfere in our election'' and that ``allegation deserves  the attention of every American.''  [[Page H5219]]    Madam Speaker, American elections are to be decided by American  voters free from foreign interference or sabotage, and that is why I  support and urge all my colleague to vote to pass H.R. 2722, the  ``Securing America's Federal Elections Act'' or SAFE Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma, but I am an optimist.   More importantly, I stand here in the name of Mr. Ramirez and his  little, baby girl who were found on the shores of the Rio Grande. The  question is: How did they wind up there? They wound up there because of  this administration's policies that rejected them as they stood on the  Brownsville-Matamoros International Bridge.   There was no reason to say the bridge was closed. They had a legal  right to claim asylum, fleeing from the horrible violence of El  Salvador. Yet, they could not stand there, and so this is their end.   I am supporting this bill because I believe we should not settle for  just anything. This bill particularly provides for the requirements  that have additional resources for these children so that they don't  die, so that they do have toothpaste, that they are clean, that they  are living in clean places. It acknowledges that children cannot be  held like cattle in one place beyond 90 days, that you must find their  family members, and, yes, there are family members.   This is a process that has been the law of the land and the  international law for decades. It is an asylum that can be sought so  the Nation can address it. It takes no one's place. It does nothing to  hurt this Nation.   I support the underlying legislation because, in the name of Mr.  Ramirez and his child, we must do what is right.    Madam Speaker, this was a tough week for those of us  who, as mothers, have a deep pain for the conditions of our children.   It was a difficult week because Mr. Ramirez and his toddler died  trying to seek an opportunity in the United States.   It was a difficult week because this administration rejected Mr.  Ramirez from the Matamoros bridge and forced him to cross the Rio  Grande.   Today, I voted ``no'' for the $4.5 billion, moneys that I know are  needed and that passed and were provided for those in need. If my vote  was needed to pass the bill, I would have done so.   But I am saddened by the fact that we passed a bill that does not  have the strengthened protocols for treating the difficulties of  children and their health needs:   It does not have the provisions dealing with the quality of the  treatment of the children, the sanitation and safety;   It does not have the idea that children can only remain in a place  for 90 days;   It does not have the ability to have a program that talks about or  puts in place how these children are treated as relates to their  healthcare and other matters.   So, I will continue to fight because these children's lives are  important at the border and around the Nation, and we will get to a  point where we can pass legislation that will treat these children who  are suffering and fleeing in the right way.                            ____________________
