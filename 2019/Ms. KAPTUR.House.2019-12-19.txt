 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   I rise in opposition to NAFTA 2, which has been rebranded the USMCA.   First of all, it is being rushed through at the last moments of this  session without the majority of Members even able to read it or  participate in hearings on it.   Number two, it will not stem the continental outsourcing of U.S.  jobs, and, sadly, and most importantly, it will not achieve the real  enforcement by the Governments of Mexico or the United States.   For over 10 years, I have been trying to get the Government of Mexico  to arrest and prosecute the brutal murderers of Santiago Cruz, a  Mexican national fighting against the huge continental labor  trafficking of his countrymen. He was educating his fellow farmworkers  that they did not have to pay a bounty of $8,000 to come to this  country to work in our fields as they became indentured workers.   Despite my over 10 years of efforts to bring justice to his brutal  killers, Mexico behaves as if this crime never occurred. Why should I  believe Mexico will enforce anything?   Furthermore, about a month ago, we saw the President of Mexico not  able to keep control of his own streets, and he released the son of El  Chapo, the drug lord. What makes you think this administration or the  one in Mexico will do anything to enforce the laws that USMCA purports  to support?   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''
