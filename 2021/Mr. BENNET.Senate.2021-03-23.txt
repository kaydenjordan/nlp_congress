 Mr. President, on Monday, March 15, due to a snowstorm in  Denver, I was unable to travel to Washington in time for the vote to  confirm Deb Haaland to serve as Secretary of Interior. Had I been  present, I would have voted to confirm her to serve in this important  position.                            ____________________
