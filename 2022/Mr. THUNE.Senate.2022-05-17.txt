 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin, I want to mention the  severe storms that hit eastern South Dakota last Thursday.   I visited Castlewood on Saturday, which is among the communities that  was hardest hit, to get a look at the damage, and it is extensive.  Homes and a school have been damaged, destroyed. Many of our farmers  were hit hard and lost critical equipment and buildings.   I just want our thoughts and prayers to go out to those South  Dakotans who were affected and, in particular, the family and friends  of the two women who were killed in the storm.   My office will be doing everything possible to help those affected  get the assistance that they need to recover.                             National Police Week    Madam President, this week is National Police Week--a time set aside  to honor the service of our Nation's law enforcement officers and pay  tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  duty.   While there are a number of tough jobs out there, being a law  enforcement officer is in a different league. I can think of only one  other career path where willingness to lay down your life for your  fellow citizens is part of the job description.   Law enforcement officers don't know what they will face when they get  up every day. They don't know what they face when they respond to a  call, but they go out anyway. We call, and they come, day or night, no  matter the danger.   In addition to the physical dangers that they face, police officers  also bear a heavy mental burden. Most of us don't have to confront evil  in our lives every day, thanks in large part to the sacrifices of our  Nation's law enforcement officers. But police officers have to get up  close and personal with evil on a daily basis. They get a front-row  seat when it comes to seeing fallen humanity, and they pay a price.   Being a police officer has always been a tough job, but over the past  couple of years, it has gotten even harder. The ``defund the police''  movement and the anti-law enforcement sentiment have taken a tremendous  toll on police departments and police officers.   Morale has sunk, which has resulted in increased resignations and  retirements. Police departments are understaffed, which has stretched  officers to the limit and limited their ability to respond to crimes.  And, unsurprisingly, police departments are struggling to recruit  officers.   Being a police officer is a difficult enough job as it is. It is not  surprising that people would be reluctant to go into this field,  knowing that the reward for their sacrifice will be constant criticism  and vilification.   ``Defund the police'' rhetoric has also put officers in increased  danger. I find it hard to believe that the 59-percent increase in  murders of police officers in 2021 had nothing to do with the fanning  of anti-police sentiment.   And ``defund the police'' rhetoric and soft-on-crime policies  associated with it are taking a toll on public safety and contributing  to the surge in violent crime that we have been seeing.   The ``defund the police'' movement is a movement that should have  never gotten off the ground. It is based on a lie that America's law  enforcement officers are evil and racist.   It is also based on the absurd premise that society can exist without  the police or that police officers can be replaced by social workers  and psychologists.   There may well be individuals who fall into a life of crime as a  result of tough circumstances, but there are also a lot of criminals  who choose evil deliberately, not because of a difficult past but  simply for their own personal gain, whether that looks like money or  power or revenge or violence.   And as long as we live in a world where people deliberately choose  evil, we are going to need men and women who are willing to step up and  confront that evil and do their best to ensure that the perpetrators  face justice.   When the ``defund the police'' movement arose 2 years ago, the  Democratic Party should have stepped up and denounced it. Instead, they  equivocated, and some Democrats openly embraced ``defund the police''  rhetoric.   Now the President and other Democrats, perhaps motivated by poll  numbers showing that Americans are seriously concerned about crime, are  trying to distance themselves from anti-law enforcement rhetoric. But  it is pretty difficult to take the President seriously on this when he  has filled key administration posts with individuals who have spoken  supportively about ``defund the police'' efforts.   Even the Vice President is on the record praising efforts to divert  money from police departments.   ``Defund the police'' rhetoric needs to disappear from our public  discourse. We need to be making it clear as a society that policing is  an essential job and that police officers perform an essential public  service.   I am proud to support legislation like the Back the Blue Act, which  would increase penalties for deliberately targeting a law enforcement  officer and give officers new tools to protect themselves.   Police officers face the possibility of serious injury or death on a  daily basis. The least we can do is to make sure that we are doing  everything we can to discourage attacks on our law enforcement  officers.   In addition to supporting legislation like the Back the Blue Act and  the Protect and Serve Act, I will continue to urge the President to  take action to secure the border.   Border security is not just something that affects border  communities. Lax border security has consequences for the entire  country. South Dakota law enforcement leaders and officials tell me  that they are seizing drugs that they can trace directly back to the  cartels that smuggle these drugs across the border.   We currently have a very serious fentanyl problem in this country. In  fact, right now, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for  U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45.   And where is all this fentanyl coming from?   Mostly, it is being trafficked across our southern border. And there  is no question that the worse the situation at the border gets, the  easier it is for drug smugglers to evade detection and capture, which  means more drugs flowing into our country and more of our law  enforcement officers having to deal with the consequences.   In my job, I have the privilege of interacting with law enforcement  regularly, whether it is members of the Capitol Police who protect  Congress or local law enforcement in my home State of South Dakota. As  a Senator, I have been in more than one situation where I have gotten  to see up close what happens when danger threatens and law enforcement  officers step into the breach to protect those in peril.   I am more grateful than I can say for all the men and women in South  Dakota, in Washington, DC, and around the country who have made the  choice to serve.   I am also tremendously grateful for their families. It is no small  thing to say goodbye to a husband or wife or a mom or dad every morning  knowing that there is a chance that he or she may not come home that  night. No mention of the sacrifices made by our law enforcement  officers would be complete without mentioning the sacrifices made by  their families.   The mission statement of the police department in Rapid City, SD, is  ``Community First, Service Above Self, Integrity-Driven. One  Interaction at a Time.'' Well, that definitely describes our Rapid City  officers, and it is a pretty good description, I might add, of law  [[Page S2531]]  enforcement officers across South Dakota and around the country-- community first, service above self. We are lucky to have men and women  around the country who put their communities first and choose service  above self, and I pray that we will always remember that.   Again, this Police Week and every week, I want to express my deep  gratitude to the men and women of our Nation's law enforcement  community.   Thank you. Thank you for putting your lives on the line every day to  keep our homes, our families, and our communities safe. Thank you for  your sacrifice, and may God bless you all.   I yield the floor.
