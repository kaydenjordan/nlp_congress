 Madam President, today I recognize Mykaylan  Burner, an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work  she has done on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South  Dakota.   Mykaylan is a graduate of Dakota Valley High School in North Sioux  City, SD. Currently, she is attending South Dakota State University in  Brookings, SD, where she studies political science and Spanish.  Mykaylan is a dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to  getting the most out of her internship experience and has been a true  asset to the office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mykaylan for all of  the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years  to come.                            ____________________
