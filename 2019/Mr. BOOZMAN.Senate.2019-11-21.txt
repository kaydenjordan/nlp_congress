 Madam President, it is a pleasure to be with my friend  and colleague from Arkansas to talk about a tremendous State  institution, something that is truly a true Arkansas institution, and  we want to pay tribute to it and the men and women who made it great in  the past and will continue to make it great into the future.   Newspapers have played a vital role in our country's history of  public discourse, increasing our knowledge and awareness about what  takes place all around us. The stories they print keep us informed,  while building a sense of community and regional identity. Newspapers  drive political debates and set the agenda, helping us make sense of  the issues impacting our world.   As one of the oldest continuously published newspapers west of the  Mississippi, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette has been a resource of  information that has kept readers connected to community, the State,  and our Nation for 200 years.   In 1819, William E. Woodruff published the first edition of the  Arkansas Gazette, the Arkansas Territory's first newspaper. There was  no shortage of news to print in those days. During its early years, the  publication encouraged settlement to the region, shared news of  national importance, and promoted statehood.   For generations, this publication has been a primary source of  reliable and comprehensive news that has shaped the way Arkansans view  the world. It has constantly challenged the status quo and examined the  decisions of elected leaders, while pursuing transparency and  accountability.   The work the Gazette produced often resulted in positive change in  the Natural State. In 1957, the newspaper opposed Governor Orval  Faubus's decision to prevent integration of Little Rock Central High  School. For its reporting on the struggles of integration, the Gazette  earned two Pulitzer Prizes, one for meritorious public service and the  other awarded to its executive editor, Harry Ashmore, for editorial  writing, marking the first time a newspaper won two Pulitzer Prizes in  the same year.   The newspaper and its spirited competitor, the Arkansas Democrat,  contended for readers and advertisers for decades. In 1991, the Gazette  was sold to the owners of the Arkansas Democrat, who then launched the  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which is the only statewide newspaper  Arkansans read today.   The importance of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in today's media  landscape cannot be overstated. In some cases, it is the sole source of  news for many small towns in Arkansas, as local newspapers continue to  cease operations, especially those serving rural areas.   Under the leadership of Walter Hussman, Jr., the Democrat-Gazette is  navigating the challenging industry landscape and creating  opportunities to keep readers informed by keeping costs manageable.  Hussman and his team are rethinking how and what news they deliver to  readers, as well as how subscribers can and like to consume it.   To cut printing and transportation costs and combat declining  advertisement revenue, the paper is now using iPads to maintain  subscribers and continue providing this valuable, not-easily-replaced  service to the community.   In an interview earlier this year about efforts at the Democrat- Gazette, Hussman noted his view that the print model is not  sustainable, but he voiced his commitment to finding a solution that  will fill the void because, as he says, society and our democracy will  be impeded if we don't have newspapers.   It is a simple truth. Throughout periods of change, Hussman and the  newspaper he owns continue to believe in the critical role that news  gathering and reporting play in informing the public.   Every day, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and the other publications  owned by the Hussman family publish a statement of core values that  include ``objectivity, impartiality, integrity and truth-seeking.''  This clear, sensible mantra consistently helps guide the work done by  the reporters and editors in the paper's newsrooms.   Journalism is a pillar of our democracy. Our Founders understood the  importance of a free press and included protections in the First  Amendment that safeguard and ensure the ability of reporters and the  publications they write for to hold the powerful to account.   Earlier this year, I was proud to support the World Press Freedom Day  resolution and recognize the sacrifices journalists around the world  make in their effort to report the truth.   We must continue to promote a free and open press in the United  States and around the globe. In today's climate, we all share  responsibility for acknowledging the value and the necessity of press  freedom while at the same time not shrinking away from appropriate  scrutiny and fair criticism. The health and well-being of our society  and civic life depends on striking the right balance in this regard.   For 200 years, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette has kept individuals  informed about moments and events of significance in Arkansas, our  country, and the world. I congratulate the newspaper's leaders and  staff for pursuing facts and accountability, as they have created and  sustained the publication as a responsible and reliable source of  information.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Gary and  Hanna Canada for receiving the American Bankers Association's Bruning  Award. This award is dedicated to bankers who demonstrate a strong  sense of leadership and dedication to providing financial guidance and  credit to ranchers, farmers, and businesses in rural America.   The Canadas are well known throughout southern Arkansas for their  partnership running their business hand-in-hand, which helps explain  why, for first time in the 22-year history, the award has been  presented to a team of ag bankers.   Gary Canada began his professional career as a teacher and coach,  eventually working his way up to principal. In 1975, Gary joined the  Bank of England and climbed the ranks to become the chairman and  president of the bank. Over the years, Gary has served on numerous  committees and boards, including the ABA's Agricultural and Rural  Bankers Committee, Arkansas Rice Council, and Bayou Metro Irrigation  District. In addition to his work with the bank, Gary has farmed  cotton, rice, and wheat and run a cow and calf operation.   Similarly, Hanna Canada began her career as a teacher before working  at the Bank of England. Her early years at the bank consisted of  working as a teller before transitioning to board secretary assisting  with policies. Hanna currently serves as the executive vice president  of the Bank of England and member of the board of directors. Along with  her hard work and dedication to the bank, she also serves as an  emergency medical technician.   Gary and Hanna Canada demonstrate what it means to give back to your  community. Every opportunity they have had to help those in need, they  have not hesitated to step in and lend a hand. In addition, Hanna hopes  to inspire other women to step into leadership roles in the agriculture  banking community. The couple's desire to grow the farming community in  the State is remarkable and reveals why they are so well-deserving of  this recognition.   I would like to congratulate and thank the Canadas for their hard  work, dedication, and leadership to the city of England, the ag  community in their area, and the State of Arkansas. I am grateful for  their work and for the ABA recognizing their careers and contributions  with the Bruning Award.                            ____________________
