 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 7776, the Water  Resources Development Act of 2022, or WRDA 2022.   Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago we advanced this bipartisan legislation out  of committee by voice vote, and I am proud to continue the bipartisan  tradition of passing a WRDA bill every 2 years--as the chairman pointed  out--something we have done since 2014.   I thank Chairman DeFazio, Water Resources and Environment  Subcommittee Chair Napolitano, and Ranking Member Rouzer for all of  their hard work and support in getting this legislation across the  finish line here in the House.   WRDA 2022 authorizes water infrastructure projects and policies that  are critical to local communities, but also provides far-reaching  benefits to both the region and our national economy.   With the current supply chain crisis and surging inflation our  country faces, it is more important than ever that Congress continues  to support our Nation's water infrastructure that keeps our economy  moving and protects our communities.   WRDA 2022 supports American competitiveness and our economy by  ensuring the reliability and the effectiveness of our Nation's ports  and inland waterways to move American goods and products to those who  need them.   This legislation also boosts flood production for our local  communities, such as those in Missouri's Sixth District, which is my  own district.   In Missouri, we are at a crossroads of the largest rivers in the  country--the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. These rivers are  an invaluable natural resource that provide drinking water, irrigation,  and transportation; however, they can also be the source of some very  devastating flooding.   My constituents are still working to recover and rebuild their homes,  farms, businesses, and their communities after devastating flooding  that occurred in 2019.   I know all too well the consequences when water resources are  mismanaged, which is why WRDA 2022 is going to ensure that the Corps  remains focused on its core missions and priorities and activities like  flood control and navigation.   To do this, this bill contains assistance for meeting levee  inspection requirements, it examines ways to control erosion on our  rivers, and it supports Missouri flood control projects.   These and other provisions in WRDA 2022 are going to provide benefits  not only to Missourians, but citizens all across the country who depend  on water resources and infrastructure in their daily lives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everybody for their support in developing this  legislation, and that includes staff on both sides of the aisle.   Specifically, on my team, I acknowledge the work of my staff  director, Paul Sass, for his leadership of the Republican staff on this  bill, and many other important bills for that matter, over the last  3\1/2\ years.   At the end of this week, Paul will be leaving the committee after  more than 20 years of public service on Capitol Hill--and all of that  time working for me in my personal office or on my committee staff. I  thank him for his dedication and his guidance and friendship over the  last two decades. He has a lot to be proud of as he moves forward onto  the next chapter of his career. He can look back and be proud of all  that he has done. I wish him and his family nothing but the best.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's legislation,  WRDA  [[Page H5291]]  2022, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), who is a member of the  Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), who is the ranking member of  the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership and ranking  member for allowing all the amendments and the language included in  this bill.    WRDA has always been key for infrastructure development projects in  all our States and territories, and this year's bill will not be the  exception. This has been a cornerstone in the process of Puerto Rico's  recovery, and this legislation enables it to continue to do so.   This bill includes the reauthorization of three major flood risk  management projects in Puerto Rico: Rio Guanajibo in Mayaguez, Rio  Nigua in Salinas, and Rio Grande de Loiza in Gurabo, that had waited  for funding, in some cases, for over a decade, to the point that the  original authorizations had to be withdrawn and new validation studies  required.   The projects had later received funding for at least their initial  stages after passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, but needed  this reauthorization so their development can continue with the  planning and design, the allocated funding is protected from loss, and  updated project needs can be addressed in the future so they can move  on construction.   So by advancing this legislation containing these provisions, this  House demonstrates its commitment to our communities. I look forward  for the approval of this bill. And again, I thank all the staff and  leadership and the ranking member for allowing all these amendments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire as to time  remaining?    And the time for the other side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7776, or WRDA 2022, is a very good bipartisan piece  of legislation that will improve flood control infrastructure. It is  going to improve ports, harbors, and inland waterways all across the  country.   This bill provides the support and the investment in our country's  water infrastructure needed to keep our supply chain moving and boost  the competitiveness of the American economy.   When it comes right down to it, this bill is a projects bill that was  pulled together based off requests from Members from all across the  country in the House on both sides of the aisle, and there isn't a  single line in this bill that cannot be attributed to an  individual Member request.    I again thank my colleagues and the members of the committee for  coming together to develop this bipartisan legislation. Again, I thank  the chairman for his work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important piece of legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution, as has been pointed out, authorizes the  use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual Greater Washington Soap Box  Derby on June 18, 2022.   This is a time-honored tradition. With the exception of World War II,  it has run every year since 1934 and provides children in the greater  Washington area an opportunity to build knowledge and character through  fair and honest competition.   This is one of the many regional competitions across the country to  qualify children to compete in the All-American Soap Box Derby. This is  a program I participated in some 40-odd years ago. It is a good  program, and I fully endorse it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this resolution authorizes the  use of the Capitol Grounds for a longstanding tradition for the  children of the greater Washington, D.C., area.   Once in a while, we do some fun stuff here on the floor, and this is  one of those things. I urge support of the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
