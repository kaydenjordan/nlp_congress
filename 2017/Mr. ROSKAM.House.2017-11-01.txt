 Mr. Speaker, cruelty to animals is a scourge, and there  is no worse example than animal fighting that is for so-called pleasure  and definite profit.   I am pleased today to introduce the Parity in Animal Cruelty  Enforcement Act, which is to close a loophole.   Animal fighting is prohibited in the United States, but it is allowed  in some U.S. territories. This is important for us because what we have  is a situation where animals are manipulated, drugged, and put into  situations where their aggression is heightened. It is disgusting.  [[Page H8307]]    I am pleased to join with friends on the other side of the aisle-- Messrs. Blumenauer and Nolan--and Representatives on the Republican  side--Messrs. Rodney Davis, Yoder, and Knight--to come together on a  bipartisan basis to address this trouble. I ask for cosponsors.                            ____________________
