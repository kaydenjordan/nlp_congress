 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the JOBS and  Investor Confidence Act. This important bipartisan package includes my  Senior Security Act which seeks to protect seniors from financial  scammers and help them save for retirement.   I am committed to helping seniors keep their hard-earned money for  retirement so they can afford to stay in New Jersey and enjoy their  lives and times with their kids and grandkids. We need to protect  Social Security and Medicare, cut taxes, and cut costs for our seniors.  We need to do so by working with both sides of the aisle, with  Democrats and Republicans.   For decades, the Greatest Generation has supported their families and  communities, making America the greatest country in the world. Now we  need to commit to fighting for them by stopping financial predators  from scamming seniors out of their savings.   Older Americans are criminally defrauded of $13 billion annually, in  most cases by friends, family members, or caregivers. With more than  10,000 Americans turning 65 every day through 2030, we can't afford  this any longer.   The Senior Security Act will identify problems that seniors face  while saving, making recommendations to Congress to help seniors save  their hard-earned money.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member  Waters for their bipartisan work on this package of Financial Services  bills. I also want to thank Congressman Hollingsworth and Congresswoman  Sinema for helping co-lead the Senior Security Act, working hard to  strike a bipartisan compromise. Together we work to protect seniors  from malicious scammers and ensure our seniors have the savings they  need and deserve in their golden years.
