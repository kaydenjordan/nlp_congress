 Madam Speaker, I am proud to support the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act today because it  is high time that we reduce prescription drug costs for all Americans.   Likewise, this bill includes provisions to expand access to Medicaid  and quality healthcare insurance with expanded tax credits and premium  subsidies.   This bill includes a provision in the bill--that is, the bill that I  have been advocating with my colleagues   John Lewis and Mark Veasey  for some time now--to ensure that all States that expand Medicaid  coverage receive an equal Federal match for expansion, regardless of  when they expanded. That means that the 14 States--like Alabama, that I  represent--could expand Medicaid and get equal Federal coverage in  their match.   This provision incentivizes Medicaid expansion because it would help  113 million Americans living in nonexpansion States. In my State alone,  over 300,000 more Alabamians would qualify for coverage from Medicaid  if we had this bill passed.   The writing is on the wall and the facts are clear: Premiums and  healthcare costs are higher in States that haven't expanded Medicaid,  and over 70 percent of the rural hospital closures are in States that  have not expanded Medicaid.   The public health emergency and economic crisis that we are currently  facing means that more uninsured and more unemployed constituents are  more vulnerable.   Let's pass this legislation. It will not only expand Medicaid and  give Medicaid expansion opportunities with equal Federal match in  States like Alabama, but it would also decrease prescription drug costs  and protect the preexisting conditions that are so important for all  Americans.   This is an important tool, providing our States with enhanced Federal  matching funds to ensure Medicaid is one of the best tools that we have  to help the communities we represent now and into the future. I urge my  colleagues to support this important bill.
