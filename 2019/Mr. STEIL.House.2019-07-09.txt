 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kentucky.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my bill today, the Expanding  Investment in Small Business Act.   Small businesses and entrepreneurs are vital to our economy. More  than 60 percent of new jobs are created by small businesses, and almost  half of our private-sector workforce is employed by firms with fewer  than 500 employees.    Small businesses are also an engine for innovation. According to the  Small Business Administration, small businesses account for an outsized  percentage of patents granted in the most innovative industries.   I see this ingenuity in Wisconsin in Racine, Janesville, Kenosha, and  everywhere in-between. Entrepreneurs and startups create good-paying  jobs for workers.   It is important that we continue giving job creators the ability to  invest in our communities. But in order to grow, hire, and invest in  innovation, small businesses need access to capital.   Unfortunately, rules and regulations have made it harder for  companies to gain access to capital, made it harder for them to go  public, and made it harder for them to stay public. This hurts small  companies, and this hurts the broader economy.   In particular, this hurts American workers and their retirement  security. Just under half of all households are invested in mutual  funds. Many Americans are invested in these funds through 401(k)'s and  pension plans. Their retirement security depends upon the ability to  invest in a diverse set of growing, innovative companies.   Our rules, though, are burdensome. They shrink the number of publicly  traded companies, either by deterring companies from going public or by  encouraging them to stay private. In doing so, they limit the  opportunities for Americans saving for retirement.   Members of both parties and a wide range of stakeholders and experts  have identified the existing mutual fund rules as an area for potential  improvement. I thank my colleague, Congressman Gonzalez from Texas, for  joining me in this across-the-aisle effort to support this bill.   This isn't a new idea, but until now, it hasn't gotten done. I am  glad to see bipartisan support for taking this important step forward  to improving our capital markets.   The Expanding Investment in Small Business Act directs the SEC to  consider whether existing mutual fund rules make it harder for small  and emerging companies to raise money, so they can grow and invest.   Under the Investment Company Act, a diversified mutual fund may not  own more than 10 percent of an issuer's outstanding securities. As  mutual funds have grown both in number and in size, they become an  important source of  [[Page H5285]]  capital, in particular for small businesses.   A substantial mutual fund investment in a small-cap company can  easily exceed the 10 percent cap. This likely deters mutual fund  investments into growing and innovative companies.   My bill asks the SEC to consider four key items: one, how many mutual  funds are currently affected by the 10 percent cap; two, how the  investing preferences of diversified mutual funds have shifted over  time with respect to smaller companies; three, the potential impact of  a change in the 10 percent threshold; and, four, the ability of  diversified funds to manage liquidity risk.   This information is necessary so that we can continue to work in a  nonpartisan manner to ensure that small businesses have access to  capital, so they can grow and invest.   Smart, targeted reforms can give us more vibrant capital markets;  growing, innovative small businesses; better outcomes for American  investors; and, ultimately, a stronger economy.   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues toward this  goal. I thank Chair Waters and Ranking Member McHenry for their support  of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.   This bill is an important step forward toward a stronger economy,  more dynamic small businesses, and more jobs for American workers.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
