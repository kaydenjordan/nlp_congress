 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday at the Fountain of Praise  Church in Houston, TX, a funeral service was held in honor of the life  of George Floyd, whose death has moved hundreds of thousands of people  across America and around the world to peacefully march against police  violence. Today, his brother Philonise Floyd will testify in front of  the House Judiciary Committee.   It is hard to imagine the courage it takes, so soon after the tragic,  awful, and brutal loss of a family member, to not only grieve in the  national spotlight but to turn that pain into action. There have been  many reasons for Americans to be shocked and outraged, angry and  frustrated with the injustice they have seen in their country, but the  entire Floyd family has given the Nation reason to hope.   Now, Democrats in the House and Senate have proposed legislation that  would directly respond to the issues of racial bias and excessive force  in our police departments. The Justice in Policing Act would ban the  use of choke holds, limit the transfer of military equipment to local  departments, make it easier to hold police misconduct accountable, and  institute a whole lot of reforms to help prevent that misconduct in the  first place. It is a comprehensive proposal, and many of the experts on  racism, discrimination, and inequality in police departments have had  large input into the bill.   We need action on the Justice in Policing Act as soon as possible,  and we Democrats in the Senate will work like hell to make it happen.  The moment calls for bold and broad-scale change. We need wholesale  reform, not piecemeal reform. We cannot approach this debate by cherry- picking one or two reforms and calling the job complete. It is my worry  that is what our Republican colleagues intend to do. We need a strong  bill. The Justice in Policing Act is where we should begin.   The Senate is a collaborative institution, at least by design, but  there is one person alone who decides what legislation reaches the  floor, and that is Leader McConnell. For 2 weeks I have asked him to  commit to a debate and a vote on a police reform bill by July 4--an  open debate and certainly an ability to vote on the Justice in Policing  Act. I still have not received an answer.   Is it too much to ask that, as hundreds of thousands, if not  millions, are in the streets, when the vast majority of Americans think  we need reform, that the leader spend some floor time here so we can  debate this issue and maybe move forward for the first time in a long  time? I don't think so. But our leader is silent, missing in action, as  he is on so many different major issues that face America.   After House and Senate Democrats released the draft legislation on  Monday, yesterday, Senate Republicans announced they would put together  ``a working group'' to prepare their own set of proposals. Working  groups are all fine and well, but it is critical that we pursue  comprehensive reform, not seek the lowest common denominator, and it is  critical that we get a real commitment to consider strong legislation  on the floor.   Unfortunately, in the aftermath of other recent moments of national  strife, particularly the mass shootings, President Trump, Leader  McConnell, and Senate Republicans make the right noises--let's study  it; let's consider it--but never follow through.   Leader McConnell once promised that a debate on expanding background  checks would be ``front and center'' on the Senate floor after  shootings in Dayton and El Paso. ``What we can't do is fail to pass  something,'' he said. Yet there was no debate on expanding background  checks, and the Republican majority in the Senate did exactly what  Leader McConnell said that it could not--it failed to pass anything on  gun safety.   So while I welcome ideas from our Republican colleagues, we need a  hard and fast commitment from the Republican leader to put real, broad- scale police reform on the Senate floor before July 4.   Americans, please, be watching the Senate. Watch the leader. Watch  the Republicans.   Is this going to be another situation just like with gun control,  just like with background checks, where they talked a good game, tried  to let the issue fade away, and did nothing? The Nation--the Nation-- will not let this issue fade away, I assure my Republican friends.                                 Coronavirus    There is another major crisis in the country at the moment as well.  COVID-19 continues to kill and infect Americans. Case numbers are  rising in Western States--Arizona, New Mexico, California, and Oregon.  The massive disruption to economic activity initially left more than 40  million--40 million--Americans without work.   This week it became official: The United States has been in  recession--the first one in many years--since February.   In truth, the issues of racial justice and COVID-19 are not  unrelated. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately kills Black  Americans. Communities of color have less access to quality healthcare,  greater food insecurity, greater percentages of poverty, and a  disproportionate number of our frontline essential workers--41.2  percent--are African American and Latino. Yet you are starting to hear  my friends on the other side strum sunny chords because one jobs report  wasn't quite as awful as it might have been, awful as it was.   The President made a revolting comment that the recent jobs report  was a great day for George Floyd and equality, even though it showed  African-American unemployment continuing to rise. What a horrible  comment.   Everyone is rooting for our country to return to normal as quickly  and as safely as possible and for our economy to rebound with similar  speed, but unemployment sits at 13 percent--higher than any point since  the great recession--and the President and my Republican colleagues are  ready to declare victory.   After saying that another COVID relief bill was likely in June,  Leader McConnell has told the Republican caucus not to expect another  relief bill until late July at the earliest--late July at the earliest,  as millions are out of work, millions risk being removed from their  homes, millions can't feed their families   Racial justice, civil rights, a global pandemic, an economic  disaster--this is truly a time of historic challenge, and Leader  McConnell and the Senate Republicans are missing in action. No  [[Page S2842]]  commitment to consider comprehensive police reform. No urgency to  provide our country the desperately needed relief from COVID-19.  Instead, Leader McConnell is likely to schedule votes next week on two  circuit court nominees--Justin Walker and Cory Wilson--both of whom  have expressed deep-seated antipathy toward our healthcare law. And I  am not aware of either of them embracing civil rights, voting rights so  desperately needed in this country.   That is right--in the middle of a public health crisis, the  Republican majority is planning to confirm rightwing judges who have  spoken out against our healthcare law. Watch what they do, not what  they say. And what they are doing is regressiveness--it is not even a  lack of moving us forward; they attempt to move us backward with  rightwing judges who want to turn the clock back.                         FBI Misconduct Investigation    Even more shocking--do you think it can get worse? It does with this  Republican majority. The Judiciary Committee tomorrow will hold a  hearing. The Republican chairman will continue his pursuit of President  Trump's wild conspiracy theories about the 2016 election, asking for  scores of subpoenas to chase down alleged misconduct by the FBI.   Let me get this straight: The Republican Party will eagerly focus on  law enforcement that affects President Trump, but they aren't ready to  commit a focus on law enforcement, on racial equality when Americans  demand it? I don't hear anyone other than the President and his  acolytes demanding a reinvestigation as it affects President Trump on a  largely discredited conspiracy theory. But that is what our Republican  Senate friends are doing, showing how removed they are from the  national needs and the national sentiment.   Senate Republicans are ready to issue nearly 100 subpoenas to trash  the FBI to protect President Trump, but they can't commit to debate on  one bill to reform police departments to protect African Americans.  Instead of addressing the real challenges African Americans face, the  Republican conspiracy caucus is obsessed with visciously attacking the  FBI for protecting our national security while Putin interfered in our  democracy. What a bizarre and outrageous inversion of our Nation's  priorities.   Now I am glad my friend from Illinois is here because it was his  leadership that will cause, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate  Democrats to request subpoenas for Trump administration officials like  Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and Michael Flynn, among others. These  officials at one time or another have pled guilty to offenses related  to Putin's interference in the election. If the Republican conspiracy  caucus wants to waste the Senate's time dredging up old conspiracy  theories, we are at least going to try to show and get the story  straight and not just call a list of witnesses that they want. It is  just crazy. Kangaroo court, kangaroo hearing.   Let's see if the Republicans have any--any--strength of conviction  about what they are doing. If they did, they would allow the witnesses  that Senator Durbin and the other members of the Judiciary Committee  have proposed to come forward and tell their side of the story--quite  contradictory to the witnesses that the Republican majority and the  Republican chairman are calling                                   Protests    That is one crazy conspiracy theory, but yesterday the country was  treated to another one. We seem, in Trump land, in the Trump world, to  live in a world of conspiracy theories. Some crazy, discredited,  rightwing blogger--sometimes with Russian information--tweets or writes  something, and then President Trump goes right ahead and tweets it and  talks about it.   I am not in the habit of responding to every Presidential tweet-- something I am sure my Republican colleagues are familiar with--but  yesterday morning, the President tweeted a vicious attack on a 75-year- old constituent of mine who was seriously injured in Buffalo, NY. The  President said he might have belonged to a radical group and that the  event might have been a setup because the man ``fell harder than was  pushed.''   It was disgusting, even for a President known for disgusting attacks.  How small a man do you have to be to slander a 75-year-old protester  recovering in a hospital? This is the President of the United States,  you have to remind yourself from time to time. This is what the  President of the United States is doing--acting like a little 12-year- old schoolyard bully.   Apparently, the conspiracy theory the President repeated on Twitter  was originally posted on an anonymous blog and then amplified by a  reporter who used to work for a Russian state media organization.   It feels like it shouldn't need to be said, but it has to be in a  democracy where we believe in facts and truth: The President has an  obligation to check out information before giving a platform to crazy  conspiracy theories. He is the President, not just some guy. He can't  shrug his shoulders and say: Hey, I am just asking questions. He has  access to national intelligence.   I call on the President to apologize. I don't expect he will. He  never does. So I will just say to my Republican colleagues: You know  how wrong his behavior is. You know it. Say so. Say so. Say something.  How much do you let this President get away with? How long will you  grimace inside or whisper to each other how crazy he is but not say a  thing? You, my Republican Senate colleagues, may be the one check left  on this President. Where are you? Where are you?   I applaud the few Republicans who have spoken out, but just far too  many have danced the familiar ``hear no evil, see no evil'' routine.  Leader McConnell was directly asked and couldn't conjure a word of  criticism for the President.   If Republicans can't call out the President on this instance, then  what the heck are they doing here? If we can't do legislation on the  floor, even during one of the greatest national crises this country has  faced, then what the heck are our Republican friends doing here?   On COVID, on police reform, and all too often when the time comes to  place a check on the President, the Republican majority is simply  missing in action.                               Georgia Primary    Madam President, one final word on the Georgia primary--yesterday,  the State of Georgia held its primary election. Across numerous  counties and dozens of polling locations, Georgians waited 3, 4, and in  some cases up to 7 hours to cast a ballot. I saw the pictures of the  long lines. Numerous polling places failed to open on time; new voting  machines may have malfunctioned. Most disgracefully, many of the  problems we saw yesterday occurred in precincts with high populations  of people of color.   Of course, in past years, the Voting Rights Act would have empowered  the Federal Government to oversee and approve the changes that the  State of Georgia made to its election process--changes that may well  have caused this election disaster. But the Roberts Court, in one of  the most misguided decisions in recent Supreme Court history, gutted  the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby County decision and opened the door  for the confusion we saw yesterday.   The idea that seems to be in the Court's mind--at least the majority  of the Court--that the need for section 5 preclearance had passed is  clearly refuted by what happened in Georgia yesterday. We have  legislation passed by the House that would fix this problem and protect  voters against racial discrimination and disenfranchisement, but it has  been gathering dust here in the Senate, condemned to Leader McConnell's  all too full legislative graveyard. Once again--once again--the  Republican majority is missing in action, and this time it is on voting  rights.    The right to vote in a free and fair election is sacrosanct in this  country. Yesterday, Georgia failed miserably for the second election in  a row. There ought to be an immediate investigation, and the errors  ought to be corrected before the general election. The Senate should  take up H.R. 4 and at the very least deliver the necessary resources to  election officials in the next COVID relief bill.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, there are millions of people in America  marching in the streets to reform our police practices, to ask for  equality, to ask for racial justice.   We have seen in the savage death of George Floyd, we have seen with  Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Eric Garner, and in so many other  instances that our police departments need real reform.   There is a demand of Americans that we act--and act soon. The  resolution my colleague offers is rhetoric, not action, and the great  worry so many Americans have is that so many on the other side will  feel rhetoric and then try to let this go away.   We demand action, and we demand it now--real action, not rhetoric--to  reform our police departments in a fair and comprehensive way. That is  what the Justice in Policing Act does. We need it on the floor now, as  soon as the House passes it.   Very few of us believe that Leader McConnell will put it on the  floor, but we want him to. We demand he does.   Again, the resolution by my friend will do nothing--nothing. It is  rhetoric. We demand action.   And so in a minute, I will be asking unanimous consent that upon  receipt of H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, the pending  business here in the Senate, after it passes the House, be that bill,  so that we are forced and required to debate it.   And at that point, my friend from Arkansas or anyone else can do  whatever they want, but not in an empty field of rhetoric and no  action, when Americans demand action.   We need justice. We need racial equality. I object.    Mr. President, I have a resolution at the desk.    Mr. President, as the gentleman heard, we need action,  not rhetoric. That is the objection because we believe that too many on  that side of the aisle will not want to act and, therefore, for them to  be content with rhetoric will not serve any good purpose.   We can debate all of these issues when we have a real bill on the  floor and we are moving forward to bring justice. My resolution does  just that. It says very simply--very simply--that the minute the House  passes the Justice in Policing Act, the pending business here in the  Senate is that act, so we can debate it and we can hopefully pass it.  Some may choose to modify it in whatever way they choose, but rhetoric  is no substitute for action when the American people, overwhelmingly,  in the streets, peacefully, proudly, strongly demand action.                          Unanimous Consent Request    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of a resolution at the desk that would make  H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing Act, the pending business upon  receipt from the House. I further ask that the resolution be agreed to  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, the gentleman from Arkansas has made my  point. He talks about business as usual. This is not business as usual.  The typical rhetoric, the kind of avoiding action which has been so, so  endemic in this Republican Party is showing itself again. If they  wanted to act, they could have supported our resolution. They are  trying to avoid it. We will not let that happen.   I yield the floor.
