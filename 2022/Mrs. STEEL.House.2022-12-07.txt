 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate a great  citizen of Orange County, Irene Dorothy Schweitzer.   Yesterday, Irene turned 100 years old. She has been an active member  of the community and has consistently given back.   Everyone who knows Irene knows how happy she is because of her  million-dollar smile which absolutely lights up the room. Even at 100  years old, Irene never forgets a face, which makes everyone who meets  her feel so special.   I have personally been so blessed to know her, and I am so thankful  that we have a person as wonderful as her living in Southern California  and making our community a brighter place to live. She truly makes the  world a better place.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all of Orange County, I wish Irene a happy  100th birthday and wish her many more years of joy, blessings, and  smiles.                            ____________________
