 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 963. There is nothing fair about the  FAIR Act. The bill would undermine Americans' freedom to contract;  burden the judicial system, both Federal and in all States in the  country; and restrict access to justice.   This bill would ban arbitration agreements across nearly all  contracts. It outlaws arbitration agreements in employment disputes,  consumer disputes, antitrust disputes, and civil rights disputes. It  outlaws arbitration agreements with respect to not only big, huge  corporations but the most humble businesses and parties in the country,  those that I served in my law practice.   Democrats propose that arbitration is bad for Americans, but it has  been a fixture of our legal landscape for almost 100 years. They claim  that arbitration is forced. Both of their claims are wrong.    Arbitration has many benefits. It is more efficient and faster than  going to court. The rules are not nearly as arcane. Injured parties get  their relief sooner, and they spend less money along the way.   Plaintiffs in employment and consumer disputes, according to studies,  actually win more in arbitration than they do in court. They get more  money in arbitration. They win more often in arbitration.   Democrats know that arbitration has plenty of benefits. How do you  know this? Because in this very bill, Democrats have carved out their  union friends from the mandates of this bill.   In other words, if the bill becomes law, powerful unions, and no one  else, can still use these valuable agreements vis-a-vis individuals.   This carve-out also tells us that Democrats know there is no such  thing as forced arbitration. Agreements that are truly forced are  already illegal under existing law in every State in the country.   People are no more forced to agree to an arbitration provision than  they are to agree to any other provision of a contract. The bill,  instead, bans private parties from knowingly and willingly agreeing on  a process to resolve future disputes. It tells Americans, no matter how  informed or sophisticated they may be, that they can't be trusted to  manage their own relationships by agreeing in advance to the means of  resolution to be used in the event of a dispute.   Our Democrat colleagues seem to believe that Americans can't be  trusted to think for themselves. Big Government needs to tell them what  to do. Their freedom to contract should be restricted by the wisdom  from Washington.   Democrats argue that this bill is no big deal because parties can  still decide to use arbitration after a dispute arises, but that never  happens in practice for much the same reason that many disputes go to  court and are resolved outside of a jury. About 1 to 2 percent actually  go all the way.   The decision to get into a lawsuit is not always purely rational,  taken from all points of view, and is often affected by tempers that  are different once the dispute has arisen than when the parties are  considering a position of cool judgment in advance.   Their incentives change after a dispute has arisen, and people will  pick a strategy to resolve that dispute at that time. They won't  necessarily be looking for a process, then, that is good for both  parties for many reasons.   When you are immersed in a dispute, there is also a greater chance  that a lawyer that you may have retained would have an incentive to  direct you in the direction of litigation rather than arbitration, and  those incentives certainly won't necessarily be consistent with a  faster and cheaper alternative.   Rather than helping the little guy stand up to big companies, this  bill would take the option to arbitrate off the table for everybody and  put more money in the pockets of trial lawyers, most especially  plaintiffs' class action trial lawyers.   The bill would force more people into court. They will pay more and  possibly recover less. But it would also force some people out of the  justice system altogether.   Some people will be unable to pay for an expensive lawsuit, or they  may have a claim so small that it is only practicable for them to bring  it themselves, which arbitration facilitates.   Let's be clear, too. The surge in new lawsuits hurts employment. It  hurts businesses and keeps them from being able to afford to hire more  people. It will raise their costs at the worst possible time, when they  are already dealing with supply chain problems and record inflation  caused by failed Democrat policies, and not only by prohibiting the use  of arbitration going forward but by retroactively eliminating it,  rendering it null and void in millions of contracts already outstanding  right now, at this point in the life of our Nation, when we have 8  percent inflation, another constraint on the supply chain imposed by  Democrat policies.   Everyone should be sounding the alarm on this blatant overreach. At  the end of the day, this bill curries favor with the plaintiffs' bar  and union bosses, and it does so at the expense of hardworking  Americans and small businesses, especially.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 963, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   The distinguished chairman of the committee offered to correct me by  saying that the bill only prohibits forced arbitration, said that was a  correction, as if I misspoke as to facts.   Let me read from the language of the bill: ``Notwithstanding any  other provision of this title, no predispute arbitration agreement or  predispute joint-action waiver shall be valid or enforceable with  respect to an employment dispute, consumer dispute, antitrust dispute,  or civil rights dispute.''   The word ``forced'' was not in that language, Madam Speaker. It  prohibits all predispute arbitration agreements and post-joint action  waivers.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Florida, and as I suggested earlier, if  the bill were a matter only of big businesses, it would be a very  different bill, but just as there is no limitation to forced  arbitration agreements in the language of the bill, there is no  limitation to arbitration agreements entered into between little guys  and big companies.   The very first appeal I ever took in a 30-year law practice in 1992  was in a case called Bennish v. North Carolina Dance Theater, in which  I represented a fledgling, very-hard-pressed economically arts group in  my hometown that had an employment dispute with a dancer who wanted to  litigate. They had an arbitration agreement. It would have destroyed  that organization financially to have to engage in extended and  expensive litigation. This bill would have made the enforcement of that  arbitration agreement unlawful, and it has nothing to do with big  business.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   We still haven't heard an explanation for why this legislation deems  it appropriate to eliminate arbitration for parties of all sizes. We  keep hearing about the little guy versus the massive corporation.   Even in that circumstance, of course, what we may be talking about is  like the case from 2011, AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, where the issue  was people in California had bought cell phones, they had been offered  a free cell phone, but it wasn't made clear that they would have to pay  the sales tax. So  [[Page H3792]]  there was a $5 claim per purchaser, and wealthy plaintiffs' class- action lawyers wanted to bring a big lawsuit. With tens of thousands of  them, they might get a $5 coupon, but the lawyers would buy a new jet.   That may be in some circumstances, even the dispute with the big guy.  But leave that aside. We still don't hear any explanation for why you  are wiping out arbitration as a means that parties choose, even if they  are on equal bargaining power.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Tiffany).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   The distinguished gentleman from Georgia suggests that this bill is  about whether or not we are preserving the right to jury trial in the  Constitution. But I submit, that is not really what is at stake.   The question is whether you resolve a dispute through arbitration or  you go to the court system. If you go to the court system, there are  innumerable paths within the court system that lead to not having your  case decided by a jury.   In fact, only about 1 to 2 percent of cases end up proceeding to a  determination by a jury. That means 99 or 98  [[Page H3793]]  out of 100 cases do not. They might be dismissed on a motion for  summary judgment. They might be dismissed for failure to state a claim.  There may be settlement processes that come to fruition during the  course of the case.   But it is almost never true--think about that--that a case in court  goes to a jury. So this notion that this bill, by eliminating the  choice of arbitration, somehow preserves everybody's jury trial  magically is a false choice.   And more to that point, the gentleman from Georgia, and also the  chairman, in the inception, noted that we have just had a bill signing  of a bill that excepts from enforceable arbitration agreements the  category of sexual assault, sexual harassment. The majority of  Republicans supported that.   The majority of Republicans will not support this bill because it  represents the throwing out of the entire mechanism of arbitration,  which has been, as I indicated, a feature of the legal landscape used  with great utility and utilized throughout the last hundred years  almost, since 1925.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Bentz).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   On the other side of the aisle, we hear repeated references to  defending the Constitution and the American way. I would remind the  Chamber that our economy, the American economy, is built on contracts;  which contracts, under the rule of law, are not forced, but enforced  when someone refuses to abide by his or her agreement. That is not  forced. That is where a contract is enforced.   We, our courts, our judicial system, and, yes, arbitration is the  means by which we call people to live by their bargains, and that has  been the key to the most successful economy in the history of the  world. It has certainly been the state of affairs, as I said, for  almost 100 years.   Throwing that out, dispensing with a major component of that on the  premise that you are pursuing the American system is contrary to fact.  It is, as Democrats often seek to do, it is transformational. It seeks  to transform America, not to reinforce and persist it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock).                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from California for his remarks.  [[Page H3795]]    It causes me to remark, as the gentleman from Tennessee said a moment  ago, that it is Democrats who look out for the interests of the little  guy and look out for the interests of the people. I wonder why it is  that looking out for the interests of the people invariably involves  restricting their freedom in some way. What a remarkable notion.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, one of the things that we have heard repeated a number  of times, as the gentleman from Rhode Island suggested and the  gentlewoman from Washington just said, is that if you go to  arbitration, the company picks the arbitrators, and that is it. That is  not, in fact, correct.   Courts police the fundamental fairness of the arbitration process. If  there is a process that is fundamentally unfair, the courts will modify  it until it is fair. So, that is a misconception.   Furthermore, it has also been suggested that it is by the whim of the  arbitrator what the result is. That is exactly what Mr. Cicilline, I  believe, said. That also is erroneous.   If an arbitrator writes a decision that manifests a disregard of the  governing law, like the soldier who had been in arbitration for 8 years  that he suggested, the courts will vacate, strike down, that  arbitration award.   It is important to know those premises before you decide what to do  on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Fitzgerald).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I was intrigued by the situation we just had on the  floor, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, I think she said she  represented big corporations. Yet, she spoke to the fundamental  unfairness of arbitration. It is ironic perhaps.   I spent almost 30 years--29 years in the practice of law as a  litigator representing people in court and in arbitration equally. I  represented plaintiffs and defendants both, frequently individuals,  often businesses, always small to medium-sized businesses, and  occasionally a local government or two, never a big company.   I have had clients who didn't want to have arbitration agreements  enforced and sometimes I could defeat them or have them modified or  change the results of them because the arbitrator had manifested  disregard for the law. Sometimes I had clients who wanted to enforce  those agreements. It depends on the circumstances.   But I can tell you it is not a tool that is uniformly bad. Although I  have voted for accepting enforceable arbitration agreements,  arbitration clauses involving sexual harassment and sexual assault  cases, I don't believe that throwing the baby out with the bath water  is a good idea. It is a terrible idea.   Let me let America in on the inside scoop. Here is what this is  about. For the past, roughly, decade there have been a series of cases  in the United States Supreme Court in which, through various efforts  and methods, plaintiffs' class action lawyers, lawyers for big class  litigation where they make millions and millions in fees, have tried  various approaches to get the United States Supreme Court to allow  class actions to be pursued through arbitration, and they have failed.  That is why this bill is here.   The bill is to reverse the result of that decade of litigation in the  Supreme Court in order for class action lawyers to be able to have a  field day and to make a lot of money. This bill protects and seeks the  fortune of plaintiffs' class action lawyers, and of course, it protects  the patronage of big unions both at the same time. That is what the  bill is about.   Madam Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
