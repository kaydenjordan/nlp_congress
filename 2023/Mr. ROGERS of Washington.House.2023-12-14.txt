 Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. ROGERS of  Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I rise in strong support of FY24 National Defense Authorization Act.   The NDAA is one of the most consequential bills Congress considers.  Passage of this bill each year sends an important signal to the men and  women defending our freedom that Congress can function and will  prioritize their needs above all else.   Enacting the NDAA has never been more valid than today. America and  our allies face unprecedented and rapidly evolving threats from China,  Russia, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist organizations throughout the  world.   These threats are real. We all just witnessed terrorist acts on their  threats against one of our closest allies in the Middle East, and we  all pray for Israel as it counters the most vile attack on Jewish  people since the Holocaust.   To stay ahead of these threats, DOD came to Congress this year, as  they do every year, to request critical new authorities as a part of  the National Defense Authorization Act.   We took those requests seriously. We held dozens of hearings to  examine them, then we worked to improve them and add our own priorities  through the committee and floor processes.   We followed regular order and had a conference committee for the  first time in 2 years. We fought the Senate for weeks over each other's  priorities, and we came to a compromise. That is what is before us  today.   I will be the first to admit, I am disappointed we didn't get all the  priorities we wanted, but the Senate is pretty disappointed they didn't  get the priorities they wanted either. It takes compromise to move  legislation in a divided government, and this bill is a good  compromise. It is laser-focused on deterring our adversaries,  especially China.   The conference report includes critical new authorities to ensure our  warfighters have what they need to deter our adversaries and to prevail  in future battles. It goes a long way toward ending woke policies being  forced on our servicemembers by leftwing bureaucrats.   It includes provisions that ban critical race theory and require  promotion based on merit. It includes several provisions that require  accountability from the administration, like a Special Inspector  General for Ukraine aid and a deadline for the DOD to finally pass an  audit.   It improves the security of Israel by extending weapons transfers and  expanding joint military training.   Finally, the conference report carries important new quality-of-life  improvements for our servicemembers and their military families,  including the largest pay raise in over 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a compromise, but it is a good compromise.  It puts the need of our servicemembers and our national security before  all else.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support, and I reserve the balance of  my time.
