 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo cast doubt over American support for our Ukrainian allies when  he asked veteran NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly if she thought  Americans care about Ukraine and if she could even find it on a map.  How insulting.   Pompeo's outburst came after Mary Louise Kelly questioned him about  the administration's shameful treatment of our Ambassador to Ukraine,  Marie Yovanovitch.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus and  representative of a large Ukrainian American population, I am deeply  concerned about what Pompeo was insinuating with his comments to NPR  that the administration can do whatever it pleases because the American  public doesn't care about Ukraine. I couldn't disagree with him more.   Ukraine is the scrimmage line for liberty in Europe. Liberty lovers  across the world care about Ukraine because its people are facing down  Russian aggression.   Unfortunately, Pompeo's comments reflect a larger pattern of the  Trump administration advancing pro-Russian causes.   On Secretary Pompeo's upcoming trip to Ukraine, I would urge him to  support liberty in Europe. America and the world paid a heavy price for  that.                            ____________________
