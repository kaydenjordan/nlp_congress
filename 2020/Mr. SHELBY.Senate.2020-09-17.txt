 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Mrs.  Melissia Davis of Kennedy, AL, who passed away on September 7, 2020.  She will be remembered as a dedicated public servant who was committed  to bettering her community and State.   Melissia worked diligently for 26 years as the State representative  in my U.S. Senate Office in Tuscaloosa, AL. She covered the West  Alabama region, specifically serving the counties of Fayette, Greene,  Hale, Lamar, Marion, Pickens, and Tuscaloosa. I first met Melissia when  she was working for the Internal Revenue Service, and I was eager to  hire her. I knew she would be an exemplary employee. Over the years,  Melissia gained a deep understanding of constituent services and  remained dedicated to working with Federal, State, and local agencies  on behalf of my constituents.   Melissia served with distinction on the board of trustees of her alma  mater, Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, AL. She was the chairwoman of  the Stillman House Restoration Committee for 13 years. Under her  leadership, the historic Stillman House was placed on the Alabama  Historic Register and National Register of Historic Places. She was  also successful in placing Stillman College on the Alabama Register of  Landmarks and Heritage, designating the campus as an Alabama Historic  District.   Outside of her professional career, Mrs. Davis was heavily involved  with Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., the West Alabama United Way  Campaign, Habitat for Humanity, and several other local endeavors.  Additionally, Melissia was a dedicated member of Elizabeth Baptist  Church, where she taught Sunday school and served as a matron. Not only  did Melissia live a life of service, she embodied it.   Melissia's many accomplishments and contributions to the State of  Alabama will long be remembered. Melissia was passionate about her  hometown of Kennedy, AL, and she served as one of its strongest  advocates. She will be remembered for her great sense of humor and  style. Melissia touched the lives of many over the years, and she will  be greatly missed.   I offer my deepest condolences to Melissia's husband, Burkles Davis,  II, and her two children, Alecia Nicole Davis and Burkles ``Trey''  Davis, III, and to all of their loved ones as they celebrate her life  and mourn her passing.                            ____________________
