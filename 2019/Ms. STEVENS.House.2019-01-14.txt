 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Abbas  family.   This beloved family perished last week in a car crash as they were  heading back home from Michigan on a family vacation.   Northville and the Metro Detroit area have lost a cornerstone of our  community. Issam and Dr. Rima Abbas were loving parents to their three  beautiful children: Ali; Isabella; and their youngest, Giselle, who was  only 7 years old.   As the children of immigrants from Lebanon, Rima was the  granddaughter of the founder of the prominent mosque in which their  memorial services were held, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn.   They touched the lives of their neighbors of all faiths, and the  interfaith community has come out in solidarity with the Abbas family.   My prayers are with their family and our community. They will always  remain in our hearts, and we will cherish their lives for all time. We  must act to make sure this never happens again.                            ____________________
