 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during  further proceedings today in the House, the Chair be authorized to  reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting on any  question that otherwise could be subjected to 5-minute voting under  clause 8 or 9 of rule XX.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Let me bring clarification. I know there is frustration. I am  frustrated as well. I know we would like to be home with our family,  but there is work still to be done.   Wait. There is still good news. Because the flood bill went down on  suspension, we do not want to leave and have that lying out there.   So, after the colloquy is done, we will debate the Senate bill on  flood. It will take about 30 minutes, and we will come back for another  vote series. I don't want to say anything, but if the bill passed, we  would not be back.   After that, tomorrow, there are no votes scheduled. We are waiting on  action in the Senate. When the Senate has action, I will notify  everybody, giving them ample time to come for that vote.    For today, yes. I don't foresee more votes until the  Senate acts, if that helps clarify for everyone.    The Senate vote is still open. There is talk. We have  our bill over there. I hope they take action. I hope they find that we  can find compromise, and then we would all come back together and solve  this problem.    The gentleman is correct. The only votes further will  be on flood, and, after that, the only vote I see coming forward would  be on funding of the government.   When the Senate acts, I will give ample time for Members to be able  to have that vote.
