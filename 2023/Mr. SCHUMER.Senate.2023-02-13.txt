And finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, February 13, be  waived.    Madam President, now, for my remarks, first and  foremost, I begin today as happy as I could possibly be. Last week, my  daughter Alison and her wife celebrated the birth of little Henry-- their first child, my third grandchild.   The tie I am wearing today is the very same tie I wore on the day my  daughter and her wife got married. The last time I wore this same tie  on the floor of the Senate was the day the Respect for Marriage Act  passed the Senate. So it is not only a great tie, but it is a really  great day, and it symbolizes a whole lot.   I want to thank everyone for their messages of support. I am pleased  to report both moms and the baby are doing just great. He is such a  little cutie.   Few things put this job in perspective quite like being a  grandparent. I have often said that after my first grandkid Noah was  born--it was about 2 weeks later--I took a bike ride through the  wetlands near Coney Island. It is on the southern shore of Brooklyn.  The Atlantic Ocean laps up on it, and it is beautiful. I love that  ride, but 2 weeks after Noah was born, as I was riding, it hit me like  a bolt: Will Noah one day get to enjoy this beautiful, beautiful bike  path like I have? Because if the ocean rises even a few inches, this  bike path will be gone.   Having grandkids like that reminds you of what we are fighting for: a  better life for them, a better globe for them, a better world for them.  It is a motivation unlike any other.   Well, I could go on, but suffice it to say that today Chuck Schumer  is one happy grandparent, and I am grateful for everyone's kind words  over the past few days.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have one request for committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned under  the provisions of S. Res. 57 until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, February 14;  that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for  the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning  business be closed; further, that following the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Mendez-Miro nomination postcloture; that at 11:30  a.m., the Senate vote on the confirmation of the Mendez-Miro  nomination, and that following the cloture vote on the Jenkins  nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  caucus meetings; that at 2:15 p.m., if cloture has been invoked on the  Jenkins nomination, the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination;  further that if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's session,  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, under the previous order and pursuant to S.  Res. 57, as a further mark of respect to the late David Durenberger,  former Senator from Minnesota, the Senate, at 7:14 p.m., adjourned  until Tuesday, February 14, 2023, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
