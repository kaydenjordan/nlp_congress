 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to Jim  Wurgler of Williams, Arizona. Sadly, Jim passed away last month of a  stroke.   Known to many as ``Doc,'' Jim devoted his life to the health and  betterment of others. He served as an Army physician in Vietnam and  later as a doctor in several locations throughout the Southwest,  including Grand Canyon Clinic and Williams Health Care Center in my  district.   A lifelong mentor to others, Jim revitalized Yosemite National Park's  EMT training program in 1978, teaching advanced emergency medicine to  park rangers. One of his proudest moments was receiving an honorary  park ranger award and a new title: The Ranger's Doctor.   Well into retirement, Jim worked to improve his community, going to  great lengths to recruit and retain doctors in rural areas.   Always an optimist, Jim's family will be honoring his wishes and  holding a ceremony of his life in lieu of a funeral.   Jim left an indelible mark on his loved ones and on the State of  Arizona. He will not soon be forgotten. Pat and I are keeping Jim's  family in our prayers this holiday season, and I hope all of my  colleagues will do the same.
