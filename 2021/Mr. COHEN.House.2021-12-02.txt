 Madam Speaker, I mourn the loss of the Supreme Court of  the United States of America.   As a lawyer, I have always had respect for the Court as the highest  court in the land dispensing justice, but starting with Bush v. Gore,  it became more political.   In Shelby v. Holder, it emasculated the Voting Rights Act, destroying  section 5 and taking the basic fundamental principles of democracy away  from so many people.   In Citizens United, it gave the rich and the powerful more and more  money.   And then yesterday, it took away women's right to choose.   To hear some of the arguments from Justice Kavanaugh, to say abortion  is not in the Constitution so we should leave it to the States, well,  high-speed internet is not in the Constitution either, but the courts  can hear cases on that. Nuclear power is not in the Constitution, but  the Court will hear cases on that.   To hear Justice Barrett say women can just go a little longer and  give birth to those children because there will be somebody there that  wants to adopt that child, deciding for the mothers that they will have  to bear that child might cost them their life. Childbearing is not  without risk and takes them away from other things.   Unfortunately, the Court is very diminished.                            ____________________
