 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, if Democrats have made one thing clear  over the past 16 months, it is that they think that the Federal  Government--or maybe just Democrats--knows best. It is evident in just  about everything they do. And there is pretty much no end to the things  they think the Federal Government should be in charge of--healthcare,  childcare, education, elections, and the list goes on.   Take the current debate over abortion. There is one thing Democrats  are clearly terrified of is putting this issue in the hands of the  American people. Overturning Roe v. Wade would return the issue of  abortion back to the people and their elected representatives.  Democrats are keen to make sure that doesn't happen, probably because  they know the American people are not in agreement with Democrats'  extreme abortion agenda.   And so the news that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe and return  the issue of abortion to people has been met with hysteria from  Democrats. More than one has responded by calling for packing the  Supreme Court so the Democrats can ensure they get the abortion  decisions they desire.   Of course, yesterday, Democrats responded to the Supreme Court's  pending decision by holding a vote on what has to be the most extreme  abortion legislation ever considered by the U.S. Congress--a bill that  would rip away even the smallest protections for the unborn and make  abortion-on-demand, at any time, for essentially any reason, the law of  the land.   Meanwhile, today, the Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing on  a favorite Democratic proposal--putting the Democrats in charge of  Americans' healthcare. Under Medicare for All, Americans can look  forward to a future in which the government decides what healthcare  Americans can access and what medications and procedures will be  covered.   Never mind the nearly 180 million Americans who have access to health  insurance through their jobs, many of whom are satisfied with their  coverage. No, that coverage would be decimated in favor of Democrats'  preferred ``one size fits all'' approach. I am not sure what Democrats  have seen that makes them think government can efficiently run  healthcare. Maybe they never had to deal with the IRS.   Oh, and let's not forget about the part where it has been projected  that this government-run system could cost taxpayers more than $30  trillion. So what is the problem with that attitude the Democrats have?  Why should all of us be concerned by the fact Democrats think the  Federal Government--or maybe just the Democratic Party--knows best?   For starters, it is clearly apparent that government does not always  know best. Take our current inflation crisis. A big reason we are  currently dealing with the worst inflation in 40 years is the  Democrats' decision to flood the economy with unnecessary government  money with their American Rescue Plan spending spree.   This legislation was billed as critical COVID relief that was going  to help families and our economy recover. Instead, it helped plunge our  economy into a massive inflation crisis that has left individuals and  families struggling to afford necessities like gas and food.   To give another example, the President's Department of Homeland  Security recently created a so-called Disinformation Governance Board.  And the individual who has been chosen to head up this disinformation  board is someone who, herself, has been a purveyor of online  disinformation, as well as being hostile to what she apparently  considers excessive free speech. Yet, apparently, the Biden  administration thinks we should trust her to rule on disinformation.    Of course, this is not to say that we should distrust every move the  government makes or whether the government can never do anything good.  Assuming the government always knows best is to vastly overestimate the  government's abilities. The Federal Government, like society, is made  up of flawed human beings. Being a Member of Congress or a Presidential  administration does not come anywhere close to conferring  infallibility.   Another big problem with ``Democrats' knows best'' attitude is it  usually involves a plan for government to take over ever-greater areas  of American life. More government control usually involves less  individual freedom.   Take the childcare plan Democrats included in their Build Back Better  legislation. First, of course, Democrats take the opportunity to add a  lot of new childcare mandates and regulations. But more than that,  Democrats' government subsidy program is set up to favor certain kinds  of childcare and childcare providers. It is set to favor institutional  childcare rather than home care or other models, like neighborhood co- ops. And it is set up to place religious providers at a disadvantage.  That is right. Despite the fact that more than half of working families  who use center-based care opt for faith-based centers, Democrats'  program is set up to put these providers at a disadvantage.   Democrats obviously think childcare is better conducted in secular,  institutional settings, so they set up their legislation to favor that  kind of childcare, no matter--no matter--what parents actually prefer.   That is pretty much par for the course for Democrats, of course, who  have made it very clear that they have their doubts as to whether  parents are the best decisionmakers for their children.   Who can forget the Democrat candidate for Governor of Virginia who  memorably said:         I'm not going to let parents come into schools and actually       take books out and make their own decision . . . I don't       think parents should be telling schools what they should       teach.    This is a view that President Biden seemed to echo just days ago. I  would love to hear the reasons why Democrats think government can make  better decisions for children than parents who know their children as  individuals and raise them and love them.   But to get back to my main point here. The childcare program in  Democrats' tax-and-spending spree is a perfect example of what happens  when government starts taking over. The government, instead of the  individual, starts making decisions. The more substantial the  government involvement, the larger the government's role in decision  making is likely to be.   Again, that is not to say that the government has no role to play in  American life. We need the Federal Government. Our national defense,  for example, is most practically handled at the Federal level. But the  Federal Government should be and is meant to be limited.   And allowing the government to take over ever-larger aspects of  American life--whether it is childcare, healthcare, or anything else-- is a recipe for the loss of individual liberty.   Finally, Democrats' ``government knows best'' attitude is a problem  because, as we have clearly seen, it quickly leads to an attitude of  ``Democrats know best,'' which quickly leads to pushing for special  privileges for Democrats.   Take recent conflicts involving the Supreme Court. Democrats have  made it abundantly clear that they believe the only legitimate Supreme  Court is a Supreme Court that hands down decisions in line with  Democrats' policy  [[Page S2470]]  preferences. And they haven't just implied this. More than one Democrat  has actually straight-out called this Supreme Court illegitimate,  despite the fact that every single Justice on the Supreme Court was  duly nominated and confirmed in accordance with the Constitution of the  United States.   And the Senate, despite having the slimmest possible majority, in  fact--a merely technical majority and absolutely no mandate for radical  change--Democrats have pushed to abolish the legislative filibuster so  they can steamroll through far-left Democratic legislation, including a  partisan takeover of election law and, of course, the most extreme  abortion legislation ever considered in Congress.   Just imagine the howls that would have resulted if Republicans had  announced that we were going to abolish the legislative filibuster to  institute a 20-week abortion ban--a ban that is much more in line with  the sentiments of the majority of Americans than Democrats' far-left  abortion legislation.   Or take the protests that have been going on at the Supreme Court  Justices' homes. The President and other Democrats have made it clear  they are perfectly fine with demonstrators congregating at the private  homes of Supreme Court Justices to try and intimidate them into  changing their vote.    I have to ask, would Democrats be fine with pro-life activists  appearing at the homes of Justice Breyer, Justice Kagan, and Justice  Sotomayor to try to intimidate them into changing their votes? I think  we all know the answer to that. But because abortion is one of  Democrats' pet issues, clearly, the usual rules don't apply.  ``Government knows best'' quickly becomes ``Democrats know best,''  which leads to one rule for Democrats and one rule for everyone else.   ``Government knows best'' is not a vision Republicans share. We  believe that individuals, not Washington bureaucrats, are the best  judges of what they and their family and children need. The government  should be a backstop, not Big Brother.   We also know the more government expands, the more individual liberty  shrinks, which is why we are firmly committed to a philosophy of  limited government. Our country is founded to safeguard individual  liberty and preserving that liberty it a sacred trust, which is why  Republicans will continue to oppose Democrats' ``Washington knows  best,'' Big Government philosophy, and why we will continue to fight to  make sure that Americans' right to run their own lives and shape their  own destinies is protected.
