 Mr. Speaker, the people's House should be better than  this. We should be better than this.   During the Member's remarks in the Judiciary Committee, the  committee's impeachment proceedings, he stated: ``To my Republican  colleagues: . . . How do you want to be remembered during this  watershed moment in our Nation's history?''   Mr. Speaker, it won't be watching sports on a laptop during official  Judiciary Committee proceedings to impeach a sitting President;   It won't be using expletives to refer to our President, calling for  his impeachment just hours after being sworn into Congress;   It won't be using the chairmanship of the once-respected Intelligence  Committee to distort the President's words in order to mislead the  American people; and   It certainly won't be using the most serious and solemn powers of  Congress to overturn a legitimate national election for political  expediency.   No, Mr. Speaker, my fellow Republican colleagues and I won't be  remembered in history for doing any of those things because we know  this is far too grave a matter for subversions such as these of our  democratic Republic.   We should all be better than this.
