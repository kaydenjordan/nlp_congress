 Mr. President, this is a pivotal moment for our country  and for our economy. Everyone understands we need a full Federal  Reserve Board. Once we move the President's nominees and get them  confirmed and get them sworn in, it will be the first time in nearly a  decade that the Federal Reserve has had a full complement of seven Fed  Governors. That is especially important with the upcoming meeting of  the Federal Reserve in March because the Fed's job is to tackle  inflation and bring prices down for American families.   It is a pretty simple equation. The President nominates. I mean, it  didn't happen in the last few years, but the President nominates. We  have hearings. We ask some questions. We send them followup questions.  The nominees answer these questions. That is how this place works. That  is a good thing about this place.   Then we call the vote in committee, and we vote yes or no. The job is  vote yes or vote no and hope your side prevails.   And that is what Americans think we should do. Every day Americans  get up, go to work, and do their jobs. But Senate Republicans didn't do  theirs yesterday.   We had our markup, a meeting to confirm five--just five--nominees for  the Federal Reserve. The Chair of the Federal Reserve, appointed  originally by President Trump, has been renominated by President Biden.  His nomination we were voting on; the Vice Chair, Lael Brainard, who  has been on the Fed some time; and then three new Fed slots that have  been vacant for some time: Sarah Bloom Raskin, who would be Vice Chair  of Supervision, a very important job at the Fed; and the other two,  also important jobs, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson. All five of these  nominations we wanted to vote on yesterday.   Three weeks ago, Senator Toomey, the leading Republican on the  committee, he and I agreed it would be yesterday; that the vote would  be yesterday and we would meet at 2:15 and vote them up or down. And  everybody--all 14 of us get a vote.   Well, under Senate rules, if one party doesn't want to play ball,  they don't  [[Page S733]]  show up, and we can't do business. So all 12 Democrats showed up. We  wanted to vote. We actually took an informal vote, which passed 12 to  0, for essentially all six of them. There was one ``no'' on one of  them. But Republicans didn't show up.   So, as I said, Americans every day get up, go to work, and do their  jobs. They expect us to get up every day, go to work, and do our jobs.  But Republicans are AWOL in the fight against inflation. If we are  going to get serious about inflation, we need a Federal Reserve in  place. We need all seven Fed Governors in place, ready to work, ready  to debate and make decisions about monetary policy, about interest  rates, about jobs, about attacking inflation.   Americans--in Boulder or Denver or Cleveland or Columbus, Americans  don't want more political theatrics. They want solutions to bring down  their costs. And Republicans, they have been great at coming to the  floor and speaking against inflation. They have got their political  stunts. But when it really came time to show up and do their job, they  just simply didn't show up yesterday to do their jobs. All 12 Democrats  were there ready to go. All 12 of us wanted to move forward on these 5  nominations for the Federal Reserve, and under Senate rules we simply  couldn't act officially to get this done.   So I know that the ranking member--I understand he doesn't want to do  this for whatever reasons. He doesn't like her position on climate  change. He doesn't like it that she is going to--the one he is  complaining most about, he doesn't like it that she is going to stand  up to Wall Street and not roll over for Wall Street every time Wall  Street, you know, rattles the Fed's chains. He knows that, and he  probably doesn't like that, but he is hanging his hat on some issue  that really makes very little sense.   Sarah Bloom Raskin, the person whom he is most complaining about,  over a weekend, had 48 hours to answer more than 180 questions from  Senator Toomey and his colleagues. She answered them all in 48 hours.  Then, even outside of the Senate rules, more questions were sent to  her. She answered those questions.   So it is really about the fact that far too many people here pay far  too much attention to the oil company lobby, but that is really neither  here nor there. Everyday Americans, as I say, get up, go to work, do  their jobs. Senate Republicans must do theirs.   Pure and simple, Republicans are AWOL in the fight against inflation.  We are not going to stop fighting for these nominees. The American  people want us to vote. Some people vote yes, some no. I am fine with  that. But the American people want us to do our jobs.   When you come here, there aren't three boxes: vote yes, vote no, or  check a box that says: I don't want to come to work today; I am not  going to vote.   No, they want us to vote. So we will keep fighting for these  nominees.   I implore at least 1 Republican of the 12 on the committee to come to  our next markup, our next vote, our next executive session so we can  vote on these nominees. I want the Federal Reserve, for the first time  in a decade, to all be there pulling in the same direction, fighting  inflation for our country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Fast-track? Fast-track? Senator Cortez Masto said it has  been a year since they have had a U.S. attorney confirmed, sitting in  Nevada. In Ohio now, it has been--let me count the days--404 days since  6 million people in the Northern District of Ohio last had a permanent  U.S. attorney leading the office. Senator Cotton, with his demagoguery,  comes down here and talks about fast-track? I don't know what speed  they move in Arkansas, but I would not consider what we are trying to  do as fast-track.   They have been vetted. Senator Portman supports this nominee. Let me  talk about that.   We know the pandemic has caused an alarming rise in violent crime,  especially gun crimes. The Northern District of Ohio, which includes  Toledo, Cleveland, Akron, Canton, Youngstown, Mansfield, Warren--cities  in basically the northern half of the State. The U.S. attorney has the  highest caseload in the last 30 years, filing a record 846 indictments  in 2021 alone without a full-time, confirmed U.S. attorney.   Even before the pandemic, the district had a staggering caseload  after reaching a record low in 2016, with only 363 new cases through,  Senator Cotton, I might add, the Obama administration. The number of  new cases began to climb in 2017, at the beginning of the Trump  administration, if you want to play those games, Senator Cotton. The  number of new cases rose to 706 in 2018. This as kept climbing since.  Last year, there were 170 homicides in the city of Cleveland, where my  wife and I live--another 30-year record--not to mention a surge in  carjackings.   We need to fill key law enforcement positions in Ohio and, as Senator  Cortez Masto said, as Senator Durbin said, in their States--and Senator  Rosen and Senator Duckworth. We need to fill these key law enforcement  positions.   I hear from Ohio police officers that they are in desperate need of  help, while we, through--Senator Cotton and others accuse Democrats of  undermining police or whatever term they use--a term that none of us  use--when we have supported local governments with more dollars so they  can hire more police while you oppose those same positions, as we know.  So we are working with local police to get them that help, whether it  is confirming U.S. marshals, whether it is confirming U.S. attorneys.   Thankfully, we have an extremely qualified nominee in Ohio who is  ready and eager to serve. The only thing standing in our way is the  U.S. Senate. Apparently, the only thing standing in the Senate's way is  Senator Cotton, although I am sure somebody else would be willing to  take his place.   Marissa Darden is a seasoned prosecutor with extensive experience, a  lead attorney in both civil and criminal cases. As an assistant U.S.  attorney in the Northern District, she was recognized for her work on  several cases involving highly complex legal issues. She received the  National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Award for outstanding  opioid investigation effort in 2016 and for outstanding investigative  effort in 2019.   Listen to what some people have said. Federal District Court Judge  Benita Pearson: You can be assured that Darden will fiercely enforce  the law while treating all--attorneys, staff, the accused, and the  community--with respect and appropriate sensitivity.   Former Acting U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman, nominated by President  Trump and supported by Senator Portman and me both--U.S. Attorney  Justin Herdman was the last confirmed U.S. attorney in the Northern  District. He described her as an attorney of outstanding ability and  unquestioned integrity. He said that she is a leader who has a proven  track record of delivering results inside and outside the courtroom.   First Assistant Federal Public Defender Jacqueline Johnson told us  that this was her first recommendation for U.S. attorney in 38 years of  practicing in the Northern District. She said she based her  recommendation on her belief that Ms. Darden possesses the intellect,  vision, temperament, and judgment needed to lead the U.S. Attorney's  Office during this perilous season.   DEA Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin. With 26 years of  experience, she is one of the best he has ever encountered, he said. He  explained that she was phenomenal in her interaction with law  enforcement, cooperative, and stands on her principles. He can't  imagine a better choice.   These qualifications--I repeat that Senator Portman also supports Ms.  Darden's nomination. Her confirmation would also be historic, making  her the first African-American woman to ever serve as U.S. attorney in  Ohio.   Unfortunately, Senator Cotton blocks this nomination in addition to  these eight other law enforcement nominees. By his own admission, his  objections to these nominees have nothing to do with their  qualifications.   I support his desire to get answers from DOJ. He should get them. But  the solution for his disagreement with DOJ is not with the 6 million  Ohio citizens who pay a price or the millions of citizens in Illinois  or in Nevada who pay a price, or Minnesota or anywhere.   The last thing I will say, last week I spoke with police officers,  one of the many kind of roundtable zooms I do around the State with  police officers from around the State. One officer conveyed his  colleagues' frustration with politics today. He told me that officers  in his department have begun leaving letters on their lockers that say,  if  [[Page S747]]  they are killed in the line of duty, they want no elected officials  invited to their funerals.   He said, the notes don't say no Democrats, no Republicans; they say  no elected officials. A whole bunch of them. The reason for that is the  gamesmanship we see right now, that we are not willing to confirm U.S.  attorneys, U.S. marshals, in many cases, Federal district judges, just  because somebody's been offended by the lack of a letter or something  somebody at the Justice Department said to them.   The fact is we need to do this. It will help our States, it will help  our country combat crime.   Let's heed this officer's warning and come together to get qualified  and talented law enforcement officials and professionals on the job.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
