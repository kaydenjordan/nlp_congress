 Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say that the  Republicans' attack on the poor and vulnerable through this disastrous  healthcare bill is a surprise. But, unfortunately, in my home State,  Republican leadership has laid out the framework for their very own  attack.   Last week, Governor Chris Christie dealt another blow to the welfare  of New Jerseyans by seeking to fund his State budget by siphoning money  from Horizon, the State's largest healthcare insurer, serving over  900,000 Medicaid members in New Jersey. Horizon's reserve fund exists  to protect healthcare consumers in the face of uncertainty. But, Mr.  Speaker, New Jerseyans are currently facing tremendous uncertainty due  to proposals by Republicans in Congress to roll back Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, the threats are clear. Governor Christie's proposal  would destabilize Horizon and raise consumer premiums just when  hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans may lose Medicaid coverage or  have premium subsidies withdrawn at the hands of reckless Federal  lawmakers.   In my district alone, 40,600 New Jerseyans currently covered by the  ACA's Medicaid expansion now stand to lose their coverage if  eliminated. Both Governor Christie's budget raid and the Republican  healthcare proposal are prescriptions for disaster. These plans are not  only lazy and careless, but are also unworkable strategies that will  only result in chaos across the healthcare industry of New Jersey and  this country.                            ____________________
