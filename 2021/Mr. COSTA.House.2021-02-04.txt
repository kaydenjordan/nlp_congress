 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the urgent need  to address doctor shortages in rural and medically underserved  communities throughout our country. The current pandemic and problems  with vaccine distribution have highlighted the dangers behind a lack of  access to the quality of healthcare in these areas. I am working to  change that right now.   Unlike producing personal protective equipment, it takes years to  train a physician. This week, I will introduce legislation to invest in  medical education and to create new medical schools throughout this  country and in underserved communities like mine in the San Joaquin  Valley.   This bill will help curb the shortfall of physicians in rural areas  by enabling medical students to stay close to home. Studies  increasingly show that students who can study close to home are more  likely to stay there and practice there upon graduation.   If we want to keep the promise that every American who wants a  vaccine will get one, then we need to have more doctors, nurses, and  medical providers throughout our country. This legislation would do  just that.   Helping my constituents and keeping them safe is my number one  priority. I will continue to do whatever it takes to make that happen.  This is important legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support this  legislation in a bipartisan basis.                            ____________________
