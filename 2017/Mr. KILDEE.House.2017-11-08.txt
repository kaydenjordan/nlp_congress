 Mr. Speaker, Democrats agree that we need to simplify our  Tax Code and provide tax relief to middle-income families.  Unfortunately, this Republican tax plan gives big tax cuts to the rich,  huge tax cuts to corporations, and raises taxes--yes, the details  matter--on tens of millions of American families, middle-income  families making $100,000 or less.   It takes away for some the ability to deduct interest on their home  mortgage; takes away the ability to deduct interest on student loans,  for goodness' sake; and takes away the ability to deduct interest on  medical expenses.   But for the loopholes that apply to the people at the very top, for  the loopholes that apply to corporations, they leave them alone. They  bring down their rates and let them keep their loopholes, and force us  to borrow money from our children and our grandchildren to give great  big tax breaks to people at the very top.   This is wrong. This is not what the American people elected us to do.  We need to shut this down now. We need tax relief for middle-income  Americans, not tax giveaways to the people at the very top. We ought to  reject this plan, and we ought to do it now.                            ____________________
