 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Energy Security  and Lightering Independence Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill would  allow foreign crewmembers of lightering ships to obtain a visa for a  time period consistent with the duties of their work in the United  States.   This bill would amend the C and D visa categories in the Immigration  and Nationality Act to allow foreign crewmembers who are involved in  ship-to-ship liquid transfer to be granted nonimmigrant visas for up to  180 days. This affects those crewmembers who are involved in moving oil  from one ship to another and then transporting it into the interior of  the United States.   The bill also clarifies that these crewmembers are engaged in foreign  trade and are not considered to be performing labor within the United  States.   Many vessels carrying crude oil or liquid natural gas are too large  to enter U.S. ports, so lightering crews transfer these imports onto  smaller vessels capable of entering U.S. ports. Crews may also transfer  oil and liquified natural gas from smaller vessels to larger ships to  consolidate exports bound for foreign ports. Approximately 74 percent  of all U.S. exports and 44 percent of all U.S. imports of crude oil or  natural gas are conducted by lightering.   Currently, crewmember visas are granted for 29 days, which is an  insufficient time for lightering crews to get their work done. Customs  and Border Protection must parole crewmembers into the United States on  a case-by-case basis, which is administratively burdensome on the  Agency. In fact, it is estimated that this bill could save CBP $250,000  and 6,000 man-hours per year.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn for joining me in this effort, and I  urge my colleagues to join us in passing this technical fix as quickly  as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Energy Security  and Lightering Independence Act of 2022.
