 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and to  honor the life of one of my mentors and my very good friend, Georgia  State Senator Jack Hill, who passed away on April 6 at the age of 75.   I sat next to Jack in the Georgia State Senate for 5 years, and he  was truly a mentor to me. Through listening and interacting with him  over the course of those years up until his death, I understood what it  really meant to be a dedicated public servant.   Jack lived his entire life in Reidsville, and his love for his  hometown and community was evident throughout his life.   After he graduated from Reidsville High School and Georgia Southern  University, he came back to his hometown and went into the grocery  business as owner and operator of Hill Shopping Center.   In addition to running his own successful business, Jack still found  time to serve in the Georgia Air National Guard for over 33 years, both  as a unit commander and a State inspector general.   He was appointed to the board of directors at The Tattnall Bank in  the early 1980s before heeding the call to public service.   In 1990, he ran for and won his first term as Georgia State Senator  for the Fourth District of Georgia.   Throughout Jack's 30 years of steadfast service in representing the  Fourth District, he served on many prestigious committees, including  the Senate Rules Committee, where he was vice chairman, and chairman of  the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.   Both Jack and I liked to write columns. We would write weekly  columns. Jack always chided me and said mine were very chatty. I always  chided him and said his were very nerdy.                                time  0930    He was a numbers cruncher. He knew the budget like no one in the  State of Georgia knew it. He was always the last to leave the capitol  each day because of how dedicated he was to serve the people of our  State.   Because of Jack's leadership, my colleagues and I were always driven  to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and uphold our mission in all  that we did to serve Georgians to the best of our abilities.   Jack was a man of overwhelming integrity, compassion, and humility.  He was a true statesman. While he certainly worked hard to be selected  for this role, he never used his prestigious title to gain praise or  acknowledgment.   He was one of the few people who taught me the importance of placing  people over the politics and praise. If anyone ever needed to talk to  him, he was always available and listened to what you had to say no  matter who you were.   Jack also taught me the importance of humility and keeping a common,  steady hand at the helm. I will always remember his immense dedication  to everyone he interacted with.   He made a huge difference in the lives of countless students, in the  reputation of the university system, and in the holistic improvement of  the State of Georgia.   Jack's legacy will always be remembered, and those he knew will never  forget the impact he had on the lives he touched.   It is for these reasons that all 14 Georgia Members of the U.S.  House, including myself, signed proposed legislation to name a post  office building in Jack's hometown of Reidsville after him. Naming a  post office after him will honor his remarkable contributions to our  State for years to come, and we will work to preserve his legacy of  public service for his fellow Georgians.   Jack's advice has stayed with me throughout the years, and he helped  make me the person I am today. I am forever grateful to have known Jack  Hill, and I will never forget him. His family, friends, and those he  worked with will continue to be in my thoughts and prayers as we all  mourn the death of a great Georgian and a great American.                 Honoring the Life of Benjamin Tarbutton, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Mr.  Benjamin Tarbutton, Jr., who passed away  [[Page H2989]]  peacefully on June 9, 2020, at the age of 90.   A lifelong resident of Sandersville, Georgia, Mr. Tarbutton's  ambition started at an earlier age when he earned the honor of Eagle  Scout. He even attended the Boy Scout International Jamboree in Paris,  France, in 1947.   Mr. Tarbutton went on to attend Oxford College and graduated from  Emory University in 1951 with a BA in economics. Following his studies,  Mr. Tarbutton served our Nation in the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955 and  was a veteran of the Korean war.   When he returned home, he began his lifelong career with the  Sandersville Railroad Company. Mr. Tarbutton served as a director of  the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association, which is now  127 years old. He dedicated 65 years to the company until the time of  his death, serving as president, vice president, and director.   His strong commitment to the railroad industry stretched beyond  Sandersville Railroad Company. Mr. Tarbutton served as the director of  the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and founder  and president of the Georgia Railroad Association.   While he found great success in business, Mr. Tarbutton is best known  for his commitment to his family, his church, and his community and the  State of Georgia.   He will always be remembered for his tireless work to bring new  industry and jobs to Sandersville. As part of this work, he served as  the director of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce for many  years and was honored as Washington County's Citizen of the Year.   But most importantly, Mr. Tarbutton was a family man. His friends and  family remember him as a wonderful storyteller who entertained everyone  around him with his colorful tales.   Our thoughts and prayers are with the Tarbutton family, especially  his widow, Nancy, with a debt of gratitude for sharing Mr. Ben with all  of us.                            ____________________
