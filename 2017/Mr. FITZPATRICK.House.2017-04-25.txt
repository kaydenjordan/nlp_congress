 Mr. Speaker, as communities across my district and  across the Nation continue to deal with the crisis of opioid abuse and  addiction, it is hard to imagine that a synthetic drug exists that is  50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine.   Fentanyl is a manufactured opioid, which, especially in its illicit  versions, has contributed to tens of thousands of deaths. Especially  concerning is the fact that this synthetic poison can be ordered online  and delivered via medical or express consignment couriers from places  like China, and because of its high potency in small amounts, Fentanyl  is extremely difficult for law enforcement officials and authorities to  detect.   That is why I have joined Congresswoman Niki Tsongas in introducing  the INTERDICT Act which will provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection  agents access to the latest chemical screening devices and scientific  support to both detect and intercept synthetic opioids before they can  cause our communities more harm and more devastation.   So I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. As  both parties, we must come together, and this is one piece of a larger  response to the opioid epidemic. Both parties can and must come  together to solve this crisis to take on this challenge head on.                            ____________________
