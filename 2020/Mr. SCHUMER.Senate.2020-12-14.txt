 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week, the Senate returns with  precious little time left to finish important matters of business. Last  week, both Houses of Congress passed the annual Defense bill with veto- proof majorities. If President Trump takes the rather ridiculous step  of vetoing a pay raise for our troops in order to defend the honor of  dead Confederate traitors--or whatever other contrived grounds he comes  up with--Congress must override that veto.   On Friday, both Chambers of Congress also passed a 1-week continuing  resolution, giving us until the end of this week to finish an omnibus  appropriations bill to fund the government. As usual, the  appropriations bill will include several important pieces of related  legislation. One that doesn't get enough attention is a bipartisan  energy bill.   Earlier this year, during the debate over the Energy bill, Senate  Democrats insisted that a provision to reduce HFCs--a very harmful  greenhouse gas that is driving our climate change problem--must be  included in the bill. Unfortunately, we had to hold up the bill until a  bipartisan agreement could be reached on this critical provision, which  would be the single biggest victory in the fight against climate change  to pass this body in a decade.   Today, I am very happy to report that we have made very good progress  toward an agreement on HFC reduction. We are about to get it done. That  is one of the biggest victories to fight global warming in a very long  time.   I want to thank Senators Carper, Kennedy, and Barrasso. They have  worked very diligently and very hard to craft a compromise.   Finally, as we all know, it is imperative we pass another round of  emergency Federal relief from the continued impact of the COVID-19  pandemic. Today, the bipartisan group of Senators who have been  diligently working toward an agreement will announce the results of  their work: a package of over $900 billion that includes an agreement  on assistance to State and local government. Notably, there is no  agreement on corporate immunity. We look forward to reviewing their  work. Democrats remain 100 percent committed to getting another round  of emergency relief to the American people before the end of the year  and in a robust, bold way because America needs it so badly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, a year that was full of bad news for  the country is coming to an end with some very good news. Over the past  8 to 9 months, American scientists, biochemists, and researchers rushed  to produce a safe and effective vaccine to the COVID-19 pandemic--and  they have succeeded in extraordinary fashion.   We don't have just one but several candidates for a vaccine, each of  which has shown to be 90 percent effective in clinical trials. One of  those vaccines has been approved, authorized by the FDA for emergency  use. And as we speak, an assembly line of workers in masks, gloves, and  face shields are pulling doses out of the freezer, loading them into  cold storage palettes, and onto trucks to be shipped to States across  the country.   The discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine within the timeframe of a  calendar year is a crowning scientific achievement of the 21st century.  It should bring not only a feeling of relief to the country--indeed, to  the entire world--but also deep admiration and pride for America's  scientists and our medical workers.   I remember, in the early days of the pandemic, going to the window of  our Brooklyn apartment each night to applaud our frontline workers. The  whoops, claps, and metallic clang of pots and pans echoed for miles.  Our medical researchers--as well as thousands of Americans who  selflessly volunteered for clinical trials--deserve the same national  expression of gratitude.   We can show our gratitude here in Congress by communicating clearly  that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and that every American  should inoculate themselves when it becomes available. Skepticism about  vaccines was already too high before the pandemic. Several polls have  shown it to be an alarming concern with respect to the COVID-19  vaccine. It is an absolute disgrace that the Republican majority on the  Homeland Security Committee has invited a prominent skeptic of the  COVID-19 vaccine to deliver testimony in a hearing this week. Public  figures at all levels should be building up confidence in a vaccine,  not giving a platform to those who undermine it.   At the moment, the vaccine is being distributed to medical personnel,  doctors, nurses, frontline workers, and the most vulnerable  populations. I myself will take the vaccine as soon as it is  appropriate and recommended. I will not skip the line. But make no  mistake, we should all lead by example, commit to taking the vaccine,  and tell our constituents to take it as well.   The CDC and our States will continue to advise which populations  should be inoculated based on availability, and we will follow that  guidance                            ____________________     Mr. President, now one other note--today, members of the  electoral college are gathering in all 50 States and the District of  Columbia to formally select Joe Biden as the next President of the  United States of America.   Typically, the meeting of the electoral college is merely a  formality. The Presidential election took place over a month ago. The  result is not in doubt. In almost any other year, both major parties  would have fully and publicly accepted the will of the American people  by now--the peaceful passing of the torch, a hallmark of our grand  democracy. But this year, it seems as if Joe Biden has had to be  declared the winner of the Presidential election again and again and  again--and still, our Republican colleagues have not fully come to  grips with that reality. Just how many times does President Trump have  to lose before rank-and-file Republicans--before most Senators-- acknowledge that Joe Biden will be the next President of the United  States?   Last week, more than 100 Republican Members of the House of  Representatives signed their names to a lawsuit that would invalidate  the results of the election in four swing States. For any serious  person, much less a Member of the U.S. Congress, to sign their name to  such an anti-democratic document is beyond shameful.  [[Page S7456]]    To my knowledge, the Republican leader of the Senate still has not  referred to Joe Biden as President-elect. Will he change his tune now  that the electoral college has once again confirmed his victory? Will  the rest of my Republican Senate colleagues do the same?   After no evidence of widespread voter fraud was found in the country,  after State election officials corroborated the accuracy of the results  in every State in the country, after the Trump campaign's legal team  racked up an astonishing win-loss record of 1 and 59, after the Supreme  Court summarily dismissed two ludicrous efforts by Republicans to  invalidate the results in swing States, will the Republican Party in  Congress, here in the Senate, finally acknowledge the results of an  election that was determined over a month ago?   Just how long are Republicans going to keep up this charade, which  has become a national embarrassment? Even now, the Chairman of the  Homeland Security Committee is planning to hold a hearing this week  about what he calls ``election irregularities.''   Look, our Republican colleagues don't have to like the results of the  election, but they have a solemn responsibility to accept them. They  have a duty to confer legitimacy on them. Instead, for the past month,  they have given President Trump the space to promote wild conspiracy  theories about election fraud and poison Americans' faith in our  democracy.   As the electoral college casts the majority of its votes for Joe  Biden--the same number of votes that President Trump called a landslide  4 years ago--our Republican colleagues must do now what they should  have done a month ago: Accept the legitimacy of Joe Biden's election to  the Presidency of the United States.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
