 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone  for yielding the time.   America should not be exporting our crude oil exports to an  adversary, and that was our national policy for 40 years until a  Republican-controlled Congress authorized sending American crude oil  abroad in 2015.   China exploited that ill-advised policy change, and exports of  American crude oil to China increased nearly a hundredfold during the  Trump administration to about 391 million barrels.   Last year, in response to soaring gasoline prices caused by Putin's  unprovoked attack on Ukraine, President Biden successfully used the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices at the pump and provide  relief to American families. This was a commonsense strategy that  worked.   Gasoline prices have fallen an average of $1.90 per gallon nationwide  since their peak last June. However, we cannot keep relying on the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep oil prices in check.   That is why Democrats have focused on lowering costs and avoiding  price spikes through the Inflation Reduction Act because cleaner,  cheaper energy is our future. It will lower costs, create good-paying  jobs, and help us build safer, more resilient, and healthier  communities.                                time  0930    Plus, this bill is way too narrowly tailored. What we should be  debating today is the farsighted bill offered by my colleagues,  Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan and Congressman   Don Bacon, a  bipartisan bill that would completely ban all crude oil exports to  China. That is a much stronger bill. In addition to China, it would ban  crude oil exports to all of our adversaries, including Iran and North  Korea.   In the end, America's future is in clean energy. That is how we are  going to lower the cost of energy for American families, provide good- paying jobs, and make sure that we provide a livable planet to our kids  and future generations.
