 Mr. Speaker, many of us in this House  will attend Memorial Day ceremonies over the weekend. I actually had  four over this past weekend. I was privileged and honored to be there  as we honor those who have died in the service of this great Nation to  defend our rights and our liberties.   Observed on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day is one of America's  most solemn occasions. The traditional Memorial Day dates back to 1864,  in Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, not too far from my home in Centre County,  Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, as the birthplace of  Memorial Day. Three ladies decorated the graves of fallen Civil War  soldiers, and the custom has continued every year since then.   Boalsburg still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration  complete with a parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches,  military enactments, and much more.   On Memorial Day, communities across the country will pay tribute to  our fallen veterans who never returned home. Many of us will gather  with family members and friends and neighbors as we keep those we lost  in our hearts.   So as we raise the Stars and Stripes, as we lay wreaths at monuments,  memorials, and cemeteries, let us remember that our freedom is thanks  to those who died and served in sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day weekend also marks the ninth year that the  National Endowment of the Arts and Blue Star Families begins Blue Star  Museums. This program provides free admission to our Nation's Active- Duty military personnel this summer from Memorial Day weekend through  Labor Day weekend of 2018.   This is an initiative of the National Endowment of the Arts in  collaboration with Blue Star Families, the Department of Defense, and  more than 2,000 museums nationwide, including children's museums, fine  art museums, history and science museums, zoos, and nature centers.   Blue Star Museums are one way our Nation's museums can express  appreciation to our military for their service and share with them  America's cultural treasures. Blue Star Museums also provide a way for  military families to feel connected to their community, especially for  those families that have recently relocated through a change of  station.   Blue Star Families build communities that support military families  by connecting research and data to programs and solutions, including  career development tools, local community events for families, and  caregiver support. Since 2009, Blue Star Families have engaged tens of  thousands of volunteers and served more than 1.5 million military  family members.   Mr. Speaker, Blue Star Families will be celebrating with every  American this weekend as we commemorate Memorial Day in honor of so  many who are no longer with us. May God bless them, and may God bless  the United States of America.                            ____________________
