 Mr. Speaker, a labor union's purpose is simple: to  represent its members and to bargain on their behalf. But for millions  of Americans who are currently paying union dues, their money is  sometimes being used for political advocacy that they may not support.   The First Amendment in our Constitution grants workers around the  country the freedom to donate or not to donate to any political cause.  As it currently stands, however, union members have to opt out of  having their dues spent on certain political activity. This process can  be burdensome, and it can be complicated and time consuming.   Instead of asking workers to go through a lengthy process just to  avoid funding political causes they don't support, they should have the  choice from the start whether to opt in to that spending or not.   Earlier this week, I introduced the National Paycheck Protection Act  that would require an employee's consent before their labor  organization dues are used for any purpose not directly related to  collective bargaining.   Mr. Speaker, union members are Americans before they are Republicans  or Democrats, and this simple change would be the first step in the  fight for more worker freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my name be  removed as cosponsor of H.J.
