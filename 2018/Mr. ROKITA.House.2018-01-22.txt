 Mr. Speaker, we have done our job. President Trump is  doing his. The House has passed a spending bill that keeps our  government open, funds our military, and helps protect healthcare for  millions of low-income children, but Senate Democrats only want to  obstruct President Trump. They are opposed to a bill that has  everything in it that they are not opposed to, but they hold out for  more.   Why?   Because they are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants above law- abiding citizens. This is unacceptable.   They are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of healthcare  for low-income children.   They are putting amnesty for illegal immigrants ahead of funding our  military.   They won't allow anything that includes President Trump's wall.   This is inexcusable. We need border security. We need to keep our  government open. We need to fund our military. And we need to provide  healthcare for millions of low-income children.   This is not a complicated matter, and voters should hold Democrats in  the House and Senate responsible.                            ____________________
