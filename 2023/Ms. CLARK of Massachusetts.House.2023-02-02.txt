 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania for yielding.   The Speaker of the House wrote this week that removing Democrats from  their committees was motivated by integrity.   Integrity? Is that the quality of honesty and acting with moral  principle?   There is no integrity here.   Congresswoman Omar is a committed, hardworking, and highly valued  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. A refugee and a survivor of  war, she knows firsthand how much is at stake in its work. It is too  serious of a subject to be subjected to partisan games by the  Republican majority. But that is how the GOP has decided to govern: not  with solutions, but with political stunts.   How can my colleagues across the aisle talk about integrity and honor  as they empower the most extreme voices in their party? As they claim  due process has been added in when there is none? As they promote  conspiracy theories?    Mr. Speaker, as they stack some of our  most critical committees with election deniers?   It is too late to inject integrity into this sham process, but we, as  Members, can inject our own by voting ``no'' on this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and  it is my privilege to join my first colloquy to stand here on behalf of  the Democratic Caucus. It is a pleasure to be with him, and I thank him  for the small promotion, however brief.   I really do appreciate the insight into the week ahead, although it  does seem to have a very local flavor to it. I have to express my  dismay that, once again, the House Republican majority is putting  forward an agenda designed to score points, rather than address the  very real challenges faced by Americans.   Next week, President Biden will return to this Chamber for the State  of the Union. Under his leadership, House Democrats have lowered costs;  we have created great-paying union jobs; and we have made communities  safer.   We have spurred a period of renewed opportunity: 10.7 million new  jobs, the lowest unemployment rate in half a century, and wage growth  that is outpacing inflation. But that work has seemed to have ground to  a halt.   Here is what we have seen from the majority over the last month. The  first bill of the 118th Congress was a bill that helps billionaires  dodge their taxes and added $114 billion to the deficit.   They continued their assault on reproductive freedom and are  threatening economic disaster in order to cut Social Security and  Medicare, and filling our schedule with hollow, symbolic stunts.   The American people are in the GOP's rearview mirror. It is politics  over people, plain and simple, and our constituents and the American  people are seeing this.   A recent national poll found that 73 percent of Americans say House  Republicans haven't paid enough attention to the country's most  important problems. The American people don't see themselves in the  Republican agenda, and I would ask the majority leader, what does he  say to them?    Mr. Speaker, I am hearing the exact same  rhetoric, the exact same political posturing that I have heard for the  last month. It doesn't give the American people any reason to think the  GOP's priorities are going to focus on them.   Let's just look at what we were able to do as Democrats, without a  single Republican vote, in the Inflation Reduction Act: true cost  savings that went and started to go into effect this past month.   We delivered a historic victory for seniors. We capped out-of-pocket  drug costs at $2,000 a year. We limited insulin copays to $35 a month.  We empowered Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and we punished drug  companies for predatory price hikes.   Once again, every single Republican in the House voted against  lowering seniors' pharmacy bills, lowering these costs for our  Americans.   A Republican Member even asked, How are we going to undo that when we  get into the majority?   Here we are, the House Republicans' campaign platform took direct aim  at this historic legislation.   So we can vote on sham bills. We can look at what the D.C. City  Council is doing; that is up to the majority to set that agenda.   Our agenda is going to remain on lowering costs for Americans; that  the issues they talk around their kitchen tables and worry about are  the issues we are going to remain focused on.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the majority leader, will you commit to  defending these cost savings, these true victories for our seniors?    Mr. Speaker, I have to say, I am  disappointed. It seemed like a simple question: Would you support the  cap on insulin at $35 a month when one in four Americans with diabetes  didn't take their medication because they simply couldn't afford it?   If the gentleman wants to talk about Social Security, though, I  welcome that discussion. Speaker McCarthy was just at the White House  yesterday talking with the President, who underlined the urgency of  responsibly raising the debt ceiling, something that Republicans did  three times under President Trump.   However, the majority seems more than ready to hold our economy  hostage, to risk a global recession, to risk the full faith and credit  of the United States, to gut those very programs, Social Security and  Medicare, and to put more money in the pockets of the rich. They are  using this debt ceiling as a smokescreen.   Let's get the facts straight. This is not about new spending. This is  about money we already owe. If we want to go back to a place where  Donald Trump really excelled, it was in driving up the deficit: $8  trillion in 4 years under the Trump administration. That is a quarter  of our entire debt ceiling. Again, when Donald Trump was in office  spiking our debt ceiling, the debt ceiling was raised three times  without fanfare.   Who benefits from that borrowing?   The rich, the very rich, and the ultrarich.   If we don't raise this debt ceiling, who do you think is going to  take over those payments?   Apparently you think it should be our seniors on Medicare and Social  Security, families who are looking for affordable housing, our  veterans, our children, our planet.   You don't have to take it from me. The majority has made their  position perfectly clear.   One Republican Member said the debt ceiling is an obvious leverage  point.   Another said the focus of budget cuts has got to be on entitlements.   The Republican chair of the Budget Committee has called for  eligibility reforms to Social Security and Medicare.   The Republican Study Committee has openly proposed raising the  retirement age to 70, handing Social Security accounts over to Wall  Street, transitioning Medicare to a voucher system.    All the while, when they actually are taking action, we are back to  the rich, the very rich, and the super rich.   First bill passed, adding to the deficit so that billionaires and the  very wealthy can avoid paying the taxes that we ask our teachers, our  firefighters, our nurses, to pay.   What is waiting on the agenda is a proposal to do away with the IRS.  Let's do away with income tax and go to a system of a 30 percent sales  tax?   This would be devastating to families at home who are trying to put  food on their table, a roof over their head, and have a basic quality  of life.   I ask the majority leader: Do you agree with your colleagues or will  you join Democrats and keep our seniors and everyday Americans off the  chopping block?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader,  but I have to disagree.   I think the majority is well aware that there is a big difference  between our responsibilities around the debt ceiling and spending  discussions. What we have seen being brought together, by all the  quotes from Republicans, laying out that this is their leverage point,  to cut spending for the basics for the American people. Those are your  words, not the words of Democrats or President Biden.   I would completely disagree with this idea that maintaining our full  faith and credit for things that we have already agreed on is a blank  check. That is not something that benefits President Biden. That is  basic fiscal responsibility.   What we have here is a case of hostage-taking, the willingness to  risk global economic destruction, to put the full faith and credit of  the United States in jeopardy, to be able to reduce investments we have  made in the American people.   What is it you would like to reduce?   There is nothing we hear. When we point out the majority's own words,  that it is entitlements we are coming after, now we are saying that is  not our goal.   But let's look at what happened under our last Republican  administration. Donald Trump tacked nearly $8 trillion onto our  deficit. If that had not occurred, we would not even be at our debt  ceiling right now; that would be coming in several years. And $8  trillion on that deficit is a quarter of everything we owe.   When that was occurring, when the spending was going to the very  wealthiest of Americans, when my colleagues were last in the majority  and Donald Trump would sign their bills, there was no mention of the  debt ceiling.   But now that we need to protect our seniors, those who are hungry in  our communities, those who are still struggling to find health  insurance, those who are needing to access security in their  communities, to find affordable housing, the investments that we are  making in fighting climate change, building resiliency, and protecting  our planet, when those things that don't affect the very wealthy and  privileged, those are the things we are willing to put on the chopping  block and use the full faith and credit of the United States as  leverage?                                time  1315    That is a disservice to the American people and it is the reason we  are seeing polls like I previously cited.   The American people see they are not a part of the Republican agenda.  This is about stunts and it is about building the economy that works  only for the very wealthy in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the Republican majority leader look  beyond the constituencies of the very wealthy. I hope that you will  find in your agenda, in the coming weeks, room for our seniors, room  for our families, room for joining us in putting people over politics  and making sure that we are working; continuing the work that we  started in rebuilding our infrastructure and making an investment in  jobs.   We have created over a million jobs in the infrastructure bill every  single year for the next 10 years. Those projects are going to be  rolling out across this country. We have seen it already with the  President's trip to Cincinnati to make sure that we are not only  rebuilding our roads and bridges and investing in the American people,  but expanding broadband, creating great paying jobs, and creating  opportunity to help the American people.   Sham bills using our full faith and credit, using the debt ceiling to  continue to rig the system for the very wealthiest Americans, that is  not what we are about. I hope that we are going to begin to see an  agenda from the GOP that has a glimmer of the American family reflected  in it.    Mr. Speaker, let's go over the basic  facts here just briefly once again. What the House GOP did fight for in  2017 was a $2 trillion in tax giveaways for our largest corporations  and for the wealthy because that is who they work for; the rich, the  very rich, and the super rich.   Under the Trump administration, we had record job loss of 3 million  jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, the numbers are there, $8  trillion in deficit under the Trump administration; a direct  correlation to a tax policy that only benefits the very wealthy.   I thank the gentleman for joining me today and look forward to many  more conversations to come. In the meantime, our caucus is thrilled to  welcome the President back to this Chamber on Tuesday for his State of  the Union Address.   We hope the majority will draw some inspiration and work with us in  service of the people who sent us here. Let's put people over politics;  put them back on the table here in Congress.
