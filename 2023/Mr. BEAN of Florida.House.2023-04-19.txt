 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chair Foxx for yielding  time.   Mr. Chairman, should the Jacksonville Jaguars play against a peewee  football team? That would be ridiculous.   Should the minor league Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp play against a  Little League team? That would be crazy. Should men compete against  women in sports? Of course not. In each example, it is just not fair.   The truth is, males have a lasting and lifelong athletic advantage-- most notably, 36 percent more muscle mass, which allows for greater  speed and force that cannot be erased with pharmaceuticals or hormone  treatments.   Sadly, every time a male takes a lane in the pool, a spot on the  field, or at the starting line, a female athlete loses the opportunity  to compete.   Every time a male athlete is named a female All-American, a female  athlete loses that honor. We are in a battle for the very survival of  women's sports.   America, we hear you. Not everybody has gone off the deep end. Today,  House Republicans will pass H.R. 734, the Protection of Women and Girls  in Sports Act, to ban men from competing in women's sports.
