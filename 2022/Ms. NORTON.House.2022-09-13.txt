[[Page H7751]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5315, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5315, the Drone Infrastructure  Inspection Grant Act, legislation sponsored by Mr. Stanton of Arizona  and Mr. Graves from Louisiana.   In recent years, small unmanned systems, also known as drones, have  been valuable assets in the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the  Nation's critical infrastructure. Drones have many uses, from surveying  transmission lines and inspecting bridges, to assessing damage from  natural disasters. As this aviation technology continues to evolve,  State and local governments should have the opportunity to leverage  these systems to help identify and address the growing infrastructure  needs across the country.   H.R. 5315 establishes a drone infrastructure inspection grant program  and a drone education and workforce training grant program at the U.S.  Department of Transportation to help increase efficiency, reduce costs,  improve worker safety, and reduce carbon emissions related to critical  infrastructure projects.   Specifically, the bill authorizes competitive Department of  Transportation grants for State, Tribal, and local governments to  purchase, lease, contract for services, or support the operational  management of small drones to perform certain infrastructure projects.  H.R. 5315 ensures that these Federal funds can only be used for small  drone technology manufactured or assembled by a U.S. company, includes  safeguards for related labor agreements, and prioritizes projects  conducted in historically disadvantaged communities.   In order to help equip the future U.S. transportation workforce with  the skills necessary to capitalize on drone technology and compete  globally, H.R. 5315 also invests Federal funding in drone workforce  training and education programs at universities and community colleges.  This program will be particularly beneficial as the U.S. aviation  sector works to achieve a workforce that better reflects the diversity  of the country as a whole.   H.R. 5315 has the support of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle  and the endorsement of several key organizations representing the U.S.  aviation and aerospace sector, and State, Tribal, and local  governments.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from these  organizations.                                                  September 8, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority Leader       McCarthy and Minority Whip Scalise: We write in strong       support of H.R. 5315, the bipartisan Drone Infrastructure       Inspection Grant (DIIG) Act, and respectfully request that       the bill be added to the House floor schedule. The DIIG Act       addresses the urgent critical infrastructure inspection       backlog our nation faces today, while also investing in the       drone workforce of tomorrow.        The bill's purpose is twofold. First, it would authorize       the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to provide       competitive grants to state, tribal, and local governments to       use secure small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to perform       critical infrastructure inspections. Drones provide states       with a safe and cost effective way to identify and repair       critical infrastructure problems in early stages, saving       money, time, and preventing needless consumer and worker       injuries and death.        Second, the bill would invest in our nation's future       workforce by authorizing USDOT competitive grants for       workforce training and education at institutions of higher       education, including community colleges. This would position       current and future workers to capitalize on the fast-growing       drone economy, and help to cultivate a diverse workforce. To       date, over 90 institutions have been approved by the Federal       Aviation Administration as VAS-Collegiate Training Initiative       Schools. This bill would nurture a dynamic workforce--ready       to adapt to the technological advancements of the future.        The DIIG Act passed out of the House Transportation and       Infrastructure Committee by a bipartisan vote of 54-4 on       April 28th. We hope you join us in supporting the DIIG Act by       adding it to the House floor schedule as soon as possible.       Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,        National League of Cities (NLC), National Conference of       State Legislatures (NCSL), National Association of Counties       (NACo), National Association of State Aviation Officials       (NASAO), American Association of State Highway and       Transportation Officials, Association of Uncrewed Vehicle       Systems International (AUVSI), Commercial Drone Alliance       (CDA).

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 884) to direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish  a national aviation preparedness plan for communicable disease  outbreaks, and for other purposes, as amended.

(2) Covered communicable disease.--The term ``covered       communicable disease'' means a communicable disease that has       the potential to cause a future epidemic or pandemic of       infectious disease that would constitute a public health       emergency of international concern as declared, after the       date of enactment of this Act, by the Secretary of Health and       Human Services under section 319  [[Page H7753]]       of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 884, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Aviation Preparedness  Plan Act of 2022, legislation sponsored by the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Larsen).   If there is one lesson of the coronavirus pandemic, it is that we  were not prepared for a pandemic and must be prepared for the next one.   While a number of mitigation efforts were eventually implemented in  aviation, they should not have taken almost a year to put in place. In  fact, in 2015, the Government Accountability Office issued a  recommendation to develop a national aviation preparedness plan for  communicable disease outbreaks.   The Government Accountability Office has since found that had the  Department of Transportation implemented such a plan, it ``could have  improved coordination between public health and aviation sectors during  COVID-19 to address issues like passenger screening.''   H.R. 884 seeks to resolve this oversight by requiring the Department  of Transportation, in collaboration with the Department of Health and  Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, to develop a  national aviation preparedness plan.   That plan, at a minimum, would lay out the responsibilities of  airports, airlines, and government entities in responding to future  pandemics, improve coordination among stakeholders, and identify  appropriate equipment to protect frontline aviation employees, among  other things.   This means we could establish the necessary procedures and  methodologies to combat pandemics prior to their onset and eliminate  the confusion surrounding who should take action.   Fortunately, we have come a long way since the start of the pandemic.  Vaccines are widely available, daily COVID hospitalizations and death  rates have decreased, and air travel is returning to prepandemic  levels.   But we could have done better. This bill, which received overwhelming  bipartisan support in committee, will ensure the lessons learned from  the current pandemic are not forgotten during the next one.   For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5774) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act to ensure that unmet needs after a major  disaster are met, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5774         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended by       adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 431. UNMET NEEDS ASSISTANCE.         ``(a) In General.--After the declaration of a major       disaster, the President may direct the Administrator of the       Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide to the State,       subject to amounts made available from appropriations,       assistance necessary for meeting unmet needs as a result of       such disaster.        ``(b) Funding.--        ``(1) Amount of funding.--Subject to appropriations and not       later than 30 days after a declaration is made under section       401, the President acting through the Administrator may       allocate an amount that equals up to 10 percent of the       estimated aggregate amount of the grants to be made pursuant       to sections 406 and 408 for the major disaster in order to       provide technical and financial assistance under this section       and such set aside shall be deemed to be related to       activities carried out pursuant to major disasters under this       Act.        ``(2) Estimated aggregate amount.--Not later than 180 days       after each major disaster declaration pursuant to this Act,       the estimated aggregate amount of grants for purposes of       paragraph (1) shall be determined by the President and such       estimated amount need not be reduced, increased, or changed       due to variations in estimates.        ``(3) No reduction in amounts.--The amount set aside       pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not reduce the amounts       otherwise made available for sections 403, 404, 406, 407,       408, 410, 416, and 428 under this Act.        ``(c) Unmet Needs.--Financial assistance provided under       this section may be used to provide assistance, in addition       to other amounts made available under this Act, for the       following unmet needs:        ``(1) Disaster-related home repair and rebuilding       assistance to families for permanent housing purposes,       including in conjunction with eligible expenditures under       section 408.        ``(2) Disaster-related unmet needs of families who are       unable to obtain adequate assistance from other sources.        ``(3) Other services that alleviate human suffering and       promote the well-being of disaster victims.        ``(4) Economic and business activities (including food and       agriculture) after a disaster to implement post-disaster       economic recovery measures, including planning and technical       assistance for long-term economic recovery plans,       infrastructure improvements, business or infrastructure       financing, market or industry research, and other activities       authorized under a comprehensive economic development       strategy.        ``(d) Accounting and Fiscal Controls.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after receipt of       funds and every 6 months thereafter until all such funds are       expended, a State shall submit a report to the Administrator       that includes--        ``(A) the criteria established for determining how the       funds are spent;  [[Page H7754]]         ``(B) the allocation of those funds; and        ``(C) the process for public notice and comment.        ``(2) Compliance.--Any individual who receives assistance       pursuant to this section shall comply with section 312(b).        ``(3) Administrative costs.--A State that receives funds       under this section may expend not more than 5 percent of the       amount of such funds for the administrative costs of       providing financial assistance to individuals and households       in the State.''.

SEC. 5. DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS.         Section 312(b)(4) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5155(b)(4)) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) Limitation on use of income criteria.--In carrying       out subparagraph (A), the President may not impose additional       income criteria on a potential grant recipient who has       accepted a qualified disaster loan in determining eligibility       for duplications of benefit relief.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5774, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5774, the Expediting Disaster Recovery  Act, legislation introduced by Mr. Graves of Louisiana.   This legislation is designed to expedite the delivery of Federal  disaster assistance and address the unpaid, unmet needs of disaster  survivors.   The authorizations in this bill allow the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to estimate the total cost of disaster recovery and  provide States up to 10 percent of this estimate when a major disaster  is declared.   States would be able to use these funds to administer a broad range  of recovery solutions not covered by FEMA's individual assistance  program. Such activities could include home repair and support for  business activities.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1468) to amend title 40, United States Code, to eliminate  the leasing authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1468         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securities and Exchange       Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act''.       SEC. 2. LEASING OF SPACE FOR SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE                     COMMISSION.         (a) In General.--Section 3304 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Leasing of Space for Securities and Exchange       Commission.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on       and after the date of enactment of this subsection, the       Securities and Exchange Commission may not lease general       purpose office space. The Administrator may lease such space       for the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 585       and this chapter.''.        (b) Limitation on Statutory Construction.--The amendment       made by subsection (a) may not be construed to invalidate or       otherwise affect a lease entered into by the Securities and       Exchange Commission before the date of enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. INDEPENDENT LEASING AUTHORITIES.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, the Committee       on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report on the review described in subsection       (b).        (b) Review.--The Comptroller General shall complete a       review under which the Comptroller General shall update the       2016 report of the Comptroller General (GAO-16-648) with a       specific focus on the following:        (1) Updating the information included in Appendix II:       Federal Entities That Reported Having Independent Leasing       Authority for Domestic Offices and Warehouses of such report.        (2) Determining to what extent Federal entities with       independent leasing authorities have had such authorities       rescinded or amended and the number and amount of office and       warehouse space such entities lease.        (3) Determining to what extent have agencies with       independent leasing authority utilized the General Services       Administration for leasing, including utilization of       delegation of authority.        (4) Identifying progress made on implementing the       recommendations in such report.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1468, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission Real Estate  Leasing Authority Revocation Act, which I introduced, will revoke the  independent real estate leasing authority of the Securities and  Exchange Commission and direct the Government Accountability Office to  update its 2016 report on independent real estate leasing authority in  the Federal Government. While a number of Federal agencies have  independent leasing authority, the SEC has a history of egregious real  estate practices.   In 2005, the SEC disclosed that it had unbudgeted costs of  approximately $48 million for the construction of its headquarters near  Union Station. In  [[Page H7756]]  2007, after moving into the headquarters, the SEC shuffled its  employees to different office space at a cost of over $3 million  without any cost-benefit analysis or justifiable explanation.   In 2010, the SEC conducted a deeply flawed analysis to justify the  need to lease 900,000 square feet and to commit over $500 million over  10 years, overestimating its space needs by over 300 percent. In  addition, the SEC failed to provide complete and accurate information  and prepared a faulty and backdated justification and approval after it  had already signed the lease.   In August 2016, the General Services Administration and the SEC  entered into an occupancy agreement to authorize the GSA to secure a  new 15-year lease. In December 2016, the GSA, with the approval of the  SEC, submitted a prospectus to Congress for approximately 1.3 million  square feet, which Congress approved in 2018. By July 2019, the GSA had  received final bids, resolved all protests, and even selected a final  bidder. A month later, the SEC canceled the occupancy agreement, citing  concerns about the value of the purchase option, which the SEC refused  to document to Congress. The SEC effectively vetoed the entire 3-year  procurement process, despite not having the authority or funding to  exercise the purchase option without the GSA's involvement.   Finally, after much back and forth between the two agencies, the GSA  entered into a lease for a new SEC headquarters in September 2021. The  SEC says it will continue to have the GSA do its leasing in the future,  but the SEC's history of egregious leasing conduct, having squandered  hundreds of millions of dollars, makes this bill necessary.   These public blunders also risk undermining the reputation of the GSA  and the Federal Government among the developers and building owners  that participate in Federal lease procurements and ultimately driving  up the costs of all GSA real estate procurement due to the threat of  uncertainty.   It is time for Congress to return the SEC's leasing authority to the  GSA, the Federal Government's civilian real estate arm. As the SEC has  demonstrated over three decades, it is incredibly inefficient,  wasteful, and redundant to have the SEC involved in real estate  procurements when the GSA exists for that very reason. Like other  Federal agencies, the SEC would continue to have input and involvement  in the real estate decision-making process, but the GSA will have the  ultimate authority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1066) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act to provide flexibility with the cost share for  fire management assistance, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1066         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Wildfire Recovery Act''.       SEC. 2. FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COST SHARE.         (a) In General.--Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:        ``(e) Federal Share.--The Federal share of assistance under       this section shall be not less than 75 percent of the       eligible cost of such assistance.''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall only apply to amounts appropriated on or after the date       of enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. RULEMAKING.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the President, acting through the Administrator of the       Federal Emergency Management Agency, shall conduct and       complete a rulemaking to provide criteria for the       circumstances under which the Administrator may recommend the       President increase the Federal cost share for section 420 of       the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5187). Such criteria shall include       a threshold metric that assesses the financial impact to a       State or local government from responding to a fire for which       fire management assistance is being provided.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1066, as amended.  [[Page H7757]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1066, the Wildfire Recovery  Act, a bill introduced by Mr. Neguse from Colorado. This legislation  will remove some of the financial burdens communities face after  suppressing a wildfire.   Wildfires are causing an unprecedented amount of damage to the  natural and built environment. This bill will require the Federal  Emergency Management Agency to cover at least 75 percent of the costs  to suppress wildfires that qualify for a Fire Management Assistance  Grant. Local officials have said that this fix would allow them to  speed up the recovery process and invest more money in mitigation  efforts.   Rural communities that typically receive this type of grant  assistance will benefit most from this legislation. Providing more  Federal assistance in the wake of the worst fires will assist stretched  local budgets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2293) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act to provide certain employment rights to  reservists of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2293         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Civilian Reservist Emergency       Workforce Act of 2021'' or the ``CREW Act''.       SEC. 2. PERSONNEL PERFORMING SERVICE RESPONDING TO                     PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED MAJOR DISASTERS AND                     EMERGENCIES.         Section 306 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and       Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5149) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(d) Personnel Performing Service Responding to Disasters       and Emergencies.--        ``(1) USERRA employment and reemployment rights.--The       protections, rights, benefits, and obligations provided under       chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, shall apply to       intermittent personnel appointed pursuant to subsection       (b)(1) to perform service to the Federal Emergency Management       Agency under sections 401 and 501 or to train for such       service.        ``(2) Notice of absence from position of employment.--      Preclusion of giving notice of service by necessity of       service under subsection (b)(1) to perform service to the       Federal Emergency Management Agency under sections 401 and       501 or to train for such service shall be considered       preclusion by `military necessity' for purposes of section       4312(b) of title 38, United States Code, pertaining to giving       notice of absence from a position of employment. A       determination of such necessity shall be made by the       Administrator and shall not be subject to review in any       judicial or administrative proceeding.''.       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT                     RIGHTS TO FEMA RESERVISTS.         (a) In General.--Section 4303 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (13), by inserting before ``, and a       period'' the following: ``, a period for which a person is       absent from a position of employment due to an appointment       into service in the Federal Emergency Management Agency as       intermittent personnel under section 306(b)(1) of the Robert       T.

(b) Modification of Exception for Requirement for Members       of Uniformed Services to Provide Notice to Employers to       Obtain Certain Employment and Reemployment Rights.--Section       4312(b) of title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking the second sentence;        (2) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``No notice''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) A determination of military necessity for purposes of       paragraph (1) shall be made--        ``(A) except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C),       pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of       Defense;        ``(B) for persons performing service to the Federal       Emergency Management Agency under section 327 of the Robert       T.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 2293.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2293, the Civilian Reservist  Emergency Workforce Act of 2021, which extends Uniformed Services  Employment and Reemployment Rights Act protections to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency's reservist workforce.   Reservists assist disaster survivors and first responders on an on- call basis. They are prepared to deploy when disaster strikes and make  up the majority of FEMA's workforce. While reservists are critical to  Federal disaster response, these essential personnel are only paid by  FEMA during deployments and have no protections that prevent them from  losing their full-time jobs when called to a disaster.   FEMA's workforce has been stretched to its limits by increasingly  [[Page H7758]]  frequent and intense disasters, climate change, and the coronavirus  pandemic. A larger reservist workforce is required to meet the current  challenge, but FEMA has reported that it is difficult to retain  reservists and recruit a diverse workforce without being able to offer  them basic protections. FEMA Administrator Deanna Criswell has stated  that the ability to recruit and maintain a skilled reservist workforce  is necessary if the agency is to fulfill its mission of helping people  before, during, and after disasters.   This bill will help FEMA continue to fulfill that mission and ensure  that these brave women and men do not have to worry that they could  lose their livelihoods when they are called by their country to serve.   It is time we give reservists the respect they deserve and provide  them protections. I would like to express my gratitude to reservists  who have answered the call and to those who will do so in the future.   I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4205) to require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to establish a working group relating to best  practices and Federal guidance for animals in emergencies and  disasters, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4205         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Planning for Animal Wellness       Act'' or the ``PAW Act''.       SEC. 2. WORKING GROUP GUIDELINES.

[[Page H7759]]         (g) New Guidance.--Not later than 540 days after the date       of enactment of this Act, if the Administrator, in       consultation with the working group, determines that the best       practices and Federal guidance described in subsection (d)(2)       are insufficient, the Administrator, in consultation with the       working group, shall publish updated Federal guidance.        (h) Sunset.--        (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the working       group shall terminate on the date that is 4 years after the       date of enactment of this Act.        (2) Extension.--The Administrator may extend the date       described in paragraph (1) if the Administrator determines an       extension is appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4205.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4205, the Planning for Animal  Wellness Act. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up  the companion bill, H.R. 7789, introduced by Representative Titus  earlier this summer.   This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to  establish a working group of experts to review and, if necessary,  update its guidance for addressing the needs of animals and pets  before, during, and after disasters.   Animals are among the most vulnerable when disaster strikes. Like  people, they may be displaced or require evacuation and sheltering.  However, disaster shelters are often unable or unwilling to accommodate  animals. Pets are beloved members of the family, and owners should not  have to choose between abandoning their animals and getting to safety.  When individuals are forced to make this terrible decision, they often  refuse to evacuate before a natural disaster.   This bill will remove barriers to ensure animal welfare is properly  considered in emergency planning so that all members of the family-- human and pet--are safe during disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues as well to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 442) to amend title 40, United States Code, to require the  Administrator of General Services to procure the most lifecycle cost  effective and energy efficient lighting products and to issue guidance  on the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of those products, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 442         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bulb Replacement Improving       Government with High-efficiency Technology Act'' or the       ``BRIGHT Act''.       SEC. 2. GUIDANCE.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Administrator of General Services shall--        (1) issue guidance to Federal agencies for the procurement       and use of the most life-cycle cost effective and energy       efficient lighting systems (as determined in accordance with       section 3313 of title 40, United States Code) to increase the       efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the Federal       Government; and        (2) publish on the internet or otherwise make available to       State, local, and Tribal entities information on ways to       improve efficiency, effectiveness, and economy by procuring       and using the most life-cycle cost effective and energy       efficient lighting systems (as determined in accordance with       section 3313 of title 40, United States Code).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 442.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 442, the BRIGHT Act. The  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee marked up the companion  bill, H.R. 7636, introduced by Representative Titus, earlier this  summer.   This legislation encourages the General Services Administration to  use the most up-to-date and efficient lighting for all routine  maintenance, alterations, and construction and gives GSA the  flexibility to choose the most efficient option for each installation.   Additionally, this bill asks that GSA provide guidance to Federal  agencies and State, local, and Tribal entities on how cost-effective  and energy-efficient lighting systems can help achieve broader  efficiency goals.                                time  1545    While the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 did include  guidelines for energy-efficient light bulb utilization, GSA managers  are not incentivized to choose the most energy and cost-efficient  options in procurements.   By directing GSA to acquire and use the most cost-and energy- efficient lighting systems practicable over the life cycles of the  systems, this legislation aims to maximize resource conservation and  use of taxpayer dollars in all GSA lighting procurements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5952) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 123 East Main Street, in Vergas, Minnesota, as the  ``Jon Glawe Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5952         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JON GLAWE POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 123 East Main Street, in Vergas,       Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``Jon Glawe       Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jon Glawe Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5952, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located in Vergas,  Minnesota, as the ``Jon Glawe Post Office.''   Jon Glawe was born on January 9, 1949, in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.  He grew up on a farm near Vergas and graduated from Perham High School  in 1967. After graduating, he moved to California and went to Ventura  Community College for 2 years, obtaining his associate's degree.   In 1970, Mr. Glawe was drafted into the U.S. Army and was a sergeant  in the 3rd Armored Division station in Frankfurt, Germany. After being  honorably discharged in March of 1972, he married his high school  sweetheart, Darla Olson, in June of 1973.   As a kid, during snowstorms, Mr. Glawe would ride along with his  brothers and dad, who was the rural mail carrier in Vergas, to help  shovel snow every time their vehicle stopped or became stuck along the  mail route.   He officially began his career with the U.S. Postal Service in  Minneapolis in 1975. After the passing of his father, he added a second  full-time job, taking over the rural mail route delivering mail for  Vergas and the surrounding areas for 36 years, until his retirement in  2011.   Mr. Glawe became well-known and revered by many on his route and  served as a lifeline for many in the community. Through Minnesota's  harshest winter storms, he was known to not only deliver mail, but  would often bring medicine, food, and other goods to those in need.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Jon Glawe by  supporting H.R. 5952.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has no further speakers, I  am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Florida has no further  speakers, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5952, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H7773]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5650) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 16605 East Avenue of the Fountains in Fountain  Hills, Arizona, as the ``Dr. C.T.

Wright Post Office Building.''   Dr. C.T. Wright was raised in a family of sharecroppers as a native  of Social Circle, Georgia. He went on to graduate from Fort Valley  University before earning his master of science from Clark Atlanta  University and his Ph.D from Boston University.   He was a teacher and administrator, devoting much of his time to  education and working for many historically Black colleges and  universities, including Morris Brown College and Talladega College.

For the last 21 years of his life, he lived in Arizona, serving as a  community leader. He was chair of the Arizona Board of Clemency,  president of the Fountain Hills Kiwanis Club, and president of the  Arizona African Society. In addition, Dr. Wright served as a delegate  for the Electoral College and met six Presidents.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Dr. C.T.

He then went on to attend the University of Houston Law School  and was admitted to the State Bar of Texas in 1967.   From 1963 to 1969, Mayor Scarcella served in the Texas National Guard  with Active Duty in the United States Air Force, where he attained the  rank of sergeant.   He was first elected as mayor of the city of Stafford in 1969 and was  the longest continuous-serving mayor in the United States.   During his tenure as mayor, he fought for 6 years to create and  implement the Stafford Municipal School District, the only breakaway  school district in the Nation to gain the approval of the Federal  courts and the only municipal school district within the State of  Texas.   In addition, Mayor Scarcella initiated the Stafford Municipal  Educational Television Station to bring vital, current, and informative  programming about the city to citizens and businesses via cable and  internet video streaming.   As well as serving as mayor, he held various positions, such as  president of the board of directors of the Fort Bend County Industrial  Development Corporation, chair of the Home Rule Charter Commission, and  president of the Stafford Economic Development Corporation.
