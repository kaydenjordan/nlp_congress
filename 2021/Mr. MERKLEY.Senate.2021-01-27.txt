 Mr. President, when we have a new administration, lots  of changes take place--changes in offices, changes in committee  assignments--but for all of us here in the Senate, perhaps the most  challenging change is when members of our team decide to open new  chapters in their lives. We celebrate those new chapters and wish them  well, but we will also miss them greatly.   I come to the floor to talk about three of my team members who are  headed to a new chapter in each of their lives.   Scott Maguire has been a central part of our team since day one. He  is my good friend, a valued team member who is preparing a new chapter  in his life in the form of a well-deserved retirement.   As of yesterday, January 26, he completed 12 years on our U.S. Senate  team as our State operations director. The Boy Scouts of America that  have a motto: ``Be prepared.'' They also have a slogan: ``Do a good  turn daily.'' These are attributes that I always have held dear, and  they are qualities I looked for when setting out to build a team to  serve the people of Oregon when I was elected to the Senate in 2008.   Scott was at the top of my list because I knew that these were  qualities that define who he is. I knew this because I have known Scott  for a very long time. We met through Boy Scout Troop 634 back when we  were 11 or 12 years old. We recognized and respected each other's  leadership skills, and I admired Scott's growth in character and  capabilities as he advanced to the rank of Eagle Scout.   When we were 15, Scott and I were dissatisfied with how the district  council was running their annual First Aid Meets, so we proposed to the  council executive that we take over and run the weekend event. To our  surprise, the staff of the council agreed.  [[Page S170]]    I think the resulting weekend event, which included dozens of troops,  hundreds of Scouts, was a tremendous success. It was the type of mutual  project that has bonded us over our lifetimes.   Scott did many things in his career before joining my team. He served  as operations director of the Northwest Christian Evangelistic  Association; as executive director of the Oregon Lions Sight & Hearing  Foundation; as a reporter and editor of the Gresham Outlook.   He got involved in many volunteer roles, including with the Gresham  Breakfast Lions Club, the Gresham Early Risers Kiwanis Club, and he has  volunteered millions of hours just so much to serve the Civil Air  Patrol and is now a lieutenant colonel in the Civil Air Patrol.   Looking back to 2009, I can't imagine how we would have gotten our  Oregon team off the ground or built the operation we have today without  Scott Maguire.   Over the years, he has kept the computers computing and the supplies  supplied, but he has done so much more. He pioneered and built our  Oregon internship program, which has been a pipeline for hundreds of  Oregonians who have been going on to do great things serving in State  and national government, in community organizations, and in business to  make that intern program the best possible.   Scott cultivated strong relationships with Oregon's colleges, and he  could work with them. He was always on the search to give young  Oregonians with a passion for public service the opportunity for public  service. He cared deeply about their experience and success throughout  their time in our office but in the time beyond as well.   Scott stepped in to serve as my field representative for a number of  Oregon counties, organizing the townhalls they hold in those counties  every year to hear from our constituents. He has not only helped to  plan in organizing these events but saved them from going off the rails  as unexpected challenges arose.   Back in 2017, when we were debating the future of the Affordable Care  Act, we knew that citizens were passionate and angry, so we anticipated  a large turnout, planning for 1,000 attendees--twice what was ever seen  before. And imagine our shock when 4,000 Oregonians showed up.  Constituents were packed in like sardines. Hundreds crowded into a  courtyard outside watching through the windows, but there was Scott  swooping in to save the day.   He reworked the sound system. He opened the windows. He figured out  how to put speakers outside the windows so everyone could hear and  participate. Crisis averted. That was just another day for Scott,  working behind the scenes and taking care of things that most people  don't even know were going wrong to ensure things were running  smoothly.   Last year, before the pandemic shut down so much of our lives and our  offices went remote, we saw massive shortages on essentials like hand  sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and tissues. But Scott, seeing the  crisis developing, raced around the metro area to gather supplies to  keep the members of our team healthy and safe. That is who Scott  Maguire is: the kind of person who goes above and beyond for everyone  in every situation; the kind of person who is prepared and always goes  out of his way to do a good turn daily for others; the kind of person  who, regardless of who you are, treats you like a VIP.   I speak for all members of Team Merkley, for all the interns who have  come through our office, for all the folks Scott has worked with over  the years, when I say that he will be deeply missed, and it will not be  the same without him.   We wish our dear friend Scott Maguire and his wonderful wife Beth all  the best as they begin a new chapter of their lives together.   I picture Scott, who has had a business, Shorty's BBQ, catering  barbecue, Texas style, during his years in Oregon--you will probably  see him firing that grill up a lot more often in the years ahead. It  will be a chapter undoubtedly filled with loving friends, family, great  traveling adventures, and, of course, as much barbecue as they can  possibly handle.   We will miss you, Scott Maguire.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have two other team members who are  leaving.   Laura Updegrove is leaving us to work with the Biden administration.  She came to us after serving in various foreign policy roles at the  State Department, the Department of Defense, and the White House. She  joined our team 4 years ago to bring her extensive expertise to bear on  our foreign policy portfolio, and I am sure glad she did.   During her tenure in my office, I have been astonished, time and  again, by the depth and breadth of her knowledge, her work ethic, her  strong organizational and management skills, and the way she approaches  each and every task with a very positive attitude. Those traits make  her not only a top-notch legislative staffer but a terrific partner as  we work to address a variety of issues.   On two occasions, we had the chance to travel on international  issues--one trip to many different countries in Africa to better  understand the root causes and impacts of the four famines on that  continent and to understand how American policy could be changed to  assist in these desperately difficult situations.   Then, some years ago, we had the genocide carried out against the  Rohingya people in Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi came and spoke to the United  Nations, and she said: We have nothing to hide. Come and see for  yourselves. So Laura went to work in organizing the congressional  response, the congressional trip. We really thought we were going to  see exactly what had gone on in those villages, and she worked  incredibly hard to arrange everything from boats to helicopters to get  us to the right places. Then, the day before we left, Burma denied us  the ability to see those villages.   We had backup plan after backup plan to explore what had happened  both in Burma and the conditions at the refugee camps in Bangladesh.  She reworked everything in a short period of time to direct attention  by our congressional delegation and through our delegation to the world  to the traumatized, difficult circumstances of a community that was the  subject of genocide by Burma. Again, the whole goal was to figure out  how the United States could do more to help. Laura really understood  and cared about and helped with the plight of people in some of the  most difficult circumstances around the world.   The same passion and dedication and strategic thinking that Laura  dedicated as a policy staffer are also what have made her an  outstanding legislative director for the past 2 years. She has not only  continued to lead our efforts on critical issues from rules reform to  social justice but has been a daily example of the power of teamwork  and mentorship to other staffers.   Her departure is a big loss for Team Merkley but a really big win for  the Biden administration, particularly the State Department, where she  will be able to utilize her enormous talents on behalf of our country  and on behalf of our country's building a better world.   Laura, we wish you all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, our third team member who is leaving is  Ben Ward.   I think of Ben as our appropriations wizard. He knows that system  inside out, and he is the master of Tribal issues and natural resources  issues and so much more. He is heading off to serve as the Office of  Management and Budget's Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs. I think  the whole world noticed his extraordinary talents, and we are looking  forward to continuing to work with him as we strive to make the  appropriations efforts as effective as possible.   I think that virtually no one in Oregon has gone untouched by the  work that Ben has done over the past 5 years. He has worked to get  piping money to Central Oregon to assist the farmers. The farmers not  only get more water, but more water gets left in the Deschutes River.   He has worked very hard to advance the improvement of Native fishing  sites, treaty fishing sites, on the Columbia River and the preparations  to  [[Page S171]]  rebuild communities that were wiped out by the building of dams some 70  years ago that have never been properly addressed. He has proceeded to  help the Klamath Tribes secure the funds to improve the habitats for  their sacred c'waam and koptu fish and to improve the whole, entire  water ecosystem in the Klamath Basin for all of the stakeholders.   When we had a big problem with sea lions that were blocking the fish  ladders and blocking the mouths of streams and tributaries, he  concocted probably more than a dozen plans to try to find one that  could move through this legislative process and address the challenge,  and he succeeded.   He helped get funding so that we could have more people fighting  fires on the frontlines, and he helped to get funding so we could thin  the forests and treat the forests so that they would be less likely to  burn in the first place.   He helped us get money for the coastal ports so they could be drudged  and so they would continue to operate appropriately and safely for the  economy of the coastal ports.   He helped us make sure we got help for the diverse agricultural  research stations in Oregon and for the mass timber project that is  developing whole new categories of engineered wood products that can  build buildings that are 14 stories high out of wood rather than  concrete and steel, utilizing our incredible supply of amazing wood in  the Pacific Northwest. He also assisted our universities in getting  funding for all kinds of programs.   The list is almost inexhaustible, but I think we all understand the  point. He is incredibly talented at seeing opportunities and is  incredibly persistent in seizing those opportunities. That is Ben's way  of getting things done. That is why he has been so valued, and that is  why we will greatly miss him.   Ben, we wish you all the best as you work on behalf of the Biden  administration and the larger OMB process in coordination with the U.S.  Senate.   To each of these team members, I say that, once you are a member of  Team Merkley, you are never not a member. You will always be part of  our family. We so much appreciate what you have contributed to the team  and what you have contributed to building a better world.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
