 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on my Republican  colleagues to stop playing ideological games and to do the job that  they were sent here to do.   As our country teeters on the brink of an economic catastrophe, they  rushed out of town and abandoned their responsibilities just like they  want the United States to abandon our fiscal responsibilities.   House Republicans have made their message clear: Their needs come  before the needs of hardworking families, seniors, children, students,  and veterans. They are willing to hold our economy hostage and are  willing to risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans with  devastating cuts to vital programs that keep folks housed, fed,  healthy, and secure.   However, Democrats are united. We stand ready to pass a clean debt  ceiling and to do what is best for our country and the American people.                            ____________________
