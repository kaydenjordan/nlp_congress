 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the holiday and in objection to the  means by which the Democrats have brought this to the floor.   It is just wrong that this holiday, which should be recognized-- arguments against it are vacuous. A CBO score is not real because it  doesn't recognize the productivity of Americans during a holiday week  in anticipation of a holiday and increased productivity after the  holiday, and it doesn't recognize the positive impact of the economy by  those who celebrate the holiday, and the money they spend.   So, the CBO score is not an argument. We support the holiday. But why  would the Democrats want to politicize this by co-opting the name of  our sacred holiday of Independence Day. Why would it not be named the  Juneteenth National Emancipation Day? Why would we want to inject  conflict about this?   I don't understand this body and the way it moves forward contrary to  the best interests of the American people. We all support the holiday.  I am voting in support of the bill, but the objection--and my Democrat  friends know this--the objection would be to the naming of the bill.   Where would that have been confronted? In committee. But this bill  was not brought to committee, was it? It was brought directly to the  floor for a vote, a trap set by my Democratic colleagues for  conservatives on this side of the aisle who they knew would object to  the naming of this bill and the co-opting of our Independence Day. They  did not bring it through committee where we could have this  conversation legitimately and for the historical record.   Everyone on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, we have  jurisdiction over national holidays. We would have wanted to speak on  this. We would have wanted to offer amendments. Did that happen? No.  Were our amendments accepted? No, because this was brought directly to  the floor.   That is what is wrong with this body. That is what is wrong about  this bizarre realm of Washington, D.C.   Despite that, we are going to support the bill. I am going to support  the bill because I support the holiday, and I support the Black  communities. My Black brothers and sisters, Americans all, have been  celebrating this holiday for 100 years. What is wrong with that? It is  recognized by most States in the Union. This legislation just brings  the Federal Government more in alignment with the sovereign States,  which as a constitutionalist, I certainly support.   Mr. Speaker, I object for the historical record since there was no  committee activity. I object on the floor this day to the process that  Democrats used to bring this bill to the floor and the name by which it  is entitled.    Mr. Speaker, my ancestral forefather  traveled to this country 200 years ago or so. He was born a poor  Irishman with no path toward prosperity that did not lead through  oppressive government, indentured servitude.   He arrived in the port of New Orleans after scrapping together enough  money to book passage on a sailing vessel that had been converted from  carrying cargo to carrying human beings. He survived the journey,  although many poor Irishmen did not.  [[Page H2883]]    He came to this land seeking freedom. He found it. He prospered. And  through the generations the Higgins family established itself as a  solid, working-class American family. Construction workers, firemen,  police officers, soldiers, and sailors.   After my father passed, my mother and her sister, my Aunt Gloria,  took it upon themselves to research the family tree. They discovered  some of the truths that I am sharing with you tonight. This was way  before the Internet and computers and iPhones. They worked in the  actual archives.   One of the things they discovered was a letter written by my  ancestral forefather describing the conditions on a vessel he traveled  to America upon. His sleeping berth measured 2 by 2 by 5. 2 by 2 by 5.  I think about that as I serve within this body.   I recognize the pain that our ancestral forefathers and foremothers  endured to carve this country of greatness from the wilderness. There  has never been a moment when American patriots claimed that our Nation  was perfect. We have always known that we are imperfect men driven by  perfect intent to create a nation where a man could breathe free, and  indeed we have.   The sovereignty of America requires action from this body and from  this executive, our current executive, to maintain the security and  sovereignty of our Nation at the southern border. The very promise of  America is threatened by the policies and weakness of action and  refusal to act in response to 1.1 million criminal crossings year to  date.                                time  2110    The very freedoms and opportunities that our ancestral forefathers  and foremothers came to this country to embrace, the blood and life and  limb that has been sacrificed by generations of patriots past have  preserved America.   America itself is imperiled from within. It is the duty and the sworn  oath of Members of this body to ring our voices loud and clear across  the land that we will not allow America to fall into decline. We will  not become judicious managers of our Nation's fall. We will stand and  we will fight; we will make noise and we will be heard.   I thank my colleague for allowing us to gather this evening and speak  on behalf of the citizens that we serve, the Nation that we love, and  the future that we will not allow to demise.
