 Madam Speaker, last Wednesday, on my third day, I  realized that I can make hard and seemingly unpopular decisions. Voting  to strip electoral college votes from States is a dangerous precedent  set by Democrats many years ago and perpetuated by my party as well. I  heard nothing in those debates that justified such a high bar.   A rushed impeachment will set a similar precedent. Without a single  hearing or investigation, I simply cannot reach the high bar of  impeachment.   To my district, I commit to constantly being objective in all of my  decision-making.   And, as I abandon the remainder of my remarks, as I listen to this  debate, it is no wonder our Nation is divided. We are on an absolute  race to the bottom. I was hoping that last week we could have hit rock  bottom.  [[Page H179]]    I commit to doing better, and I hope that we all can dig in and find  a way.
