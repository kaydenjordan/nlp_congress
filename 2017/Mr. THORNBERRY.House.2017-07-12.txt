 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 2810.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during  consideration of H.R. 2810, pursuant to House Resolution 431, amendment  No. 88 printed in part B of House Report 115-212 may be considered out  of sequence.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to bring before the House H.R. 2810, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. It was  reported favorably by the House Armed Services Committee at 11:59 p.m.  on June 28, 2017, by a vote of 60-1. Now, that vote is an indication of  the bipartisan support that exists to support our troops and to fulfill  our obligations placed on us by the Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, I think it is always helpful for us to remind ourselves  of the authority by which we undertake our responsibilities. Article I,  Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress has the power and the  responsibility ``to raise and support Armies. . . . To provide and  maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of  land and naval Forces,'' and, of course, ``To make all Laws which shall  be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing  Powers.''   The members of our committee and our staff take those  responsibilities very seriously. This year, we seek to carry them out  in a world which is as dangerous and complex as any of us have ever  seen. One example from the news of the day is the alarming progress  North Korea is making towards having an intercontinental ballistic  missile that can carry nuclear weapons to our homeland.    Now, we have, of course, a number of tools to use, including  diplomacy and sanctions, but there is no substitute for military power,  and I believe we must develop and deploy more of it to be ready to deal  with these growing threats.   So the bill before us today substantially increases money for missile  defense so we are more capable of protecting our homeland against those  ballistic missiles. It also increases funding for key munitions and for  intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance so we can have better  visibility on what adversary is doing.   It increases the end strength for the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force, just as they requested. And it funds more joint exercises with  key allies in the Pacific. It boosts our shipbuilding budget to get  more ships into the water faster, and also cheaper.   So, just as an example, Mr. Chairman, each of those items is  important for dealing with this growing threat coming from North Korea,  and we could sit here and go through a similar sort of discussion when  it comes to Iran, or the provocative actions of Russia and China, or  the terrorist organizations of various shades.   Of course, we cannot guarantee that the capabilities that we will  vote on in this bill will be available by the time the crisis comes  for, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, we are still dealing with defense  budgets that were cut by more than 20 percent at a time when the  threats around the world were growing. So we can't guarantee that these  capabilities will be available when we need them.   But what we can guarantee is, if we don't fund these things now, they  will not be available when we need them, so that is the priority given  to this bill.   Mr. Chairman, exactly 1 month ago, on June 12, Secretary Mattis and  Chairman Dunford testified before our committee. And I would like to  read just one paragraph of the Secretary's testimony where he was  comparing what the military was like when he left it and when he came  back as Secretary.   Secretary Mattis testified: ``Four years later, I returned to the  Department and I have been shocked by what I have seen with our  readiness to fight. For all the heartache caused by the loss of our  troops during these wars, no enemy in the field has done more harm to  the readiness of our military than sequestration. We have sustained our  ability to meet America's commitments abroad because our troops have  stoically shouldered a much greater burden.''   Four years later, shocked, more harm by sequestration than the  enemies in the field, and it is only because our folks are so  incredible that they have born an increasing burden. That is what the  Secretary testified.   Mr. Chairman, we have, indisputably, the finest military in the  world, but it is also indisputable that it has been severely damaged by  continuing resolutions, by sequestration, and by failure of the  executive and legislative branches to adequately support the men and  women out there on the front lines. We have an urgent need to begin to  repair and rebuild our military.   And I also believe, Mr. Chairman, it is fundamentally wrong to send  men and women out on dangerous missions without providing them the best  equipment, in the best shape, with the best training that our country  can possibly provide. This bill, if followed by matching appropriation,  takes a significant step toward meeting that objective, to support  those troops.   It also makes major reforms in the way the Pentagon does business.  Among other reforms, it enables the military to buy commercial products  through online sites such as Amazon, Staples, and Grainger. We require  life cycle maintenance costs to be considered at the beginning of a  program, as must intellectual property rights, to maximize competition  in the maintenance and repairs. Oversight into service contracts has  increased, and there is much more, of course, in the bill.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is the vehicle by which we usually, for 55  years, at least, fulfill our responsibilities under the Constitution  that I mentioned, to provide for the common defense. I believe that is  the first job of the Federal Government.   I want to just express my appreciation to each of the members of our  committee. Each of them has contributed to the product before us. Each  of them takes their responsibilities under the Constitution very  seriously; no one more so than the Ranking Member, Mr.  [[Page H5535]]  Smith of Washington. We don't always agree on the judgment calls about  issues, but I have no doubt that he and all the members of the  committee try to do what is right for the country and put the interests  of our troops first.   That is exactly the attitude that we must follow, I think, on the  floor over the next 3 days as we go through the amendments which we  will consider.   I also want to express appreciation to the committee and personal  staff who have worked on this bill.   It has been a challenging year for a variety of reasons, but, as I  started, I will finish. I am proud of this product. I hope it will gain  the support of the entire House.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), chairman of the  Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Turner), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and  Land Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the chair of our Subcommittee on  Strategic Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to make  two points.   Number one, President Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009.  The first national security strategy he submitted was in May of 2010, a  year-and-a-half later. So I don't think it is completely unreasonable  that we haven't yet gotten the national security strategy from the new  administration.   Secondly, the pay raise for the troops is based on the statutory  formula which is related to the cost of living. That is where it comes  from. And it seems to me to say, no, you don't really get what the  formula says you deserve, is not appropriate.   Now, the administration did not request it, and the criticism from  some is that we should not provide it. I think if the formula is wrong,  we should change it, but if the formula says that is how much the cost  of living has gone up, we should provide it.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), the chair of the Subcommittee on  Personnel.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) who is the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik) who is the distinguished chair  of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) who is a valued member of the  committee and a retired Air Force General.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Knight) who is another very valuable  member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), a valuable member of our committee who continues  to serve our Nation in the Reserves.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, as usual, the gentleman from Washington makes a number  of good points.   We absolutely need to have national security based on a strategy and  fund that strategy. There are many of us who would argue that is not  what has happened in recent years.   I would just point out it was not only President Obama, but also  President Bush and President Clinton. None of them provided a national  security strategy in the first year that they were in office. I have  tremendous confidence in Secretary Mattis, among others on the national  security team. I believe they are looking at these issues and will  provide us with a strategy.   The gentleman is also absolutely correct when he points out that the  Defense Authorization bill is only one step in the process. There are  many more steps to come.   I think we will have a budget on this floor to vote on shortly. I  also expect that we are going to have appropriations to vote on at some  point in the coming weeks. I also believe that we are going to have the  opportunity to vote on dealing with the sequestration caps, which, by  the way, the administration and I think most of us in the House and I  presume most in the other body as well are in favor of doing away with  because they have not been successful in accomplishing the goal for  which they were put in place.   So there are clearly many more debates to have on other days. What we  have this week on the floor before us is the Defense Authorization  bill. And it is our obligation to authorize the things that the  military needs.   I want to go back to the point that Mr. Banks made a few minutes ago.  These are life-and-death decisions. Our hearts break, our prayers go  out to the families of the 15 marines and the one sailor who lost their  lives Monday of this week in the plane crash in Mississippi, just as  our hearts go out and our prayers continue for the family members of  the seven sailors who lost their lives off of Japan a few weeks ago.   What it reminds us is exactly what Mr. Banks said: this is a  dangerous business, even on training mission, even on routine  deployments. The men and women who volunteer to serve our country to  protect us and to secure our freedoms deserve the very best our country  can provide them. That is the goal of this bill: support the men and  women who serve us and to further the national security of the United  States.   You have heard from both sides of the aisle about many good things  that are in this bill. We are going to go through a lot of amendments  over the next several days. But at the end of the day, the point is,  even with the good, the bad, and the ugly that gets put in this bill,  to support the men and women who serve by voting ``yes,'' and I hope my  colleagues will do that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask that the following exchange of  letters be included in the Record on H.R. 2810:           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of                                                    Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, July 5, 2017.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thornberry: I write concerning H.R. 2810, the       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, as       amended. There are certain provisions in the legislation that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure.        However, in order to expedite this legislation for floor       consideration, the Committee will forgo action on this bill.       This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding       that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice       the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or       to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within       the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the       Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference       committee named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 2810 and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                          Committee on Armed Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, July 5, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2018. I agree that the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure has valid jurisdictional claims to certain       provisions in this important legislation, and I am most       appreciative of your decision not to request a referral in       the interest of expediting consideration of the bill. I agree       that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure is not waiving its       jurisdiction. Further, this exchange of letters will be       included in the committee report on the bill.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.                                   ____                                                                             House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, June 30, 2017.      Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Thornberry: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 2810, the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This legislation       contains subject matter within the jurisdiction of the       Veterans' Affairs Committee. However, in order to expedite       floor consideration of this important legislation, the       committee waives consideration of the bill.        The Veterans' Affairs Committee takes this action only with       the understanding that the committee's jurisdictional       interests over this and similar legislation are in no way       diminished or altered.        The committee also reserves the right to seek appointment       to any House-Senate conference on this legislation and       requests your support if such a request is made. Finally, I       would appreciate your including this letter in the       Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 2810 on the       House Floor. Thank you for your attention to these matters.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman.                                   ____                                            Committee on Armed Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, July 5, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2018. I agree that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has       valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this       important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your       decision not to request a referral in the interest of       expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by       foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Veterans'       Affairs is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this       exchange of letters will be included in the committee report       on the bill.            Sincerely,                                     William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is a manager's amendment that contains technical  and conforming edits to the bill. I do not know of any controversy.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Turner), chair of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land  Forces.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. I am concerned about a growing  notion that we can thank servicemembers for their service but then  somehow not provide them everything they need to do their job, that we  can continue to allow them to have airplanes that don't fly, ships that  can't sail, not having the readiness they need to prepare for the  missions we send them on. As the gentleman from Ohio said, that hurts  people, and, unfortunately, that is what has happened in recent years.   Mr. Chairman, defense spending this year is still 18 percent below  what it was in 2010. So what has happened is we have cut the defense  budget while the threats that we send our military out to keep us safe  from have grown. And remember, 2010 was before Russia invaded Crimea,  before China started building islands in the South China Sea, before  ISIS even existed.   This budget that is before us does not fix all our problems. It is a  start, and I think it is about as much as we can do in a single year.  But even if this bill passes, we are not up to 2010 levels; we have not  made up the ground that we have lost.   I believe that the men and women who serve deserve our best. This  bill, I believe, comes close to providing our best to them this year.  It should be supported, and this amendment should be rejected.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, in some ways, I think this may be one of the most  important debates we have in the next 3 days because the question is  whether our support for the men and women who serve in the military is  conditional or not. Will we only repair the planes they fly, will we  only fix the ships they sail if, and only if, exactly an equal amount  will be added to domestic spending programs.                                time  2100    Will we only provide for military spouses for their needs? Will we  only take care of wounded warriors for their increased needs if, and  only if, an exact amount, the exact dollar for dollar, is added to  domestic programs?   That holds the military hostage to a domestic political agenda, and I  think that is fundamentally wrong at every level. These men and women  go out and risk their lives to keep us safe, yet they not only have to  worry about North Korea up on the DMZ, they not only have to worry  about ISIS in Syria, they have to worry about whether we will pass some  domestic program if we are going to adequately provide for them.   The Constitution says it is Congress' responsibility to provide for  the military without condition. This sort of approach, saying, ``We  will only do this for the military if, and only if, we get what we want  on domestic programs'' breaks faith with the men and women who serve.  It is wrong at every level.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I think all of us care about domestic spending  programs. I certainly do. And I am not for the cuts that were proposed  by the administration. That is what we are here to do and decide.   What I am opposed to is the sense of Congress that every dollar we  increase in defense has to be matched by an increased dollar on the  domestic side. That makes it conditional. That makes it tied to a  domestic political agenda on the EPA, the IRS, education,  transportation, whatever it is.   My point is that all of those things need to stand on their own  merits. Defense needs to stand on its own merits, support for our  military needs to stand on its own merits, having planes that fly and  ships that sail and adequate funding for our troops and their families  stand on their own merits.   It cannot be conditional upon whether or not this Congress or this  President agrees on other spending items. They need to stand on their  own two feet, too. But it is absolutely wrong to say we will only  support these military folks if we get what we want on the domestic  side.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais), a valuable member of our  committee.  [[Page H5726]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en  bloc amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the en bloc  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I  offer a second package of amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I have no requests for time, and I  simply urge adoption of this package of en bloc amendments.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to address the topics that the  gentleman from Washington addressed.   First off, I completely agree with him. This bill that we are  considering today, tomorrow, and the next day is about 1,000 pages. I  don't agree with it all. It has everything from missile defense to  helping spouses pay licenses when they are forced to move from State to  State, and I suspect I will not agree with it all at the end of the  day.   What is important, though, is the overriding obligation we have to  support the men and women who risk their lives to protect us. So, I  think the gentleman is exactly right. Just because you vote for the  bill does not mean you endorse everything in it. And at the same time,  even if you disagree with some of the things in it, it is important to  support the men and women who serve by voting for the bill, even if you  have disagreements. I completely concur with the gentleman on that.   When it comes to the nuclear issue, there are a few points I want to  make that maybe were not made during the previous debates.   Number one is we have drastically fewer nuclear weapons now than we  had during the Cold War. I think a lot of people do not realize how  significantly fewer weapons and delivery systems we have now than we  had all during the fifties, sixties, seventies, and into the eighties.   But these are still machines. They do not live forever. Whether you  are talking about the weapon itself or the delivery systems, they age;  and, as they age, there are chemical reactions, parts wear out, and  things change. So they have to be modernized if our deterrent is to  remain credible.   Now, you can get into an argument about, okay, how many weapons does  it take to be credible and what delivery systems are required to  penetrate defenses, to hold enough targets at risk, to have that  credible defense, but what I think there can be little debate about is  that the world is growing more dangerous in the nuclear field. We have  seen what happened with North Korea. There is enormous concern about  what happens in the Middle East and elsewhere.   I believe that our nuclear deterrent is the foundation upon which the  rest of our defense efforts are built, and that foundation must remain  credible. It has to be rebuilt. My understanding is the estimates are  at no point will rebuilding that entire nuclear deterrent require more  than 7 percent of any year's defense budget, 7 percent for the  foundation and 93 percent for the House that is built on it.   It is essential that we maintain that credible deterrent, and it has  got to be big enough to be credible so that a country like China does  not think they can build a few more weapons and get to parity with the  United States.   On the subject of BRAC, I do disagree with the gentleman from  Washington on this point. Two years ago, I specifically asked that we  have included in the bill that was signed into law a requirement that  the Pentagon provide us with an updated cost estimate on excess  infrastructure.   What we have all been citing is a 2004 estimate that there is about  20 percent excess infrastructure. Twenty-two percent is the number that  is often used. What we got back was seven pages of nothing.   By the way, that was not prohibited by the bill. It was required by  the bill.   What I am interested in is a real updated, data-driven study that  shows whether we have excess infrastructure and of what sort. And I  think that is exactly what Secretary Mattis said. Let me quote his  exact sentence:         I am not comfortable right now that we have a full 20-some       percent excess infrastructure. I need to go back through and       look at this again because I don't want to get rid of       something that we can't sustain and then say we have got to       go buy some land here in 10 years.    I think that is what we need is an updated study. And if it shows  that we have got excess infrastructure, I am not at all opposed to  having another round of BRAC. I am very opposed to having another round  like 2005, which, I believe, it is either CBO or GAO, I can't remember  which, says has not yet broken even 12 years later. It still costs more  money than it has, and it has not started to save yet. So I don't want  a repeat of that.   I am interested if it shows that we do have excess infrastructure and  a way to deal with that. Secretary Mattis, I believe, shares that view,  but until we see the data, I am not supportive of another round.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the point. I am not  convinced that the gentleman and I really differ on this point.   What the bill says, now, is: ``Nothing in this act shall be construed  to authorize an additional base alignment and closure round.'' That is  what it says. It says we don't authorize it, of course. It does not  prohibit a study to say whether we ought to. Again, I would welcome a  real data-driven study that will help us reach that conclusion.   Mr. Chairman, this is just further evidence that there is a wide  range of issues and discussions to have on this bill, all for that  purpose of supporting the men and women who serve our Nation.   I support en bloc package No. 2. I urge my colleagues to, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I  offer a third package of amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support en bloc  package No. 3, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I  offer a fourth package of amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment  No. 76 printed in part B of House Report 115-212 be modified by the  form I have placed at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I support en bloc package No. 4, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Thornberry) having assumed the chair, Mr. McClintock, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
