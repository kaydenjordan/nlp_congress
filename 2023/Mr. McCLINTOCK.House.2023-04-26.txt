 Mr. Speaker, for the first time in my 15 years in  Congress, I will vote for a debt limit increase because for the first  time we have a bill that is serious about controlling the reckless  spending that is destroying America's productivity and its prosperity-- $4.8 trillion in savings.   How could anyone who cares about the debt not vote for this measure?   The debt limit is there for a reason. If your family is living beyond  its means and needs to raise its credit limit, it better sit down  around the kitchen table and have a serious discussion over the  circumstances that have gotten it into this mess and what steps it  needs to take to get out. The debt limit is there to assure that we  have exactly that discussion as a Nation.   Now, the President and the Democrats across the aisle say they are  not willing to engage in that discussion. Well, to coin a phrase,  ``Come on, man.''   When Bill Clinton lost the House in 1994, he reached across the aisle  to work with House Republicans. Together, a Democratic President and a  Republican House accomplished wonderful things. They reformed the  welfare system, as this bill does; they cut spending as a percentage of  GDP; they produced the biggest capital gains tax cut in history; but  most importantly, they balanced four budgets in a row and produced one  of the greatest economic expansions in our Nation's history.   By the way, Clinton was reelected.   Americans are soon going to ask themselves, are we better off than we  were 4 years ago?   Mr. Biden is going to need a better answer than doubling down on  policies that two-thirds of Americans are desperately trying to tell  him have put our country on the wrong track, and that answer is right  here before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I beg the Democrats to join us to set our Nation's  finances in order.
