 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Rodgers, my classmate and a  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding. It is an  amazing thing to be with you here today, and it is an amazing thing to  be here today to talk about this important bill.   As the lead Republican cosponsor of the House companion to S. 578, I  rise in support of the FASTER Act.   Millions of Americans suffer from life-threatening food allergies.  More than 1.5 million Americans are allergic to sesame, in particular,  yet there is no current requirement to include the ingredient on  product labels. This legislation would declare it the ninth major  allergen to be recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and  update laws to require the labeling of sesame.   This bill would also require the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to regularly review promising food allergy treatments and  research. This is a major bipartisan priority. These efforts will help  slow this rapidly growing disease and ultimately find and fund a cure.   Finally, the FASTER Act establishes a scientific process and  framework for establishing additional allergens covered by the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.   I am proud to serve as cofounder and co-chair of the newly formed  Congressional Food Allergy Research Caucus, along with Congresswoman  Doris Matsui. We recognize there is more we can do to help those 32  million Americans, including many who are children who suffer from food  allergies.   We can and we should do more to increase funding into research,  therapies, and treatments for food allergies. Sending this legislation  to the President's desk would be a major first step to achieving our  goal of improving treatment opportunities.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on  this bill.
