 I thank Mr. Johnson.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers for the leadership that he provided  the committee for so many years. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and  Congressman Graves for working in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense. It calls on the  government to bring transparency to the major rules.   Once an agency finalizes a major rule, that is the end of it. They  are not required to review the benefits or the economic impacts. This  amendment, however, holds the agency accountable by requiring that it  look back and assess the costs and benefits of that rule after it has  taken effect. Should the cost of the regulation exceed the proposed  costs under the rule, then, under this amendment, this agency will  report back the increase to the Congress. This amendment would  facilitate a dialogue between the agency and the stakeholders. If the  costs have gone up, then the agency must open up a comment period to  hear the stakeholders and consider possible modifications or  alternatives to reduce the cost and increase the benefits. We do that  in Congress. Every time we pass a piece of legislation, we go back and  fine tune the legislation, and I think we need to do the same thing  here.   Again, we must not allow regulations to run out of control. We should  hold agencies accountable. This amendment will bring transparency and  begin those conversations between stakeholders and the agencies.   Again, I thank Congressman Graves for this bipartisan amendment.   Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the gentleman  from Texas, with whom I worked closely in developing this amendment,  which was legislation we introduced last year and which had dozens of  bipartisan cosponsors.   In summary, this is an Article I issue. This ensures that when an  agency tells Congress, they tell the American public that when the  regulation is going to cost a certain amount to comply with, they are  held accountable to that. This is about accountability. This is about  transparency.   My friend from Georgia mentioned that this was ``busywork.'' Mr.  Chairman, I want you to think about that for a minute.   This applies to major rules that are estimated to cost in excess of  $100 million to comply with, and they find it offensive that we ask  them to look back one time every 5 years for rules that cost American  families over $100 million to comply with every single year?   I am offended by that, and I am sure that millions and millions of  American families are offended by that as well.   It is all summarized by this, Mr. Chairman: since 2009, for the first  time in recorded history, we have had a net loss in small businesses in  the United States. Regulations are hidden taxes that impact our  businesses, that impact our employment opportunities, and that drive  jobs to other countries.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is that my  friends on the other side of the aisle, in their quest to satisfy the  big businesses that fund these campaigns, don't like regulations that  protect the health, safety, and well-being of Americans, including  children, including the elderly, the weak, the sick. They are trying to  get rid of the Affordable Care Act; trying to kill those regulations;  trying to kill regulations on Dodd-Frank, which is protecting people  from financial ruin by Wall Street barons.   This is an incessant march toward a deregulatory environment. We  can't let it continue unabated. We must protest. We must speak out. We  must do the right thing to protect the people of this  [[Page H354]]  country. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Chabot). The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).   The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Young of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 33, line 10, strike ``agencies and'' and insert       ``agencies,''.        Page 33, line 11, insert after ``easy to understand,'' the       following: ``and issues guidance in a manner sufficient to       provide at least 90 days for affected entities to take steps       to comply with such guidance,''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa.   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his help  and leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to make an already very good  bill even better. Regulators regulate. That is what they do. Regulators  regulate businesses, large and small, State and local governments,  nonprofits, individuals, et cetera. These regulated entities often rely  on guidance from agencies to become compliant with a new rule or  regulation; but, occasionally, this guidance is offered far too late in  the process, leaving entities with the decision to either move forward  without guidance and face possible penalties, litigation, losses, or to  wait until guidance is offered and then scramble to implement changes  before the deadline, increasing the likelihood for mistakes and  failure.   My amendment seeks to ensure guidance is offered and available in a  timely manner by instructing agencies to the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs to issue guidance at least 90 days before a rule or  a regulation goes into effect so that affected entities have time to  comply.   As an example, companies recently experienced the hardships of late  guidance from HHS through CMS. There is a company in Iowa and similar  companies from around America that produce forms, using post acute  healthcare reimbursements, including skilled nursing and home care,  both of which receive funding through Medicare.   CMS is responsible for setting rules for the reimbursement forms.  Okay. Fine. CMS specified a new set of rules for forms going into  effect at the beginning of the year. Okay. Great. This company and  other companies waited for CMS guidance before printing and sending  reimbursement forms to its customers, and this company waited and  waited and waited; but 3 weeks before the effective date, this company  and others like it hadn't heard anything from CMS on guidance or  directions--crickets.                                time  1615    So at this point, they had to make a business decision. That is the  reality. Either wait for CMS and fail to have the required forms to its  customers in time for the new year or send the forms to print, cross  your fingers, say a prayer, roll the dice, and hope they will later be  found in compliance.   They sent the forms to print knowing full well they would eat the  cost if the forms did not comply. Losses, penalties, litigation, a  soiled reputation--those are the real things the lack of guidance and  notice causes. Thankfully, everything worked out in this situation, but  in other situations, things haven't worked out. A few days after they  sent the forms to print, CMS finally approved.   However, this situation illustrates a broader problem that occurs too  often transcending in other instances through the economy and needs to  be addressed. We need to make sure that when we give agencies the power  to effectively write law, we ensure compliance guidelines are clear- cut, timely, and enforcement is fair.   Allowing the regulatory process to continue as is and agencies to  issue needed guidance at the last minute, we only further burden  Americans in their organizations, businesses, these individuals in our  districts.   So I want to be clear what the amendment does not do. This amendment  does not change a rule or regulation in any way. It does not direct the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to do or speak to anything  else other than the timeliness issue I just described. It is pretty  plain language. My amendment says, when guidance is forthcoming, it  arrives in a timely manner.   Mr. Chairman, it is past time for Congress to rein in and approve  this process so our constituents aren't left with uncertainty, wringing  their hands waiting for Washington, and can, instead, get to work.  Let's get this fixed right now, Mr. Chairman.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the underlying  bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The gentleman is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend Mr. Young's  amendment which establishes a 90-day compliance period for guidance  documents when, in the underlying legislation, it makes clear that  during any compliance period for guidance it is nonbinding. So I rise  in opposition to this amendment which imposes an unnecessary and  burdensome 90-day waiting period for agencies to issue guidance  documents.   Importantly, as a form of nonlegislative rule, guidance documents do  not have the force of law and are not subject to the Administrative  Procedure Act's notice and comment requirements. Section 104 of H.R. 5  already clarifies that these documents are not legally binding and may  not be relied upon by an agency as legal grounds for agency action.   This provision additionally requires agencies to make this document  available to the public and provide a plain and prominent statement  that the document is not legally binding. Given the requirements that  already exist in current law and the additional requirements imposed by  title I of this bill, it is difficult to ascertain why an additional  90-day compliance period for guidance that is not legally binding is  warranted.   Furthermore, in all cases, regulated entities have ample opportunity  to challenge rules, including guidance, as ``arbitrary or capricious''  under the Administrative Procedure Act where an agency lacks statutory  authority to issue the guidance or the guidance is otherwise legally  unsound.   Indeed, as Justice Elena Kagan noted in 2015 in Paralyzed Veterans v.  Mortgage Bankers, the APA contains a variety of constraints on agency  decisionmaking, the arbitrary and capricious standard being among the  most notable.   Accordingly, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman.
