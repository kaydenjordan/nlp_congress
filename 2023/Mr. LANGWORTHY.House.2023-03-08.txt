 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, which  provides consideration for three important pieces of legislation to  restore trust and certainty for millions of Americans.   Specifically, I will highlight H.J. Res. 27, which would provide for  congressional disapproval of the Biden administration's overreaching  new Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule that threatens the  livelihoods and survival of our Nation's farmers and rural communities.   The Biden EPA's new reinterpretation of WOTUS is a complete rejection  of the Clean Water Act's decades-long, broadly accepted jurisdiction.  The new rule gives the Federal Government sweeping authority over  private lands and unleashes the Federal regulatory machine on private  property owners, over bodies of water as small as ditches, low spots,  and ephemeral drainages. And God forbid, if a farmer is perceived to  have violated the EPA's vague new WOTUS regulatory framework, they  could find themselves tangled in years of expensive litigation and red  tape threatening their very survival as an operation.   Now, my district in western New York, in the Southern Tier, has over  800 dairy operations. These are generational farms with deep roots in  our surrounding communities. My farmers, as in the case with farmers  across this country, are deeply worried about how the Biden EPA's new  WOTUS rule will impact the long-term survival of their operations.   Our farmers should be focused on production and growing and  maintaining their operations, not hiring outside, expensive consultants  to help them navigate a maze of new burdensome government regulations.  They shouldn't be worried about whether farming a certain part of their  land will lead to thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of  dollars in penalties, enough to put these family farms out of business.  But under the Biden administration, sadly, this is just considered the  cost of doing business.   Now, some might say I am speaking in hyperbole. But we have seen this  play out before in 2015. We saw what an overly broad interpretation of  WOTUS meant to our farmers, many of whom suffered devastating fines  from an overzealous Obama-era EPA for having the audacity to manage and  farm their own private lands.   So the question before us with this resolution isn't how to best  regulate a pond versus a stream or a low spot. It isn't how far we  should turn the dial up on regulation, forward or backward, so as to  not inflict too much pain on rural America. It is a question of whether  we stand for the long-term survival of American agriculture and  domestic food security or whether we are willing to regulate the  American farmer out of business and out of existence.   Congress has a duty to review and oppose this radical interpretation  of WOTUS. I strongly support the rule, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.                                time  1300
