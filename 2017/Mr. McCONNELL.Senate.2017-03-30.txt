 Mr. President, I would like to begin this morning by  paying tribute to a fallen hero. Yesterday, Officer Nick Rodman of the  Louisville Metro Police Department passed away after a crash in west  Louisville on Tuesday night.   Officer Rodman had served in the department for 3 years, where he  followed in a strong family tradition of law enforcement. In his life,  he showed compassion and dedication, which are among the best virtues  of public service.   According to LMPD Chief Steve Conrad, Officer Rodman is the second  officer in the department's history to be killed in the line of duty.   Officer Rodman's tragic death reminds us of the tremendous debt of  gratitude we owe to all of the courageous men and women like him who  daily put themselves into harm's way to defend our communities. They  deserve our utmost respect.   This morning, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in expressing our  deepest sympathy to Officer Rodman's family, friends, and fellow  officers. They will all be in our prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, the  Senate will soon act to prevent workers from being forced into risky  government-run savings plans. Then we will turn our attention to an  additional opportunity to protect the American people from Executive  overreach with another resolution under the Congressional Review Act.   On its way out the door, the Obama administration issued a regulation  that prohibited States from allocating certain health preventative-care  funds in a way that best serves local communities. It substituted  Washington's judgment for the needs of real people, controlling  Americans' access to healthcare services while hurting the community  health centers that so many Americans--especially women--depend upon.  This regulation is an unnecessary restriction on States that know their  residents' own needs a lot better than the Federal Government.   Fortunately, by sending the CRA resolution before us to the  President's desk, we can once again return power back to the people,  and we will do so without decreasing funding for women's healthcare by  a single penny.   I would like to recognize my colleague, Senator Joni Ernst, who  introduced the Senate companion to the House resolution we will vote  on, for her leadership on this important issue. I look forward to  supporting it later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, many Members came to the floor  yesterday to debate the Gorsuch nomination. We will have all of next  week to continue the debate. I encourage my colleagues to continue  discussing this important nomination.   Two months ago today, before Neil Gorsuch had even been nominated, I  spoke on the Senate floor about the rhetoric we could expect to hear  from the other side after the President's nominee was announced.  [[Page S2120]]    I predicted then that we would see many on the left ``[try] to paint  whomever is actually nominated in apocalyptic terms.'' It ``doesn't  matter who this Republican President nominates,'' I said then. It  ``doesn't matter who any Republican President nominates, really,'' I  continued. No matter the nominee, I said back before we had the  nominee, ``we can expect to hear a lot of end-times rhetoric from the  left . . . [and] [i]n fact, we already have.''   I was alluding then to the fact that, sight unseen, we had already  begun hearing from those on the far left who vowed to oppose anyone-- anyone the President nominated. The Democratic leader even joined in,  saying he would oppose anyone from the President's list of candidates  and would ``fight it tooth-and-nail, as long as we have to'' in order  to keep Justice Scalia's seat open, even for the entirety of the  President's term.   Remember, that was before Judge Gorsuch was even selected, before we  knew his credentials, before we had heard from the current and former  colleagues of his, before we had examined his judicial record, and well  before his hearing before the Judiciary Committee.   Our friends across the aisle made it clear then that their opposition  to this nominee would have nothing to do with the nominee himself. In  fact, I said we could expect to hear a number of convoluted excuses as  to why they wouldn't support the President's yet-to-be named nominee-- excuses that would amount to little more than their dissatisfaction  with the outcome of the election.   Sure enough, that is just what we have seen over the past few weeks.  They are opposing this well-qualified nominee despite his impressive  credentials, bipartisan support, and excellent testimony before the  committee.   Judge Neil Gorsuch is such an outstanding candidate, so  noncontroversial, so well-esteemed by people across the political  spectrum that Democrats have been forced to talk about pretty much  anything: President Trump, think tanks, you name it--anything but the  nominee himself.   Yesterday's comments by the Democratic leader are a good example. He  gave a lengthy speech about why he wouldn't support Judge Gorsuch, but  when you boil it down, his remarks had little to do with Judge Gorsuch  at all.   Essentially, he concluded that because Judge Gorsuch had earned the  praise of legal groups like the Federalist Society, Democrats should  not support him. By the way, all current sitting Justices have  participated in events with this same organization. Let me say that  again: All current sitting Supreme Court Justices have participated in  Federalist Society activities. That includes Justices who were  nominated by Democratic Presidents, including President Clinton and  President Obama.   So, yes, Judge Gorsuch has received high praise from a number of  conservatives--he certainly has--just as he has earned the support of  centrists and leftists as well.   As I have pointed out on several occasions, many long-time Democrats  you might not expect have even complimented Judge Gorsuch--people like  President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal,  President Obama's legal mentor, Professor Laurence Tribe, President  Carter's district court appointee, Judge John Kane, President Clinton's  appointee to the Tenth Circuit and former chief judge of that court,  Judge Robert Henry, and liberal Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, and  so many more.   Judge Gorsuch has such a proven record of judicial independence and  impartiality that people from the left to the right and everywhere in  between have voiced their confidence in his fitness to serve on the  High Court. That would explain why the American Bar Association--which,  according to the Democratic leader and former Democratic Judiciary  chairman, is the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judges--gave Gorsuch  its highest rating possible: unanimously ``well qualified.''   So let's be clear. The support for Judge Gorsuch is anything but one- sided.   The Democratic leader also noted his concerns yesterday about the  process by which we arrived at this point. As we all know, this Supreme  Court nominee process has been historically transparent. Here is what I  mean. Months and months ago, then-Presidential Candidate Trump took the  unprecedented action of compiling a list of potential nominees he would  consider nominating to the Supreme Court. These potential nominees were  made public for the American people, including every Senator, to  review.   Before making his selection, now-President Trump's White House  consulted on a bipartisan basis with each and every Democrat on the  Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as numerous other Senators. The  President followed through with his pledge, selecting from that public  list Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado, who we can all agree is well  qualified to serve on the Supreme Court and whom the Senate confirmed  to his current position without a single vote in opposition.   Since being nominated, Judge Gorsuch has continued this transparent  process by meeting face-to-face with nearly 80 Senators--from both  parties, obviously.   So you see, this process has been as straightforward and bipartisan  as possible from the very beginning--before we even knew that the  President would, indeed, be making this nomination.   Only in the upside-down world of my Democratic colleagues is telling  the entire world months before one is even elected President the list  of people he would choose from, if he became the President, a  ``secret'' process. I can't think of anything less secret than putting  out that list in the middle of a hotly contested Presidential election  process.   So, look, it is time to move beyond this hollow rhetoric and get back  to the serious business of governing. Confirming Judge Gorsuch would  mark a significant step in that direction. He has proved himself a  worthy successor to the Supreme Court. He has earned high acclaim along  the way from various news publications and lawyers and judges and  clerks who represent all walks of life and all political ideologies.   People like David Frederick, a long-time Democrat and board member of  the left-leaning American Constitution Society, may have summed it up  best in a recent Washington Post op-ed. Here is what he said: ``The  Senate should confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no principled reason  to vote no.''   No principled reason to oppose him, none.   As this American Constitution Society member says, there is not one  single principled reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch, so it makes sense  that Democrats can't come up with a single substantive reason to oppose  him either.   I suggest the absence of a quorum    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 43.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Monday, April 3, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 18, S. 89, with the time until 5:30 p.m.  equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or  yielding back of time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate  vote on passage with no intervening action or debate. I further ask  that following the vote on passage, the Senate proceed to executive  session for consideration of Calendar No. 24, the nomination of Elaine  Duke to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. I further ask that at  a time to be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence of  the Democratic leader, on Tuesday, April 4, the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nomination, and that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 107, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday,  April 3; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:17 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, April 3, 2017, at 3 p.m.
