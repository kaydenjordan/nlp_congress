 Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks tonight about  something Senator Isakson and I have worked diligently on for the last  6 months. Yet, before we adjourn, I do want to echo what he has just  brought to the Senate floor; that being a rounding statement of praise  for a personal friend of his and mine, Woody Woodside.   I am a resident of Glynn County and so have gotten to know him as a  personal friend over the last few years. I will have more to say about  his retirement later this year. Suffice it to say, tonight, Woody  Woodside is one of the greatest people to be able to get things done  with whom I have ever worked, and when he disagrees with you, he does  it in a way in which you actually like him for his disagreement. He is  a bulldog when he gets on something, and I have the highest respect for  what he has been able to accomplish in his career. I will have much  more to say about that in the days to come.  [[Page S2161]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, as an outsider to this political process,  it is easy to be frustrated with how slowly the Senate moves. It is  easy to find fault with colleagues. As an outsider here, it is very  easy to think we are not focused on getting results. I usually try to  temper that with some rational thought about, well, this is the way  things work, et cetera, et cetera, but I didn't see that tonight, and I  am very frustrated with the vote. What we just witnessed on the floor  of the U.S. Senate was nothing but pure partisan politics.   Our colleagues across the aisle blocked our disaster relief bill  because they said it didn't include enough for Puerto Rico. That was  one of several reasons. To date, $40 billion in Federal disaster relief  aid has already been allocated for Puerto Rico, and it is eligible for  another $50 billion-plus, potentially, which has already been  allocated.   How much aid did the farmers in the Southeast receive after Hurricane  Michael just 6 months ago? Not one dime. Now, why is that critical? You  say: Well, OK. It takes time. Yes, it takes time. These farmers lost  their livelihoods, and it hit them at the very time when their harvests  were coming due last fall, October 10. It has been 6 months now. They  have not received a dime from the Federal Government. The State has  moved in with minor help, but these bridge loans these farmers have  been using are running out; therefore, we were hoping this bill tonight  would have given them some direct relief.   Let's put this in perspective.   Congress appropriated $136 billion for 2017's natural disasters  across our country. That was for Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria,  Hurricane Harvey, and the California wildfires--in 2017, $136 billion.  Before then, in 2013, $50.5 billion was appropriated for Hurricane  Sandy, mostly for New Jersey.   In this bill from tonight, we were only talking about $13.45 billion  for unprecedented hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and wildfires  over the last year. Listen to the number of States we were talking  about: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina,  Alaska, Hawaii, California, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas. That  is right. This $13.45 billion included only $3 billion for farmers  across five States in the Southeast.   President Trump visited that damage, and Vice President Pence visited  that damage. I was personally privileged, as was Johnny Isakson, to  travel with him that day to see this damage. You only have to see it to  understand how ravaging this was to the businesses that have been built  up over generations with regard to these family farmers.   President Trump has done his part. He has been very reasonable in  this negotiation. He stepped up and did the right thing with regard to  Puerto Rico. He agreed that because the nutrition benefits were running  out under the prior allocations that we just mentioned, he stepped up  and said, yes, he would support $600 million in further assistance for  Puerto Rico nutrition so that those benefits would not run out and so  that it would, hopefully, in the negotiations, break the logjam.   It did no such thing. This $600 million was exactly what Puerto Rico  needed, and President Trump saw that. I give him high marks for  stepping up and taking the political risk to go ahead and do that in  addition to what had already been done for Puerto Rico over the last 2  years. In fact, Puerto Rico's own Representative in Congress, Jenniffer  Gonzalez-Colon, supports this disaster relief bill that Senator Isakson  and I and others sponsored.   She said:         I urge for the swift Senate passage of $600 million for       nutrition assistance. Over 1.3 million of my constituents are       already experiencing cuts in their food benefits. Puerto Rico       needs this funding and needs it now.    When you listen to pleas like that, I can only think of one word for  our colleagues across the aisle in this episode, and that is that it is  very similar to what has happened on the border. It is hypocritical to  me to think that they asked for that and then voted no against it. What  we see here is pure partisan politics.   The American people are not stupid. It is clear that this had nothing  to do with Puerto Rico and that it really hadn't had much to do with  disaster relief. This vote was really pure partisan politics. It had  everything to do with obstructing this President and preventing him  from keeping his promise of helping the American people recover from  the tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, and floods that have ravaged our  communities.   The Democrats ought to be ashamed. They are holding our farmers  hostage right now for the political gain they foresee in their having  taken this position. It is unacceptable. They are gambling with  people's lives, and I don't overstate that. Some people will not  recover from this. They will get out of farming. For those who stay in,  it will take a decade to recover even with this government assistance,  and many will have to get out of the crops they were growing to just  survive in the next year.   We have farmers in Georgia whom I know personally who are on their  second bridge loan. As an individual businessperson, I have done those  in my career. I know how hard it is to go back after one bridge loan  and ask for an extension or for another bridge loan to get to the point  at which, hopefully, the Federal Government will step in and provide  much needed assistance to back up these bank loans. These farmers are  coming to the end of their ability to do that. I empathize with the  bankers as well. They have a very difficult time giving bridge loans in  addition to what they have already done until they get some degree of  certainty about what it is we in Congress are going to do.   It is unacceptable that this intransigence in Washington continues to  threaten the livelihoods the very people who sent us here to represent  them. Because the Democrats chose to play politics today, farmers  across the Southeast may, indeed, lose their businesses. Puerto Rican  families will not have access to the food benefits they desperately  need. California wildfire victims will not get any Federal assistance  to help rebuild until we get this done. The list goes on.   I challenge each of the Senators in this body who voted against this  disaster relief bill tonight to go down to Georgia, to Florida, or to  South Carolina and look the farmers in the eye and tell them that,  tonight, we chose politics over helping Americans in need. It is a  shameful night in the American Senate.   I thank Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee,  and its ranking member, Senator Leahy. They have worked diligently to  try to find a compromise in here, but it is hard to compromise when  there is only one party playing.   In conclusion, I want farmers across the Southeast to understand that  I, Senator Isakson, Senator Rubio, Senator Scott, and many others-- Senator Tillis, Senator Burr, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Tim Scott  from South Carolina, and even one of the Democrats, Senator Doug  Jones--are all committed, along with Senator Marco Rubio and Senator  Rick Scott of Florida, and are not giving up. This is not the end of  this tale. I want the farmers and the bankers in these five States to  understand we are going to continue this fight.   I thank Leader McConnell for continuing to give us this opportunity.  It took a lot of time to get to this vote on the Senate floor tonight,  and I thank him for that.   For the people of these States who were affected, don't lose heart.  We will get this done eventually.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
