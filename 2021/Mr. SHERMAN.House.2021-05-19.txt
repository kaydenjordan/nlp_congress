 Mr. Speaker, over the last 5 years, we have seen a 40  percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes. Most are lone wolf  property crimes, late at night.   But last night in Los Angeles, we saw something new: organized  violence. A small caravan of SUVs, waving Palestinian flags, drove to a  significantly Jewish neighborhood. Dozens of men, wearing all black,  with faces covered, disembarked at a restaurant, chanting ``death to  the Jews.'' They demanded that diners either answer the question: ``Are  you Jewish?'' And if they answered ``yes'' or they objected to the  question, they were beaten, some sent to the hospital.   Nearby, an Orthodox Jew, dressed distinctively, was chased down by a  caravan waving Palestinian flags. He ran for his life, and thank God,  he found safety.   The Los Angeles Police Department will investigate these hate crimes.  I also ask that those who criticize the Israeli Government to avoid  rhetoric which will infuse these anti-Semites with the view that they  are somehow part of the American mainstream.                            ____________________
