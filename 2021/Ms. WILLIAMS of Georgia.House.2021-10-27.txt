 Will the gentlewoman yield?    Madam Speaker, in Atlanta we are known for  making history and a little bit of good trouble.   As the home of Congressman John Lewis, the home of Hammerin' Hank  Aaron, who was an Atlanta Brave, we are ready to make history once  again and win this World Series, just like we won the first game last  night--and we will be ready with a nice southern soul food dinner.
