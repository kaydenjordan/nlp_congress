 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  3525, and I commend my colleague, Lauren Underwood, for introducing  this important legislation.   When migrants are in U.S. Federal custody, it is our moral  responsibility to ensure they are treated humanely and receive  appropriate medical screenings and care.   Earlier this year, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland  Security, which I chair, appropriated significant additional resources  to CBP to improve medical care and screening.   H.R. 3525 will help ensure this care is standardized across the  Border Patrol by requiring it to formalize the medical screening  process and to come up with innovative approaches to fill medical  screening gaps.   The bill also requires the Border Patrol to have a singular  electronic health record system, accessible to other DHS components, to  ensure continuance of care for migrants.   These are smart, simple steps that can save the lives of migrants who  left tragic situations in their home country to seek refuge in the  United States. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  bill.
