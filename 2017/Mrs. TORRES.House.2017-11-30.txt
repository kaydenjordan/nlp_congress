 Mr. Speaker, this Congress faces a moral decision that  we have put off making for too long, a decision that we cannot put off  any longer: Will we stop the deportation of hundreds of thousands of  young DREAMers or not?   This is not a partisan question. This is a question of who we are as  Americans.   Are we willing to put partisan games aside? Are we willing to put to  an end the fear that DREAMers have, the fear that they have been living  with these past few months?   We are quickly approaching the year-end deadline for many items this  body needs to address. Many of us are looking forward to seeing our  families through the holidays.   What about the 122 DREAMers that lose protection every day that we  don't act? Can they say the same.   This is unconscionable. This is not who we are.   When I am home, I hear from businesses, school leaders, public  officials, religious leaders, and friends, and they all want us to act  now, today. Failure to do so will result in tearing families and  communities apart.   The fix is right here in front of us. H.R. 3440, the Dream Act, is a  bipartisan, bicameral bill that will put this issue at rest once and  for all.   We all know that the votes are here today in this body. Plenty of my  Republican colleagues support this legislation. Plenty of my Republican  colleagues stand with their business, religious, and community leaders  to bring this dream to a reality for the DREAMers.   We have been clear. This Congress must not finish this year without  providing a fix in certainty for DREAMers. Their families and the  communities that depend on them expect that.   I ask my colleagues to allow us to vote and provide a vote against  the previous question so that we can immediately bring the Dream Act to  the floor for a vote today.
