 Madam Speaker, last week, Louisville lost a legend. If  you look up Coach Denny Crum or are a fan of college basketball, you  know that is not hyperbole: 30 years leading the University of  Louisville basketball  [[Page H2334]]  team, 675 wins, two national championships, six Final Fours, and a  stream of conference championships, all Americans, NBA standouts, Hall  of Fame. Legend.   That is on the court. In a town where college basketball is king,  Denny Crum was an absolute rock star. After 600,000 hands shaken,  autographs signed, and pictures snapped, Denny Crum was just as nice as  if you were the first person he ever met. We were all Denny Crum's  friends. Legend.   If you thought Denny was good to new people, you should see what the  guys who knew him forever thought. He was inclusive before it was ever  cool.   Guys going back 50 years still call him coach, mentor, friend.  Everyone from Dr. Dunkenstein to guys you have never heard of got the  same treatment. They were all Denny's guys, Cardinals. Legend, on and  off the court.   Today, we all join Scott and Susan, a city in mourning, and forever a  community grateful for Coach Denny Crum.                            ____________________
