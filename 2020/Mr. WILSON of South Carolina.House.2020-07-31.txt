 Madam Speaker, during these uncertain  times, it is inspiring to see our communities come together to help one  another.   I am thankful to ZVerse in Columbia for their efforts to help our  citizens to be safe and healthy. ZVerse is currently using their  advanced technology to meet the urgent needs to shield healthcare  heroes fighting the Wuhan virus.   Through this effort, ZVerse can produce 1 million engineered ZShields  per week. I am grateful for the success of founder and CEO John  Carrington, with President David Craig; board members Hugh Evans, Wei- Chun Tai, and Scot Wingo; and adviser Tom Kurke in fighting against  this devastating disease.   I look forward to thanking ZVerse during the annual bus tour of the  Second District. I am grateful for the opportunity to recognize the  important work and citizens I represent.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family and friends of Herman Cain from Atlanta.                            ____________________
