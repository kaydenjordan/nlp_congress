 Madam President, Sam Ross is a farmer from  Pioneer, LA, and is recognized as a top producer of the year finalist,  a great honor in the farming community. Ross's family has been farming  for years, and after graduating high school, he got into the trade with  his first 100 acres. Fast-forward to now, and Sam owns over 10,000  acres of crops. His farm is a fourth-generation family-run operation. I  would like to thank Sam and all the other farmers in America for the  great work they do.                            ____________________
