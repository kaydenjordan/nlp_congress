 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  the Banks/Gosar amendment, as a clear threat to a bedrock protection of  the American people of the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Rule  guarantees clean drinking water for 117 million Americans. My  constituents rely on the Clean Water Rule, which protects critical  waterways like the Chesapeake Bay.   By eliminating this rule, we jeopardize the streams, headwaters,  wetlands, and other bodies of water supporting critical wildlife  ecosystems that naturally filter out pollution and provide essential,  clean drinking water to a third of our Nation.   Mr. Chairman, the farm bill should be a tool for protecting  Americans. It must not be used to poison their water. A vote for this  amendment is a vote against clean water, and I urge my colleagues to  oppose it.
