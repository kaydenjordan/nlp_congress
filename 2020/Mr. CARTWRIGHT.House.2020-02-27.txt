 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Appropriations  Committee, I believe we have a duty to spend our resources responsibly.  But we can't make the kind of cuts that hurt American workers, American  seniors, and American middle-class families. As it currently stands,  the administration's proposed budget would recklessly slash funds for  Social Security, for Medicare, and for Medicaid.   The cuts to Medicaid alone over 10 years are nearly $900 billion.  They would seriously jeopardize rural hospitals, combating the opioid  crisis, and seniors' access to long-term care.   Mr. Speaker, did you know that six out of ten seniors in nursing  homes depend on Medicaid?   Last year, Democrats and Republicans in Congress came together to  reach a 2-year budget deal that invests in the American people. We need  to honor that deal over the coming months and reject this current  reckless budget that we just saw come out of the White House.                            ____________________
