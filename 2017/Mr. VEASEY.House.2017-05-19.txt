 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Leighton Durham  IV of Dallas, Texas, as he and his family celebrate his selection as an  Eagle Scout.   The Boy Scouts of America has a long tradition of preparing young men  for leadership, and the Eagle Scout award recognizes the highest rank  within that program. Only 4 percent of Boy Scouts are granted this  recognition, after a lengthy review process which includes the  verification of 21 merit badges, a demonstrated Scout spirit, and a  youth-led service project.   For Leighton, his involvement in the service organization began when  he was only 8 years old. Since then, the Boy Scouts program has helped  foster a sense of service and leadership.   This past year, as part of his Eagle Scout project, Leighton led  efforts to refurbish a previously neglected classroom at the Tyler  Street United Methodist Church in Oak Cliff. As a result of Leighton's  project, the classroom is now in use for middle school youth.   Please join me in congratulating Leighton in his latest achievement.  I look forward to seeing his continued leadership in our community.                            ____________________
