 Mr. President, we are once again in a conversation  about freedom of religion and the free exercise of religion and what  that means. Very simply, I would argue that it means the ability to  have any faith, to have no faith at all, to change your faith, and to  be able to live it out.   The ability to have a faith is a part of who we are. It is our most  precious possession within us. If it is not that, if it is something  less than that, if the free exercise of religion has limitations on it,  then it is simply the freedom to worship or to have a named faith  around you but not to actually live your faith.   That is not what we have in this country, thankfully. We have a  constitutionally protected right to the  [[Page S5907]]  free exercise of religion. We have more than the freedom of worship at  the place of our choosing; we have the ability to live our faith  freely, 7 days a week, in all aspects of our lives.   The question has become, though, are there certain positions in  public life where you cannot have the free exercise of religion; where,  literally, if you are elected or appointed into certain offices, you  lose your constitutional right.   The U.S. Constitution makes that very, very clear. Article VI of the  Constitution says that ``no religious Test shall ever be required as a  Qualification for any Office or public Trust under the United States.''  It should be pretty straightforward and clear.   In our last confirmation hearing, then-Professor Amy Coney Barrett  said, when asked a question about her faith:         Senator, I see no conflict between having a sincerely held       faith and duties as a judge. In fact, we have many judges,       both State and Federal, across the country who have sincerely       held religious views and still impartially and honestly       discharge their obligations as a judge. And were I confirmed       as a judge, I would decide cases according to rule of law,       beginning to end, and in the rare circumstances that might       ever arise--I can't imagine one sitting here now--where I       felt I had some conscientious objection to the law, I would       recuse.    Three years ago, like today, Judge Barrett's faith--not her judicial  philosophy or her temperament--seemed to be front and center. Three  years ago, my colleague from California, Senator Dianne Feinstein, said  this during Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearing:         Why is it that so many of us on this side have this very       uncomfortable feeling that, you know, dogma and law are two       different things, and I think whatever religion is, it has       its own dogma. The law is totally different. And I think in       your case, Professor, when you read your speeches, the       conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within       you.    Senator Durbin from Illinois just asked her a very straightforward  question: ``Do you consider yourself an orthodox Catholic?''   A question like that about the defining of faith and how much of a  Catholic are you or how much dogma lives in you is really a question  of, how much faith do you really practice, do you have a name on you,  or do you practice a little too much faith for my comfort level?   See, the free exercise of religion pertains to an individual's  sincerely held religious beliefs. It is not about the acceptance of  that belief by others. If it were, the free exercise of religion would  be dictated by what others believe rather than what you believe. But in  America--at least the America that I know--individuals are allowed to  have a faith, live their faith, have no faith, or change their faith.   For whatever reason, Judge Amy Coney Barrett is being criticized  because she is Catholic.   There is an AP article that came out just this week that did an in- depth view--it was sent all over the country--about, she is not just  Catholic; she is one of those Catholics. It went into great detail  about how she attends Bible studies and is on a board of a school and  helps educate children and seems to believe that there is a personal  relationship with Jesus, as they quoted in the article, as if that were  some sort of criminal thing and needs to have some suspicion.   It is about her faith that she is being challenged, this  undercurrent. However, Justice Ginsburg was not shy about the fact that  she was Jewish--nor should she have been. We have heard a lot about the  fact that she was the longest serving Jewish Justice and the first  Jewish person to lie in state in the Capitol. Why is it OK for Justice  Ginsburg to talk about her faith and not Judge Barrett? Why is Justice  Ginsburg's faith celebrated and Judge Barrett's faith currently being  demonized? It is because those on the left believe their faith is OK,  but for people on the right, it is suspicious.   Even last night, Vice President Biden introduced himself as an Irish  Catholic. That is celebrated on the left. But for Judge Barrett to  identify herself as a Catholic, she is asked questioningly: Yeah, but  are you one of those orthodox Catholics?   One of the most remembered things about Justice Ginsburg--of many-- was her storied friendship with Justice Scalia. On paper, they would be  the unlikeliest of friends. She was a Jewish liberal. He was a Catholic  conservative. Their differences didn't divide them or offend each  other.   Of their friendship, Judge Barrett said:         Particularly poignant to me was her long--    The ``her'' being Justice Ginsburg--       and deep friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia, my own       mentor. Justices Scalia and Ginsburg disagreed fiercely in       print without rancor in person. Their ability to maintain a       warm and rich friendship despite their differences even       inspired an opera. These two great Americans demonstrated       that arguments, even about matters of great consequence, need       not destroy affection.    There is no question that Justice Ginsburg did a lot for the  advancement of women in this country. Doesn't Judge Barrett also  exemplify that? She is a circuit court judge. She graduated summa cum  laude from Notre Dame Law School, first in her class. She has been a  professor for 15 years at Notre Dame, has clerked for a Supreme Court  Justice, is the mother of seven children, and was three times voted as  the top law professor at Notre Dame.   Thirty-four Supreme Court clerks who worked alongside Barrett--of all  parties--wrote this:         We are Democrats, Republicans, and independents, and we       have diverse points of view on politics, judicial philosophy,       and much else. Yet we all write to support the nomination of       Professor Barrett to be a Circuit Judge on the United States       Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Professor Barrett       is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is       eminently qualified for the job.    All 49 full-time faculty members of Notre Dame Law School--all 49 of  them--signed a letter stating:         [Barrett] possesses in abundance all of the other qualities       that shape extraordinary jurists: discipline, intellect,       wisdom, impeccable temperament, and above all, fundamental       decency and humanity.    Seventy-three law professors across the country, including former  Obama administration Solicitor General Neal Katyal, stated this:         Although we have differing perspectives on the methods and       conclusions in her work, we all agree that Professor       Barrett's contributions to legal scholarship are rigorous,       fair-minded, respectful, and constructive.    So she is criticized tenaciously because of her faith. She is  criticized because she is not woman enough, whatever that may mean. She  has even been criticized this past week and called a ``White  colonizer.'' Two of her seven children were adopted from Haiti. She has  been accused of using her children as props. How low can this go?   This is what Judge Barrett had to say about her family:         The president has asked me to become the ninth justice, and       as it happens I am used to being in a group of nine--my       family. Our family includes me; my husband, Jesse; Emma;       Vivian; Tess; John Peter; Liam; Juliet; and Benjamin. Vivian       and John Peter, as the president said, were born in Haiti,       and they came to us five years apart when they were very       young. And the most revealing fact about Benjamin, our       youngest, is that his brothers and sisters unreservedly       identify him as their favorite sibling.        Our children obviously make our life very full. While I am       a judge, I'm better known back home as a [room] parent,       carpool driver, and birthday party planner. When schools went       remote last spring, I tried on another hat. Jesse--    That is, her husband--       and I became co-principals of the Barrett e-learning academy.       And yes, the list of enrolled students was a very long one.       Our children are my greatest joy, even though they deprive me       of any reasonable amount of sleep.    Judge Barrett has even been criticized in her faith and been  criticized in her relationship in her family.   Judge Barrett said this about her husband and her family:         I could not manage this very full life without the       unwavering support of my husband, Jesse. At the start of our       marriage, I imagined that we would run our household as       partners. As it has turned out, Jesse does far more than his       share of the work. To my chagrin, I learned at dinner       recently that my children consider him to be the better cook.        For 21 years, Jesse has asked me every single morning what       he can do for me that day. And though I almost always say       ``Nothing,'' he still finds ways to take things off my plate.       And that's not because he has a lot of free time. He has a       busy law practice. It is because he is a superb and generous       husband, and I am very fortunate.    Faith, her family--why are we doing personal attacks on a qualified  candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States? First in her  class, recognized by the faculty as superior, recognized by judges and  leaders across the country as qualified--why are we into this  conversation?  [[Page S5908]]    On September 29, an article from NPR was entitled ``Amy Coney  Barrett's Catholicism Is Controversial But May Not Be Confirmation  Issue.'' The article said:         Never before has the Court been so dominated by one       religious denomination. . . .    That is, Catholics.         ``It's legitimate for senators to be concerned about       whether the court is reflecting the diversity of faith in the       United States.''    Wow. Now it is maybe we have too many Catholics. Maybe this is one  too many, and Senators should consider the greater diversity. As odd as  it sounds, the article didn't identify the fact that Amy Coney Barrett  would be the only Justice not to have graduated from Harvard or Yale.  There doesn't seem to be a desire to have a diversity of opinion or  background in that. It is just about this one area--her faith.   Imposing a religious test on a Supreme Court Justice is not only  antithetical to the Constitution; it is a very slippery slope, and it  is one we have been down before and I thought we had cleared.   In 1960--1960--then-Candidate John F. Kennedy stood in front of a  group of ministers in Houston, TX, who were concerned about having a  Catholic President because we, as a country, had never had a Catholic  President, and there were all these rumors and innuendoes out there  that the President would work for the Pope. So in 1960 JFK stood in  Houston, TX, and spoke to a group of ministers and made this statement.  He said:         I believe in an America . . . where no religious body seeks       to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general       populace or the public acts of its officials; and where       religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one       church is treated as an act against all.        For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the       finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been,       and may someday be again, a Jew--or a Quaker or a Unitarian       or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist       preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's       statute of religious freedom.        Today I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you--      until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped at       a time of great national peril.    JFK said this:         Finally, I believe in an America where religious       intolerance will someday end; where all men and all churches       are treated as equal; where every man has the same right to       attend or not attend the church of his choice; where there is       no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of       any kind; and where Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, at both       the lay and pastoral level, will refrain from those attitudes       of disdain and division which have so often marred their       works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of       brotherhood.        [This] is the kind of America . . . I believe [in]. And it       represents the kind of presidency in which I believe--a great       office that must neither be humbled by making it the       instrument of any one religious group, nor tarnished by       arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any       one religious group. I believe in a president whose religious       views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon       the nation, or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition       of holding that office.        I would not look with favor upon a president--    Or in this case, I would say a judge--       working to subvert the First Amendment's guarantees of       religious liberty. Nor would our system of checks and       balances permit him to do so. And neither do I look with       favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the       Constitution by requiring a religious test--even by       indirection--for it. If they disagree with that safeguard,       they should be out openly working to repeal it.    We are a nation that celebrates faith and recognizes faith as a  unifying factor, even in diversity of faith. I have had the privilege-- many of us have--to be able to pray with each other. We are Senators of  different faiths, different backgrounds, different places. We work to  treat each other with respect.   Faith is not something that Americans should demand--nor the Senate  should demand--that people have to take off to be able to serve the  American people. We don't take our faith off. It is not a jersey that  we wear on the outside; it is the core of who we are on the inside.  That is not something that I just take off to put on public service.  You put on public service, but your core faith should not be challenged  to be removed from your soul to be a viable person to be able to serve  the Court.   Let's work on our concept of religious liberty. Whether you are a  Christian, whether you are a Muslim, whether you are a Buddhist or a  Hindu, you can be a great American and you can serve this great country  in any location that you choose because we are a nation that honors and  protects the right of free exercise of religion.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
