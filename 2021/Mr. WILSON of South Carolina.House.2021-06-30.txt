 Madam Speaker, on Monday, I appreciate  meeting with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin at the U.S. Capitol. We  are always grateful for the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to  Israel.   Recently, Hamas terrorists in Gaza launched 4,500 Iranian-produced  rockets against Israeli families. America should always stand with our  allies. The world is impressed by Israel as she defends herself with  the Iron Dome.   It is encouraging to see the successes of Iron Dome intercepting  rockets  [[Page H3314]]  launched by Iranian-backed Hamas. The Iron Dome intercepted 90 percent  of the rockets toward the civilian areas of Israel protecting Israeli  families.   Allies stand together. Thank you, President Rivlin, for your  incredible insight on the murderous threat of Iran. Israel is vigilant  in monitoring Iranian intercontinental ballistic missile development,  which would deliver nuclear warheads against North America.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
