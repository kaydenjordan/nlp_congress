 Madam Speaker, the President is holding the country  hostage, putting hundreds of thousands of families at great risk.   The President has manufactured a crisis at the border that has no  basis in fact and has used the wall to incite fear. Vital agriculture  programs, which millions of families and farmers depend on, are at  risk.   At the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farm service loans are  stalled, family farmers need the capital to buy seed and equipment for  the approaching planting season. Rural development programs are at  risk.   Food stamps, food banks, and food programs are down to their last  dollars. School lunch programs and other nutrition programs are at  risk. Forty-seven million Americans could go hungry.   Let's take a look at the Food and Drug Administration, because our  food supply is at risk. When you go to the grocery store, you can't be  sure that the product you are buying is safe because almost all food  safety inspectors have been furloughed. The FDA remains understaffed  for food surveillance and food recall operations.   The Commissioner of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, said routine food safety  inspections are not taking place. The FDA has stopped posting warning  letters. Routine inspections of food facilities are not taking place,  and FDA's work finalizing guidance and implementing rules related to  the Food Safety Modernization Act is in limbo.   Foodborne illness kills 3,000 Americans every year, and because of  the  [[Page H391]]  President's manufactured crisis, the safety of every American is in  question. We have a duty to our constituents and their safety. We  cannot stand by while this President holds the country hostage. Their  physical and their financial well-being is at stake.   Let's pass this bipartisan bill so that hungry families can eat,  consumers can be safe, and farmers can do their job.                                time  1300
