 Mr. President, I want to say that the field hearings  I had have shown me that people not only fear but will be justifiably  hurt forever by this sabotage of our exchanges and by the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act. Whether it is called a skinny repeal or any other  name, it will fundamentally decimate Medicaid, it will put Americans  who are in nursing homes out on the streets, and it will mean that  people who need treatment for opioids--the consequences to them and  many others whom I have seen in Connecticut and around the country will  be absolutely devastating.   This shameful and senseless step toward gutting the Affordable Care  Act has left millions not only in fear but in potential real jeopardy.  We can do better, and the people of Connecticut and around the country  know we can do better.   We owe it to our democracy to go through the regular order, as  Senator McCain urged us to do, and to make sure that we fulfill our  promise, our oath that we will uphold the Constitution and do what is  right for the American people.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues across the  aisle accommodating me for 3 minutes, and I ask that--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no Democratic time remaining.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, we have seen in the course of this  debate some very high points and some points that I think in some ways  we regretted. One of the high points for me was the return of Senator  McCain, and I want to join all of my colleagues in saying how heartfelt  our gratitude is for his return and his eloquence here about the need  for us to work together.   Yet yesterday we also saw, in my view, a shameful and disgraceful  mockery of our democracy when Senators proceeded, in effect, to a  slogan, a shell of a bill, not a really substantive measure. Yet that  shell itself will undermine the exchanges and insurance coverage for  millions and millions of Americans by creating uncertainty, and this  process itself will aggravate that fear.   I have now held five field hearings in Connecticut, and at each one I  have heard from countless people with tears in their eyes telling me  what the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid have meant to them, what  repeal of it will mean to them, and how devastating and cataclysmic the  damage will be.   Thousands of constituents have written, have called, and have also  contacted others of my colleagues, as I have urged them to do, and I  want to say how grateful I am to them for their continued activism and  advocacy. We need to maintain this fight. I have heard from moms and  dads about what would happen to their children. One said to me: We  can't thrive as a nation or as individuals if we can't afford to be  healthy.   So I ask my colleagues to listen to their constituents, to the people  in their States, people like Conner and Mackenzie and Amelie and Evan  and Amanda and Michelle and Jennifer and Gay. I described them on the  floor in my previous talks. These voices and faces need to be brought  here because there have been no hearings, no regular order, no  democratic process, as we have an obligation to do.   If at some point my colleagues abandon this effort to repeal and  decimate the Affordable Care Act, I stand ready to come across the  aisle to work together to drive down the costs of healthcare-- particularly pharmaceutical drugs--and to open the exchanges to more  competition and create more choices for consumers among insurance  companies. There are steps we can take together to improve this  process. As Senator McCain urged us so powerfully, we need to go back  to regular order, come together, and work across the aisle. There is no  panacea. There is no instant solution. But we need to work together.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.
