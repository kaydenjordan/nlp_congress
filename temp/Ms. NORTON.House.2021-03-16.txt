 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the police who are to  receive Congressional Gold Medals: The U.S. Capitol Police, the  Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and the  other law enforcement agencies that participated in protecting the  Capitol on January 6, 2021.   The insurrection that day halted the final leg of congressional  business declaring Joe Biden President of the United States. Yet,  Congress was able to continue with its business that evening and early  the next morning because of the help of the law enforcement officers we  honor here today.   Then-President Donald Trump urged the crowd to the Capitol and  delayed using his authority to deploy the D.C. National Guard in the  country's moment of crisis. As a result, I have reintroduced a bill  that would give the mayor of the District of Columbia control over the  D.C. National Guard, and I am hopeful that this bill will be brought to  the floor during this Congress.   It cannot be forgotten that the damage done would have been worse  were it not for the Metropolitan Police Department, our local police,  funded by D.C. taxpayers, who were was responsible for indispensable  intervention when most Federal police forces did not appear, saving  lives at the Capitol on January 6. I appreciate this recognition for  the work of our local police force. An important way to reward them  would be to ensure that the people they protect in the Nation's capital  are given full and equal rights by passing the D.C. statehood bill.   Congratulations again to the Metropolitan Police Department of the  District of Columbia, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the other law  enforcement agencies on these congressional gold medals, which are well  deserved for the protection they provided to our democracy on January  6.
