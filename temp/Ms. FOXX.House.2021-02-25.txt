 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding,  and I completely agree with him on his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, yet another harmful bill  that has been rushed to the House floor without thorough bipartisan  consideration. It claims to strive for equality, but, in practice, this  bill undermines the constitutional religious freedoms guaranteed to all  Americans.   Once again, abandoning long-established House procedures, Democrats  are pushing a conveniently titled bill without convening one hearing or  markup during the 117th Congress to consider its vast implications for  educational institutions and employers.   This legislation would require our Nation's K-12 schools to treat  gender as being fluid, subjective, and not tied to biological reality.   H.R. 5 also threatens religious freedom protections for all Americans  and Federal funding for religiously affiliated colleges and  universities.   Under this bill, student codes of conduct, hiring practices, and  housing rules that reflect sincerely held beliefs about marriage and  sexuality would be deemed discriminatory, eroding First Amendment  rights.   In addition, the definitions in this bill are vague and would subject  employers and other covered organizations to increase litigation risks.   The bill also fails to advocate for the unborn, which is why I urge  support for my amendment that will protect anyone, including  religiously affiliated groups and individuals, from being forced to  perform abortions.   Masquerading as a proposal to guarantee fundamental civil rights to  all Americans, H.R. 5 is nothing more than a partisan ploy to destroy  religious liberty and educational opportunities for girls. Shameful  doesn't even begin to describe this bill.   This is no way to legislate, but for House Democrats, silencing the  voices of the minority and millions of hardworking Americans is  business as usual.
