 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Lee and Cruz ask of counsel for the  President:         The House managers have argued aggressively that the       President's actions contravened U.S. foreign policy. Isn't it       the President's place--certainly more than the place for       career civil servants--to conduct foreign policy?    Mr. Manager PHILBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, and  thank you for that question.   It is definitely the President's place to set U.S. foreign policy,  and the Constitution makes this clear. Article II, section 1 vests the  entirety of the executive authority in a President of the United  States, and it is critically important in our constitutional structure  that that authority is vested solely in the President because the  President is elected by the people every 4 years. That is what gives  the President democratic legitimacy to have the powers that he is given  under the Constitution.   Our system is somewhat unique in the very broad powers that are  assigned to the Executive, but it works, and it makes sense in a  democratic system precisely because he is directly accountable to the  people for the policies that he sets.   Those who are staffers in the executive branch bureaucracy are not  elected by the people. They have no accountability, and they have no  legitimacy or authority that comes from an election by the people, and  so it is critically important to recognize the President sets foreign  policy.   Of course, within some constraints, there are some roles for Congress  in foreign affairs. To some extent, statutes can be passed, funding  provisions can be passed that relate to it, but the Supreme Court has  recognized time and again that the President is, as the Court said in  Curtiss-Wright, the ``sole organ of the nation'' in foreign affairs.  [[Page S649]]    So he sets foreign policy, and if staffers disagree with him, that  does not mean that the President is doing something wrong, and this is  a critical point because this is one of the centerpieces of the abuse  of power theory that the House managers would like this body to adopt,  and that is that they are going to impeach the President based solely  on his subjective motive.   The premise of their case is the objective actions that were taken  were perfectly permissible and within the President's constitutional  authority, but if his real reason--if we get inside his head and figure  it out--then we can impeach him. And the way that they have tried to  explain that they can prove that the President had a bad motive is they  say: Well, we compare what did the President want to do with what the  interagency consensus was.    And I mentioned this the other day. They say that the President  defied and confounded every agency in the executive branch. That is a  constitutionally incoherent statement. The President cannot defy the  agencies within the executive branch that are subordinate to him. It is  only they who can defy the President's determinations of policy.   And so what this all boils down to is it shows that this case is  built upon a policy difference and a policy difference where the  President is the one who gets to determine policy because he has been  elected by the people to do that.   And we are right now only a few months away from another election  where the people can decide for themselves whether they like what the  President has done with that authority or not, and that is the way  disputes about policy like that should be resolved.   It is not legitimate to say that there is some interagency consensus  that disagrees with the President, and therefore we can show he did  something wrong, and therefore he can be impeached. That is an  extraordinarily dangerous proposition because it lacks any democratic  legitimacy whatsoever. It is contrary to the Constitution, and it  should be rejected by this body.   The President is the one who gets to set foreign policy because that  is the role assigned to him in the Constitution.   And it was even Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who had complained about  the July 25 call, himself ultimately agreed that it was only a policy  difference; it was a policy concern that he raised about the call. That  is not enough to impeach a President of the United States.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from New Hampshire.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Cruz and Hawley.   The CHIEF JUSTICE.
