 Mr. President, I want to talk today about Russia. I want to  talk about Vladimir Putin. I want to describe to this Chamber a  bipartisan victory that together we won, and then I want to describe,  tragically, how President Joe Biden is giving that victory away to  Putin and Russia.   To understand this issue, we need to go back to the summer of 2019.  In the summer of 2019, Russia was in the process of constructing a  pipeline called the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   Behind me is a map demonstrating where the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline  runs. It is a pipeline that was to run from Russia to Germany, going  underneath the Baltic Sea.   In the summer of 2019, the pipeline was nearly complete. At various  periods in time, it was 70 percent complete, 80 percent complete. There  was widespread consensus that if this pipeline were completed, it would  have devastating consequences. In a few minutes, I will discuss those  consequences in greater detail. But in an effort to stop the  devastating consequences, I worked on bipartisan legislation, along  with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat from New Hampshire, and we  introduced bipartisan sanctions legislation designed to stop the Nord  Stream 2 Pipeline.   That legislation, when we introduced it, was almost immediately  subject to a Russian disinformation campaign. In Europe, the Russians  were saying to anyone who would listen that the Cruz-Shaheen sanction  legislation could never pass; that there was no way Congress would come  together in a bipartisan manner to stop the Nord Stream 2; that it was  hopeless; that no one needed to be concerned that this legislation  could pass. They also made the argument as part of their disinformation  campaign that the pipeline was nearly complete so that U.S. sanctions  could not stop it. There was nothing that could be done to stop it.   Well, to the surprise of nobody who follows these issues, that  Russian disinformation was precisely that--it was disinformation. It  was lies.   In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Shaheen and I  worked with our colleagues, and our legislation was initially voted out  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by an overwhelming bipartisan  vote of 20 to 2--overwhelming bipartisan support.   At that point, Senator Shaheen and I began working to get it passed  on the floor of the Senate. While we were doing so, the Russian  disinformation continued: This cannot pass.   We endeavored to have our sanctions legislation attached to the  National Defense Authorization Act, which was moving in the fall and  winter of 2019. To do so was not easy. To do so, we needed to get the  explicit signoff of the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee. We needed the explicit signoff of the  chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  We needed the explicit signoff of the chairman and the ranking member  of the Senate Banking Committee. Then we needed the explicit signoff of  Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the Republican and Democratic  leader respectively. All eight of those Senators needed to agree with       our legislation for this to proceed on the NDAA.   And then we had to do the exact same thing in the House of  Representatives and get the chairman and ranking member on Foreign  Relations, on Armed Services and on Banking, and we had to get the  signoff of Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy.   To get the explicit support of all 16 of those congressional  leaders--8 Republicans and 8 Democrats--in any world is not easy.   And I will say on my part and Senator Shaheen's part, we invested  dozens, if not hundreds, of hours in terms of talking to our colleagues  to build that bipartisan consensus, and we ended up getting that  overwhelming support. In many ways, that support was miraculous.   Why is that?   Well, one of the reasons why Nord Stream 2 is particularly  problematic is that Russia is building Nord Stream 2 in order to cut  off Ukraine. There is currently a pipeline running through Ukraine and,  through Nord Stream 2, Russia has the power to starve Ukraine.   Why is it miraculous in December of 2019 that we were able to pass  this legislation?   Well, if you will recall what was happening in the House of  Representatives in December of 2019, the House of Representatives was  in the middle of impeaching President Donald Trump for alleged high  crimes and misdemeanors concerning Ukraine.   If you will recall, from the trial we held on this Senate floor,  central to the allegations that were raised by Democrats against  President Trump was conduct concerning Ukraine.   It remains astonishing that right in the middle of a partisan  gladiatorial battle concerning Ukraine, simultaneously we were able to  get Republicans and Democrats to work hand-in-hand to agree with  complete consensus that we were going to come together and stop the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. We were going to stop what Vladimir Putin was  doing.   In December of 2019, our legislation passed. The Cruz-Shaheen  sanctions legislation passed. Now, I will remind you what the Russian  disinformation did when we first introduced it. They said it will never  pass; and they said, even if it does pass, it is too late for it to  have any effect.   Well, if my memory serves me correctly, President Trump signed the  Cruz-Shaheen sanctions legislation at 7 p.m. on a Thursday. At 6:45  p.m. on a Thursday, 15 minutes before our sanctions legislation was  signed into law, the company that was laying the pipeline in the Baltic  Sea announced it had immediately halted laying the pipeline  [[Page S6644]]  and it was lifting anchor and sailing away. It was an incredible  bipartisan victory. The pipeline was stopped in its tracks.   What happened next was absolutely nothing. For a year, the pipeline  lay dormant. The talking points from Vladimir Putin--and now, sadly,  adopted by Joe Biden and his administration--is the pipeline is 90  percent complete or the pipeline is 95 percent complete. But it is not  rocket science that a 90-percent complete pipeline is zero-percent  complete. Until you build both ends of the pipeline, it ain't nothing  but a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean. Nothing is traveling  through it until the pipeline is complete and online.   For a year, the pipeline lay dormant. Then in the year 2020, Senator  Shaheen and I joined together again in a second round of bipartisan  legislation, a second round of sanctions. We had stopped the Nord  Stream 2 Pipeline in its tracks. For a year, Putin was stopped  altogether.   And we came together for a second piece of legislation--the second  version of Cruz-Shaheen--and just like the first sanctions, we passed  it through both Houses of Congress and it was signed into law with  overwhelming bipartisan support--nearly unanimous support of all 535  Members of Congress.   So we now had two major pieces of sanctions legislation on the books.  Those sanctions had been working for a year and the pipeline was  stopped.   Then in November of 2020 was the Presidential election. And in the  wake of the Presidential election, Joe Biden and his transition team  almost immediately began telegraphing weakness to Russia. Members of  Joe Biden's foreign policy advisory team in the German newspapers  expressed openness to Nord Stream 2 being built, expressed a  willingness to try to circumvent the sanctions that had been working  and had worked for over a year. Within days of Joe Biden and his team  expressing weakness to Putin, Russia and Putin heard and they began the  process of getting ready to return to building the pipeline.   (Thereupon, Ms. STABENOW assumed the Chair.)   Russia did return to building the pipeline. Do you know what day?  January 24, 2021. Four days after Joe Biden was sworn into office,  Putin said: We are safe. We are free. Our man Joe is in the White  House.    And we know that the administration is not going to follow U.S. law  anymore. And so on January 24, the Russians returned to building the  pipeline.   Now, for 2 years, this body had been united, Republicans and  Democrats, that we were going to stop this pipeline; but Joe Biden and  his administration decided instead to waive the sanctions, decided  instead to give Vladimir Putin what amounts to a multibillion-dollar  gift--and not just a gift one time. If this pipeline is allowed to go  online, it will put billions of dollars in Putin's pockets every year,  year after year after year.   What are the consequences of Nord Stream 2?   No. 1, Russia gets richer; Russia gets stronger; Russia gets billions  of dollars that it can use to build its military, to threaten its  neighbors, to threaten our allies, to endanger the lives of Americans  and our friends.   No. 2, Europe is hurt. Our friends and allies in Europe are made even  more dependent on Russian energy.   Our former colleague in this body, Senator John McCain--may he rest  in peace--had a phrase for Russia that was memorable, that I have used  many times. He referred to Russia as ``a gas station with a country  attached.''   That is Putin's plan. It is very simple. Putin is a petrol tyrant. He  is a tyrant, he is a bully, he is a KGB thug, and all his aggression is  funded by selling oil and gas.   Together, Republicans and Democrats in Congress had taken billions  out of Putin's pockets; and, sadly, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris decided  the world would be a better place if instead Putin had billions more  not just this year or next year, but for decades to come.   When Putin is dead and buried and the next dictator is ruling over  Russia, that next dictator will be reaping the benefits of this  pipeline. Indeed, as a result of Joe Biden's decision, many are  referring to this pipeline as the Biden-Putin pipeline for a very  simple reason: It is Putin who is building it; it is Putin who is  profiting by it.   And the only reason Putin is allowed to do so is because President  Joe Biden has given a multibillion-dollar gift that strengthens Russia  and it weakens Europe.   It makes Europe subject to energy blackmail. Putin has demonstrated a  willingness and, indeed, a history of using energy blackmail, of using  those who are dependent on natural gas to coerce them to do what he  wants. In the dead of winter, when people are at risk of freezing to  death, Putin has threatened to--and has, in fact--cut off gas to  endanger the lives of innocent civilians in order to coerce governments  to bend to his will.   As a result of Joe Biden's surrender to Vladimir Putin, Putin will  have the continued ability to exercise economic blackmail against  Europe.   But not only that. Europe has energy needs. Those energy needs could  be readily satisfied by American energy. Europe has expressed a  willingness and, in some instances, an eagerness to import American  energy.   But Joe Biden has decided that American jobs are unimportant. On his  first day in office, Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline, killing  11,000 jobs in the United States, including 8,000 union jobs--8,000  high-paying union jobs that, with a stroke of a pen, Joe Biden  eliminated.   And at the exact same time that Biden is shutting down jobs and a  pipeline in America, he is green lighting and giving Putin a gift of a  pipeline between Russia and Germany, producing jobs in Russia,  producing billions of dollars in Russia, and taking away jobs in  America.   This pipeline is a disaster. As the afternoon goes on, I will  elaborate on different aspects on which it is harmful and on the steps  we can and should be taking to stop it.   But at this point, Senator Barrasso is here and has some thoughts he  wishes to express, and so I will yield the floor to Senator Barrasso  for his remarks.    Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his  powerful remarks, and I thank each of the Senators who have worked with  me, both Republicans and Democrats, in our successful effort for over a  year to stop the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline--successful, right until Joe  Biden became President.   I want to talk now about the precise dangers that are posed by the  completion of Nord Stream 2. Many agree it would be a catastrophe for  the security of the United States and for our European allies.   Nord Stream 2, if it goes online, would double the gas flowing from  Russia to Germany while circumventing American allies that Putin  targets militarily, diplomatically, and commercially. As a result, if  Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will expose Ukraine and Poland to deep,  long-term dangers, and it will leave them vulnerable the next time  Russia targets them for aggression.   Right now, one-third of Russian gas exports to Europe travel through  Ukraine. That provides Ukraine a curious kind of protection because  Putin knows that he can't endanger that energy infrastructure without  endangering his economic line to the world.   With Nord Stream 2, Putin and Russia are given, by Joe Biden and by  Kamala Harris, effectively open season on Ukraine. And when a year from  now we see Russian tanks in Ukraine, we will remember this moment that  it was Joe Biden's surrender to Putin on Nord Stream 2 that enabled  Russia to carry out that aggression.   If Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will enrich Putin with billions of  dollars to direct toward his malign activities. And, by the way, if you  don't want to take my word for it, here is what the Polish Prime  Minister said about Nord Stream 2; that Nord Stream 2 ``strengthens  Russia's power, helps President Putin to build a military power, [and]  helps to intimidate other nations.''   In addition, if Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will solidify Russian  energy dominance at the expense of European energy diversification. If  Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will deepen the corruption that  tragically is endemic across Russia's energy sector, and it will export  more of that corruption to Europe.   But I want to talk a bit more about the crushing, overarching danger  of Russia using Nord Stream 2 for blackmail and for coercion. Putin  uses energy as a weapon. We have seen that pattern over and over again.  He uses energy for blackmail and coercion. He turns it off or on to  punish resistance to his expansionism.   This is a real, acute, and proven threat. Russia turned off the gas  to Europe in the winter months of 2006 and again in 2009 because of  political disputes. The Kremlin company that owns and would run Nord  Stream 2, Gazprom, has repeatedly cut off gas to Ukraine during  political crises. It is open blackmail, and because of Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris, Putin will have more power to blackmail our friends in  Europe.   And it is not only me; it is not only Republicans; and, indeed, it is  not only Republicans and Democrats in Congress who understand the  magnitude of this threat. Our European allies understand fully just how  disastrous Nord Stream 2 would be.   Ukrainian President Zelensky has said that it is flatout ``wrong''  ``not to notice that'' Nord Stream 2 ``is a dangerous weapon'' not only  for Europe, ``not only for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe.''   I want you to pause and reflect. President Zelensky of Ukraine said  this pipeline is a dangerous weapon directed at Ukraine and the whole  of Europe. Why is it being built? Because Joe Biden decided to give it  as a gift to Vladimir Putin.   In a meeting with the Biden administration, the Polish Deputy Foreign  Minister said:         Poland considers this project to be detrimental to the       security of not only Ukraine, not only Central Europe, but       also to the security of the whole of Europe, making the EU       dependent on Russian gas.    If we give a damn about our friends in Poland, if we give a damn  about our friends in Ukraine, if we give a damn about our friends in  Europe, don't allow Joe Biden to allow Vladimir Putin to point this  weapon at the heart of Europe.   In a joint statement signed by representatives of the Foreign Affairs  Committees of the Parliaments of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech  Republic, Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, here is  what the Estonian Foreign Affairs Committee stated: ``Countering malign  Russian aggression is in the vital national security interest of the  whole of NATO, the EU and our partners in Central and Eastern Europe,''  and that ``Nord Stream 2 is a geopolitical project geared towards  expanding Russia's influence on Europe, through energy dominance.''  [[Page S6647]]    A question for every Member of this Senate to decide: Do we care  about endangering the national security, about threatening, about  making our European friends subject to blackmail? Do we care about what  Estonia has told us, about what Latvia has told us, about what  Lithuania has told us? Do we care about the Czech Republic? Do we care  about Ireland? Do we care about Poland? Do we care about Ukraine? Do we  care about the United Kingdom?   Well, our actions can decide that. Unfortunately, Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris have decided that our European allies, their security is  not of sufficient concern to them. And, instead, they have actively  given this pipeline to Vladimir Putin.   My Democratic colleagues and, indeed, the vast majority of American  lawmakers, also understand the precise danger of blackmail and coercion  posed by Nord Stream 2.   In 2018, Senator Coons, my Democratic colleague from Delaware, said  quite plainly that ``we have to work with Europe to reduce its  dependence on Russian energy exports and in particular to convince it  to discontinue the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany.''  Senator Coons continued: ``As long as Russia dominates the provision of  energy to Europe it will continue to hold a veto over many European  policies and [it] will be in a position to weaken and marginalize  countries like Poland and Ukraine.''   Senator Coons was right in 2018, and what he said is right today.   Joe Biden is committing a generational political blunder, a  catastrophic mistake that hurts American national security and that  hurts European security.   Congress has repeatedly passed sanctions targeting Nord Stream 2,  targeting Russia's corrupt energy market more broadly. Those sanctions,  especially CAATSA and PEESA--and I am going to discuss in greater  detail, later today, the specific sanctions legislation that is on U.S.  books that Joe Biden is ignoring, that he is flouting, that he is  disregarding, that he is refusing to enforce. Those sanctions impose  mandatory sanctions. This body, Congress as a whole, Democrats and  Republicans, past administrations--everyone has worked together not  just to counter Russia but, specifically, to prevent Putin from being  able to leverage energy as a geopolitical weapon.   The Biden administration, however, tells us they have a better  solution, a better solution than both Houses of Congress, a better  solution than following U.S. law. Instead of imposing sanctions to stop  the pipeline, they tell us they have worked out a deal with Germany  that they promise will prevent Putin from being able to use energy as a  weapon. It is the best of both worlds, they say. They don't have to use  sanctions, and they still solve the problem of Russian energy  blackmail.   President Biden said: ``Chancellor Merkel and I are absolutely united  in our conviction that Russia must not be allowed to use energy as a  weapon to coerce or threaten its neighbors.''   Those are nice sentiments, if they weren't accompanied with Joe Biden  giving a multibillion-dollar generational gift to Putin to do exactly  what President Biden just said he didn't want Putin to do.   Here is how an official from the Biden State Department described the  deal: ``There's a clear commitment on the part of the United States and  Germany in this statement that should Russia attempt to use energy as a  weapon''--and, as an aside, they have done so over and over and over  and over again in the past--``should Russia attempt to use energy as a  weapon . . . Germany will take action at the national level and press  for effective measures at the European level, including sanctions to  limit Russian export capabilities to Europe in the energy sector, and  that includes gas and/or other economically relevant sectors.''   So understand what they are saying. If and when Russia does what they  have done in the past over and over again, if they do--one of the  reasons they want Nord Stream 2 is to exercise economic blackmail. If  and when they do that, Germany is going to send a really stern letter  to the European Union.   One of my favorite movies that Heidi and I have watched many times is  a movie called ``Team America.'' It is a comedy. It is done by the  creators of the movie ``South Park.'' It is a movie that involves  puppets. I will give a warning: It is a movie with an enormous amount  of profanity in it. It is also one of the most sidesplittingly funny  movies ever made.   In ``Team America,'' they talk about Hans Blix and the tool of  sending a stern letter to the United Nations. The movie ``Team  America'' understandably ridicules that as being utterly ineffective.  In the case of that movie, it was North Korea. But in the case of  Putin, I assure you, Vladimir Putin has not lost 1 minute of sleep  worrying about Germany's letter to the European Union.   Once Nord Stream 2 goes online, it will become a dominant source of  energy for Europe. Putin knows this. Merkel knows this. Biden knows  this.   Turning off Nord Stream 2, which Germany has suggested: Oh, once we  are addicted to the crack, we will just turn it off when we don't want  it anymore--that would be suicidal, which Putin knows, and he is  counting on it.    It is as empty and hollow a threat as has ever been uttered on the  international stage. And, even worse, we already know that it is a  hollow threat because Putin has already, in just the last few days,  crossed the line into using energy as a weapon.   So we don't have to go back to 2006. We don't have to go back to  2009. Let's go back to last week.   In just the last week, it has become clear that Putin has been  turning down gas exports to Europe to coerce our allies into dropping  opposition to Nord Stream 2.   The blackmail is open, and it is brazen. Russian and Gazprom  officials have said: If Germany and the EU approve Nord Stream 2 coming  online, then the Russians will turn exports back up.   On Friday, more than 40 Members of the European Parliament called for  an investigation of the coercion, saying Gazprom was driving up prices  to ``pressure'' the European Union into speeding Nord Stream 2  activation.   So I want you to pause and reflect. The Biden administration's claim  to prevent Nord Stream 2 being used as a weapon for energy blackmail  is, if Russia ever does it, Germany will stand up to them.   Russia is doing it right now--not in 2006--well, yes, they did in  2006. Not in 2009--well, yes, they did in 2009. Today, last week--and  they are not hiding it. They are saying: We are going to cut off your  energy until you approve Nord Stream 2.   How exactly is the Biden administration claiming they are going to  prevent the malign use of this pipeline? They are literally  surrendering to blackmail right now for no reason.   You know, sadly, the reason--over the past 9 months, I have had  conversations with just about every senior Biden State Department  nominee, in my office, over and over and over again, about Nord Stream  2. Almost to a person, the nominees agree: Nord Stream 2 would be  terrible. It would be disastrous. It would be bad for America. It would  be bad for Europe. It would be good for Russia.   They all agree with that. By the way, Tony Blinken, the Secretary of  State, said so vociferously in his confirmation hearing, and he said so  even more vociferously sitting on the couch in my office. They all  admit this.   So why, then, would Biden have committed this disastrous mistake?  Sadly, I think there are two reasons. One, the Biden team entered  office with an almost pathological revulsion to anything the previous  administration did. If the Trump administration did it, it must be  wrong and must be reversed.   Now, listen. None of us in this Chamber are naive. We understand  politics. We understand that when one party takes over from the other  party, they often reverse policy decisions. That is not unusual.   Obama reversed decisions of the Bush administration. Trump reversed  decisions of the Obama administration. And there are a whole lot of  decisions of the Trump administration that, sadly, from my perspective,  Biden is reversing. As a general matter, that is why we have elections,  and there are differences between the policy positions between the two  parties.   But the Biden team is further than that. It is almost a pathological  ``if Trump did it, it must be bad.'' Never mind that the Trump  administration  [[Page S6648]]  did this only after the Congress came together in an extraordinary  moment of bipartisan unity and passed this as mandatory legislation.   In my office, over and over again, with just about every senior Biden  State Department nominee, I asked them: Please don't turn one of the  biggest foreign policy victories of the last several years into one of  the biggest foreign policy defeats of the last several years.   The reports came out, actually, that State tried to honor its  commitment; that State--the Department of State--in the interagency  process, argued for ``let's follow the law; let's impose the  sanctions.'' And what public reports have suggested is that the Biden  White House--the political operatives in the Biden White House-- overruled State.   So even though State knew that the right policy was ``shut down the  Putin pipeline'' and the wrong policy was ``turn it into the Biden- Putin pipeline,'' the Biden White House desperately wanted to stamp  their imprimatur on this, because if it was done under President Trump,  they were going to reverse it.   The second reason is that the Biden foreign policy team, for whatever  reason, has a deep and abiding interest in giving to Germany whatever  it is they want.   Now, look, Germany is an important friend and ally. We work together  closely with Germany on economic matters, on diplomatic matters. We  have long and positive relationships with our friend and ally Germany.  It doesn't mean we agree with everything the Germans do, any more than  we agree with everything any other ally of ours does.   Indeed, I will point out, in the past week, the Biden administration  precipitated the French withdrawing their Ambassador from America--an  extraordinary moment, which, I will point out, at least illustrates  that we have a history of having disagreements, and sometimes serious  disagreements, with our friends and allies.   But one friend of mine has a phrase--he puts it--that the Biden  foreign policy establishment, they sleep with votive candles of Angela  Merkel under their beds; that they view Chancellor Merkel as someone  who must be surrendered to, acquiesced to no matter what. Never mind  that Chancellor Merkel has an extremely limited tenure in office. She  is on her way out. Never mind that the next successor government in  Germany may well decide that they don't even want Nord Stream 2. This  Biden foreign policy team, perhaps as a farewell gift to Angela Merkel,  has decided that President Biden should surrender to Putin. That makes  no sense. That is dangerous. It is harmful to Europe, it is harmful to  Germany, it is harmful to America, and it helps Russia.   We are going to have an extended period of time to continue to  discuss these matters, but at this point, I see that Senator Shaheen is  preparing to speak, so I yield the floor to Senator Shaheen.    Mr. President, I would like to discuss now how Nord Stream  2 is an unprecedented example, a contemporary example, of bipartisan  unity. Democrats and Republicans both know that Nord Stream 2 is a  terrible idea. It is a terrible idea for Europe, and it is a terrible  idea for the United States.   Here are several examples of the bipartisan agreement we have. It has  been commonplace to say that bipartisanship doesn't exist, but Nord  Stream 2 refutes that.   The first wave of sanctions authored by me and by Senator Shaheen  goes back to the summer of 2019. At a July 31 hearing, several  Democrats spoke out against Nord Stream 2 and its support of the Cruz- Shaheen sanctions to stop it.   Here are some of the things they said. Senator Menendez said:         I think the international community must stand firm against       opening more doors and creating new opportunities for further       Kremlin aggression in Ukraine leading to the loss of life.       The Russian Federation has repeatedly used its energy       resources as a lever of power, and I believe Nord Stream 2 is       no exception. Not only will it considerably strengthen the       Kremlin's stranglehold on Europe, but it allows Moscow to       further undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and stability.    Senator Shaheen said:         We have heard in our office directly from other countries       in Eastern and Central Europe, and the Baltics, and many of       the Nordic states, and of course especially Ukraine, who       understand that this pipeline is an effort to increase       reliance on Russia among Europe. And I would argue that this       does nothing to strengthen the transatlantic alliance, the       Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In fact, it actually decreases       support for the alliance.    Here is what Senator Coons from Delaware said:         I, like many of us, have been to Ukraine, remain gravely       concerned about Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine,       and the ways in which Russia finances its aggression through       the use of its sole remaining export of any interest, which       is energy.    Senator Menendez was right. Senator Shaheen was right. Senator Coons  was right. That consensus has held for over 2 years, Democrats and  Republicans, even through the Biden administration's catastrophic  decision to green light the pipeline and to give a multibillion-dollar  gift to Vladimir Putin.   This issue was central to a June 8 meeting of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee after Biden had defied U.S. law and given a  multibillion-dollar gift to Putin.   Here is what Senator Menendez said after Biden acted:         I think many of us on a bipartisan basis were deeply       concerned about the administration's decision to waive       sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG. . . . I would have thought       that one of the most significant ways to show strength is to       ensure that the pipeline is killed.    Senator Menendez was right.   Senator Merkley even condemned the pipeline for issues he said were  directly related to climate change, which is something Biden officials  claim is utterly sacrosanct in this administration.   The consensus, even after the Biden administration formally announced  that it had struck a deal surrendering entirely to Russia on the  pipeline--nonetheless, we saw the bipartisan consensus remain.   On July 21, Senator Kaine said:         I'm not happy about it. . . . I'm not happy about it in       terms of Russian politics, and I'm not happy about it in       terms of climate change.    Senator Kaine was right.   Senator Shaheen said she was ``skeptical that [the agreement] will be  sufficient when the key player at the table--Russia--refuses to play by  the rules.''   Senator Shaheen was right. She was right to be skeptical that the  agreement from the Biden administration, mind you, will be sufficient  when the key player at the table--Russia--refuses to play by the rules.   And I would note that the consensus wasn't limited to the Senate. On  the other side of the Capitol in the U.S. House of Representatives,  that same sentiment was broadly echoed both during the previous  administration and during the current administration.   At the beginning of my push for the Cruz-Shaheen sanctions in 2019,  Democratic Representative Engel said:         Russia has weaponized its energy resources, expanding into       European markets and creating greater and greater dependency,       particularly with projects such as the Nord Stream 2.    Representative Engel was right.   Several years later, after the announcement of President Biden's  complete surrender to Russia on Nord Stream 2, Representative Kaptur  told a Polish newspaper that she and much of the House of  Representatives were disappointed with the deal. She said:         I am very disappointed by the Biden administration's       willingness to allow Russian gas to reach the heart of Europe       via Nord Stream 2, endangering energy security. . . . We       consider this a dangerous project from a security point of       view.    Representative Kaptur was right.   Supporters of the Biden administration will say: Well, of course,  everybody opposes Nord Stream 2, but there is no way to stop it.   That excuse is disingenuous. That excuse is laughable on its face.  Now, why is that? Because it is the identical excuse that was central  to the Russian disinformation 2 years ago. In the summer of 2019, when  I first authored the bipartisan sanctions to stop Nord Stream 2, the  Russian disinformation campaign in Europe was predicated on the  proposition that the pipeline was 95 percent complete, and they said:  Gosh, you can't stop it. There is nothing you can do to stop it.   They halted construction of the pipeline 15 minutes before our  bipartisan sanctions were signed into law, and for over a year, the  pipeline lay dormant as a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea.   So every time the Biden administration says ``It was too far along;  we couldn't stop it,'' you know what--it was just as far along in  December of 2019, and we stopped it then. It was just as far along in  January of 2020, and we stopped it then. We stopped it in February. We  stopped it in March, April, May, June, July, August, September,  October, November, December. And it wasn't until January, January 24--4  days after Joe Biden took the oath of office--that Russia resumed  building the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   The only reason they couldn't stop it is because Joe Biden wanted to  surrender to Putin, because the answer is, Republicans and Democrats in  this Chamber had stopped it for over a year, until Joe Biden came in  and turned victory into defeat; until Joe Biden came in and offered  complete capitulation--and might I note, in exchange for nothing.   Let me ask you, what did the Biden administration get in exchange for  a multibillion-dollar gift--and not a one-time gift; a gift every year  for decades in perpetuity? What did the Biden administration get? Not a  damn thing. Nothing. It was simply a complete capitulation. Surrender.   Now, defenders of the Biden administration will say: Well, maybe we  could have stopped it a few months ago, before the pipeline was  complete. But in between January and this month, the Russian efforts  built the pipeline, and they just announced it is complete. So now we  should surrender, right? There is nothing that can be done about it.   Well, that, in fact, is not true. That is a second wave of  disinformation. Now, why is that true? That is not true because before  the pipeline can go online, there are a series of certifications that  are required. Nord Stream 2 AG, the company that is responsible for  [[Page S6660]]  planning, construction, and eventual operation of Nord Stream 2, needs  to be granted formal permission as a gas transmitter. There are many  regulatory hurdles in their way--hurdles that have not yet been  cleared. The process at a minimum should take many months, and the  process could be derailed at any time.   First, there has to be an inspection process. Each of Nord Stream 2's  strings has to be inspected to make sure there are no leaks, and part  of that requires confirming that the pipelines were installed  correctly. Part of that has already begun with air. Nobody knows how it  has been going.   Then, there has to be an additional technical certification. This  will be extremely difficult for Nord Stream 2 AG because the bipartisan  sanctions legislation that I wrote and passed with Senator Shaheen and  that Congress passed imposes mandatory sanctions on anyone who  certifies the pipeline for operation.   Now, pause and think about that for a second. The pipeline can't go  into effect unless it is certified. U.S. law passed overwhelmingly by  Democrats and Republicans in this Congress, signed into law in the U.S.  Code, says anyone who certifies it faces mandatory, crushing sanctions  from the United States. The company that was originally going to  certify it withdrew after the sanctions became law. The only way that a  different company would dare to certify is if they believed the Biden  administration would look the other way, would bless their  certification in outright defiance of U.S. law.   Then, apart from the technical issues, Nord Stream 2 AG still has to  be certified as a gas transmission operator as a matter of regulation  and law. That should take at a minimum many months and require delicate  negotiations between the company and the regulators.   You know, what is striking is, everything that I am saying has been  said by the Biden administration. So right now, their talking points  are ``There is nothing we can do. It is a done deal. We have  surrendered. We have given up. There is nothing we can do,'' but when  they were in the process of surrendering, they said everything I just  told you.   Until recently, even the top officials of the Biden administration  acknowledged that physical completion of Nord Stream 2 didn't make its  activation a fait accompli.   On June 8, Secretary of State Blinken testified that ``even when the  pipeline is physically complete, for it to go into operation, it still  requires insurance, it still requires various permits, and we are  looking very carefully at all of that.'' Secretary Blinken said that  ``it was too late to stop the joining of those pipes. Its operation is  another matter.''   Secretary Blinken was wrong when he said it was too late to stop the  joining of the pipes because we stopped them for over a year, until  Biden surrendered to Putin, but he wasn't wrong when he said we could  still stop the operation of it.   Given these requirements and this time line, the path for America is  obvious: We should sanction Nord Stream 2 AG, the parent company of the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. That will automatically isolate the company,  and it will signal our readiness to follow the law, to impose more  sanctions, and to ensure that everyone knows that involvement with  Putin's pipeline brings with it crippling, company-ending sanctions.  Indeed, that is exactly why Congress has repeatedly passed  legislation--bipartisan legislation--to stop this pipeline. But instead  of obeying the law, President Biden decided brazenly and willfully to  defy Federal law--to defy Congress's mandate.   In May, President Biden transmitted a communication to Congress  that acknowledged, yes, he was obliged to impose sanctions on Nord  Stream 2 AG for violating the sanctions that Congress had passed and  passed overwhelmingly, but instead of imposing those mandatory  sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, given the clear and unequivocal intent  of Congress, the Biden administration chose instead to waive them. It  was a disastrous decision. It was a decision based on weakness and  capitulation to Russia. It hurt our friends and allies in Europe, and  it hurt the United States of America.    It is a decision that can be reversed. Right now, the pipeline, if  this pipeline goes into effect, will be the Biden-Putin pipeline. It  doesn't have to be. This was designed at the outset to be the Putin  pipeline, and when it was the Putin pipeline, we stopped it.  Republicans stopped it. Democrats stopped it. We came together at a  time of partisan division and we said together: Giving billions of  dollars to Putin, to Russia, for aggressive military hostility,  subjecting Europe to energy blackmail, making Europe dependent on  Putin's gas, and destroying American jobs is bad all around.   Congress succeeded. It was the Putin pipeline until January 24, 2021.  Joe Biden had just been sworn into office, and Putin, after a year of  dormancy, began building the pipeline again because Biden had already  signaled he intended to capitulate.   When we convene next week, I am going to discuss in greater detail  the compromise that I have offered to the Biden administration and  Senate Democrats to move forward on more of their nominees if they  accept a compromise solution on Nord Stream 2. The Biden administration  has had this compromise offer for 2 months, and they have done nothing  with it.   But I would suggest something right now. In the course of my remarks,  I have read quote after quote after quote from Senate Democrats. Senate  Democrats know this pipeline is a disaster for America. Senate  Democrats know that surrendering to Putin is bad for America. But  Senate Democrats are scared to stand up to a Democratic President.   I can tell you, when we had a Republican President, President Trump,  there were some in the Trump administration who resisted these  bipartisan sanctions, and as a Republican, I was perfectly willing to  stand up to a Republican administration for those who were resisting  these sanctions and to press them hard.   So my request to my Democratic colleagues is, show that you actually  believe what you said in 2019 and 2020 and 2021. Show that you care  about U.S. national security. Let's stand together, and let's reclaim  that bipartisan consensus we have had for 2 years that Nord Stream 2 is  bad for America and bad for our allies.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
