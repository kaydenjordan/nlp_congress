 Madam Speaker, on Saturday, as members of  our Jewish community in San Diego and all over the world observed the  final day of Passover, a 19-year-old chose hate. He stormed into the  Chabad of Poway synagogue, shooting at the congregation, leaving  beloved community member Lori Gilbert Kaye dead and three more wounded.   The congregation's brave rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, reflected: ``I do  not know why I had to witness scenes of a pogrom in San Diego County  like the ones my grandparents experienced in Poland. . . . I don't know  why I had to see my good friend . . . hunted in her house of worship.''   This Thursday, Madam Speaker, is Israel's Yom HaShoah, a day to  commemorate the Holocaust and the 6 million Jews who were murdered for  being Jewish.   We are reminded of the hate, bigotry, and intolerance that we  continue to face today, whether it be in San Diego, Sri Lanka,  Christchurch, or Pittsburgh.   Hate and violence had no place then and still do not today. We need  to say ``never again'' and act.                            ____________________
