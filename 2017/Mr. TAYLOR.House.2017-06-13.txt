 Mr. Speaker, I was absent for the initial vote series due  to my attendance of  [[Page H4875]]  the funeral of Kyle Milliken. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 302, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 303, and ``yea''  on rollcall No. 304.                            ____________________
