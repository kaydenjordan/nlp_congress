 Mr. President, in the last few weeks, students in Uvalde  and the rest of Texas started a new school year. Three and a half  months ago, on May 24, 19 innocent children and 2 teachers were  murdered by a deranged, evil gunman.   There are no words to describe a monster who enters a school and  murders little children--19 children, 19 families in Uvalde who lost  their little boys and their little girls, 2 teachers who are no longer  here with us.   I was in Uvalde the day after the shooting. I sat down with local  officials and law enforcement. I went to the prayer vigil that night  where the entire Uvalde community came together, praying, weeping, and  mourning the unbelievable loss of those 19 precious children and 2  teachers.   The Uvalde shooting was the deadliest school shooting in Texas  history. Before that, I was in Santa Fe, where yet another evil madman  killed eight students and two teachers. I was also at Sutherland  Springs, the worst church shooting in U.S. history. I was in El Paso. I  was in Midland-Odessa. I was in Dallas.  [[Page S4591]]    There have been too damn many mass shootings. With kids going back to  school all across the country, we need to again revisit what we can do  to keep them safe from mass shooters.   Many students, especially in Uvalde, are scared. Their parents are  scared, and they have expressed concerns that the security measures at  schools in Uvalde haven't improved enough to make them feel safe.   Today, I want to put forth two bills that would address this problem.   Inevitably, when a mass murder occurs, Democrats in this Chamber and  the media implore Congress: Do something.   Well, in just a moment, the Senate can do something. The first bill I  am going to ask this body to pass is the Secure Our Schools Act, which  would spend unused COVID education funds on hiring police officers in  schools and hiring school-based mental health professionals. This bill  would be the most serious, the most significant, the most major  investment in school security Congress has ever enacted. This bill  would double the number of police officers on campus. So if, God  forbid, the next deranged madman shows up trying to commit murder,  before that madman gets into the school, into the classroom, he would  encounter an armed police officer who could stop him outside the school  before he commits murder.    This bill also funds $10 billion for 15,000 new mental health  counselors in schools. So many of these deranged killers have a long  and horrifying descent into mental illness before they commit their  crimes. We see the pattern of the lone, alienated, angry, deranged,  young man who seeks to commit the most unspeakable evil. If we had  additional mental health resources on campuses, they would be in a  position to spot the warning signs, to see the young man heading down  that dangerous path, and to intervene and stop them.   Recently, the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part  of the U.S. Department of Education, found that 88 percent of public  schools did not ``strongly agree'' when asked whether they had the  funding and the mental health professionals they needed in the schools.  Eighty-eight percent said: We need more mental health professionals in  schools and more funding to hire them.   My bill would address both of these problems by ensuring that we are  doubling the number of police officers so there are armed police  officers to protect our kids and keep them safe and so there are mental  health counselors to spot a dangerous young man before he goes down the  road of committing a horrific mass murder.   This bill is common sense, and in a sane political environment, it  would be passed 100 to nothing.   My colleague Senator Barrasso wants to make some additional remarks  on our bill. So I yield the floor to Senator Barrasso.   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 4845, which is at the desk; further, that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, what we just saw on this floor was  stunning. I am genuinely at a loss for words.   This bill is common sense. There is not a constituent in Texas or  Nevada or Connecticut who, if you asked: Would it be a good thing to  have more police officers keeping our kids safe, wouldn't say: Of  course it would. There is not a constituent of ours who, if you asked:  Would it be a good thing to have more mental health counselors on  campus to stop people from committing crimes, wouldn't say: Of course  it would.   I was informed a few days ago that when I was going to seek unanimous  consent, the Senator from Connecticut was going to object. Now, the  Senator from Connecticut styles himself the leading advocate of gun  control in the U.S. Senate.   I was asked by reporters: Why are the Democrats objecting to this?   I will tell you what I told reporters: I have no idea. They haven't  said. They haven't told me why they object to it.   So I was genuinely looking forward to seeing the Senator from  Connecticut's remarks. I was sitting here waiting to see, why do you  oppose more police officers to keep our kids safe? Why do you oppose  mental health counselors in schools?   I have been in the Senate 10 years. The Senator from Connecticut and  I were elected at the same time. I have engaged in many debates on this  floor, including with the Senator from Connecticut. The fact that he  chose not to say a word about why he objects is stunning. I find myself  genuinely flabbergasted.   I will say that one of reasons I think the Senator from Connecticut  feels content not only not to argue but now to walk off the floor and  not even listen to the debate he is ostensibly participating in, one of  reasons he feels free to do so is, if you look up in the Senate  Gallery--I can count them--there are precisely zero reporters in this  Gallery. Not a single one of the corporate media will report on this,  and I think the Senator from Connecticut feels absolutely certain, when  he walks out, he will have reporters that will say: Tell me how  terrible Donald Trump is.   He will lean in and say: Oh, Donald Trump is really terrible.   But not one of the reporters will ask: Hey, wait a second, why don't  you want police officers keeping our kids safe?   None of them will. The Democrats are protected by a dishonest army of  propagandists in the corporate media.   CNN will not have a panel sitting around discussing why is it that  the  [[Page S4592]]  Democrats simply do not care to defend their positions.   Let me tell you, when there is a mass murdering and the Democrats  stand up and give speeches and they point at Republicans and say: Blood  is on your hands, it is great political rhetoric. It is dishonest, but,  boy, it gins up their donors. It gets people to go and write checks to  Democrats and fund their campaigns.   What we just saw reveals that Democrats have one objective when a  mass murder happens, and that is to take away the Second Amendment  rights of law-abiding citizens. That is always, always, always their  solution. Never mind that it doesn't work. Never mind that it doesn't  stop violent crime. Never mind that if you look at the jurisdictions  across the country with the strictest gun control laws, almost every  single one of them consistently has among the highest crime rates and  murder rates.   Earlier this year, the Senator from Connecticut authored his big gun  control package, rammed it through this body--a package which will do  nothing, zero, to stop mass murders. We will see another mass murder. I  pray that we don't, but evil exists in the world, and if another  lunatic attacks a school, and there is not a police officer at the  front door to stop him, remember right now. Remember this moment when  the Democrats said: No, we will not protect our kids.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 4586    Madam President, there are lots of arguments the Senator from  Connecticut could have made. He chose to make none of them.   If he does not like how the money in this bill is specifically spent,  I am now going to propound a second unanimous consent bill.   There is right now $135 billion in unspent COVID relief funds to  schools. Under the rules the Democrats have put in place, those funds  cannot be spent on school security.   The second bill that I am going to ask this body to pass is a bill  that is very simple. It is one page. It says schools can spend some of  that $135 billion on school security. They can decide what to spend it  on, but if they decide they want to hire an additional police officer,  they can spend the money on that. If they decide they want to enhance  the physical security of their campus to make their students safer,  they can spend it on that. They can invest in school security. Right  now, the Democrats have blocked them from doing this.   These are funds Congress has already appropriated that haven't been  spent. And this bill is unbelievably simple. It says the schools can  choose to invest in school security.   Therefore, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged  from further consideration of S. 4586 and that the Senate proceed to  its immediate consideration; further, that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, the Senator from Connecticut just gave us  the sum total of his wisdom as he walks off the floor again, which is,  he says this isn't real.   The Presiding Officer is well aware of how the Senate operates. When  a Senator arises for a unanimous consent request, one of two things  happens: A Senator objects, or the bill passes.   I have stood on this floor and passed unanimous consent requests  because our colleagues chose not to object.   One of the more notable instances was following multiple instances in  the House of House Democrats making anti-Semitic comments. The House  tried to pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. Sadly, the radical  left in the Democratic caucus objected, and the House Democrats  couldn't pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism.   I joined with our colleague Senator Kaine from Virginia, a Democrat.  We authored a resolution, the Cruz-Kaine resolution--a bipartisan  resolution that was a clear and unequivocal condemnation of anti- Semitism. It condemned BDS as anti-Semitism. It condemned explicitly  the anti-Semitic comments made by those House Democrats at the outset  of the dispute.   When Senator Kaine and I came to the Senate floor, we did not know if  a Senator would object. There were numerous Senators in this body who  did not join the resolution and could easily have walked out on the  floor and objected. We stood up and asked unanimous consent, and much  to our very pleasant surprise, the opposing party chose not to object,  and the resolution passed. It passed 100 to nothing.   When the Senator from Connecticut says this isn't real, the only  reason this bill has not passed the U.S. Senate is because the Senator  from Connecticut stood up and uttered two magic words: I object. Had he  done something really simple--just shut up, just shut his mouth, just  sat there--we would be standing in a position where both of these bills  would have passed into law.   What does it say about the Democrats' view of the American people  that they don't engage in debate, they don't engage in discussion, they  don't defend their positions? They, instead, arrogantly say no and have  full confidence that their compliant cheerleaders in the media will  never even tell anyone about it.   I don't know how you defend the position he just took. I was  genuinely looking forward to hearing some form of an argument.   I can tell you, when I forced a vote on the Cruz-Barrasso bill on  this floor and the Democrats voted, party line, no, we don't want more  police officers in school; no, we don't want more mental health  counselors in school; no, we don't want additional funding for school  safety, to the best of my knowledge, no reporter asked a single  Democrat: Why are you leaving our kids vulnerable? Why aren't you  acting to protect children in school? Because, you know what, there is  no money on the left for actually stopping these crimes. The money is  for disarming law-abiding citizens. It is a narrow-minded, political  focus.   We could have just passed the most significant school safety  legislation ever passed by the Federal Government. Why didn't we?  Because the Democrats objected. That objection is wrong, it is  irresponsible, and it shows a willingness to play political games while  demonstrating contempt for our constituents.   Today, the U.S. Senate failed the American people. Today, the U.S.  Senate failed the schoolchildren of America. And I pray that the  consequences are not truly horrific. I pray that this body will show up  and do its damn job: Debate real issues and pass real legislation that  will actually stop crime rather than the empty political gestures of  the left.   I yield the floor.
