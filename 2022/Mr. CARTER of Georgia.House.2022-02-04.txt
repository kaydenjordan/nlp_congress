 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a life  spent in service and love for others, Patsy Bennett of Jesup, Georgia.   If you got married in southeast Georgia in the 1960s to the late  1980s, you probably had the pleasure of working with Patsy Bennett.   Patsy was special to many people in her community because she was  dedicated to making their special day unforgettable. Patsy made it her  mission to ensure every bride had whatever dress she wanted, and if she  didn't have it on hand, she would craft it herself.   At her bridal store, one could pick out their own flowers, have  bridesmaids' luncheons, rehearsal dinners, and even hold their wedding  ceremony in Patsy's big room.   Patsy left a beautiful mark on everything she created--be that a  wedding, a bridal shower, or a relationship she developed with the  women she served.   Her service to our community's women and families truly was not only  remarkable but fun to watch in the form of beautiful ceremonies.   Patsy's legacy is one of beauty, grace, and service, and my thoughts  and prayers reside with her family and those affected by this  tremendous loss.                            ____________________
