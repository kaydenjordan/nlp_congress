 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership, and I thank Congresswoman Judy Chu for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise with great enthusiasm for the National Origin- Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, and that is the NO BAN  Act.   I proclaim a breath of fresh air, and that was the election of 2020  and the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala  Harris, who made it very clear what our position is as it relates to  those who come to this country.  [[Page H2009]]    First of all, they did not turn a blind eye to the Statue of Liberty,  which acknowledges the fact that we are a refuge for those who are  fleeing persecution. They also understood that we are not a country  that discriminates against individuals simply because of their  religion. That is what the NO BAN Act represented. It had nothing to do  with terrorism.   I wonder why President Trump never said anything about domestic  terrorists? Why didn't they have a structure to ban them, the very  terrorists that jumped this Capitol on January 6th?   I am reminded of a little 15-year-old on the day that the ban was  issued. When I was flying in from Washington, I went straight over to  the international terminal because my staff had called me and others  had called me. This little boy, innocent, with legal documents, a  tourist visa, coming to visit his family, innocently indicated who he  was. And, of course, by law, those CBP officers had to detain him.                                time  1300    Do you know what was worse? He was not able to see anyone at that  time, but more importantly, he wound up in Chicago.   And so I rise to support the NO BAN Act, and I indicate that there is  a policy. The border is closed. The Vice President will be working on a  broader plan for dealing with the border. The shelter in Houston was a  temporary shelter. It was an emergency shelter. It was rightly closed  when other beds were found. 130 of those children were reunited with  their families. This bill is important.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted that this bill  includes an important provision of mine offered last year during the  committee markup, which requires the administration to report to  Congress on the impacts, positive, negative, and unintended of any  action by the President pursuant to executive orders.   We know that banning Nigeria was the wrong thing to do, and I support  the NO BAN Act.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee  on the Judiciary and a cosponsor, I rise in strong and enthusiastic  support of H.R. 1333, the ``National Origin-Based Anti-Discrimination  For Non-Immigrants Act, or No BAN Act, which stops executive overreach  by preventing the abuse of  [[Page H2015]]  the system pioneered by the 45th President with his several abuses of  the authority to restrict the entry of non-citizens into the United  States under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act  (INA).   Thankfully, it is unnecessary for Congress to repeal by legislation  the several section 212(f)-based executive actions of the 45th  President's, including his original Muslim ban, because were rescinded  by his successor, President Joseph Biden, in the initial days of the  new Administration.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because the NO BAN Act  amends section 212(f) of the INA to place checks and balances on the  President's authority to temporarily suspend or restrict the entry of  aliens or classes of aliens into the United States, when it is  determined that such individuals ``would undermine the security or  public safety of the United States or the preservation of human rights,  democratic processes or institutions, or international stability.''   Specifically, the bill requires the President to find and document  that any suspension or restriction:   (1) is based on specific and credible facts;   (2) is narrowly tailored;   (3) specifies a duration; and   (4) includes waivers.   The NO BAN Act expands the INA's nondiscrimination provision to  prohibit discrimination based on religion and extends the prohibition  on discrimination beyond the issuance of immigrant visas to include the  issuance of nonimmigrant visas, entry and admission into the United  States, and the approval or revocation of any immigration benefit.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that the NO BAN Act includes an important  provision offered last year during the committee markup of this  legislation, which requires the Administration to report to Congress on  the impacts--positive, negative, and unintended--of any action taken by  the President pursuant to executive orders he has or will issue  pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA.   I strongly support this legislation, and President Biden's rescission  of his predecessor executive order which added the countries of  Belarus, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania to  the President's new and offensive Muslim Ban.   Madam Speaker, as a co-chair of the Congressional Nigerian Caucus, it  is important to convey to our colleagues that the United States cannot  afford to hamper diplomatic relations with Nigeria due to its  importance in the region.   Nigeria is the largest economy and most populous country in Africa  with an estimated population of more than 190 million, which is  expected to grow to 400 million by 2050 and become the third most  populous country in the world after China and India.   The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with  U.S. foreign direct investment concentrated largely in the petroleum  and mining and wholesale trade sectors.   At $2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export  destination in Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States and Nigeria  have a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement.   In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and  Nigeria totaled over $9 billion.   Due to many of the residents of these countries practicing Islam, the  45th President's executive order was appropriately nicknamed the  ``Muslim Ban'', and only exemplified his xenophobic and prejudiced  mindset that the American people renounced as unacceptable in the 2020  presidential election.   Tanzania is also an important partner of the United States, and  through numerous presidential initiatives, the United States has  provided development and other assistance to Tanzania for capacity  building to address health and education issues, encourage democratic  governance promote broad-based economic growth, and advance regional  and domestic security to sustain progress.   Although Sudan has had some internal issues during the last decade,  the U.S. was a major donor in the March 1989 ``Operation Lifeline  Sudan,'' which delivered 100,000 metric tons of food into both  government and rebel held areas of the Sudan, thus, averting widespread  starvation.   The United States established diplomatic relations with Eritrea in  1993, following its independence and separation from Ethiopia.   The United States supported Eritrea's independence and through a  concerted, mutual effort that began in late 2017 and continues today,  there are vast improvements to the bilateral relationship.   U.S. interests in Eritrea include supporting efforts for greater  integration of Eritrea with the rest of the Horn of Africa, encouraging  Eritrea to contribute to regional stability and partner on shared peace  and security goals, urging progress toward a democratic political  culture, addressing human rights issues and promoting economic reform  and prosperity.   A comprehensive and coordinated strategy needs to be developed in  coordination with the United States Congress to ensure that each  country affected by this law may peacefully have its residents enter  the United States and complete visa and asylum applications.   We live in a nation of laws, but we also live in a nation that seeks  to establish and maintain diplomatic ties to these important African  nations and imposing a discriminatory and arbitrary ban would adversely  affect foreign relations with a critical continent for decades to come.   Madam Speaker, in light of the crisis presented by current COVID-19  pandemic, the NO BAN Act contains a provision to ensure that the  President can use section 212(f) to protect the United States from the  spread of communicable diseases, including COVID-19, by suspending the  entry of a class of individuals if the President determines their entry  would undermine the public safety of the United States.   However, to remove any perceived ambiguity and avoid the propensity  of this president to abuse delegated authority, the legislation  includes language to clarify that the term ``public safety'' ``includes  efforts necessary to contain a communicable disease of public health  significance.''   Madam Speaker, the NO BAN Act is supported by a bipartisan coalition  of the nation's leading immigrants' rights organizations, faith-based  organizations, and civil rights organizations, including the following:   American Civil Liberties Union, Church World Service, U.S. Conference  of Catholic Bishops, Muslim Advocates Immigration Hub, Asian Americans  Advancing Justice Association, Americans United for Separation of  Church and State, Bend the Arc, Center for American Progress, The  Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, Interfaith Immigration  Coalition, Human Rights Campaign, Franciscan Action Network, HIAS,  Jewish and Muslims and Allies Acting Together, Religious Action Center  of Reform Judaism, National Council of Jewish Women, National Iranian  American Organization Action, National Immigration Law Center,  International Refugee Assistance Project, Friends Committee on National  Legislation, Engage Action, Airbnb.   I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 1333 and send a powerful message  that this House stands firmly behind America's well-earned and long- established reputation of being the most welcoming Nation on earth.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  for his leadership.   I thank the gentlewoman from the State of Washington for her grand  and superb and astute leadership in understanding the Bill of Rights.   I have watched this debate, and I have seen people go to the  microphone and talk about ``on the left.'' I didn't know the  Constitution was on the left or the right. I thought the Constitution  was a document that our Founding Fathers started with the language ``to  form a more perfect Union.'' And in the Bill of Rights, citizens or  noncitizens can have access to due process just because of the basic  foundation of this Nation.   For a moment, I am going to pause, but I rise to support  enthusiastically the Access to Counsel Act, H.R. 1573. But let me  pause, as a resident and citizen of a border State.   Oh, how interesting it is, the interpretation of those one-time  visitors. What about those of us who have been at the border over and  over again? What about those of us who stood in the dark of night and  saw a 2-year-old or a baby come off the wall.   No, that was not what we wanted. But people fleeing persecution have  always sought to come to the place where the Statue of Liberty stands  in the harbor. As far as I know, she is not gone. There is an Office of  Refugee Resettlement. We have been a refuge for refugees.   Madam Speaker, I can tell you that, in the last 4 years, I saw scenes  that I had never seen in my life. Do I need to remind Republicans of  the children who died in our custody? No, I don't blame those Border  Patrol or others there, my neighbors. But I blame the policies of the  previous administration that did not care and simply left them to their  own devices, which was a crowded, unsanitized place with metallic  blankets and people not able to move because their idea was: Move them  out. Make it so horrible, short of losing their lives, they will leave.   Then, what about the MPP program? I went to Mexico and saw desperate  people in the streets. They had no place to live. They were being taken  advantage of. I don't fault Mexico that, in essence, made an agreement.  Maybe they were intimidated by the last administration and didn't know  what else to do. But the MPP program subjected people to very dangerous  conditions.   So, besides the Biden administration's policy of a closed border,  sending people back who are single adults, but for the ports of entry,  obviously; and, as well, those families, still giving them the  opportunity to apply for asylum, which was literally cut off--domestic  abuse persons couldn't apply for asylum under the last administration-- fleeing bloodshed.   I would rather stand with President Biden and Vice President Harris,  who are strategically trying to work on behalf of the American people,  but they have not left their compassion and humanity at the front door  of the White House.  [[Page H2020]]    This legislation is absolutely in compliance with the Constitution  because what it says is that you have access to counsel. We don't pay  for it. You have legal entry documents, and it is only when you are in  secondary detention that this takes place so that little Ali, who I  mentioned earlier on the floor, coming from Egypt with the appropriate  documents, would have been able to call his father or his uncle, who  was here in Houston, Texas.   Is that not simple humanity? Is that simple kindness? Is that  recognizing the dignity of all people?   What about this New York City design gallery owner detained at an  airport because of this ridiculous process? Of course, that was in  2017, the last administration, Juan Garcia Mosqueda, founder of the New  York art-and-design gallery called Chamber and a decade-long legal  permanent resident. I don't know how he got detained at the John F.  Kennedy International Airport. Not only did he get detained, but he was  shipped back to his native Argentina with no opportunity to talk to  anyone ahead of his gallery art show that very day.   In an open letter titled ``The Visible Wall,'' released by Mosqueda,  he called the experience dehumanizing and degrading. He had his  documents and detailed his 36-hour-long detainment, questioning, and  return to Buenos Aires.   We already know I was getting ready to speak in the last debate on  the No BAN Act. Nigeria was added to the list. I co-chair the Nigerian  Caucus. There are doctors, lawyers, teachers, and businesspersons who  have served from Nigeria in this Nation.   I believe this is a right-thinking bill, the Access to Counsel Act of  2021. I rise to support this legislation, and I oppose all of those who  think that the Constitution no longer exists. Support the bill, H.R.  1573.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee  on the Judiciary, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of H.R.  1573, the ``Access to Counsel Act of 2021'', which would ensure that  certain individuals who are subject to prolonged inspection by U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at ports of entry have the ability  to communicate with and receive the assistance of counsel and other  interested parties at no expense to the government.   The Access to Counsel Act does the following:   Allows individuals who already have legal status in the United States  who are held in secondary inspection at airports or other points of  entry for more than an hour with an opportunity to access legal counsel  or an interested party, such as a relative or someone with a bona fide  relationship, under certain circumstances.   Allows counsel or a covered interested party the ability to advocate  on behalf of the individual by providing information or documentation  in support of the individual.   Affirms the opportunity to access to counsel attaches no later than  one hour after the secondary inspection process begins and as necessary  throughout the process.   Invalidates any effort by CBP to persuade someone to relinquish their  legal status (by executing a I-407 or Record of Abandonment of Lawful  Permanent Resident Status) if that person has been denied access to  counsel or voluntarily waives, in writing, the opportunity to seek  advice from counsel.   In 2017, Juan Garcia Mosqueda, a decade-long legal permanent resident  of the U.S., was detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport in  New York City and sent back to his native Argentina by a CBP agent who  told him that, ``lawyers had no jurisdiction at the borders.''   This statement, made in the weeks following implementation of the  former president's 2017 travel ban, lays bare the vulnerable situation  faced by people upon their arrival to the United States.   Behind closed doors without a friend or counsel, people are subjected  to prolonged questioning, coercion, extended detention, mistreatment  and summary expulsion.   Many lose valuable rights, and sometimes more, as CBP agents  interpret and apply complex immigration rules to decide people's lives  without the benefit of a knowledgeable advocate.   While many within the agency interpret and apply the law competently,  the position does not require more than a high school degree, and CBP  inspectors continue to act as judge, jury and expulsioner without so  much as a  [[Page H2024]]  whisper allowed during that decision making from an attorney  representing the banished.   We are a country of laws, and we hold as a cherished tradition the  concept of due process of law.   The need for this bill became apparent after the Trump Administration  implemented the Muslim ban in early 2017, resulting in individuals  being detained at airports, while others being barred from boarding  flights and pulled off planes abroad.   In 2020, we saw additional instances of CBP officers unjustly  detaining Iranian Americans for up to 12 hours at the northern border  in Blaine, WA and detaining and deporting Iranian students who were  attending U.S. universities and people from Iran traveling on valid  visas.   Immigrants and civil rights activists have also raised concerns that  CBP appears to target individuals for inspection based on racial  profiling, and often holds U.S. citizens with proper documentation in  secondary inspection without access to an attorney.   For example, three Black CBP officers recently filed a lawsuit  against DHS, alleging CBP routinely targets and harasses Black  travelers at the Blue Water bridge between Port Huron and Sarnia on the  Canada-Michigan border.   A March 25, 2021 report by the American Civil Liberties Union of  Michigan examined CBP data on apprehensions at the Michigan-Canada  border and corroborates these allegations.   The report found that between 2012 and 2019, over 96 percent of the  13,000 documented apprehensions involved people of color, and one-third  involved U.S. citizens.   In another example, Tianna Spears, a Black U.S. citizen diplomat  working at the U.S. consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico said that she  was targeted regularly for inspection over a four month period, despite  crossing the border daily, possessing a diplomatic passport and Global  Entry approval, and having registered her car in the SENTRI system.   She states that during these encounters, she was unable to contact  counsel or State Department colleagues who could verify her identity.   After four months of regular apprehensions, she began to develop  symptoms of PTSD, and was forced to transfer to a different post. She  later resigned from the State Department.   Madam Speaker, we must ensure that people are treated fairly during  the inspections process, and to do so at the very minimum requires that  CBP permit representation of counsel when requested during inspections.   I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 1573 and send a powerful message  that this House stands firmly behind America's well-earned and long  established reputation of being the most welcoming nation on earth.                        [From Curbed, Mar. 2, 2017]   Owner of NYC Design Gallery Detained at Airports, Denied Re-entry to                                    U.S.         Juan Garcia Mosqueda, founder of New York art and design       gallery Chamber and a decade-long legal permanent resident of       the U.S., was detained last Friday at John F. Kennedy       International Airport in New York City and was sent back to       his native Argentina, ahead of his gallery's new show--      Domestic Appeal, Part III--which opens tonight.        In an open letter titled The Visible Wall released by       Mosqueda on Tuesday, he called the experience ``dehumanizing       and degrading,'' and detailed his 36-hours-long detainment,       questioning, and return to Buenos Aires.        The reaction from the design community was swift and       impassioned. Posting Mosqueda's open letter on Tuesday, Sight       Unseen wrote: ``We are strongly against this administration's       unfair and un-American targeting of immigrants--and not just       those who are important design gallerists, but all those who       seek to make a better life here.''        Designers, journalists, and other supporters took to       Twitter to rally behind Mosqueda and decry his alleged       treatment.        Of the response from the design community, Mosqueda said       this in a statement emailed to Curbed:        Since issuing the letter . . . I have received tremendous       support from not only the design community in New York but       from people all over the world. I greatly appreciate       everyone's kind words and concern following this unfortunate       incident.        My reason for sharing my experience was to bring to light       the situation currently facing immigrants from around the       world and to encourage my American friends to contact your       local congressmen and push for immigration reform. I am       currently in the process of dealing with my reentry into the       United States and for this reason I am not able to speak with       media at this time. Thank you again for your support.        You can read Mosqueda's open letter in full below.                              The Visible Wall         Dear Friends: This past Friday, February 24, 2017, I was       denied entry into the United States--the nation where I have       been legally residing for the past ten years. The procedure       was dehumanizing and degrading every step of the way.        After being escorted to the secondary inspection premises,       I was brought down for interrogation where I was questioned       under oath and threatened with the possibility of being       barred from entering the country for five years.        The border patrol officer denied me the right to legal       counseling, arrogantly claiming that lawyers had no       jurisdiction at the borders. Shortly after my sworn statement       was delivered to the chief officer in charge, they informed       me that I was not permitted to come into the country and,       therefore, would be forced onto the return flight to Buenos       Aires later that evening.        During the following fourteen excruciatingly painful hours,       I was prohibited from the use of any means of communication       and had no access to any of my belongings, which were       ferociously examined without any warrant whatsoever. I was       deprived of food. I was frisked three times in order to go to       the bathroom, where I had no privacy and was under the       constant surveillance of an officer.        Finally, I was escorted by two armed officers directly onto       the plane and denied my documents until I reached my       destination, Buenos Aires.        This thirty-six hour nightmare is nothing but clear       evidence of a deeply flawed immigration system in the United       States, carried out by an administration that is more       interested in expelling people than admitting them.        I was educated in America, worked at prestigious design       entities, and, now, as you all know, own a gallery which       employs Americans and non-Americans alike. Chamber supports       architecture and design studios in the United States and       abroad.        I own several properties in New York and have collaborated       in numerous projects with architects, contractors, and       construction workers to bring to life projects around the       city. We have created a network within the creative       industries that span all disciplines and media that help       individuals sustain their practices and do what they love.        We proudly carry the New York flag to every fair that we do       and every project we initiate across the globe. We self-      publish books printed in the United States. And, needless to       say, we pay considerable federal and state taxes that help       fund many of the societal aspects that fuel the American       engine.        Although I am not an American citizen, Chamber is an       American product that I hope adds to the cultural landscape       of the country. The gallery was conceived in alignment with       the same idea of inclusion that was found in the streets of       the Lower East Side (where I live and was denied access to)       not so long ago: a melting pot of all nationalities and       religions, importing ideas from abroad to a culturally       embracing metropolis.        We have worked with over 200 artists and designers, from       Tokyo to Los Angeles, from Amstetdam to Santiago, in our less       than three years of existence and rely heavily on social       mobility to get our message across and display the works that       we want to show.        To my American friends, I urge you to contact your       congressmen and push for immigration reform. Push for a       system that does not alienate, intimidate, and bully       foreigners but that, on the contrary, welcomes and encourages       citizens from all countries to want to keep investing in and       contributing to your wonderful country.        This coming Thursday, I will not be able to celebrate the       opening of our newest show, Domestic Appeal, which my team       and I worked hard to conceive, and will not be able to meet       some of the incredible participants that are traveling to the       United States to take pride in displaying their creations in       one of the most culturally relevant cities on the planet.        Please come see it, have a glass of wine, and enjoy it on       my behalf!        Hope to see you all very soon,                                              Juan Garcia Mosqueda,                                           Buenos Aires, Argentina.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce for the constant diligence that he has in the  landscape of healthcare and energy, consumer issues. Certainly, as a  member of the Committee on the Judiciary, we are looking forward to  working with this committee on a very important matter.   So I want to acknowledge the work of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and indicate that isn't it sad that we have not been able to  find common ground to work on this issue. I am very concerned that what  we are now doing, we probably would need more time for our committees  to work together. I am concerned that we might be extending the Trump  administration's temporary class-wide emergency scheduling of fentanyl,  a substance that all of us vigorously opposed.   Madam Speaker, I think the chairman is well-aware of my longstanding  concern on criminalizing substance abuse instead of preventing and  treating it. I know that our two committees have a common perspective  and agreement on that, but I have seen failed policies in my own  neighborhood that have disproportionately impacted communities of  color.   For instance, in the 1980s, Congress adopted harsh mandatory minimum  sentences for crack cocaine offenses and putting many in unjust and  lengthy terms of imprisonment.   Madam Speaker, I simply want to indicate an acknowledgment of  fentanyl and its impact that it has had, and I want to acknowledge the  importance of us working together. But I also want to put on the record  my concern with the DEA's temporary order that would group all  fentanyl-related substances under a class-wide ban.   You see, what I know we can document is that the recipient, the  taker, gets the short end of the criminal justice stick, and with that,  I have concerns. But as we take more time to do this, I want to make  sure the traffickers, the cartels, the gangs, are put in the eye of the  storm where they belong.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, just to put on the record that the data shows that  there are already significant racial disparities in some of the Federal  cases and mandatory minimum sentences involving fentanyl analogues.   I don't want to put words in the mouth of my chairman, Chairman  Pallone, but I have heard him speak to these issues, and I am grateful  for it. I am grateful for his sensitivity. So I wanted to come to the  floor knowing the work that has been done, but also knowing your  understanding. And I wanted to just make sure that these communities  that cannot speak for themselves clearly are put on the record.   I need not say that the trial that we just had with the George Floyd  case and what was trying to be represented in that case, albeit was a  very tiny or minute or nonexistent amount. So I want to make sure that  we do this right and we get the time to do it.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.                                                  Washington, DC,                                                     April 19, 2021.      President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: We write to express our serious       concerns with class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-related       substances, joining with our colleagues Senators Booker,       Hirono, Markey, Warren and Whitehouse, who wrote to you about       this issue on April 14. We too commend your commitment to end       mandatory minimums, to address racial disparities, and to       achieve criminal justice reform. We also agree with the       Administration's recognition of the pressing need to       ``eradicate racial, gender and economic inequities that       currently exist in the criminal justice system. We look       forward to working with your Domestic Policy Council and the       interagency working group that has been formed to develop       specific policy solutions for criminal justice reform. At the       same time, we also hope to collaborate with you and your       Administration to enact just and restorative policies that       will meaningfully transform our nation's response to       substance use disorders through the lens of public health and       racial equity.        We agree with our Senate colleagues that fentanyl use is a       serious concern. Combatting substance use, including the       illicit use of fentanyl, is a top priority for all of us.       However, we ask that you reject the last Administration's       misguided approach to the opioid epidemic, especially       regarding class-wide scheduling of fentanyl analogues.        As an initial matter, federal prosecutors may already       pursue charges concerning harmful fentanyl analogues, with or       without class-wide scheduling. In addition, classifying all       fentanyl analogues as Schedule I substances is unnecessary       for federal prosecutions of these cases. Independent from any       temporary scheduling order for certain substances, the       federal government has the authority to prosecute anyone who       possesses, imports, distributes, or manufactures any       unscheduled fentanyl analogue with a high potential for       abuse, no medical value, and the ability to cause overdose       deaths. In addition, the Department of Justice can continue       to prosecute any case involving the illicit manufacturing or       distribution of any fentanyl-related substances under a       separate statutory scheme established by the Federal Analogue       Act. The DEA can also continue to use its existing authority       to schedule specific fentanyl-related substances as       Controlled Substances under the well-established interagency       process.        However, under the Trump Administration, the Drug       Enforcement Administration used its emergency scheduling       authority to place certain fentanyl analogues onto Schedule I       of the Controlled Substances Act. The Temporary Scheduling       Order (``the Order'') scheduled a general ``class'' of       ``fentanyl-related substances.'' In doing so, the Trump       Administration expanded the application of mandatory minimum       penalties to a broader range of federal cases, while also       creating additional barriers to medical research. The Order       also circumvented the standard procedures for the scheduling       of substances under the Controlled Substances Act, preventing       input from the Department of Health and Human Services and       other relevant interagency experts.        The Trump Administration's Order also widened the net as       far as the application of mandatory minimum penalties. As you       know, people of color have been disproportionately subject to       mandatory minimum sentences, preventing judges from being       allowed to apply penalties that fit the facts and       circumstances of each case. Continuation of this Order will       further perpetuate current racial disparities that exist       throughout the criminal justice system. According to the most       recent statistics from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, there       are significant racial disparities in the prosecution of       fentanyl cases, with people of color comprising almost 75% of       those sentenced in 2019. This also holds true for federal       convictions in cases involving fentanyl analogues, for which       68% of those sentenced were people of color. To keep this       approach in place--even temporarily--will further exacerbate       existing racial disparities.        In addition, mandatory minimum penalties continue to       disproportionately impact individuals with a minor role in       the offense. In 2019, more than half of all federal fentanyl-      analogue prosecutions involved a street-level seller or other       minor role. During this challenging time, our most vulnerable       communities, especially communities of color, have been       disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving       forward, we must not exacerbate these health and justice       inequities. We need to reject approaches that expand criminal       penalties, rather than prioritize evidence-based approaches       to this public health crisis.        Moreover, we need to work to reduce barriers to research in       order to expand opportunities to identify antidotes to       fentanyl-analogue overdoses and to improve treatment options.       By extending the Order, critical medical research will       continue to be limited during a time when the country is       facing even greater concerns regarding the opioid crisis and       the rising number of overdoses. For these reasons, we urge       you to discard this misguided approach.        Drug addiction is a serious problem in communities across       the country, and we are profoundly concerned about fentanyl-      related deaths. The current pandemic has furthered worsened       the tragic impact of overdoses as so many Americans continue       to struggle through this isolating and stressful crisis. We       must learn from the lessons of the past as we prioritize       evidence-based, public health approaches and pursue better       and more just means to address this problem, rather than  [[Page H2028]]       the class-wide scheduling of fentanyl analogues.            Sincerely,        Jerrold Nadler, Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr., Hakeem       Jeffries, Ted Lieu, Val B. Demings, Sheila Jackson Lee,       Theodore E. Deutch, David N. Cicilline, Pramila Jayapal,       Mondaire Jones, Deborah K. Ross, Tony Cardenas, Yvette D.       Clark, Cori Bush, and Bobby L. Rush, Members of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to George  Floyd's family, a family that I have come to know even more than the  time we spent together in Houston, Texas.   The family grew up in my congressional district, and they lived in  what is called Cuney Homes, which stands today proud, as I know they  are, of this family. And they, of course, went to the famous Jack Yates  High School.   Why would I pay tribute to this family?   Because I think America has come to see them as America's family, and  the world has come to admire them for their steadfastness, their  passion and compassion, as well as their calm and peaceful  understanding of the crisis and the terrible tragedy that has befallen  them. They have acted in generosity. They have prayed. They have  embraced those who have come to honor them. They realize the symbol  that they stand for, yet they were hurting--hurting and hurting.   Thank goodness for the decision yesterday, the judgment, the just  justice for them, for they are America's family; and their commitment  is that they will continue to serve this country to bring about justice  for all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, with humility, gratitude, and a  broken heart, I rise to anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special  Order in remembrance of Congressman Alcee Hastings, senior member of  the Committee on Rules, a man who travelled the world leading  congressional delegations to defend, protect, and strengthen  democracies while serving as Chair of the Helsinki Commission, a highly  respected and valued member of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of  this House's greatest debaters, one of the first three African  Americans elected to this body from Florida since Reconstruction, a  member of Congress for 28 years, my mentor, a beloved colleague, and  dear friend who died Tuesday, April 6, 2021, at the age of 84.   Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings, who was affectionately referred to by  his colleagues and constituents as ``Judge Hastings,'' was a statesman  and strong supporter of equality, economic and social justice, civil  rights, Israel, and human dignity for all.   He took to heart and lived the admonition he received from his father  as a young child'' ``Be your own boss man,'' who through it all was his  own man as he blazed trails and pioneered paths to improve the lives  and life chances of the was so honored to serve.   Alcee Lamar Hastings was born September 5, 1936, in Altamonte  Springs, to Julius Hastings, a butler, and Mildred nee Merritt, a maid.   His parents left Florida to find jobs .to earn money for Alcee's  education, during which time he was raised by his maternal grandmother  and attended Crooms Academy in Sanford, Florida, which was founded for  African-American students, graduating in 1953.   Five years later, Alcee Hastings graduated from Fisk University with  dual majors in zoology and botany.   Alcee Hastings started law school at Howard University before  transferring to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in  Tallahassee, from which he received his law degree in 1963.   Always a fighter and foot soldier for justice, Alcee Hastings was  involved in early civil rights struggles, including the famous sit-ins  in drugstore lunch-counters in North Carolina in 1959.   About those times, he later said: ``Those were the early days of the  civil rights movement, and the people in Walgreens were breaking eggs  on our heads and throwing  [[Page H2036]]  mustard and ketchup and salt at us. We sat there taking all of that.''   ``After graduating from Florida A&M law school, Alcee Hastings went  into private practice as a civil rights lawyer in Fort Lauderdale, but  when he first arrived a motel refused to rent him a room; a humiliating  experience inflicted on African Americans whenever they traveled in the  United States before passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   As a civil rights lawyer, Alcee Hastings successfully filed lawsuits  to desegregate the public schools in Broward County, Florida, as well  as the Cat's Meow, a restaurant that was popular with white lawyers and  judges but would not serve African Americans.   It was poetic justice indeed when then Florida Governor Reuben Askew  appointed Alcee Hastings to the circuit court of Broward County in 1977  and held the investiture ceremony at a high school he had helped  desegregate.   In 1979, Alcee Hastings was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to  serve as United States District Judge on the United States District  Court for the Southern District of Florida, becoming the first African  American federal judge in Florida; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate  on October 31, 1979, sworn in on November 2, 1979, and served for a  decade until leaving the bench in October 1989.   As a judge, Alcee Hastings established his own style, eschewing the  typical judicial mien of grave reserve; he cracked jokes from the  bench, dropped slang in rulings and interviews, and was unflinching in  his support for the poor and the dispossessed.   In 1981, Judge Hastings exasperated the Department of Justice when he  extended a court order blocking the deportation of 76 Haitians after  the Immigration and Naturalization Service had stepped up removals.   Many thought that with his departure from the federal bench, Alcee  Hastings's career in public service had come to end but they  underestimated this irrepressible and indomitable human being, who  never forgot the lesson taught him years ago by his father: ``Be your  own boss man!''   So three years later, in 1992, Alcee Hastings ran for Congress from  the newly created 23rd Congressional District of Florida and won  election in November of that year and, along with Congresswomen-elect  Carrie Meek and Corrine Brown, became the first African Americans  elected to Congress since Reconstruction, where he would go to be a  productive and constructive member as Dean of the Florida Congressional  Delegation, Vice-Chair of the Committee on Rules, and Vice-Chair and  senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.   One of the great joys of my life was serving with Alcee Hastings when  he chaired the Helsinki Commission, the Organization for Cooperation  and Security in Europe, and we traveled often to distant capitals to  meet with our counter-parts in Europe and work on ways to strengthen  economic and political ties and support their democratic aspirations.   Alcee Hastings was held in such high esteem by international  legislators that he was elected the first African American president of  the 323-member OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, an institution of the  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe charged with  facilitating inter-parliamentary dialogue, an important aspect of the  overall effort to meet the challenges of democracy throughout the OSCE  area.   Madam Speaker, in these days of trial and challenge, I am reminded  that our dear departed colleague Alcee Hastings always counseled us to  remain steadfast, saying:   ``Continuing to do nothing in the face of continued threats to our  people and our way of life is hardly what the American people elected  us to do.''   Alcee Hastings, the recipient of numerous honors and awards bestowed  on him from organizations both at home and abroad, firmly believed that  progress and change can be achieved through mutual respect and  appreciation, and that individuals and communities can see beyond the  limits of parochialism, enabling them to better understand each other.   And we all know how proud he was to be a Nupe, a member of Kappa  Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., and a member of the National Bar  Association.   Alcee Hastings' commanding presence will forever be missed; we all  mourn his loss and extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Patricia  Williams; his children, Alcee Hastings II, Chelsea Hastings and Leigh  Hastings; his stepdaughter, Maisha; and all the relatives and friends  who loved him so dearly.   My deepest sympathies go out to them, and I pray they find  consolation in the certain knowledge that the Judge is now resting in  the Heavenly Chorus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman so very much  for yielding tonight, and I thank her for establishing the uniqueness  of this Special Order.   It is a special Special Order in tribute and in remembrance of Alcee  Lamar Hastings, a tireless fighter for justice and equality, dean of  the Florida Congressional Delegation, former United States District  Court judge, first African American elected to Congress from Florida  since Reconstruction, vice chair of the Committee on Rules, and former  member of the Intelligence Committee, chairman of the Helsinki  Commission, Member of Congress for 28 years, mentor, beloved colleague,  and dear friend.  [[Page H2037]]    Madam Speaker, tonight, with humility, gratitude and a broken heart,  I rise to anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order in  remembrance of Congressman Alcee Hastings, a senior member of the  Committee on Rules, a man who traveled the world. Most of all, he loved  his family, he loved his country, he loved his State of Florida, loved  his friends and his colleagues. We humble ourselves today to honor him.   Madam Speaker, I will reserve my words and tribute so that I can  acknowledge one of his dear friends, the Honorable Bennie Thompson.  Bennie Thompson, the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, a  distinguished gentleman from Mississippi, a fighter for justice  himself, but as well, the opportunity to be able to lead this country  into safety.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), and if I might say, the gentleman with the white jacket as a  member of the great Divine Nine, the Kappas.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words  of reminding us how forthright and direct Alcee Hastings was.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer),  distinguished majority leader of the House, who gave an eloquent  portrayal this morning at our celebration service of his relationship  with Congressman Hastings and his understanding of Congressman  Hastings' contribution and value to all of us.    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that  [[Page H2038]]  personal tribute of the bond of love between his friend, Alcee  Hastings, and himself. I thank him for that story and tribute.   Madam Speaker, it is now an honor to yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the co-chair of the Florida  delegation, the cardinal of the Appropriations Committee, but I think  this evening what she would most want to be known as, certainly a  mentee of earlier years, but a very dear friend of Congressman Alcee  Hastings.    Madam Speaker, it is certainly a privilege as well.   I thank Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz for the personal stories she  has shared with us, and her friendship.   Madam Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), known as an expert on all things agricultural; a  civil rights leader; as well in this place, in this House, a cardinal  himself. But I believe what he will share with us tonight is a personal  relationship with Congressman Alcee Hastings, a Kappa. And, yes,  Congressman Bishop is a Kappa.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Bishop for  letting us know that the world is a better place because of Alcee  Hastings.   Now it is my privilege again to introduce another of Congressman  Hastings' dear, dear friends, the chairwoman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee as well as a proud member of the Divine Nine and a  great Texan.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas  for her recognition of Alcee's complimentary words about Texas, but he  was still our friend. I thank Congresswoman Johnson for that tribute.   Again, this is a very special tribute, and I might say special,  special tribute to our friend, the late Alcee Lamar Hastings.   To provide another tribute is one of our members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, a member of the leadership of the cochair of the  Democratic Policy and Steering Committee, a cardinal on the  Appropriations Committee, and it is known that often people say:  Barbara Lee speaks for me.   The Honorable Congresswoman Barbara Lee is from California, a State  that loves Texas as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    We will be reminded of those colorful socks. That  was his trademark, and that is very special. This is a special tribute  to Congressman Alcee Hastings.   Our next tribute presenter is Gwen Moore from the great State of  Wisconsin. Gwen Moore has been a fighter for the vulnerable and serves  on the distinguished and powerful Ways and Means Committee. I thank my  colleague and friend on the Helsinki Commission.   Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin for her kind words. Those were memorable times, and the  historic nature of his leadership was not only national; it was  international.   I am privileged again in this very special tribute to be able to  yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia. States are quite close to each  other, and of course, her passion matches the deep passion of  Congressman Alcee Hastings. That is the obvious reason for her kinship  to Congressman Hastings, but also the ability to have suffered in loss  but stand up to fight for justice, and that is our friend and  colleague, Lucy McBath, from Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for that  sense of kinship, with her tribute and a reference to his kindness and  his wisdom.   I hope everyone knows that we are telling a very special story this  evening. To join us in that is a Floridian. I always like to pronounce  it in a way that indicates the bonding of Floridians, but, certainly,  Floridians of a certain kind, like Alcee Hastings with the  distinguished former chief of police, Val Demings, a senior member of  the Intelligence Committee, a member of the Judiciary Committee and  Homeland Security Committee, and a Floridian with deep roots and a  friend of Congressman Hastings.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    We are truly grateful for his life.   Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I will bring this Special Order to a  close, and I want to remind our colleagues of this very special Special  Order led by Chairwoman Joyce Beatty. Then, we heard from Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, Sanford Bishop, Bennie Thompson, Eddie Bernice  Johnson, our Majority Leader Hoyer, Barbara Lee, and Gwen Moore. We  heard from Lucy McBath and Val Demings, and we heard from others in  their voices throughout the day and in their statements.                                time  1945    So let me try to summarize this life. This giant of a man was a  Federal judge and a tireless fighter for justice and equality. He was  the dean of the Florida delegation. He led an international  organization never before led by an American, never before led by an  African American.   But let me tell you what I believe really meant something to Alcee's  life. First, his beautiful wife, Patricia, and all of his family  members who we pay tribute to for sharing him with us. But he was a  Florida A&M man. He was a Fisk man. All over the country, I would hear  Fiskites saying: ``Alcee Hastings went to Fisk.'' And Alcee Hastings  would let you know he went Fisk University. He honored that university,  and they honored him.   As a member of the National Bar Association myself, that is where I  got to know Alcee Hastings. Oh, as a little, small pip of a lawyer  myself, I looked up to Alcee Hastings and the words that he would say.  In his own organization, he would be a guest speaker, a civil rights  lawyer, as well as a civil rights fighter.   Yes, Alcee Hastings was born to a butler and a maid who left the  South so that they could get money for him to go to school. And his dad  said to him: ``Be your own boss.''   As I said, he ultimately went on to law school. But he also sat at  the sit-in counters: Walgreens, where the individuals put ketchup and  smashed eggs on him. Oh, Alcee could have turned around with vengeance,  but he understood the message of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that  violence begets nothing, and he peacefully sat. But that didn't mean  that he was going to allow them to get the best of Alcee Hastings.   He went on to be a civil rights lawyer. He went on to file lawsuits  and desegregate the schools and the Cat's Meow restaurant that he had  gone to.   Wasn't it poetic justice when he was named a circuit court judge and  the investiture ceremony was at the high school that he had helped  desegregate?   Yes, he was a Federal judge. Yes, of course, he did great things. He  stopped the deportation of 76 Haitians, when they thought they were  gone.   Then, in 1992, he made history again, becoming one of the first  African Americans coming up to this great body from Florida since  Reconstruction, joining Corrine Brown and Carrie Meek.   The Helsinki Commission was a special love for him. Can you imagine  an international organization led for the first time--they had to vote  for him. And that was a place where they raised up the issue of  slavery. They raised up reparations. They raised up human rights. They  raised up stopping hatred around the world. Alcee set that tone.   Then, of course, he continued to counsel, even in these times. I  would come to him. Lucy McBath reminded me, as a cancer survivor, you  would always check on him. But I tell you, he would walk in with those  socks and those suits, and he would be having a pep in his step.   But let me leave you with this: Continuing to do nothing in the face  of continued threats to our people and our way of life is hardly what  America elected us to do.   So as I close, let me simply say: Deepest sympathy. But let me remind  his family that those who die in the Lord--and I paraphrase--they will,  in fact, rest from their labor, but their deeds will follow them. Alcee  Hastings' deeds will follow him. A tribute to America, a Floridian, a  son, and a great man, both of this Nation and as a freedom fighter.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
