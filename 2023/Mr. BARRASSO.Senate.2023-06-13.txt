 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Centennial  of Evansville, WY. Located in Natrona County, just east of the city of  Casper, Evansville is home to 2,746 residents. Settled along the North  Platte River, the area boasts many opportunities for outdoor recreation  and activities. Visitors to the Edness Kimball Wilkins State Park can  enjoy fishing, hiking, canoeing, and biking. Named after Edness  Wilkins, a longtime Natrona County legislator, the park is also a great  place for wildlife viewing.   Evansville's history is built upon a legacy of opportunity. With its  proximity to the North Platte River, the area was a gateway to the  West. The area, originally popular with mountain men and fur traders,  attracted thousands of American Pioneers along the Oregon, California,  and Mormon trails during the 1850s and 1860s.   In the fall of 1852, French trader John Baptiste Richard built the  first successful bridge over the North Platte River. He designed the  thousand-foot bridge with reinforced wood piers meant to withstand high  water and strong currents. Given his accent, many thought Richard  pronounced his name ``Reshaw.'' Thus, the crossing became widely known  as Reshaw's Bridge. It was completed in 1853 and was immensely popular.  That year, nearly 50,000 people paid fees to cross the river safely.   As traffic at the bridge increased, a settlement developed in the  area. This included a trading post, where travelers could barter for  buckskin clothing, moccasins, and other supplies.  [[Page S2065]]  Eventually, competition from other bridges and alternate routes drew  visitors away, and the post was abandoned.   In 1855, the US Army established Fort Clay, an outpost of Fort  Laramie, where soldiers protected citizens living in the area. By 1856,  the fort housed the 10th Infantry, led by Captain Henry Heth. It was  renamed Camp Davis in honor of Jefferson Davis. The Army briefly used  Camp Davis from 1855 to 1856 and later as a supply post during the  Mormon war.   During an especially hard winter in 1865-66, soldiers from nearby  Fort Caspar dismantled Reshaw's Bridge and used it for firewood. Today,  a replica of the bridge stands in Reshaw Park in Evansville. The town  of Evansville also maintains a free exhibit in the community center  detailing the site's history.   In 1911, William T. Evans, an English immigrant, homesteaded a plot  of land in the area and began a successful ranch. As the area grew,  Evans began parceling off property for homes and businesses. He built  many of the area's most prominent buildings, including the Bishop House  in Casper, which was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic  Places in 2001. Evansville was officially incorporated on May 15, 1923.   Evansville and the surrounding area experienced rapid growth during  the oil boom of the 1920s, with the discovery of oil and natural gas at  Salt Creek Oil Field. During this time, Evansville was home to two of  the State's 16 refineries. The Texas Company, established in 1922, and  White Eagle Oil and Refining, established in 1923, boosted the small  town's economy. While oil and natural gas development is still a  primary economic driver, Evansville has many thriving small businesses  whose owners are committed to giving back to the community.   The only Wyoming State Veterans Cemetery--Oregon Trail State Veterans  Cemetery--is also located in Evansville. Built in 1983, the cemetery  holds regular events to honor our current, former, and fallen U.S.  servicemembers.   On November 11, 2022--Veterans Day--I was honored to join members of  the Evansville community in honoring the life and service of Leo  Sanchez. Leo, a Casper native, served as a U.S. Marine in the Korean  war. Officials renamed a bridge leading from the cemetery to Evansville  the Leo R. Sanchez Freedom Bridge. It is a testament to his decades of  service as a teacher, mentor, and American hero.   There are several events planned to celebrate Evansville's  centennial. On May 15, the town's actual centennial, Evansville's first  responders hosted a parade. Students at Evansville Elementary School  spent time learning about the area's history and contributed to a time  capsule. On June 24, town officials and residents will celebrate its  100th birthday with a family-friendly festival in Reshaw Park. There  will be vendors, food trucks, and live music and a fireworks show. I  appreciate the efforts of Evansville council member Candace Machado and  the members of the centennial planning committee: Alona Vigneault, Town  Clerk Janelle Underwood, PW Director Robert Lewallen, Carol Knop,  Ardell Breed, Fire Chief Leo Malsom, and Police Chief Mike Thompson.   The Town of Evansville is led by these dedicated individuals:         Chad Edwards, Mayor        Candace Machado, Council Member        Dacia Edward, Council Member        Greg Flesvig, Council Member        Janelle Underwood, Clerk        Lexi Erickson, Treasurer        Shane Porter, Planning/Zoning Director        Robert Lewallen, Public Works Director        Mike Thompson, Police Chief        Leo Malsom, Fire Chief    Evansville is a remarkable place. I applaud the citizens who continue  to improve their community, making it a safe and welcoming place for  all to visit. In honor of Evansville's centennial celebration, my wife  Bobbi joins me in recognizing this special milestone.                            ____________________
