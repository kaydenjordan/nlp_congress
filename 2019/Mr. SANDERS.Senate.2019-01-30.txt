 Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the ninth annual State of the Union essay contest  conducted by my office.   The essays follow, in alphabetical order according to the finalists'  names.   The material follows:    Megan Benway, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Junior, Finalist         A problem that is growing rapidly in our world would be the       increase in children entering foster care due to the opioid       crisis. The White House stated that ``in 2016, more than two       million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit       opioids.'' This shows that there is a huge climb in the       amount of people getting addicted. Emily Birnbaum and Maya       Lora, writing for The Hill, reported that ``the population of       children in foster care had risen by 15 percent to 30 percent       in just the last four years.'' This shows that due to opioid       crisis, the foster care system is filling up, and they don't       have enough homes for the children.        The first solution that could help would be to get more       funding for the state to use on children and treatments.       There has been funding given due to President Trump taking       office; ``more than $1 billion in funding has been allocated       or spent directly addressing the drug addiction and opioid       crisis'' (The White House). A couple ways the funding could       be used for would be for hiring more social workers. A lot of       the children don't get the attention they need because there       are so many cases of children for one person to do.        The second solution would be to make getting treatment       easier, not only getting more  [[Page S767]]       treatment homes but also making them more affordable. It       could go from anywhere from $650 to $250 a day (American       Addiction Centers). That's a lot of money for someone who is       struggling with an addition and could be almost impossible to       get. With the funding they can invest ``in residential       substance treatment program[s] that keeps families together       while a parent gets help'' (The Hill). By doing this the       treatment center is giving the parents an incentive to get       better and follow through with the treatment.        The third solution that could help would be keeping the       families together. In the paragraph above The Hill mentioned       a center where addicts can get help but still be with their       families. One thing that would be good about keeping family       together is ``once [they finish their] treatment and are       stable, [they] can reintegrate [the people] into [their] old       work and apartment and things that will keep [them] clean and       not create unsafe circumstances for [their] children to be       taken away''(The Hill). This treatment center could       potentially decrease the number of children entering foster       care by a lot.        All of the above solutions could help drop the number of       children in foster care. This is an important issue because       many American children and adults are being affected by this       problem. I know from experience that it hurts to be a child       who watches their parents rely on drugs, and then one day       some random person comes and takes the child away. There       needs to be a change, and it must happen fast. If it doesn't       I'm afraid that many children and adults will be stuck in a       solution that could kill them all.         Thomas Buckley, Colchester High School, Freshman, Finalist         Abraham Lincoln reminded us that ``a house divided against       itself cannot stand.'' Today, America feels almost as divided       as it was before the Civil War. Partisan news channels and a       primary system that favors playing to the base have produced       election cycles lacking in civility and meaningful       discussion. However, the erosion of respectful political       discourse and the increased polarization of the electorate       are not entirely the fault of politicians nor the voters who       elect them. They are instead inevitable consequences of the       First Past the Post (FPTP) voting system we use to elect our       representatives.        First Past the Post (or plurality voting) is a voting       system where each voter has one vote and the candidate with       the most votes wins. While this system is intuitive and       simple, it is fatally flawed. Because plurality voting has       only one winner, and one vote per person, it is impossible       for elections to have more than two viable candidates. Any       additional strong candidates will result in the winner       earning less than half of the vote. To illustrate my point,       imagine a scenario in which there are three candidates: a       center-right candidate, a center-left candidate, and a more       liberal candidate. If half of the voters are right-leaning       and half are left-leaning, the two left-leaning candidates       will inevitably split the liberal vote and lead to an easy       conservative victory, whether or not more people would have       preferred either one of the two left-leaning options.       Therefore, to avoid the negative effects of splitting the       vote, voters must vote strategically by voting against the       candidate they most prefer to avoid electing the candidate       they most dislike. Because voters must vote strategically,       elections in FPTP systems produce two major parties defined       by their opposition to each other. Campaigns become       increasingly negative as the parties compete in a ``race to       the bottom'' to vilify the other party's candidate instead of       promoting their own positive ideas. This is exacerbated by a       primary process that favors the most uncompromising       candidates.        Attempts to address the problems with FPTP voting are being       made. For example, Maine recently transitioned to Ranked       Choice Voting, a system where voters can rank their favorite       candidates rather than choosing only one option. This       improves political discourse and favors moderation because       politicians must compete for second place votes as well as       first choice votes. Ranked Choice Voting eliminates the       incentive for politicians to run negative campaigns. It       doesn't make sense to dismiss the opposition if you want       their voters to support you.        Consequently, campaigns under a Ranked Choice system tend       to be more civil, with less polarized electorates. When       politicians spend all of their time playing to their base,       they have no incentive to compromise with the other side,       weakening democracy. Because Ranked Choice Voting encourages       civil discussion, politicians are more likely to work with       each other on issues that are important to the American       people. American democracy is broken. We should fix it by       changing how we elect our civil servants.            Brendany Byrne, Essex High School, Junior, Finalist         The greatest problem our country faces is not just a       national problem, but a problem that affects the entire       world--climate change. Climate change will impact all of the       people of the world regardless of race, gender, or social       class. If our country does not address this problem, the       world will be destroyed. In October, the Intergovernmental       Panel on Climate Change released a report warning that unless       humanity drastically reduces CO2 emissions, the       change to the world's climate will become irreversible.       Arctic sea ice will disappear. Sea levels will rise to the       point where coastal cities will become completely submerged.       Extreme weather will become more frequent. Potable water and       food will become more scarce. Yet many people in the United       States still deny that climate change exists, or they believe       that there is nothing they can do to change the outcome. This       ignorance and sense of powerlessness is dangerous at this       critical point in time because the solution to climate change       requires the people of the world to come together and act as       one.        Under the Trump administration, the United States has       stopped participating in the global effort to stop climate       change. Mr. Trump has stated that the United States will       withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as possible. This       is a rash decision considering the consequences of ignoring       climate change. Instead of running away from reality, the       United States should accept the responsibility of being a       global power and rise to the challenge of saving the world       from climate change.        To solve the problem of climate change, it will take a       large scale effort. Similar to the American war effort during       the Second World War, every American will need to get behind       the movement to stop climate change, and it is the       government's responsibility to lead the people in this       struggle. The government needs to issue stricter regulations       on the emissions produced by large businesses. Instead of       spending an enormous amount of money on the military, the       government needs to invest money for scientific research to       stop climate change. The government must offer incentives for       people to live sustainably or impose a gas tax to reduce       emissions. The United States needs to work with other nations       to share ideas and solutions. Jobs can also be created from       the work that will be required to clean the environment, on       the federal, state, and local level. The public education       system has already started educating people about climate       change and its dangers. Hopefully, this education will help       change the culture so that the American people actively want       to address climate change.        In the past, America has proven that it can unify as a       nation and tackle global problems. It is simply a matter of       Americans seeing the dangers of climate change and realizing       that it must be our top priority. We must lead the rest of       the world and become a role model for the world. We need to       engage the government so that we change ourselves instead of       the climate.         Caroline Cassell, Hartford High School, Freshman, Finalist         Xenophobia is one of America's greatest debacles. Defined       as the fear of foreigners, xenophobia has unnecessarily       increased over the past few years due to numerous factors.       America was founded by immigrants, yet we now prosecute those       flocking here in search of better lives.        American immigration has always fluctuated due to the       extent of xenophobia in the country at the time. During World       War II numerous Jewish refugees flocked to America seeking       safety from the Nazis. Among these people was Albert       Einstein, now seen as one of America's greatest minds. We       have seen this occurring recently with the immigration ban on       Syrian immigrants. In the modern day, war torn Syrian asylum       seekers are denied entrance to America and are left living in       overcrowded refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. America's       policy: keep them out, they may be terrorists.        Immigrants living inside U.S. borders are being denied the       right to naturalize. Children of illegal immigrants who used       to be protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals       (DACA) are now unsure of their safety after DACA was       suspended by President Trump. These harmless people whose       parents wanted a better life for their children are denied       citizenship due to xenophobia. The act of separating families       or deporting innocent children to countries where they are       unfamiliar with the language and culture is unjust.        My family lived in Saudi Arabia for six years. Living       internationally taught me to be open-minded towards everyone;       I attended an international school with students from over       100 nations. Every student was like me, and deserved the same       rights. When I returned to the America I was alienated by       classmates who posed ridiculously ignorant questions such as       ``Are you Muslim?'' ``Are you going to bomb the school?''        The issue at hand is fear. Americans need to open their       eyes and educate themselves about the world, not just their       country. Only 36% of all Americans have passports, and       organizations such as the U.S. Peace Corps, which encourage       world connections are struggling to find volunteers. We must       eliminate our fear is through education. By educating       citizens about the outside world, whether it be by inviting       more refugees into our country, sending more Americans abroad       to do service work, or having immigrants talk about their       experiences, we will be able to reduce hatred and fear. We       don't need a wall, we need to tear down our own walls of       ignorance and hatred.        Without immigrants, America would not be the extraordinary       country it is today. Through history, we have looked down on       immigrants, and have created ``nativist'' groups who yearned       to exclude immigrants from their society. Everyone deserves       the rights that all Americans have; many do not have the       access to such rights in their home countries. By excluding       those willing to become citizens, we not only deny them       opportunities in this country, but we deny them of  [[Page S768]]       their rights. Let's ``Make America Great Again'': let's       educate each other about the world around us and share our       rights with those in search of better lives.       Collin Chutter-Casey, Burlington High School, Senior, Finalist         Where do you imagine the human race being in 20 years? 50       years? The effects of climate change should be front and       center in our minds when fantasizing about a space age world.       The human desire for technology and cheap cost of living       negates responsibility to the environment. Climate change       means more than a rise of a few seemingly insignificant       degrees over centuries of human innovation and       industrialization; however, the rising oceans and       temperatures, animal extinction, and increased natural       disasters are the real world effects that cost us an       increasing amount of money, resources, and even human lives       to sweep under the rug.        One of the main effects of climate change is the rise of       ocean height and temperature. According to NASA, a federally       funded organization, the sea level will rise 1-4 feet by the       year 2100. This is in addition to the eight inch rise in sea       levels since 1880. A rise of 1-4 feet in sea levels is       comparable to the shallow end of a swimming pool, but in the       real world means millions of homes and businesses destroyed       on the vulnerable coastline, which cannot be restored as we       do with hurricanes and tornadoes. Climate change by itself       may not seem to be a huge issue, but the ripple effect it       creates causes colossal damage.        When solving these problems, we cannot think of our own       lives, but rather future generations. Humans do not have the       power to predict the future, but we can shape the future.       There are two parts to the solution of climate change:       Mitigation and Adaptation. Adaptation is adjusting to the       effects of climate change. This plan does not deal with the       issue of slowing and preventing climate change, but with       preventing the effects of global warming from changing the       way people live, even if it does change where they live.       Mitigation is reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that       are released into the atmosphere. For mitigation to be a       viable solution to solve the earth's warming, we need a       global plan for a global problem. This means that, as a       global community, we need laws to promote and enforce       renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal),       sustainable houses and buildings, eliminate litter, cut down       on trash, cut down on resource use, the list goes on. This       intensive process requires a change in mindset, and support       and participation from all people in all nations.        Let the U.S. stand where the world knows it to be, one step       ahead of others, and carry all nations to the solution of       global warming. We know the mass destruction that global       warming can cause, and the best solution to counter it. So       now let the question we ask not be what we imagine the world       to be in 20 years, but what is necessary to get there.        Felicia Daigle, Rice Memorial High School, Junior, Finalist         The world today revolves around our dependency on       convenience. We live in a society that works to make our       lives easier through inventions like drive-thrus and one-use       items. Ignoring the effects of this dependency has resulted       in an environmental crisis that seems to be too great to fix.       The fact that 18 million pounds of plastic enters our oceans       annually should shock our generation and instill a sense of       ownership about this issue (Howard). Realizing that plastic       dominates most of our consumerism and convenience needs       should prioritized reducing its production. The way to treat       this issue would be by placing a ban on unnecessary plastic       goods and an emphasis on teaching students about our oceans       and environment instead of ignoring the problem.        By banning plastic accommodations like straw, bags, and       bottles, over 14 billion tons of plastic waste could be       prevented (Howard). The United States would be joining other       nations like the United Kingdom and India in an effort to       reduce plastic waste. The European Commission proposed, ``a       ban on 10 common items that it says make up about 70 percent       of the litter in EU waters. This includes plastic straws,       drink stirrers, plates, and more'' (Howard). All these items       seem to make life easier but they have become the reason for       the world's struggles with plastic pollution.        When we share the knowledge about how harmful plastic has       become, then we take responsibility about choosing a plastic       water bottle because it's easy. I only learned about the dire       state of our oceans a few years ago when I walked on the       beaches in Santa Barbara and saw plastic Starbucks cups and       straws intertwined with the seaweed that had washed up onto       shore. From that moment I realized that plastic does not go       anywhere but into landfills and if we keep producing more and       more, none of our beaches will have no plastic debris. If       schools took action and speak about plastic waste, there       would be no excuse for our ignorance regarding the planet's       environmental state.        Taking plastic pollution seriously, starting by a national       ban on straws, bags, and water bottles, would be the first       step in the right direction. We cannot undo the past, but the       future lies in the decisions we start making today. Plastic,       a man-made product, cannot keep killing thousands of sea       creatures without our government trying to enforce some kind       of change. If the United States does not understand its dire       need for plastic reduction, our future generations will never       know the ocean with plastic filling them.         Paige Dean, South Burlington High School, Senior, Finalist         Members of Congress, I come before you today to speak about       something that is near to my heart. I spend my summers       sailing on beautiful Lake Champlain in my home state of       Vermont, and every Fourth of July my family and I kayak out       into Burlington Bay and watch the fireworks. The lake is part       of many Vermonters' lives; from childhood jokes about Champ,       our local lake monster, to walks along the shore and trips       across on the ferry, our Lake Champlain has been an integral       part of the Vermont experience.        But today, Lake Champlain is suffering, just as the rest of       America is. Devastating hurricanes in the South are       displacing us and flooding our homes and businesses. Droughts       and wildfires in the West raze the ground, destroy our       property, prevent our crops from growing and force us to       flee. Our shining seas are encroaching on our plentiful       shores, the water lapping ever closer, year by year, to our       front stoop. Summers are getting hotter, and storms wilder.       We all know the cause, and what it means for us. Climate       change is real. We are experiencing it right here, right now.       Science does not lie, and all around our nation we are seeing       it firsthand. The homeowners in Louisiana who can't sell       because their house is in a flood zone, the farmers in       Arizona whose crops are withering from drought, the       schoolchildren in Flint, Michigan, whose tap water is unsafe       to drink, and those Vermont who can't utilize their lake due       to dangerous algae blooms.        Every single thing I have listed has its roots in our own       actions. However we twist it, the facts remain: we are       responsible for climate change.        There is still hope. If we act now, we can lessen the       effects of climate change on our homes and livelihoods. I       call now on Congress to pass and support strong and direct       legislation to help our environment and economy. Strengthen       the EPA! Ensure that this vital agency has the resources and       leadership necessary to protect our lands and create real       change. Pass legislation tightening regulations, taxing and       limiting the production and spread of pollutants, give       incentives to alternative clean and sustainable energy       companies, move to limit our reliance on oil and gas, and       make America energy independent and sustainable. We have       thousands of capable scientists, business leaders, policy       experts and engaged citizens ready to work on solutions       and save our planet. Let them! Work with our allies and       neighbors to mitigate climate change worldwide. Rejoin and       support the Paris Climate Agreement! Climate change       affects our whole planet, and only global solutions and       partnership will solve it. Let's work on fostering the       clean energy and environmental protection programs of       other countries through incentives and aid, especially to       developing countries while promoting energy independence.        Solutions are in our grasp, we only have to believe in       them, reach out, and grab them. Otherwise, we are doing       ourselves, the people of America, and indeed the whole world       a great disservice. The world's future, America's future, our       future is at stake. Act now.          Aynsa Denby, St. Johnsbury Academy, Sophomore, Finalist                   Fighting for Women's Reproductive Rights         In America, woman are still continually fighting for       women's reproductive rights 70 years after Roe vs. Wade was       passed. While many people agree that women have a right to       their own body, many politicians still engage in an       unrelenting and increasingly aggressive attacks on women's       reproductive health care. They do this by introducing and       passing unconstitutional bills that would restrict women's       rights, for example by stifling access to essential health       care and endangering women's lives. To put this into       perspective, this, that means hundreds of women's rights are       being taken away with each restriction passed, according to       the National Reproductive Rights Organization. A possible       solution is the Women's Health Protection Act which would       prevent states from passing these dangerous legislations and       would prohibit state and federal politicians from imposing a       range of dangerous anti-choice provisions that take away       women's rights and choice over their own body.        In his first year in office, Trump and his administration       have brought an aggressive campaign against women's sexual       and reproductive rights to the White House, by limiting       women's access to birth control and his anti-abortion       advocacy. To understand the administration's emphasis on       rolling back birth control access and abortion rights, it's       important to remember the administration is filled with       people who have a track record of anti-abortion legislation       and advocacy throughout the years such as Vice President Mike       Pence and Trump's top healthcare advisor Katy Talento. Trump       administration's 2018-'22 draft plan for Health and Human       Services, for the first time ever suggested the federal       health agency will now be ``serving and protecting Americans       at every stage of life, beginning at conception.'' this       language about conception and unborn children signals a shift       toward faith-based decision-making in American health care.       But women's rights are not based on the faith or beliefs of       the government officials but rather each woman's individual       choice, therefore the decision should be up the person whose  [[Page S769]]       body is being affected and not a single groups beliefs.        The Women's Health Protection Act would prevent states from       passing these dangerous legislations and would prohibit state       and federal politicians from imposing a range of dangerous       anti-choice provisions. Senator Sanders needs to expand and       protect the reproductive rights of women by continuing to       fight and support for The Women's Health Protection Act, and       by bringing attention to this continuing struggle for       equality and individual choice over one's own body. Senator       Sanders also can fight to keep Planned Parenthood funded and       covered by Medicaid, as attacking Planned Parenthood remains       a priority for social conservatives in our Congress today. As       of right now 2.5 million people rely on Planned Parenthood       for a range of health care services, like birth control and       cancer screenings, and defunding it would change the health       of millions of Americans as found in the article ``How       Women's reproductive rights stalled under Trump'' by Julia       Belluz. So therefore I am not only asking for continuing       support for women's reproductive rights but also the health       of millions of Americans.                            ____________________
