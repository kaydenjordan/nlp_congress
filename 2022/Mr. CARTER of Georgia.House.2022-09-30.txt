 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  Joe Higgins, chairman of the Veterans of Chatham County organization,  for being awarded the Marne Rockstar Award.  [[Page H8359]]    The Marne Rockstar program recognizes private citizens for their  dedication to serving Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, which are  both in Georgia's First Congressional District. Recipients of the award  must show that they have given back to the bases through outstanding  public service. Joe Higgins has done just that.   As a result of him winning this prestigious award, Joe's photo, along  with a description of his service, will be permanently displayed at  division headquarters. Throughout the years, Joe has given back to the  military bases in many ways. He has given turkeys to junior soldiers at  Thanksgiving, arranged meals for over 700 families for Family Day, and  has secured donations from local distributors.   Joe has gone above and beyond with every opportunity he has gotten.  He could not be more deserving of this award.   On behalf of myself and the First Congressional District of Georgia,  I say thank you, Joe, for giving to our servicemen and -women.                            ____________________
