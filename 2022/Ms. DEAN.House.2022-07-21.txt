 Madam Speaker, it has been nearly a month since the Supreme  Court inexplicably overturned a woman's 50-year right to her private  reproductive healthcare decisions--abortion care.  [[Page H6926]]    In this month, we have heard many on the other side spread  frightening disinformation like Democrats want abortion on demand. No,  Democrats want freedom and choice for women to make their own  reproductive decisions.   Meanwhile, they ignore or don't care about the fact that women are  scared, terrified that they may lose access to very personal  reproductive healthcare medications and procedures.   So, it is necessary that we pass the Right to Contraception Act,  which will guarantee the right to get and use birth control, whether it  is birth control pills, IUDs, or emergency contraceptives.   It is maddening that we even have to vote on this, that a woman's  right to birth control could even be in question, that a privacy right  is even up for political debate. But in this brave new world, this is  where we are.    I support this legislation to protect the rights of our daughters and  granddaughters, nieces and friends, women and girls everywhere.                            ____________________
