 Mr. President, yesterday, President Biden welcomed the  President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, to Washington.   Unfortunately, some of the loudest anti-Israel voices in the  President's own party took President Herzog's visit as an opportunity  to call the world's only Jewish state racist, and House Democrats'  leftwing boycotted President Herzog's joint address to Congress this  morning.   These activist theatrics are unbecoming of elected American  officials, and they are a distraction from the real threats that  America, Israel, and our Arab friends face in the Middle East. I hope  these threats were the focus of the conversation between the two  Presidents.   Of course, threats to our shared interests have grown, in large part  due to the Biden administration's naive approach to the world's largest  state sponsor of terror, Iran.   Over the last 2\1/2\ years, Iran has dramatically increased its  nuclear activities and even rebuffed the administration's repeated  begging for a return to President Obama's flawed deal.   It has consolidated influence in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. It funds  and  [[Page S3131]]  equips terrorist groups dedicated to Israel's destruction, and the  deadly arm of its IRGC extends right up to Israel's borders.   In the Arabian Gulf, Iranian military vessels have targeted or seized  commercial vessels offshore nearly 20 times since 2021. On the Arabian  Peninsula, Iranian weapons have rained down on America's Saudi and  Emirati partners.   In Iraq, Tehran works directly with Shia paramilitaries that threaten  Iraq's sovereignty as well as Iraq's neighbors and U.S. forces and  Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups channel massive flows of  Iranian support into increasing attacks on Israeli and American lives.   Violent flareups along the border with Lebanon earlier this month  have Israel's forces on particularly high alert, but as our friends  face growing threats, they need more bipartisan solidarity from  Washington, not performative BDS or lectures from politicians in glass  houses.   Earlier this year, the President warned ominously that Israel  ``cannot continue down this road'' in its efforts to pass domestic  judicial reforms. According to reports, it is a message he intends to  continue delivering to the Israeli Prime Minister in the weeks to come.   Well, Mr. President, nobody here in Congress seems to like it when  foreign politicians weigh in on American domestic politics and tell us  how to do our job, so I try to stay out of the domestic politics of  fellow democracies.   I have confidence in the Israeli people and their democratically  elected leaders, including President Herzog, whom we welcomed to the  Capitol today, and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who will travel soon to  Washington.   Ironically, the radical House Democrats who crowed about boycotting  the President's historic address are the ones who could benefit the  most from his perspective on guiding a coalition government and a  diverse nation toward greater security, prosperity, and peace.   President Herzog's remarks were a reminder to anyone willing to  listen that, even in the face of growing threats, Israel and its Arab  neighbors continue to offer tremendous opportunities to actually  promote peace.   I was in the region earlier this year, and I can assure any skeptics  that the promise of the Abraham Accords is real. It is changing the  geopolitical and economic climate of a region that remains extremely  important to the United States.   I hope President Biden will seize on this progress and help Israel  and Saudi Arabia improve their relationship--an achievable and  transformational goal. Here in Congress, we have a tremendous  opportunity before us to demonstrate our commitment to Israel by  prioritizing American strength with the NDAA.    I hope our colleagues will continue to work swiftly to finish this  essential business.                              U.S. Supreme Court    Mr. President, now, on another matter, while Democrats like President  Biden may not like the Israeli Government's attempts at judicial  reform, they are obsessed with doing it themselves here in the United  States.   For the past several months, when they are not rubberstamping radical  nominees for the Federal bench, Senate Democrats have been laser- focused on pushing a coequal branch of government and bending it to  their political will. To do so, our colleagues plan to steer the  Judiciary Committee onto the thinnest constitutional ice.   This week, the committee will mark up what Democrats are calling the  Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act. But in the  interests of actual transparency, let's discuss what our colleagues'  intentions here actually are.   For months now, the Justices of the Court have been the subject of an  uptick in pearl-clutching and hysterics from the political left and  their media allies. We have been told we should be outraged that the  Justices dare to buy and sell property and take vacations, that they  speak at universities and write children's books, and that their  spouses dare to pursue careers of their own.   As I have said before, I believe in the integrity and honesty of each  member of the Court, and the Justices and their families should  continue to ignore desperate attacks peddled by Democrats and organs of  yellow journalism.   But no matter which headline is chosen as a pretext on any given day,  it is the same old intimidation campaign by the left to undermine the  Court.   By their own example, Senate Democrats have repeatedly told the  American people that the entire Federal judiciary exists for no other  reason than to fulfill their changing political whims. They have  threatened Justices by name from the steps of the Court and threatened  the institution itself in unfriendly amicus briefs. In each instance,  Democrats have signaled their open disdain for a body that refuses to  interpret the Constitution through the lens of their party's platform.   They have shown how afraid they are of a Court that upholds our laws  as they were actually written, and they have expressed their profound  misunderstanding of the Supreme Court's purpose in our Republic.   But this week, the same Senate Democrats who recently threatened to  strip the Court's security budget would like us to believe that they  are driven by nothing more than the pursuit of ethics and transparency.  The same Democrats who warn solemnly about defending democracy would  like to shatter the independence of a coequal pillar of our government.   The partisan bill before the Judiciary Committee this week deserves  neither the Court's cooperation nor any Senator's support. I would urge  each of our colleagues to reject it.
