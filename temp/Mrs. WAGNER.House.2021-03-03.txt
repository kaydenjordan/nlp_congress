 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1.   Free, fair, and transparent elections are the cornerstone of our  democracy. Americans must be able to trust in the integrity of our  election processes.   This bill, however, federalizes elections and takes control of  elections from State and local governments.   It will grant the Federal Government unprecedented power over voting  processes and pave the way for rampant fraud, abuse, and litigation.   This legislation nullifies voter I.D. laws, allows convicted felons  to vote, legalizes ballot harvesting, and expands mail-in voting.   It even allows, for the first time ever, taxpayer funding of Federal  campaigns, with a 6-to-1 government, taxpayer-funded match in most  cases.   H.R. 1 is a cynical and partisan measure that will erode faith in our  democracy and not restore it.   Every citizen should be confident that every legal vote counts.  Congress has a duty to deliver election reform that honors the will of  the people and the Constitution.   We need meaningful, bipartisan election reform, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose H.R. 1.                            ____________________
