 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Caldwell County resident  Bill Meuth a happy 100th birthday.   Mr. Meuth served as an Army medic in World War II. He stormed the  beaches at Normandy on D-day, fighting with the Allies in the name of  freedom. Prior to the war, he had quit school at an early age to help  care for his father who was sick, representing the ethos of a  generation who understood that commitment to family and country  sometimes comes at a personal cost.   After the war, he worked in the oil fields instilling a strong work  ethic in his family.   In 1943, Mr. Meuth married his sweetheart, Lucy, and they remained  married for 72 years until Miss Lucy passed away in 2015.   Together they had four children, 14 grandchildren, 15 great- grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.   We in south Texas are incredibly thankful for his sacrifice at such a  critical time in our history and for the cause of freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy birthday to Mr. Meuth, and may God bless  him.                         Congratulating Nathan Tudor     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Nathan Tudor for  receiving the Texas Hospital Association Pioneer Award. Each year this  award is given to rural hospital administrators or a CEO who  demonstrates creative and innovative leadership within the organization  and community.   This year the award was given to one of El Campo's very own. Mr.  Tudor came on board as the CEO of El Campo Memorial Hospital in January  of 2017.   Since Mr. Tudor has been on the team, the emergency department has  expanded by 11 beds, three new campus-care clinics have been opened  within the community, five walk-in clinics have been added, and new  physicians have been recruited.   El Campo has directly benefited from the expansion of services but so  have the surrounding communities.   We are thankful for Mr. Tudor and those working with him at the El  Campo Hospital for their efforts in improving and expanding healthcare  services for the El Campo area.                            ____________________
