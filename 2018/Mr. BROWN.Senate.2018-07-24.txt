 Mr. President, this is a big deal for Americans making  $15,000, $20,000, $30,000, or $40,000 a year. They will get a  refundable tax credit if they claim it--if they can figure out how to  claim it, because it is sometimes too complicated. They can get $2,000,  $3,000 $4,000, or sometimes a little more than that, in the refundable  tax credit. That is money in their pockets to buy school clothes. It is  money in their pockets to fix a car that is broken down. It is money in  their pockets so they can take their kids to a restaurant occasionally.   Filing taxes is complicated for everyone. It can be particularly  challenging for those claiming the EITC. Wall Street CEO's and big  companies have armies of accountants. This is for working-class  families making $20,000, $30,000, or $40,000 a year.   I thank Senator Heller. I ask support for the Heller-Brown amendment.  It will matter to so many working families in Mansfield, Toledo,  Sandusky, and all over Ohio.   I yield the floor.
