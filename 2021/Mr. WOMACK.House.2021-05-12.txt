 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this very  important series regarding law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today to honor the men and women in blue.  They have devoted their lives to keeping our communities and families  safe--unflinching in this mission, even when faced with growing  hostility and danger. These guardians stand on the front lines,  regardless of the peril to themselves, not for praise or glory, but to  protect and serve the citizens and uphold law and order. And no matter  the situation, they answer the call of duty.   Mr. Speaker, as I speak, Officer Tyler Franks of the Prairie Grove  Arkansas Police Department is recovering, having been shot in the line  of duty just a few days ago. Officer Franks has undergone multiple  surgeries. He will endure more, and, indeed, has a long road ahead.  Please pray for Officer Franks.   Let us also pay tribute to our fallen heroes. We honor the memory of  Fayetteville Police Officer Stephen Carr, who, in December of 2019, was  assassinated while sitting in his patrol unit behind the police  department because of his uniform. We recognize the quick action of  Corporal Seay Floyd and Officer Natalie Eucce, who immediately acted  and captured the assassin.   We also remember Sebastian County Deputy Bill Cooper and Corporal  Terry Wayne Johnson, both of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in the  line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of the real sacrifices and  dangers faced by our brave officers every day. I am eternally grateful  for those who wear the badge and keep the Third District safe.   This National Police Week, I thank every noble law enforcement  officer in Arkansas and across our Nation for their dedicated service.  We salute them.
