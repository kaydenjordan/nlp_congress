 Mr. Chairman, free speech is the cornerstone of a free and  thriving society.   Unfortunately, recent revelations made in the Twitter files show that  free speech under the First Amendment is under attack--even by those  within our own Federal Government.   Our Founding Fathers fought hard to enshrine the right to free speech  in our Constitution. As social media companies and Big Tech  corporations collude with rogue Federal officials to censor and  deplatform members of our free society--including Members of Congress  and other conservative voices--we must continue to do everything we can  to fight to protect the First Amendment for everyone.   The Protecting Speech for Government Interference Act does exactly  that. It is a victory against the modern-day attacks on our freedom,  and it is a victory for all freedom-loving citizens of the United  States who embrace and accept the right to free speech.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the bill.
