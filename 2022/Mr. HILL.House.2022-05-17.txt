 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Foxx for her work and  leadership on these important issues and for visiting my home State of  Arkansas many times in support of a better workforce.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7309 due to its  lack of innovation and lack of opportunity that I think is embedded in  this legislation.   It is a shame we are on the floor, yet again, debating a bill that  the Democratic majority crafted to please unions and bolster them at  the expense of American workers, small businesses, and nonunion  entities.                                time  1445    Most employers want to provide work-based upskilling, but they are  already hesitant to apply for Federal funds. This bill will make that  process even more complex and burdensome.   In my home State of Arkansas, we are a right-to-work State. This bill  is harmful to my home State.   There are many bad policies embedded in the bill that will harm the  American workforce. This bill will expand Federal control over  workforce standards, limiting the rights of jobseekers. It will do this  while mandating that union representation on State and local workforce  development boards be expanded by 10 percent. Most importantly, this  bill will fail to expand opportunity access for jobseekers.   It is clear that this bill was written to favor unions, not the full  and diverse American workforce. This bill is deeply flawed and another  example of the Democratic majority being out of touch with working  Americans.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the continued death  of freedom and personal rights occurring in greater China.   Last week, Cardinal Joseph Zen, 90 years old, the former cardinal  from Hong Kong, was arrested by the Chinese Communist Party in Hong  Kong for speaking out for democracy.   This arrest threatens the fundamental freedoms of all individuals  with the courage to speak out against the Chinese Communist Party by  demonstrating the extent of the regime's aggression, threatening these  advocates with life in prison or worse.   For years, Cardinal Zen has advocated for democracy and religious  freedom for the Chinese people. I have had the opportunity to meet with  Cardinal Zen and have heard his pleas for freedom and advocacy for  citizens in Hong Kong and Roman Catholics in China.   Next week, we will recognize a week of global prayer for China.  During the week, we will pray for all suffering under the Chinese  regime, including Cardinal Zen.   I urge my colleagues to take a moment to pray for religious tolerance  and individual rights, to pray for a bright and safe future for the  Chinese people, a future without persecution, a future with the  fundamental freedoms we all deserve.   We must keep Cardinal Zen and the other brave individuals advocating  for freedoms that we enjoy here today and every day in our prayers  today, tomorrow, next week, and until the Chinese people are no longer  under the boot of Communist persecution.                   Preserving Peace and Stability in Taiwan     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation  that I have introduced with the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).   Our bill, H.R. 7704, the Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act, is a  necessary step to help deter the Chinese aggression or the potential  aggression, I think we should all hope, against Taiwan.   In 1979, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act to preserve and  promote a close relationship between the United States and Taiwan. For  43 years, the United States has been committed to the preservation of  human rights, peace, and stability for the people on the island of  Taiwan.   Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party has been growing more  comfortable in taking coercive and aggressive actions toward Taiwan.   Our bill will ensure that the financial consequences for CCP  officials and their immediate family members are immediate if they are  tempted to get any ideas from their brutal, repressive, murderous  friends in Russia.   Under my bill, if the President reports to Congress any threat to the  security or social or economic system of Taiwan made by China, as  required under the 1979 act, the Treasury will report on all illicit  and corrupt assets of senior CCP officials and their immediate family  members and will take steps to prohibit these officials from benefiting  from these funds at U.S. financial institutions.                                time  2140    We cannot risk any lack of clarity regarding the U.S. commitment to  Taiwan. Aspiring global strongmen must know personal consequences are  in store for any aggressive behavior.   Madam Speaker, I urge quick consideration and adoption of our bill,  the Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act.
