 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to Rex  Tillerson's nomination to be our next Secretary of State. I don't  believe Mr. Tillerson is an appropriate selection to be our Nation's  chief diplomat.   During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Tillerson repeatedly evaded  questions related to transparency and corporate responsibility. For  instance, on multiple occasions Mr. Tillerson stated that he was  unaware of Exxon's history of lobbying Congress; yet, according to  lobbying disclosure forms, Exxon lobbied against a variety of Iran and  Russia-related sanctions since at least 2010. When pressed on the  matter, Mr. Tillerson even claimed he didn't know if Exxon lobbied for  or against these energy-related sanctions bills.   Additionally, I am troubled by Mr. Tillerson's response to questions  about Exxon's dealings with Iran, Syria, and Sudan. According to public  documents, Exxon established a joint venture with Shell to conduct  business with state sponsors of terror. That joint venture--Infineum-- sold petroleum products to Iran, Sudan, and Syria, when those nations  were being sanctioned by the United States.   During that time, Mr. Tillerson rose from senior vice president to  president and director and eventually to chairman and CEO of Exxon;  yet, during his testimony, Mr. Tillerson claimed to be unaware of  Infineum's purposeful evasion of sanctions. Instead of recognizing the  larger national interest, Mr. Tillerson suggested that American  companies could legally avoid sanctions by setting up shell companies  outside of the United States.  [[Page S548]]    Infineum is not the only example of Exxon's history of undermining  American policy. Under Mr. Tillerson's leadership, Exxon signed oil  exploration contracts with the Kurds in Iraq. Doing so undermined the  United States ``one Iraq'' policy and exacerbated the long-simmering  conflict between the central government and the Kurds. That is because  Exxon signed contracts to explore oil at six sites. Three of those  sites were on disputed land claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi  central government.   By agreeing to explore in disputed territory on behalf of the Kurds,  Exxon changed the facts on the ground in favor of the Kurds. Exxon's  decision may have been good for Exxon, but it certainly did not benefit  a stable, unified Iraq.   I am also concerned by Mr. Tillerson's response to questions about  Russia. Russia has invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, intervened in  Syria, and meddled in our own elections; yet Mr. Tillerson refuses to  offer support for international sanctions against Russia.   He refuses to describe Russia's bombing of Syrian hospitals and  schools--and a U.N. humanitarian aid convoy--as war crimes.   Russia remains in violation of the Minsk agreement and continues to  occupy Crimea, indiscriminately bomb in Syria, and hack American think  tanks.   Now is not the time to remove sanctions against Russia, and I have  little confidence Mr. Tillerson is committed to pushing back against  Russian aggression.   Finally, Mr. Tillerson's indifference to the two-state solution  between Israel and the Palestinians is unacceptable. Specifically, Mr.  Tillerson said that a two-state solution is a ``dream'' and openly  questioned whether or not it could ever become a reality. The reality  is that, without a two-state solution, Israel cannot be both a  democracy and a majority-Jewish state.   Today Israel is constructing settlements throughout the West Bank.  Palestinian terror and incitement continue. Mr. Tillerson's almost  casual dismissal of the two-state solution is disqualifying for a  Secretary of State. Our chief diplomat must understand the urgency of  the situation and must be willing to engage both sides in the pursuit  of peace.   I simply do not believe Mr. Tillerson is interested in doing so.   Mr. Tillerson's lack of transparency, history of working against our  national interests, close ties to Russia, and indifference to Israel's  future make him unfit to serve as the Secretary of State.   I intend to oppose Mr. Tillerson, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, my father served in the Foreign  Service at the Department of State, so I spent some of my early years  overseas. I was proud to be part of a family that represented our great  country. I learned firsthand the critical role of our Nation's  diplomats, the risks that they take to serve our country, and the part  that they play in spreading American ideals of freedom and democracy  around the world.   The cabinet position of Secretary of State is as old as our Nation.  Thomas Jefferson served as President Washington's Secretary of State.  The Secretary is the President's top foreign policy adviser and our  Nation's chief representative abroad. Today the State Department  reaches across the world, advancing our interests, shaping our  relationships, advocating for human rights, and working to advance  peace.   In addition, the Secretary of State will encounter a department of  employees who are deeply concerned about the role that they will play  and the actions that they may be expected to take in service to the new  President. Last week, the Washington Post reported that the State  Department's entire senior management resigned, including officials who  had worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations. This was  an unprecedented loss of institutional knowledge.   And by yesterday afternoon, a dissent letter by State Department  staff saying that President Trump's executive order to temporarily bar  citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries would not make the Nation  safer had attracted around 1,000 signatures, far more than any dissent  cable in recent years.   President Trump's campaign rhetoric has shaken our allies--wavering  on our commitment to NATO, gratuitously escalating arguments with China  and Mexico, and empowering an increasingly aggressive Russia. Mr. Trump  has made fawning statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin. In  October 2007, Mr. Trump said of Putin, ``he's doing a great job.'' In  December 2011, Mr. Trump praised Putin's ``intelligence'' and ``no- nonsense way.'' In June 2013, Mr. Trump wondered if Putin would be his  ``new best friend.'' And in July 2015, Mr. Trump said, ``I think I'd  get along very well with Vladimir Putin.''   And Mr. Trump has questioned the reality of climate change. He  tweeted, ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the  Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.''   The Secretary of State thus must play a crucial role in maintaining  relationships between the United States and our allies around the  world. In the face of Mr. Trump's statements and actions, the need for  a strong Secretary of State is all the more important.   President Trump has nominated Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of  ExxonMobil, to take on this critical role. Mr. Tillerson, who has never  served in government, has spent many years building business  relationships with Russia and Vladimir Putin, and in 2013, even  received the Russian Order of Friendship, an award given to foreigners  who work to improve relations with Russia.   Mr. Tillerson has had particularly close dealings with Igor Sechin,  the head of a state-owned Russian oil company whom the United States  has sanctioned and banned from entering the United States.   In 2014, Mr. Tillerson opposed sanctioning Russia for its actions in  Ukraine and reportedly lobbied the government against those sanctions.  According to Reuters, ``[Tillerson] added that Exxon does not  `generally' support sanctions and has made that view known to the U.S.  Government. . . . `We're having conversations such that our views are  being heard at the highest levels.' Tillerson told reporters.'' And  yet, in his confirmation hearing, Mr. Tillerson denied that he or Exxon  directly lobbied against the sanctions.   Given Russia's interference with U.S. elections and Russia's  increased provocation of our allies, we need to be able to rely on our  Secretary of State to advance U.S. interests above all. Mr. Tillerson's  long and close relationship with Russia casts doubt on his ability and  inclination to pursue additional sanctions as necessary and on the  quality of advice that he will give the President. And despite the  active national conversation about Russia, Mr. Tillerson said in his  hearing that he and President Trump had not even discussed Russian  policy with any specificity.   I am also concerned that Mr. Tillerson does not seem to view human  rights as a critical issue for the State Department. In addition to  refusing to condemn Russian and Syrian atrocities as war crimes, he did  not condemn Philippine President Duterte's extrajudicial killings. This  is particularly disturbing, as President Duterte has alleged that  President Trump approves of his actions. Mr. Tillerson appeared  hesitant to weigh in on human rights abuses. But the State Department  cannot be silent and must be an outspoken voice for human rights, even  to our allies.   Mr. Tillerson appears not to appreciate America's role as a beacon of  light around the world that stands up for the rule of law and human  rights. This is especially troubling, as President Trump's order last  Friday to suspend America's refugee programs is an attack on everything  for which our country stands. President Trump's order has made us less  safe by playing into ISIS's propaganda, casting our fight against  terrorism as a fight against an entire religion. That is not who we are  as a nation. We must remain vigilant and resolute against efforts to  sow fear and division, and we must fight together to protect the rights  and freedoms of all people.   President Trump's executive order highlights the need for a Secretary  of State who will push back against President Trump's worst impulses.  Mr. Tillerson, however, seems ready to do  [[Page S549]]  the opposite and reinforce many of President Trump's worst instincts.  Mr. Tillerson's lack of focus on human rights and the rule of law  indicate that he seems not to appreciate the role of American in the  world--particularly dangerous traits when President Trump is retreating  from America's 70-year special role in the world, retreating--in the  words of a recent article in The Atlantic--to a pre-1941 world of  ``closed borders, limited trade, intolerance to diversity, arms races,  and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom.''   Finally, I seriously question Mr. Tillerson's commitment to working  with our allies and cosigners of the Paris Climate Agreement to  confront one of our greatest global challenges. While at certain  points, he has acknowledged the dangers of climate change, he has more  recently questioned the science and the human contribution. In his  hearing, he acknowledged that climate change does exist and that the  United States needed to have a seat at the table, but he failed to  express any urgency to respond or a clear commitment to the Paris  Agreement.   While Mr. Tillerson may be a skilled business dealmaker, the job of  the Secretary of State and the leader of our State Department requires  the experience and determination to meet our current challenges. Given  his extensive ties to Russia and questionable commitment to advancing  human rights and combatting climate change, I do not believe that Mr.  Tillerson is the right person for this job, and I will vote against his  confirmation.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an  extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S.  intelligence community, Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Taylor, the Under  Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, I&A, at the Department of  Homeland Security.   I had the pleasure of presiding as chairman of the Intelligence  Committee for the confirmation hearing for General Taylor in 2014 and  have witnessed his leadership over the past 2 and a half years as I&A  has made perhaps the most impressive progress of any intelligence  agency over this time.   After nearly 40 years of honorable service to our Nation, Under  Secretary Taylor retired on the last day of the Obama administration.   Prior to his work at DHS, Frank Taylor served for 31 years in the  U.S. Air Force and at the U.S. Department of State as an ambassador for  counterterrorism and head of diplomatic security. He also served as  vice president of security at General Electric. For the past 2 years,  he has applied the leadership skills, understanding of security at home  and abroad, and his close personal friendship with Secretary Jeh  Johnson to transform the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.   I&A's mission is to equip the Homeland Security Enterprise with  timely intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe,  secure, and resilient. It provides critical intelligence to the  leadership of the DHS and its components; State, local, tribal, and  territorial governments, and private sector partners. The office itself  was formed after the creation of DHS through the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 and has seen significant change and disruption in its short  lifetime. Due to Under Secretary Taylor's leadership, I&A is much  further along on its vision of becoming a premier element of the IC,  driving information sharing and delivering unique predictive  intelligence and analysis to operators and decisionmakers at all  levels.   During his confirmation hearing, General Taylor was asked why I&A  needed to exist, given the domestic mission of the FBI and the analytic  work of the National Counterterrorism Center. He was asked to justify  the office's existence if it produced one analytic product per employee  per year. Members questioned him on the need for State and local fusion  centers and the support provided to them by the Federal Government. I  focused my questions on why an intelligence agency should have more  than 60 percent of its staffing come from a contractor workforce.   As we begin 2017, those questions are no longer applicable. Under  Secretary Taylor has transformed the organization. He removed internal  I&A stovepipes and realigned the organization to more closely reflect  the intelligence cycle. Where homeland intelligence analysis had too  often relied on repackaging products from other members of the IC, DHS  collection now forms the basis of I&A production. Under Secretary  Taylor also ordered that finished intelligence include DHS and State- local-tribal Partner data. Within 1 year, the organization achieved  great success on this front, ensuring 80 percent of finished  intelligence in fiscal year 2016 included unique homeland-derived data.  Under his leadership, I&A is fulfilling the unique homeland-focused  role that Congress intended. The contract workforce is below 25 percent  and the office is producing valuable intelligence analysis, tips to law  enforcement, compiling and improving the quality of DHS data for  intelligence purposes, strengthening our watch listing capability, and  lending expertise to decision makers from the President down to the cop  on the beat.   Under Secretary Taylor has worked tirelessly to mature and strengthen  the Department's relationship with the State and local fusion centers  and make information sharing a priority, changing the way the IC  analyzes the domestic threat picture. When I have visited my local  fusion center in San  [[Page S590]]  Francisco, I receive nothing but praise for the support that I&A  provides and the importance of local, State, and Federal information  sharing. The most recent example of this partnership is the Field  Analysis Report, FAR, an intelligence report written by State and local  intelligence analysts in coordination with I&A for the State and local  audience. This is an important development from intelligence handed  down from intelligence agencies inside the Federal beltway that, at  times, misses the mark of what the local customer needs. FARs are among  the most highly rated finished intelligence products coming out of I&A  and are a direct result of General Taylor's vision.   Under Secretary Taylor also took to heart the need to invest in the  workforce and address extremely low employee morale. He has  restructured the workforce, drastically reducing the ratio of  supervisors to workers, streamlining management and developing what he  calls ``seed corn''--young, junior intelligence professionals brought  in to rejuvenate the organization and help develop a truly homeland- focused workforce. Besides shifting the balance of the staff, Under  Secretary Taylor focused on hiring, growing, and investing in the  workforce and ensuring that inherently governmental work is done by  governmental employees and clear communication between the workforce  and the leadership.   Members of the Intelligence Committee spend most of our time on  international events and the often controversial practices of the CIA,  NSA, and FBI. We have had the luxury in the recent past not to have to  worry on the intelligence coming from and provided to our homeland  security professionals because of the leadership and uncommon skill of  Under Secretary Frank Taylor. We owe him a tremendous debt of  gratitude. I wish to thank Under Secretary Taylor for his decades of  exceptional service to our country and to wish him and his wife,  Connie, the very best in the days and years ahead as he retires for the  fourth time.   Thank you.                            ____________________
