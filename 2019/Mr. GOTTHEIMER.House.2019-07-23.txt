 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bipartisan solution opposing the boycott of Israel and supporting a  two-state solution.   I want to thank Chairman Engel for his excellent leadership on this  important issue and Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer for  bringing this resolution to the floor.   With this bill and 349 cosponsors, it is very clear that Members of  both parties support our vital ally, Israel, the leading democracy in  the Middle East, because our countries share common interests and  fundamental values, and Israel's security is key to America's  security--to fighting Hezbollah, Hamas, PIJ, and global terror.   However, the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, BDS, Movement  seeks to delegitimize Israel and deny its right to exist as a Jewish  state.   As Mr. Suozzi, my colleague, just so aptly read, the founder of BDS,  Omar Barghouti, said it very clearly: ``Definitely, most definitely, we  oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian,  rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a  Jewish state.''   That exactly captures what we are fighting here today. There are few  clearer examples of bias and double standards than the BDS movement. No  other democratic country faces a global boycott.   But BDS is also fundamentally incompatible with a two-state solution,  which I strongly support. BDS seeks to punish only Israel, and it  rejects direct negotiations in favor of unilateral strategy. That is  why it is so important that Congress goes on record opposing BDS and  other harmful efforts to single out and delegitimize Israel.   Standing up for the U.S.-Israel relationship should not be a partisan  issue. That is why the members of the Problem Solvers Caucus are proud  to support this resolution.    This resolution was introduced by our colleague  Congressman Brad Schneider, along with Congressman Lee Zeldin, Chairman  Jerry Nadler, and Congresswoman Ann Wagner.   They have all done an excellent job. Nothing in this resolution would  prevent anyone, in any way, from being able to engage in free speech.  That is not what this is about, and we must not allow false attacks on  Israel.   Mr. Speaker, today, we must continue to make sure that confronting  biased anti-Semitism and supporting a two-state solution remain  bipartisan priorities.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1850,  the Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention Act,  bipartisan legislation that I was proud to introduce with my good  friend and Republican colleague, Congressman Brian Mast from Florida.   I also thank my good friend, Mr. Smith from New Jersey, for his  leadership.   I want to thank House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel  and Ranking Member  Mike McCaul, who were original cosponsors of our  legislation, for their support and leadership.   Mr. Speaker, Hamas is a heinous terrorist group responsible for the  murders of innocent American and Israeli citizens, which has been  designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department  since 1997. It is well known for firing rockets and digging terror  tunnels into Israel and using Gazans, including women and children, as  human shields. In fact, in May, terrorist groups like Hamas and PIJ in  Gaza fired more than 600 rockets at Israel in just 36 hours.   It is critical that the United States and our allies continue to  isolate Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad by cutting them off at the  source, including Iran.   As the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, the Iranian regime  provides more than $70 million annually to the terrorist group Hamas in  Gaza.                                time  1645    Just yesterday, Iran's supreme leader met with the political deputy  chief of Hamas and renewed Iran's commitment to supporting this  terrorist organization in its armed struggle against Israel.   Iran is also a principal funder of PIJ, helping the group amass a  stockpile of more than 8,000 rockets aimed at Israel, an arsenal even  larger than that of Hamas.   PIJ has also claimed credit for multiple terrorist attacks in Israel,  including a gruesome suicide bus bombing in April 1995 that killed New  Jersey student Alisa Flatow, a graduate of the Frisch School in my  district in Paramus. And I will say forever that her memory should  never be forgotten.   H.R. 1850 would require the President to submit to Congress an annual  report for the next 3 years identifying foreign entities who assist  Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or an affiliate or successor, and  impose at least two or more crippling sanctions.   This bill would also crack down on foreign terrorist governments that  support these groups, by suspending U.S. foreign aid, making it harder  for them to receive loans or technical assistance, and tying up their  credit.   This bipartisan bill will strengthen existing sanctions to weaken  these terrorist groups that threaten our ally Israel, undermine peace,  and further destabilize the Middle East.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this critical legislation and in the fight against  terror.
