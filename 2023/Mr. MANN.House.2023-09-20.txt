 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the face of a looming  government shutdown to discuss fiscal responsibility and the importance  of returning to regular order in this Congress.   The government borrows too much money and the government spends too  much money. The Biden administration and Congressional Democrats'  spending addiction has created massive inflation and caused our  national debt to climb to nearly $33 trillion. They prioritize spending  that is out of touch with what Americans are asking for and are killing  the economy in the process.   Republicans have offered real solutions to fix this mess. All the  other side has offered is enthusiasm for more reckless behavior.   House Republicans remain committed to limiting future government  spending, reclaiming unspent COVID relief money, eliminating burdensome  regulations, and promoting pro-growth energy and economic policies.   We need to get government spending under control and get our economy  back on track, and we need to protect both our national defense and  Social Security and Medicare benefits for seniors while we do it.   What we are seeing now is President Biden and Washington Democrats'  failure to negotiate, which regular order mandates and which Congress  is based on. We can't keep going down this road.   In my commitment to the Big First, I promised to do everything I can  to end Washington's spending addiction, balance the budget, grow the  economy, curb inflation, secure the border, and lower taxes for  individuals and small businesses.   We must restore fiscal sanity. Americans deserve to have their tax  dollars used wisely. Giving the President endless, no-limit credit  cards is no way to govern in a democracy.   Let's secure the border. Let's decrease our country's dependence on  Communist China. Let's commit to reining in government spending.   It is hard for me to imagine how anyone can love the open border so  much, or love losing to China so much, or love $200 billion of  unaccounted for COVID relief dollars so much that they would be willing  to shut down the Federal Government to keep the situation as-is.   If the other side would spend as much energy on funding the  government as they do on their liberal wish list, we would have solved  this problem long ago.                            ____________________
