 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 22.   The bottom line is, do we sell our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  China or not?   The answer is we should never sell one ounce of our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to the communist country of China.   Remember, Joe Biden as a candidate on day one declared war on  American energy by shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline. He still  commits to the war on American energy.   We in America are paying way more for energy than we should because  of the policies of this administration.   H.R. 22, Mr. Speaker, is an easy one. The United States of America  should not sell one ounce of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the  communist country of China.  [[Page H217]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 22.
