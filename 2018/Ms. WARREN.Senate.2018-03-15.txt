 Mr. President, I am here to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's monumental campaign for President.  Kennedy's brief, tragic run at the Presidency has had an enduring  impact on so many generations of Americans. The reason, I think, is  because Robert Kennedy had the courage to challenge a divided nation to  face up to its failings, to challenge a divided people to acknowledge  their own contributions to our Nation's ills, to challenge us to step  back from the stale, cheap politics of the moment, to challenge us to  do better by each other.   History may not repeat, but it often rhymes. Conditions are different  now, but a lot of the anxiety that swept through the country in 1968  echoes the anxiety of today, especially the economic anxiety felt by  millions of Americans who are working harder than ever but feel  opportunity slipping away from themselves and from their children.   Too often, our political and business leaders refuse to see this.  Instead they hide behind macroeconomic statistics, using them as a  shield to dismiss the concerns of the American people as faulty,  wrongheaded, or even as nonexistent.   Robert Kennedy understood that America's national economy is not the  same as the economic well-being of its people. In 1968, in a speech at  the University of Kansas, he spoke eloquently about the differences  between them, and here is what he said:         [Our] Gross National Product counts air pollution and       cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways       of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the       jails for the people who break them. It counts the       destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder       in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear       warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots       in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife,       and the television programs which glorify violence in order       to sell toys to our children.        Yet the gross national product does not allow for the       health of our children, the quality of their education or the       joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our       poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of       our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.       It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our       wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our       devotion to our country.        It measures everything, in short, except that which makes       life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America       except why we are proud that we are Americans.    Consider three stats: corporate profits, the stock market, and  unemployment.   Today, corporate profits are up--corporate profits that count gun  sales for manufacturers whose weapons are used to massacre children in  our schools and our streets. Corporate profits that count revenues from  drug companies when they quadruple prices for the sick and the  desperate. Corporate profits that count revenues of banks like Wells  Fargo as they rip off millions of American consumers.   The stock market is up as giant companies pocket trillions in  taxpayer money stolen from middle-class families. The market is up as  CEOs shut down plants and factories in the United States and move them  overseas. The market is up as business leaders, flush with cash, turn  their backs on workers while they plow millions and even billions into  stock buybacks to goose investors' returns and CEOs' bonuses.    Unemployment is down, but wages have barely budged in a generation.  Unemployment is down, but for millions of people, the exploding costs  for housing, healthcare, and childcare mean it now takes two jobs to do  what one job covered a generation ago. Unemployment is down, but the  numbers fail to represent the millions living in rural and urban  American communities alike that have given up on the search for a job.   These statistics on corporate profits, the stock market, and  unemployment tell us everything about the American economy, but they  tell us very little about the lived experience of today's Americans.  They do not speak to the citizen who fears police violence or the  police officer who fears gang violence or the immigrant who cannot  speak out about sexual assault at the hands of her boss or the toxic  rhetoric flowing through our politics seeking to turn neighbor against  neighbor. They do not account for our devotion to our communities, to  our churches, and to our children. They tell us virtually nothing about  our trials, our challenges, our hopes, or our principles.   Robert Kennedy understood this. He knew we cannot simply run an  economy for those at the top and assume it will solve America's  problems. In the intervening 50 years since his speech, America ran  that experiment anyway and watched it fail miserably.   It is time to try something different. It is time to challenge each  of us to do better by each other, to see the dignity in one another,  and to put our values first. I believe we can make Robert Kennedy's  legacy a reality, and I am proud to fight for it.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
