 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of every girl and woman  whose rights, lives, and futures are on the line if Roe v. Wade is  struck down.   For the first time in our Nation's history, the Supreme Court is  poised to take a constitutional right away from the American people,  creating a time when America's daughters will not have the rights their  mothers had. The Court's intent to turn back the hands of time by a  half century, without the consent of the governed, is devastating.   If Roe falls, there will be a patchwork of States with differing laws  and restrictions, causing societal chaos. Twenty-six States are likely  to ban abortion, few with exceptions for rape and incest, subjecting  more than 36 million women and girls to the black markets of back-alley  abortions.   House Democrats will gather on the steps of the Capitol today, across  the street from the Supreme Court, to stand with the millions of women  whose basic reproductive rights are being stripped away by this ruling.   The Supreme Court is now surrounded by protective fencing. I think  the Justices are fenced off from reality.   This is private, personal, and serious, and women should be able to  make their own decisions.                            ____________________
