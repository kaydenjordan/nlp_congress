 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2134) to reauthorize the Helen Keller National Center for  Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2134         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helen Keller National Center       Reauthorization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER REAUTHORIZED.         The first sentence of section 205(a) of the Helen Keller       National Center Act (29 U.S.C. 1904(a)) is amended by       striking ``1999 through 2003'' and inserting ``2019 through       2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2134.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am excited that the House of Representatives is  considering this bill, the Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization  Act, a bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. This  bill will reauthorize funding for the center through 2023.   Congress established the Helen Keller National Center in 1967 to  provide nationwide services for people who are deaf-blind.  Headquartered in New York with regional offices across the country, the  center is the only organization of its kind that provides training and  resources exclusively to people 16 and over who have both vision and  hearing loss.   Unfortunately, deaf-blind people face unique and diverse challenges.  Many youth who are deaf-blind have not been provided with the type or  quality of education that generally yields successful outcomes in  employment, independent living, and community involvement. In fact,  deaf-blind youth have some of the lowest levels of access to special  education services.   I am so proud of some of the work that we are doing in my home State  of Washington to advance justice for deaf-blind people. Washington  State Deaf-Blind Citizens is doing incredible work to organize  community events, to provide support for everyday tasks like reading  the mail and doing errands, and to advocate with lawmakers on the  unique needs of the deaf-blind community.   We also have the Deaf-Blind Service Center of Seattle, which focuses  on breaking down communication barriers by providing interpretation and  advocacy services for free to deaf-blind individuals.   I think we can all agree that every deaf-blind person deserves equal  access to services that promote their successes, independence, and full  participation in their communities. That is exactly what the Helen  Keller National Center provides to this underserved population. Thanks  to the center, deaf-blind people in every congressional district can  connect with support systems to grow productively and find meaning in  their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to enthusiastically support this bill to  extend congressional authorization for the Helen Keller National  Center. I urge my colleagues to support it as well, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who is the sponsor of this bill, H.R. 2134, a  member of the Appropriations Committee, and my co-chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus. He is a real champion for communities  across the country.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this is commonsense, bipartisan  legislation to help deaf-blind students across the country. I am so  proud that the House is considering this legislation today. I urge a  ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
