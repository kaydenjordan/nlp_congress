 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week there was a significant  development when it came to public health and our children in America.  By way of preface to what I am about to say, I want to make clear that  I have, during the course of my service in the House and the Senate,  focused a great deal of my efforts on tobacco, the addiction that  people have to tobacco cigarettes, and the deadly consequences of that  addiction. My family has been touched by it, as most have in America. I  lost my father when I was in high school. He smoked two packs a day and  was a lung cancer victim. We buried him at the age of 53. I remember it  to this day.   I am not alone. Literally, thousands of Americans--millions,  perhaps--have a similar story to tell. So from the beginning of my  service in the House of Representatives, I started looking for ways to  deal with this scourge of tobacco cigarette addiction. Many years ago-- over 25 years ago--I introduced a measure that banned smoking on  airplanes, and to my great surprise it managed to pass the House of  Representatives. Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey was on the  Appropriations subcommittee with the responsibility. He took it on in  the Senate, passed it, and we made it the law of the land, banning  smoking in airplanes.   I didn't realize--and I am sure Senator Lautenberg didn't--that we  had triggered a tipping point or reaction that led to banning smoking  in so many other venues. Ultimately, we have now reached a point where  no one would consider walking into my office and lighting up a  cigarette or even asking for permission to light a cigarette. It is  just unthinkable. But 25 years ago it was common. So things have  changed.   But what has happened is that Big Tobacco, having lost its  marketplace position and lost its profitability, has moved to a new  product--e-cigarettes and vaping. This company, JUUL, which is the  largest provider of e-cigarette devices in the United States, has a  huge stock ownership in tobacco companies. This is their new venue,  their new approach. But much as with tobacco cigarettes, the vaping  industry is counting on addicting children so that they can build their  ranks, addicting teenagers. Tobacco cigarettes did the same with Joe  Camel and the Marlboro cowboy, and now we see the same thing occurring  when it comes to e-cigarettes and vaping.   The previous Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb,  characterized it properly when he called it an epidemic. We now have 3  percent of American adults who are using vaping devices, 20 percent of  America's teenagers and children using vaping devices. It is a new  school year, and many of these students are heading off to middle  schools and high schools  [[Page S5414]]  with new backpacks and maybe new laptops and new lockers and new  teachers and new classrooms and new friends and a new addiction--the  addiction of vaping.   Vaping targets kids. They are introducing flavors that can be mixed  with this vaping experience that appeal directly to children and  teenagers in this country. How in the world can you imagine that  someone who is a 50-year-old chain smoker trying to quit is going to  choose a flavor pod called ``Unicorn Milk'' or ``Bubble Gum'' or  ``Gummy Bears''? They are all out there. They are designed to lure  children, and, sadly, they are effective.   For months now I have been begging this administration and the Food  and Drug Administration to do something about this epidemic, and until  this week they did little or nothing. But this week was a breakthrough.  The Food and Drug Administration announced early this week that they  were going to stop JUUL from advertising that their vaping products  were a safe alternative to tobacco cigarettes.   The reason is obvious. We have hundreds and hundreds of vaping  victims now showing up in hospitals. As of last night, the sixth victim  in America died from a vaping experience. Why? Because they are  ingesting into their lungs, in these huge clouds of vapor and smoke,  chemicals that are killing them, chemicals that are stopping their  lungs from functioning. They don't realize it at the time; it is just  another wild experience. They are told, by the way, by JUUL and others  that it is safer than tobacco cigarettes. It is not safe. It is deadly,  and it is an epidemic in this country.   This week the American Medical Association stepped up its role, and I  want to commend them. Dr. Patrice Harris, the President of the American  Medical Association, released the following this week:         In light of increasing reports of e-cigarette-associated       lung illnesses across the country, the [American Medical       Association] urges the public to avoid the use of e-cigarette       products until health officials further investigate and       understand the cause of these illnesses.    She goes on to say:         The e-cigarette-related lung illnesses currently sweeping       across the country reaffirm our belief that the use of e-      cigarettes and vaping is an urgent public health epidemic       that must be addressed. We must not stand by while e-      cigarettes continue to go unregulated. We urge the U.S. Food       and Drug Administration to speed up the regulation of e-      cigarettes and remove all unregulated products from the       market. We also call on the FDA to immediately ban flavors,       as well as marketing practices, that enhance the appeal of e-      cigarette products to youth.    The Food and Drug Administration Commissioner has the authority  today--before the sun sets on this 9/11 anniversary--to ban these  flavor pods that are attracting children and adding to this epidemic in  our high schools and middle schools across the United States. This Food  and Drug Administration Administrator, Dr. Ned Sharpless, has the  authority to take off the market scores, if not hundreds, of vaping  devices that have been introduced to the public after the official date  of deeming last year. He can do it today. It would have a dramatic  effect starting tomorrow. He could start enforcing it with the  retailers across America if he cared and if he were serious.   Now we have an opportunity to test him and to test this  administration. Will they go the next step in warning America's  schools, teachers, families, and children about this epidemic and the  deadly consequences of ignoring it? Will they take these products off  the market this week?   That is my challenge to them and to every American parent who dearly  loves their child and cares about their health. I hope they will join  me in this effort to urge this administration to take decisive action  for children across America.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms.  Warren) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, let me say at the outset, I join with the  sentiments expressed by the Senator from Oklahoma and our colleagues on  the floor, starting with a moment of silence until this last speech, in  remembering the historic American significance of September 11.   The fact that both political parties came together shows there is  hope that when it comes to this Nation and its values, what brings us  together is a powerful force. Today it is the force of memory, the  force of promise, and the force of the future of this country. I want  to salute my colleagues, particularly my friend from Oklahoma for his  moving statement about families in his State touched by this tragedy.
