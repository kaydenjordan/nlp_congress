 Mr. Speaker, reserving my right to object, although I  don't intend to object, I want to, first of all, thank the chairman for  bringing this resolution to the floor.   The Foreign Affairs Committee marked up this resolution awhile back.  It passed unanimously, and we were under the impression that it might  come up for debate on Tuesday under suspension. That is what should  have happened.   Members should have had the opportunity to debate this in the House  before the NATO summit meeting began this morning, and sent a clear  message that this body stands with NATO, that we support this alliance,  the most successful in history, that our allies can count on American  leadership and American resolve.   Instead, we are rushing it through today, after the summit is halfway  over and after President Trump has again insulted our closest friends  on the global stage.   This is an important resolution. It should not be swept under the rug  because it is important that this body stand up for NATO, even if we  are late to the game.   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
