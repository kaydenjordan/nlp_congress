 Mr. Speaker, in 1993, the United States Air Force  deployed Task Force Ranger to Somalia to restore order to the capital  city of Mogadishu after it was taken over by a rebel warlord. The  Battle of Mogadishu was the event which inspired the movie ``Black Hawk  Down.''   The Somali people wanted democracy, but this general and his militia  took over the nation to impose radical Islamic Sharia law. They  hijacked food supplies and cut off water to anyone who did not support  their reign of terror.   After several successful operations, Task Force Ranger set out on a  mission to arrest two of the general's top lieutenants in a building by  the Olympic Hotel in a militia stronghold neighborhood.   The plan was to surround the building the lieutenants were meeting  in, lower themselves on ropes from helicopters and surround them, then  take the prisoners to the vehicles that would be waiting outside.   Unfortunately, the mission took a catastrophic turn, Mr. Speaker,  when two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled  grenades. The soldiers were attacked, and the battle that followed  lasted 18 hours. Eighteen of our brave men were killed and dozens were  injured, and the Somalis lost over 1,000 men.   This October, Knoxville is holding a 30th anniversary event to  commemorate this mission, where surviving members of Task Force Ranger  can be reunited and they can remember their fallen brothers.   As a Christian, Mr. Speaker, I owe everything in my life, except for  my salvation, to the men and women who wore our country's uniform.  Members of Task Force Ranger are no different, and I look forward to  seeing them in Knoxville this year and welcome the heroes and give them  some true Tennessee hospitality.                            ____________________
