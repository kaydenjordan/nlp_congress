 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the DelBene amendment  and in defense of Oregon's coast.   The Oregon coastline is a wonder of nature and a critical piece of  Oregon's economy. We love our coastal playground. We respect our  coastal communities. And that is why we must fight to protect them--not  as Democrats or Republicans, but as Oregonians who cherish our  environment and our people.   Oregon led with the first-ever ``Bottle Bill'' to reduce litter on  the beaches. Oregon led when it made its coastline free and open to the  public. Now we must lead the fight against offshore drilling, which  threatens our coastline, the people who call it home, and fisheries and  families who depend on it for their livelihoods, and our environment.   Offshore drilling is a mistake, and it will only exacerbate our  energy and environmental crisis down the road. We must say ``no'' by  voting ``yes'' on this amendment.
