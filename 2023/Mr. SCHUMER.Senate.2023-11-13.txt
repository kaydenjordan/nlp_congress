 Madam President, this week, President Biden will attend  the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in San Francisco, where,  on Wednesday, he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.   Earlier today, I spoke with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan  and urged that President Biden should push President Xi on some of the  same things my colleagues and I did during the bipartisan codel I led  to China last month. At the top of our list is the fentanyl crisis,  which has killed tens of thousands of Americans each year--so many of  them young Americans--and which, in large part, originates in China.   For years, Chinese chemical companies have faced little oversight as  they have sold chemicals like fentanyl analogs, xylazine, and other  substances to Mexican buyers. Mexican cartels then turn these chemicals  into fentanyl that they sell in the United States and ultimately into  our communities, wreaking havoc, claiming tens of thousands of lives.   So when my colleagues and I met with President Xi, we explained in  graphic detail how fentanyl was devastating our communities and that  China needs to stop the exportation of these precursor chemicals. We  spoke in very strong terms--I did, Senator Hassan, and Senator Cassidy.  We all told him what havoc this was wreaking in America.   Then, I explained to President Xi that my dad used to be a small  business owner and that it would go a very, very long way toward  improving China's image for Americans if they took action to crack down  on the fentanyl crisis; that the benefits China would get from cracking  down on these companies, in terms of American good will, would far more  than outweigh the tiny cost it would have on the economy. And I said  any businessman knows that would be a good thing to do. President Xi  seemed receptive to our concerns about fentanyl and said he would look  into it.   So, today, I relayed to Jake Sullivan that President Biden should be  really strong on this issue and ask for concrete action from President  Xi on this important topic.   It sounds as if there may be a chance for progress with the Chinese  Government on cracking down on exporting precursor chemicals used to  manufacture fentanyl, so we are eager to hear  [[Page S5466]]  more come out of Wednesday's meeting.   If they will crack down on these precursor chemicals that are used to  make fentanyl, it would be of huge benefit to this country and save  thousands of lives. So we are optimistic and hopeful that our codel and  now President Biden pushing the issue will get some real results. It  was among the highest priorities for our codel last month.   I also urged Jake Sullivan to make sure that President Biden echoes  what we told President Xi about the need for reciprocity between U.S.  and Chinese businesses. Time and time again, our best companies are  prohibited from competing freely or competing at all in China, while  many of their best companies can freely compete here.   So many of our companies are severely disadvantaged when the Chinese  Government stacks the deck against them in the form of forced  technology transfers, the theft of their intellectual property, and  other unfair practices. This is costing countless American jobs and  tens of millions--if not more--to our economy every single year.   We listed, roughly, a dozen major companies that right now face a  major disadvantage competing in China, and we hope the President will  strongly push President Xi on those this week.   We also stressed to President Xi last month that if the United States  and China are to improve their economic relations, U.S. companies need  to be able to compete freely in China, just as they compete freely  here. I expect President Biden will emphasize the same this week.   Finally, I hope President Biden is adamant, as we were, with  President Xi that China must lean on Russia and Iran not to exacerbate  the military crises happening around the world.   On the Israel-Gaza conflict, in particular, we told President Xi that  China needs to use its influence on Iran to stop them from acting in  any way that would widen the conflict. China should play a positive,  not a negative, role in this delicate crisis.   In fact, during my meeting with President Xi, as you may remember, I  criticized the Chinese Government for issuing a statement about October  7 that failed to condemn the killing of civilians, and they ended up  issuing a stronger statement the next day. When President Biden is  similarly firm that China should play a stabilizing role with Iran and  Russia, I think it will make a big difference.   In short, Wednesday's meeting between President Biden and President  Xi will be a real test for China to show that they truly want a better  relationship with the United States.   When my colleagues and I met with President Xi in person, we were  pointed and specific with our questions and issues and found him to be  responsive. So I expect President Biden will have the same sort of  frank conversation we did a month ago.   When the President hammers home the same things we focused on in  Beijing on fentanyl, on reciprocity for U.S. businesses, on ensuring  stability on the world stage, then, given what we saw in our  conversations, we think it could make significant progress on issues we  have long focused on here in the U.S. Senate.   I salute President Biden for meeting with President Xi, and I am very  hopeful we will get some real results as a result of that meeting.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture vote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 815 occur at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican  leader, but no later than Saturday, November 18; further, that if the  cloture vote does not occur under this order, the cloture motion be  withdrawn.    Madam President, now a few moments ago, I asked for  consent that the Senate delay today's cloture vote and allow for it to  be rescheduled to a time to be determined later this week.   We are pausing on our plans to move forward on a Senate vehicle to  allow the House to move first with their proposal.   I have said since the very beginning that bipartisanship is the only  way to avoid a government shutdown; and for that reason, I am heartened  that the bill Speaker Johnson is advancing omits the sort of  devastating cuts that are nonstarters for Democrats.   The Speaker's proposal is far from perfect, but the most important  thing is that it refrains from making steep cuts while avoiding a  costly government shutdown--two things we very much believe in and  need.   I hope the Speaker continues to acknowledge that he will need  Democratic votes in both chambers if he wants to avoid a government  shutdown. He needs to stay away from poison pills and steep, hard-right  cuts to make that happen. Bipartisanship is the only way to get this  done.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the following nominations  be returned to the Committee on the Judiciary: Calendar Nos. 405 and  406.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 427.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 461, which is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m. on  Tuesday, November 14; that following the prayer and pledge, the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each; further, that the Senate recess from  12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:10 p.m., recessed until  Tuesday, November 14, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
