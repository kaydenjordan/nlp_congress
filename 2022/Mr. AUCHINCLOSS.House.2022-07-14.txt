Researchers at the University of California at Davis found that: ``By  the end of 2021 there were about 2 million fewer working-age immigrants  living in the United States than there would have been if the pre-2020  immigration trend had continued unchanged.''   This has hit certain industries hard, including food, hospitality,  construction, transportation, and healthcare, particularly nursing, at  a time when our economy is overheating in its recovery from COVID-19.   A significant part of lowering cost and avoiding a recession is  expanding the productive capacity of the economy. Until we address  staffing shortfalls, we will continue to artificially constrain the  supply side of our economy and drive up costs for everyday people. We  must recognize and reverse this trend by clearing the visa backlog,  documenting immigrants and Dreamers already here, and increasing caps  for both immigration and refugee resettlement. It is not just a moral  imperative; it is an economic one.                            ____________________
