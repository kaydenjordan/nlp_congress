 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5889) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  disseminate information, resources, and if requested, technical  assistance to early  [[Page H5124]]  childhood care and education providers and professionals working with  young children on ways to properly recognize and respond to children  who may be impacted by trauma related to substance abuse.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Recognizing Early Childhood       Trauma Related to Substance Abuse Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. RECOGNIZING EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA RELATED TO                     SUBSTANCE ABUSE.         (a) Dissemination of Information.--The Secretary of Health       and Human Services shall disseminate information, resources,       and, if requested, technical assistance to early childhood       care and education providers and professionals working with       young children on--        (1) ways to properly recognize children who may be impacted       by trauma related to substance abuse by a family member or       other adult, and        (2) how to respond appropriately in order to provide for       the safety and well-being of young children and their       families.        (b) Goals.--The information, resources, and technical       assistance provided under subsection (a) shall--        (1) educate early childhood care and education providers       and professionals working with young children on       understanding and identifying the early signs and risk       factors of children who might be impacted by trauma due to       exposure to substance abuse,        (2) suggest age-appropriate communication tools,       procedures, and practices for trauma-informed care, including       ways to prevent or mitigate the effects of trauma,        (3) provide options for responding to children impacted by       trauma due to exposure to substance abuse that consider the       needs of the child and family, including recommending       resources and referrals for evidence-based services to       support such family, and        (4) promote whole-family and multi-generational approaches       to prevent separation and support re-unification of families       whenever possible and in the best interest of the child.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5889.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5889, Recognizing Early  Childhood Trauma Related to Substance Abuse Act of 2018.   Last year, we lost more Virginians to opioid overdoses than any other  year in the last decade. For 5 years now, fatal drug overdoses are the  leading cause of unnatural death in Virginia.   In 2017, the average overdose rate across Virginia was 14 per 1,000  people. But in Henrico County, the rate has increased from 11.5 in 2015  to 19.6 in 2017. In fact, 87 percent of inmates in Henrico County  identified drug involvement as being a direct or an indirect reason for  their incarceration. That is 87 percent. Out of the 1,007 inmates  jailed for drug involvement, a plurality began using at age 13.   The largest overdose rate last year was in Culpeper County, which  increased from about 22.5 per 1,000 people in 2015 to 38 in 2017. We  are losing friends, family members, and neighbors every day.   Last November, the Committee on Education and the Workforce held a  hearing to examine how opioids are impacting communities across  America. During the hearing, members heard testimony from Ms. Toni  Miner, a family support partner for Child and Youth Leadership who uses  her own past struggle with drug abuse to help other families and  children who need help overcoming addiction. In her testimony, Miner  told members that: ``Addiction is a family disease, and if the whole  family is not treated, history will continue to repeat itself.''   One of the unintended consequences of the opioid epidemic is that  addiction has devastated not only the lives of users, but the lives of  their families as well. Maybe the most tragic reality of this epidemic  is it has devastated the lives of our children.   Half of opioid overdose deaths occur among men and women ages 25 to  44, and many of these individuals are parents. The number of children  in the U.S. foster care system is increasing, and a recent study showed  almost one in three children who were placed in the foster care system  in 2015 entered at least partially due to parental drug abuse.   In Virginia, there were 5,295 children in foster care as of April.  These children, and those living with an addicted caregiver, experience  unimaginable hardship and trauma and, thus, have unique needs. When  these tragedies occur, the children need the community's help.   The professionals working at child care homes and centers, Head Start  programs, faith-based organizations, camps, doctors' offices, and many  other places are in a special position to identify and assist children  affected by substance abuse. However, they may not have the preparation  and education needed to recognize the risk factor associated with  childhood trauma due to an adult's substance abuse.   Information and resources from the Department of Health and Human  Services could help educate child care and early education providers  how to identify risk factors and respond appropriately when faced with  a child experiencing trauma related to substance abuse. Such  information and resources will help keep more children safe while  aiding in the healthy development and well-being of the child and  promoting whole-family approaches whenever possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman  Bonamici, for her great work in committee and for her always keen  insights and great presentation today as well.   I would also like to personally thank the sheriffs back at home. I am  referring to Henrico Sheriff Mike Wade and Chesterfield County Sheriff  Karl Leonard. I thank them for helping with the statistics they do and  for their recovery programs back at home in Chesterfield and Henrico.  They do outstanding work, along with some of the other recovery folks.  John Shinholser and many of our faith community work hand in hand on  this across the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5889, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
