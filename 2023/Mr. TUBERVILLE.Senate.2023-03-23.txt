 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    I object, and I will give the reasons why. I am happy  to explain all of the holds on my nominations, and I am glad to see my  colleague, the Senator from Ohio, who will be here in just a moment to  support these efforts.   My friend from Colorado says this hold is unprecedented. It is not  unprecedented at all. In fact, there is very recent precedent. Just a  couple of years ago, the junior Senator from Illinois, a Democrat, held  more than 1,000 military nominations. The reason she held them was over  one single officer she wanted promoted.   My colleague from Colorado threatened to do the same thing just a few  weeks ago.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a news article from January 24.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           [From defensenews.com]   Colorado Dem Threatens To Hold Pentagon Nominees Over Space Command HQ                             (By Bryant Harris)         Washington.--Republican lawmakers spent the last year       stalling President Joe Biden's defense nominees, but the       latest threat to filling the Pentagon's top jobs is coming       from the president's own party.        Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said he's threatening to       delay the six remaining Pentagon nominees because Defense       Secretary Lloyd Austin refuses to meet with him over the       Trump administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command       from its current location in Colorado Springs to Huntsville,       Alabama.        The potential roadblock comes after the Senate made       significant progress on its Pentagon confirmation backlog,       confirming at least four long-stalled Defense Department       nominees in December. Then on Monday, the Senate voted 60-35       to confirm Brendan Owens as assistant secretary of defense       for energy and installations in its first floor vote of the       year.        Bennet and fellow Colorado Democrat Sen. John Hickenlooper       joined Republicans in voting ``no'' on Owens because their       letters to Austin have gone unanswered.        ``We simply have received no response,'' Bennet told       Defense News Tuesday. ``When the stakes are as high as they       are, when our national security is at risk, when [former  [[Page S924]]       President] Donald Trump made a political decision that       overruled the best advice of the Air Force's generals who       examined the question of where Space Command should be, I       think we should hear from the secretary of defense.''        Two years ago, during the final days of the Trump       administration, the Air Force announced Huntsville, Alabama--      the site of the Army's Redstone Arsenal and home to the       Missile Defense Agency--would serve as the new location for       Space Command headquarters, moving it from Colorado Springs.        The decision infuriated Colorado's congressional       delegation, who asked the Air Force to review the decision.       Several Colorado Democrats argued it was an act of political       retaliation because Biden won the swing state in the 2020       election.        A Defense Department Inspector General report in May found       the Air Force followed all relevant laws and Policies when       selecting Huntsville. But the report also found the rules       themselves may have been flawed, resulting in a less than       optimal decision.        A separate June report from the Government Accountability       Office found the Air Force did not follow best Practices when       making the basing decision.        Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall is reviewing both       reports' findings and will make a determination about whether       to revisit the basing process. SPACECOM Commander Gen. James       Dickinson said in early December he expects that decision       ``shortly,'' but the service declined to provide a more       specific timeline to Defense News.        ``We are engaging the senator on this,'' a senior defense       official told Defense News, speaking on the condition of       anonymity to discuss Bennet's threat on Pentagon nominations.       ``More broadly, we continue to have conversations with       senators from both parties as we work to confirm our       nominees.''                          `prerogative of senators'         Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., told       Defense News ``we can and we should rapidly resolve [Bennet's       and Hickenlooper's] desire for a meeting'' with Austin.        ``And then I think they'll withdraw the holds,'' he added.        Any senator can block the expedited procedures generally       used to confirm Pentagon nominees with broad bipartisan       support. This forces Senate leaders to devote scarce hours of       floor time on the numerous procedural votes needed to confirm       these nominees.        Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., placed a blanket hold on all       Pentagon nominees in 2021 over Biden's hasty Afghanistan       withdrawal. Hawley had initially demanded Austin and other       top Biden administration officials resign, but ultimately       agreed to allow up-or-down votes on nominees such as Owens       after Congress passed Hawley's legislation banning TikTok on       federal devices.        Reed repeatedly denounced Hawley's blanket hold on the       chamber's floor last year, but drew a distinction between       Bennet's tactic and that of the Missouri Republican.        ``That's a prerogative of senators,'' he said. ``Continuous       holds, I think, are just self-destructive because they take       away the talent the Department of Defense needs.''        Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the       Armed Services Committee, also defended the increasing       instances of individual senators holding up nominees as       leverage over the executive branch.        ``It's a tool we have at our disposal,'' Wicker told       Defense News. ``It's part of our oversight abilities, and       sometimes it's important to get the attention of unelected       officials.''        Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, also has holds on two Pentagon       nominees over a separate dispute with the Interior Department       regarding a mine project in his state. Those nominees are       Laura Taylor-Kale, tapped to serve as assistant secretary of       defense for industrial-base policy, and Radha Plumb,       nominated to be deputy undersecretary of defense for       acquisition and sustainment.        Ravi Chaudhary and Lester Martinez-Lopez are also awaiting       floor votes to respectively serve as assistant Air Force       secretary for energy, installations and the environment and       assistant secretary of defense for health affairs.        The Senate Armed Services Committee must also hold       nomination hearings for Nickolas Guertin to be assistant Navy       secretary for research, development and acquisition as well       as for Ronald Keohane to be assistant defense secretary for       manpower and reserve affairs before voting to advance them to       the floor.        Joe Gould and Courtney Albon contributed to this report.     The headline reads: ``Colorado [Democrat] threatens  to hold Pentagon nominees over Space Command [Headquarters].'' That  Colorado Democrat happens to be my colleague opposite me as we speak.   He has given us emotion and opinion. Let's talk about the facts.   Last summer, the Supreme Court returned the decision to regulate  abortion to the States. In response, the Department of Defense claimed  that this was a threat to the readiness of our Armed Forces. They said  this without any evidence at all.   On July 15 of last year, Republican members of the Armed Services  Committee asked Secretary Austin how the Department came to this  conclusion. It wasn't until November that the Department scheduled a  briefing with Senate offices to give us some answers. However, minutes  before the briefing was scheduled to begin, the Department canceled.   On December 5, 2022, I sent a letter to Secretary Austin letting him  know I would hold all civilian and general and flag officer nominees  until we got some answers. Less than 24 hours later, we got answers.  The answers were disturbing.   We learned the Pentagon intended to go well beyond what has been  authorized by Congress. Federal law only allows the military to provide  abortions in three very narrow circumstances: rape, incest, and threat  to the life of the mother. Yet the Biden administration has turned the  DOD into an abortion travel agency. They did it by using just a memo.   The Biden administration wants abortion-on-demand for not just those  enlisted in our military but their family members as well. This would  expand the policy to millions of people. Now, the American taxpayers  are on the hook to cover nonchargeable paid time off and travel costs  for abortions for our military and their families. Again, nobody voted  for this. This goes beyond the law.   We still have a Constitution in this country to go by, and the  Constitution is clear: Congress makes the laws. The executive branch  enforces the laws.   Secretary Austin seems to think he can make a change in the law  without going through Congress. It would be irresponsible for the U.S.  Senate to allow an administration to walk all over the legislative  branch. Secretary Austin cannot change the law by memo. Congress cannot  be replaced by a post on the Department of Defense website.   In December, I warned the Department that I would hold their nominees  if they tried to force abortion-on-demand on our military, and they did  it anyway. The Department knew what the consequences would be. It was  clear. This was their choice.   I will continue to hold these nominees until the Department of  Defense follows the law or Congress changes the law. In the meantime,  we should do our job and vote. If these nominees are so important to  the Democrats, then the Democratic leader can find time to get them on  the floor.   Frankly, I wish Democrats were this concerned about our enlisted  servicemembers. We have a recruiting crisis in this country. The Army  missed its recruiting goal by 15,000 last year. That is an entire  division. One of the causes of this crisis is the policies of the Biden  administration.   At yesterday's Armed Services hearing, I talked about the Navy's  training materials. Many of these materials denigrate religious  Americans, who are the majority in this country.   Democrats seem a lot more worried about these nominations than about  our recruitment, the people who actually fight wars.   If Democrats are so worried about the nominations, then they can  bring them up for a vote. We have more than enough time to vote on  nominees. We have voted on plenty of nominees this year. That is about  the only thing the leader has let us do so far.   I will continue to come down here and lay out the facts for as long  as my colleague from Colorado wants to. We talked about this less than  a month ago. The facts have not changed. My position has not changed.  So I reserve the right to object.    I object.
