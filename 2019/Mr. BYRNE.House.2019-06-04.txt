 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, a  bill that would protect innocent children, the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule  this important bill.
