 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nevada (Mr.  Horsford), my colleague, for his support of the Congressional Black  Caucus, and working with me in ensuring that the voices of Black  America are heard here in the Congress.   At this time, I yield to the great gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson) for his reflections of our colleague, Elijah Cummings.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his  reflections on our colleague, Elijah Cummings.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond),  former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, a good friend and  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words.   Mr. Richmond, that happens to be my life scripture--Micah 6:8. That,  I believe, was the scripture that the Lord gave me when I was in law  school. I recognize that I had the honor of being a member of the  committee in which Elijah Cummings sat, was the chair, and I was on  that committee for 5 years now.   Mr. Cummings was a mentor to me. And to those who had a chance to  interact with him and knew him more than just as a Member of Congress,  he was a man of God. He lived and worked in Congress on Christian  values. I think that scripture, Micah 6:8 exemplifies how he lived his  life. It really exemplifies his Christian walk.  [[Page H8291]]    He was a man of great wisdom. And although he needed little  protection, when I was on that committee, I viewed my role as not only  being a consummate prosecutor and counselor but being on the front  line. I remember I called and told him, I was almost gleeful, that I  was going to be sitting in front of him, not because I thought that the  camera would be there, but that I could watch his back from many of  those coming at him from the front.   He always shook his head at my colorful language. Although, mind you,  he did chuckle quietly at a lot of the things that I had to say. And he  always counseled me to take care of my children first before any of  this. ``Take care of your family,'' he always said, ``because at the  end of the day, that is who you are going to have, even when you leave  this job.'' But he also counseled me to go slow and steady, to ``walk  humbly,'' as Micah 6:8 says.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne), who sits with me on the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure. He represents his home of Newark, New Jersey, and I  would ask him to reflect on the life and his times with Congressman  Elijah Cummings.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne).   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), who, like Elijah Cummings, came to Congress first in a special  election. I am happy to call her my classmate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Lawrence), my very close classmate from the State of Michigan who  is herself a tireless fighter for the rights of not only the people of  Michigan but of women and people who are oppressed and who also sat and  sit on the Committee on Oversight and Reform under the tutelage of  Elijah Cummings.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans),  representing Philadelphia.    I thank Mr. Evans, as one gentleman from a great  American city paying tribute to another man from a great American city,  as native sons. I thank him for those kind words and for the fight that  we are all continuing to undertake on behalf of the people whom we  represent in this great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings),  who had the honor of being on the Oversight and Reform Committee with  Mr. Cummings, for her remarks about that great American.    I thank the gentlewoman for those powerful words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath)  for her tribute and words about Congressman Elijah Cummings.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), who also sat on the Oversight and Reform  Committee under Mr. Cummings.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to close my portion of this by  stating that, when it came to a notion of democracy, Chairman Cummings,  in his speeches, insistently invoked it, and not in the inert way that  elected officials tend to do.   He spoke of democracy as something vital and fragile and valuable, an  inheritance that had to be safeguarded for future generations. He said  that to all of us who sat under him in his chairmanship and ensured  that we brought that passion and that desire to do the best for this  democracy that our bodies could do.   So I thank him for that. I thank him for everything that he has been  to all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last week, we lost the earthly man Elijah  Cummings. Most of the country and many around the world knew him as a  member of Congress from the city of Baltimore. He was a fierce fighter  for the forgotten, a sworn opponent of hunger, poverty, abuse and  addiction and a relentless advocate for civil rights. Chairman Cummings  was a driven man, a person who pushed for what was right because he  believed in the supreme responsibility of elected officials to advocate  for those we represent.   I have the honor of being a member of the Committee he chaired for 5  years. Congressman Cummings was a mentor to me. I and those who had a  chance to interact with him knew him as more than a Member of Congress.  More importantly, he was a man of God. He lived and worked in Congress  on Christian values.   He was a man of great wisdom and, although he needed little  protection, I viewed my role on the Committee as not only being the  consummate prosecutor and counselor but as a frontline and protector to  this gentleman. With a booming voice and speaking cadence that hinted  of the pulpit--his parents were preachers--Chairman Cummings was a  compelling figure on Capitol Hill for more than two decades, repeatedly  re-elected by voters in Maryland's Seventh Congressional District,  which covers much of Baltimore, including a section of the city with  more than its share of social problems. He campaigned tirelessly for  stricter gun control laws and was a consummate voice for those addicted  to drugs. He was at times gruff, but always respected. But, it was as  Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform--the panel  charged with maintaining integrity in government--that Chairman  Cummings may have left his most legacy.   When it came to the notion of democracy, Chairman Cummings, in his  speeches--particularly those he gave in the past few years--insistently  invoked it, and not in the inert way that elected officials tend to. He  spoke of democracy as something vital and fragile and valuable--an  inheritance that had to be safeguarded for future generations. When he  spoke of HR-1, the exhaustive election-protection bill that the  Democrats introduced in January as their first piece of legislation of  this Congress, he mentioned his ninety-two-year-old mother, who had  died a year earlier. She was a former sharecropper, who implored him,  ``Do not let them take our votes away from us.'' He viewed his  Chairmanship of the House Oversight and Reform Committee as part of the  battle to protect voting rights. What remains clear is the void that  Chairman Cummings's absence leaves in his district and his country.  This would have been the case at nearly any point in his quarter  century in Congress. But it's even more acute in this one. In a fiery  bit of oration delivered at the introduction of HR-1, he pledged to  ``fight to the death'' in defense of voting and, thereby, democracy. It  was a promise that he made good on.
