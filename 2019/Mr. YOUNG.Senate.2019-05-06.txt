 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to  recognize an outstanding family-run small business who is providing  Hoosiers with great jobs and good food, all while supporting their  local community. In honor of the U.S. Small Business Administration's  National Small Business Week, it is my privilege to name Bubbles Ice  Cream Parlor of Michigan City, IN, as the Senate Small Business of the  Day.   Tim and Kim Martin founded Bubbles nearly 16 years ago and have been  serving premium ice cream to Hoosiers ever since. Known for always  serving delicious ice cream with a smile, Bubbles has become a  community staple and a gathering place for the families of northwest  Indiana.   Today, Tim and Kim's son, Zach manages the ice cream parlor, where  they employ many local high school students as ice cream scoopers. They  serve 32 varieties of ice cream, milkshakes, sundaes, and pies.  Recently, they have even started offering handmade donuts on weekend  mornings. At Bubbles, you can always expect a delicious treat and a  family-friendly atmosphere.   Bubbles is dedicated to more than just their delicious desserts. They  are committed to giving back to their community. They are a sponsor of  Michigan City High School, provide ice cream rewards to elementary  students who reach various academic goals, and donate ice cream to  local philanthropies.   These fantastic treats, friendly service, and community commitment  have not gone unnoticed. Bubbles has been awarded the News-Dispatch's  Readers' Choice Award for 8 consecutive years. They are a prime example  of a small business's ability to provide a great product, a welcoming  smile, and a helping hand--all in a day's work.   Small businesses are the backbone of local communities throughout  Indiana. They provide dignified jobs to rural communities and support  schools, charities, and nonprofits. I would like to extend my sincerest  congratulations to the Martin family and all of the employees at  Bubbles Ice Cream Parlor for being named the Senate Small Business of  the Day. I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
