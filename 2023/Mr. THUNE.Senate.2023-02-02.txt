 Mr. President, yesterday the Senate unanimously approved  my resolution with Senator Rounds formally congratulating the South  Dakota State University football team on their championship season. And  what a great season it was for the Jackrabbits. They ended the season  14 and 1 and never lost a game in their conference. They earned the No.  1 seed in the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. And they  brought home the FCS National Championship for the first time in  program history with a 45-to-21 win against the North Dakota State  Bison last month in Frisco, TX.   I happened to be on hand for that game. It was an extraordinary game  and capped off an extraordinary season. I happened to be there for the  semifinal game against Montana State, which the Jackrabbits won  decisively. In each of those games, and their games throughout the  season, they demonstrated on the field not only great skill but just an  incredible determination, resilience, and a willingness to play  together as a team, which, really, I think, is what distinguished and  differentiated their team from many others around the country this  year. It really was an extraordinary team to watch on both sides of the  ball. And as someone who has been a fan of sports for a long time, it  was really exciting to see the success that they had not only  throughout the course of the season but ultimately capping it off with  the national championship.   That championship win was a fitting capstone to coach John  Stiegelmeirer's 26-season career leading the Jacks. Coach Stig, as he  is affectionately known, is the heart and soul of Jackrabbit football.   Like many South Dakotans, he learned his values from his dad. He  worked on a family farm in Selby, SD. His dad told him: If you work  hard and be a good person, you will have success. Work hard, be a good  person, and you will have success.   I would say Coach Stig has done all three. His determination  transformed SDSU's football team into what it is today. SDSU became a  Division 1 program under his leadership, and former Jacks players have  gone on to careers in the NFL. His calm, patience, and caring set the  standard for the players and made the team a family.   He leaves as the winningest coach in SDSU history, the 2022 FCS Coach  of the Year, and, of course, with a national title for the team that he  has dedicated his career to making great.   Huge congratulations to the Jackrabbits on their season and to Coach  Stig, and we wish you all the best in your retirement. You have earned  it.
