 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank President  Biden for his science-based efforts in defeating this virus and his  unrelenting focus on putting American families back on their feet.   The American Rescue Plan meets the moment and fulfills that old adage  that help is on the way.   This bill gets shots into arms, money into people's pockets, and  provides their communities, and especially our schools, with the relief  that they need.   In Connecticut, 1.5 million working families will receive $4 billion.  This relief is felt by those families--I say to my colleagues--as those  families sit at the kitchen table and look across at each other and  talk about their day-to-day needs and what needs to be met, Mr.  Speaker.   And so this bipartisan relief package that we have put forward--and I  say bipartisan, because when you talk to the general public and when  you talk to the people that need this relief directly, you see that  more than 70 percent of Democrats, Republicans, and the unaffiliated  support this bill.
