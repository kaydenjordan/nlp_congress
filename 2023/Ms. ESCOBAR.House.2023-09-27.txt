 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment strikes section 224 of the bill,  which mandates that ICE prioritize detention before considering any  other options, such as alternatives to detention.   This mandate is absurd, and for a party claiming to champion fiscal  responsibility, it makes no sense to mandate detention, which is the  most expensive option available.   We know from previous alternatives to detention, like the case  management program run by DHS in 2016, that providing case management  services for migrant families costs the Department roughly $39 per day.  Compare that to the cost of detaining those same families, which is  roughly $300 per day.   The mandate makes no sense, even on the most practical level. The  United States simply does not have the capacity to detain every single  asylum seeker who arrives at our Nation's front door, nor should it.   Furthermore, section 244 of the bill hamstrings DHS' operational  flexibility to effectively manage their resources depending on the  Department's needs at a given time. This could cause a ripple effect of  management issues for several agencies within DHS, including ICE and  CBP, which would further exacerbate the challenges we see in border  communities like mine.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, if my colleagues were truly being honest with  each other, they would admit the proposed Homeland Security  appropriations bill is unworkable and truly will not solve the  challenges that we face.   For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee.   Mr. Chair, this bill pulls money from critical DHS functions and  improvements, including investing in our ports of entry, the CBP One  app, and even endangers public safety by defunding CBP's recently  updated vehicle pursuit policy.   In short, this bill is filled with unworkable, empty promises  Republicans feed their base instead of putting forth real solutions.   I have tremendous respect for my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio,  and I would implore him to work with  [[Page H4673]]  us on a bipartisan solution that is truly workable.   I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, on the U.S.-Mexico border. I  live there today. I raised my two children there in that beautiful  community.   No one wants safety, security, and order more than those of us who  live there and have invested our lives in those communities. We know  that relying on borders, as my colleague, Representative Cuellar, has  pointed out, is not the answer.   They don't deter or manage, and they don't make migrants go away. All  it does is feed cartels so that they can find other routes for  migrants. We share a commitment to wanting to end that.   We can find a solution and a bipartisan pathway. My colleague, Maria  Salazar, and I have come together to find compromise, to seek true  solutions that uphold our values and actually solve the problems at  hand, and I invite my Republican colleagues to join us.   There is no doubt that this is a very broken system that puts  significant pressure and strain on communities like mine, on NGOs, on  local governments, on our Federal personnel, and, of course, the  incredible inhumanity that migrants endure in order to seek an  opportunity to live and work in our country.   This broken system is a consequence of Congress' inaction. It has  been 37 years since Congress has reformed and passed a comprehensive  immigration law. There is no better time than the present to do that  together, in a bipartisan way.   Depending on unworkable solutions, expecting that Mexico will accept  every migrant, believing we can jail every human being that comes to  our border is unrealistic, and it is not a true solution.   If the House rules permitted, I would have offered a motion to  recommit with an important amendment to this bill.   My amendment would cut the billions of dollars being allocated to the  outdated and expensive border wall and reallocate it to the programs  and services necessary to address a deadly and urgent matter--the  fentanyl smuggling detection and interdiction that is needed at our  ports of entry.   The most effective way to ensure that fentanyl smugglers are caught  and held accountable is to send resources where fentanyl is entering  the country--our ports of entry.   Over 90 percent of fentanyl is seized at these land ports and  interior checkpoints, and it is overwhelmingly smuggled by U.S.  citizens crossing the border legally.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.         Ms. Escobar moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4367 to the       Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Page 13, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $310,274,000)''.
