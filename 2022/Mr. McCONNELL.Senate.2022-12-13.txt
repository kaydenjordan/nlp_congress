 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senate Republicans have spent,  literally, months focused on the need for a strong bipartisan National  Defense Authorization Act, as well as robust funding for our Armed  Forces. Defending our homeland, deterring future threats, and  supporting our allies and partners should not be last-minute, low  priorities. They are fundamental duties if we want to remain the  strongest power in the world, and investing in strength today protects  our country, our servicemembers, and the American taxpayer tomorrow.   Let's take, for example, Ukraine. For nearly a year now, the free  people of a sovereign nation have stood firm and battled against brutal  and lawless aggression. The Ukrainians' brave stand was made possible,  in part, because the United States and a number of other countries have  realized that supporting their self-defense directly serves our own  interests.   Europe together constitutes America's largest trading partner.  Instability in Europe poses a direct threat to countless American  producers who sell to our friends across the Atlantic. Further, huge  disruptions to European markets would only add to the inflationary  challenges that the Democrats' spending has caused us already here at  home.   What is more, a successful Russian invasion would embolden the entire  club of anti-American thug regimes to take bolder and more brazen steps  toward further conflict, including direct threats to American lives.   Every day Russia spends on the back foot in Ukraine degrades its own  ability to wage further wars and dramatically changes the cost-benefit  calculus for others who might contemplate similar violence.   Continuing support for Ukraine is the popular mainstream view that  stretches across the ideological spectrum.   On my side of the aisle, for example, the former Director of National  Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, said recently that supporting Ukraine  ``fully and completely'' is in the best interest of the United States.   The top foreign policy expert at the Heritage Foundation, James  Carafano, has spoken out forcefully about the need for continued  military assistance, and so has former Secretary of State Pompeo,  former Vice President Pence, and virtually every other leading national  security official from the previous administration.   Now, while the conflict has exposed serious weaknesses in Russia's  ability to wage a conventional war, it has also exposed shortcomings in  the West, particularly with our defense industrial bases.   Our European friends who had treated themselves to holidays from  history after the Cold War, who presumed a new normal of stability and  security and shifted spending disproportionately into domestic  programs, have received a harsh--harsh--wake-up call. They are rushing  to reinvest more in their own defenses. Some politicians here in  America fell victim to the same lullaby.   Now, fortunately, supplying the specific kinds of American armaments  that Ukraine needs does not cut our readiness in other important  regions, such as the Pacific. China and its neighbors are watching the  conflict in Ukraine closely, and the CCP would be delighted if Ukraine  fell to Russia.   But the long lead times to replenish what we are sending still  provide us with a sober reminder. We know, for a fact, that the world's  foremost military and economic superpower can and should both produce  all the capabilities that we need for ourselves and serve as freedom's  arsenal for our friends at the same time. We just need to organize our  resources and make critical, overdue investments in our defense  industrial capacity.   That is why the National Defense Authorization Act we will take up  soon provides multiyear procurement authority for longer term  certainty, planning, and efficiency. It authorizes significant  investments in modernizing our forces and capabilities.   But following through on these promises also requires that we pass  robust appropriations. I made that clear at  [[Page S7109]]  last week's briefing with the Biden officials.   I will say it again: Providing for the common defense is a  fundamental governing responsibility. It is not extra credit.   Our Democratic colleagues will not receive a goody bag of domestic  spending in exchange for fulfilling this solemn duty.                           Tribute to Richard Burr    Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter, I would like to  begin my tribute to another of our distinguished departing colleagues  by quoting his own words from a letter written back in 2009. Here is  what he said:         Dear Mr. and Mrs. Carver, Thank you for entrusting me with       [your son's] memorial bracelet at the Asheville Veterans Day       Ceremony. I wish there had been more time to talk that day. I       returned to Washington, DC with the bracelet on my wrist . .       . [your son's] unrelenting courage and zeal for life are what       I will think of when I look at his name on my wrist. Rest       assured that I will wear [this] bracelet forever.    A quiet gesture, unheralded and understated, but leaving hugely  impactful ripples in its wake. A perfect case study of Senator Richard  Burr.   At first glance, it might appear to the uninitiated that our  distinguished friend is a man of contrasts or contradictions. For  example, this impeccably dressed Southern gentleman has been known to  drive around town in a rickety old Volkswagen. I think that our dear  departed colleague John McCain once called it ``an assault on the  senses''; or take the fact that when most of us were happy enough to  finish high school as either a successful jock or a successful student,  Richard was both a standout scholarship football player and winner of  the science fair; or consider that our unflappable, calm colleague with  an easy manner--almost casual, really--has been one of this Chamber's  most dogged legislators and most relentless champions across a whole  array of critically important causes.   That special bracelet bearing Army Chief Warrant Officer Mitch  Carver's name isn't just a comfort to one Gold Star family; it is an  outward sign of Richard Burr's entire approach to his job: supporting  service, honoring sacrifice, and making life better for folks in North  Carolina and across the Nation.   For 5 years, Richard's colleagues tasked him with helming the  Intelligence Committee. Some of this institution's most sensitive and  critical responsibilities wound up right in his lap.   But Senators on both sides knew that Richard's thoughtfulness,  fairmindedness, and discretion tailor-made made him for the role--no  showy victory laps, no braggy press tours. He led with the serious,  collegial, and patriotic tone that the issues actually demanded.   This quiet competence has been part of the Richard Burr brand from  the very beginning. As a backbench House freshman, Richard spearheaded  massive reforms of the Food and Drug Administration. Long before COVID- 19, he had a personal passion for helping to equip BARDA and other  pandemic preparedness initiatives.   Richard has authored transformational legislation that disability  advocates called the most important advance for their cause in a  quarter century. He reached across the aisle to help deliver justice  for victims of decades-old hate crimes. He drove bipartisan consensus  on a measure that has helped save students and families near $100  billion in loan payments.   In a situation folks in my own State know well, he stepped up to help  tobacco farmers transition to succeed in a freer market, and as the  ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Richard delivered  much needed relief to men and women who served our Nation with the  Veterans Choice Act of 2014.   It is truly amazing what you can accomplish when you are willing to  be patient, keep an even keel, share some credit--oh, and occasionally,  even jump out a window. Let me explain. This is creative problem- solving in action.   Back during sequestration, when staffing shortages had closed some of  the normal entrances and exits around the Capitol campus, our friend  found himself in the Russell Building while the only open exit was all  the way over in Dirksen. Rather than lengthen his commute, this ever- pragmatic man of mystery found the lowest window around, grabbed his  dry cleaning, shimmied out, and hopped right down to the sidewalk.   Now the day is fast approaching when our colleague will escape from  this institution for good, but Richard's remarkable legacy here will  endure--whether that has meant using his charm and judgment of  character to disarm committee witnesses and get to the bottom of  complex issues under investigation or using his fluency in House-speak  to translate key happenings for us, his colleagues over here in the  upper Chamber.   And I would be remiss if I didn't mention how Richard excels at  turning up the pressure to break a stalemate. You see, if an issue is  dragging out and no solution appears forthcoming, unless Richard was  the point person himself, he would frequently just threaten to leave  town altogether until things got worked out.   We are talking about a colleague who is famous for keeping closer  tabs on the Senate's weekly wrapup proceedings than just about anyone.   In fact, as I understand it, Richard's team became so famous for  tracking the timing of final votes so closely that some other offices  would try calling Team Burr for the scoop before they would even try  the cloakroom.   Now, with Richard's seemingly laid-back demeanor, you might assume  our friend was just eager to get out to the beach or hit the links, but  that would be another one of those deceptive appearances. The truth is,  Richard didn't become an expert at speedy getaways because he wanted to  shortchange his duties. In fact, it was just the opposite. Even as  devoted a public servant as Senator Burr is, he knew that, in the final  analysis, another set of duties was even more essential.   When our colleague was first elected to the House in 1994, he and his  beloved wife Brooke had two young sons, and Brooke was carving out her  own tremendously successful career in business.   So our friend was bound and determined that serving the people of  North Carolina would not mean skimping on his proudest job of all--as  father to Tyler and William, and now as a grandfather as well.   Through decades of committed service, he has found a way to do it  all. But even so, I know Richard is excited to make up for lost time.   So we thank our colleague for his outstanding work for our country.  And I have it on good authority that our friend has a favorite catch  phrase that he has used to bid farewell to his office after they have  spent a long day doing good work. So, Richard, as you like to say,  ``Dilly dilly.''   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
