 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in June, I went home to where Democrats announced $670  million of investments in broadband that will grow our middle class in  New Mexico. Then, I came back to a Congress controlled by the most  extreme Members of the Republican Party who want to strip women of  their ability to receive reproductive healthcare.   If these extreme Republicans succeed, it will be unreasonably  difficult for servicewomen assigned to bases in States that ban  abortion to travel and receive reproductive healthcare.   I came back to an extreme Republican Party that wants to take the  culture wars to our military instead of preparing our servicemembers to  protect Americans from war.   A travel ban for pregnant servicewomen, how un-American is that?   This rule and the extreme amendments in it are simply unpatriotic.  They are un-American. The Republicans are waging culture wars against  patriotic women, patriotic Latinos, Blacks, Native Americans, Asians,  gays, lesbians, and trans Americans who serve in our military. These  patriotic men and women are willing to fight and die for our country.   I call upon my colleagues to honor the sacrifice of these diverse  Americans and vote against this rule and these horrible amendments.   I call upon my colleagues to reject the culture wars and instead to  celebrate. Let's celebrate the diversity that is America. Let's honor  all servicemembers, all servicewomen, and their sacrifice.   Democrats are supporting our troops, and Democrats are investing in  our country and investing in our military while Republicans are  dividing our country with these extreme amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this extremism.
