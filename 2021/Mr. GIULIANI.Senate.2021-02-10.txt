 Senator Tuberville--or I should say Coach       Tuberville, this is Rudy Giuliani, the President's lawyer.       I'm calling you because I want to discuss with you how       they're trying to rush this hearing and how we need you, our       Republican friends, to try to just slow it down.    This was the singular focus of Donald Trump during this bloody,  violent attack on the Capitol: stopping the certification.   Look, as I mentioned, I was a trial lawyer for 16 years. Sometimes,  you have to ask a jury to use reasonable inferences to piece together a  defendant's state of mind. We don't have to do this here. While our  country was violently attacked by an armed mob, President Trump not  only refused to stop the attack or even address the attack at all, he  made clear his focus was on the same goal of the attackers he incited:  to stop the certification process and prevent the peaceful transition  of power. The only action we know that he took an hour into this attack  was to call Senator Tuberville to ask him to delay the certification.  This is as clear evidence as I have ever seen of what Donald Trump  really cared about that day.   Now, look, the certification process, as we all know, includes debate  and objections. Some of us disagreed, but we came here on January 6 to  formally administer the certification process pursuant to our  constitutional duties. At the end of it, Congress certified the results  to ensure that we continue to be a country with leaders who are elected  by the people for the people.   Donald Trump's objections to the certification are not on trial, but  what is on trial is, while we were under armed attack and being  evacuated, while our law enforcement officers were fighting for their  lives, our Commander in Chief was calling not to determine how to best  secure the building and the people in it but to continue to pressure  Senators to stop the certification process and a peaceful transfer of  power, just as he incited the mob to do earlier in the day. This was a  breathtaking dereliction of his duty and a violation of his oath as our  Commander in Chief.   Senators, before I hand this over to Manager Castro to walk through  the rest of the day, please let me make one final point. These  attackers stood right where you are. They went through that rostrum.  They rifled through your desks, and they desecrated this place. And  literally, the President sat delighted, doing nothing to help us,  calling one of you to pressure you to stop the certification.   It can't be that the Commander in Chief can incite a lawless, bloody  insurrection and then utterly fail in his duty as Commander in Chief to  defend us from the attack, to defend our law enforcement officers from  that attack, and just get away with it. Donald Trump abdicated his duty  to us all. We have to make this right, and you can make it right.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. My fellow manager   David Cicilline  showed you what President Trump did and did not do in thos first  critical hours of the attack.  [[Page S641]]    He sent a tweet at 1:49 p.m., where he reposted a video of the speech  that incited the attack, and he called a Senator to ask him to delay  the certification as the Senator was being evacuated for his own  safety.   We left off around 2:15 p.m. At this point, insurgents were inside  the Senate and the House, and the Senate had been evacuated for  everyone's safety. As you saw, Vice President Mike Pence and his family  even had to be evacuated for their safety.   Now, you will recall Donald Trump had made Vice President Pence a  target. He attacked the Vice President at the rallies, in speeches, and  on Twitter. And during President Trump's speech that morning of the  attack, he ramped it up again. After privately pressuring Mike Pence in  front of thousands in the crowd, he called Mike Pence out 11 times,  including saying:   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of       our Constitution and for the good of your country. And if       you're not, I'm [going] to be . . . disappointed in you. I       will tell you right now.    And this was the crowd's response to Donald Trump's days of  relentless attacks on his own Vice President:   (Text of video presentation.)         (People chanting: ``Hang Mike Pence.'')    By 2:15 p.m., the crowd was chanting in unison ``Hang Mike Pence''  outside the very building he had been evacuated from with his family.   Now, even if President Trump didn't know that his inflammatory  remarks about his Vice President would result in chants of ``Hang Mike  Pence,'' by 2:15 p.m., he surely knew. The attack was all over  television. They were doing this out in the open. This was a Vice  President whose life, whose family's life, was being threatened by  people whom the President had summoned to the Capitol. And what did  President Trump do in response? Did he stop? Did he tell his base: No,  don't attack my Vice President. Even when President Trump knew what his  words were causing, he didn't do any of those things to stop the crowd.  In fact, he did the opposite. He fueled the fire.   At 2:24 p.m., he tweeted:         Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have       been done to protect our country and our Constitution. . . .       USA demands the truth.    Over an hour and a half into the attack, and this is what he tweeted.  And he still, even at this point, did not acknowledge the attack on the  Capitol, let alone condemn it. Instead, he further incites the mob  against his own Vice President, whose life was being threatened.   Well, some of you may say: Well, who was paying attention anyway?  Well, that mob was paying attention.   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. Mike Pence didn't have the courage to       do what should have been done to protect our country and our       Constitution, giving States a chance to certify or correct a       set of facts, not (inaudible) defraud ones or inaccurate       ones, which they were asked to previously certify. U.S.       demands the truth.        Unidentified Speaker. Mike Pence, anarchist. Mike Pence,       anarchist.        Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible.) Can I speak to Pelosi?       Yeah, we're coming, bitch. Oh, Mike Pence, we're coming for       you, too, fucking traitor.        Unidentified Speaker. Donald J. Trump better (inaudible).        Unidentified Speaker. Full house.        Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible) Mike Pence let us down.       Mike Pence let us down, people. If you want to get something       done, you are going to have to do it yourself.    The insurgents amplified President Trump's tweet attacking the Vice  President with a bullhorn. They were paying attention, and they also  followed instructions. In fact, the insurgents were at one point, as  you saw, 60 feet away from the Vice President and the Vice President's  family. Some of these insurgents were heard saying ``that they hoped to  find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a  Capitol Hill tree as a traitor,'' and then they erected a gallows with  a noose.   This is what Donald Trump incited. Please take a close look at that  picture. It hearkens back to our Nation's worst history of lynching.   A President's words have the power to move people to action, and  these were the results.   And why did the President incite such rage against the Vice  President? He was fulfilling his constitutional duty, as we all were  that day. Vice Presidents in this country have been carrying out this  constitutional duty--overseeing the certification of election results-- without incident, without contest, without a word, for the entirety of  our Nation. It is part of our peaceful transition of power in the  United States.   The Vice President said he reviewed the Constitution and he could not  block certification, as President Trump wanted him and was pressuring  him to do. He told the President in a letter that morning, a few hours  before President Trump's tweet:         [I will] approach this moment with [a] sense of duty and an       open mind, setting politics and personal interests aside, and       do [my] part to faithfully discharge our duties under the       Constitution. I also pray that we will do so with humility       and faith.    And the President's response to that statement was to attack Mike  Pence while he was with his family under the threat of a violent mob.  The Vice President was following his faith, his duty, and his oath to  our Nation.   The Vice President and I don't agree on too much in politics, but he  is a man who upholds his oath, his faith, his duty, and most of all  upholds the Constitution. And Mike Pence is not a traitor to this  country. He is a patriot. And he and his family, who was with him that  day, didn't deserve this, didn't deserve a President unleashing a mob  on them, especially because he was just doing his job.   As this was unfolding and the crowd grew more violent, the President,  of course, was not alone at the White House, and the people closest to  him--his family and advisers--who saw this unfolding in realtime,  begged him, implored him to stop the attack.   An aide to Mark Meadows, the President's Chief of Staff, urged his  boss to go see the President, saying: ``They are going to kill  people.''   ``They are going to kill people.'' That is what those around  President Trump feared, and still nothing. It wasn't until 2:38 p.m.,  nearly 2 hours after the start of the siege, that Donald Trump even  acknowledged the attack. And when he finally did acknowledge the  attack, here is what he said.   On the right you will see what had been happening prior to that tweet  and as he sent the tweet, and on the left you will see exactly what he  tweeted.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. I'm going to stop you there for just       one moment because we do have some breaking news. We want to       bring in congressional correspondent Chad Pergram as this is       all developing right now. Chad, I understand the Capitol is       now on lockdown?        Mr. Pergram. They're definitely fired up. The chant, by the       way, I heard the most today was ``fight for Trump,'' and       that's clearly what many of them feel they're doing.        Unidentified Speaker. Hold the line.        (People singing: ``O, the land of the free.'')    That is what our President saw unfolding in realtime, broadcast all  over television, and this is what he tweeted at 2:38 p.m.:         Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They       are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!    Much has been made of the fact that in this tweet he says, ``Stay  peaceful.'' Senators, ``Stay peaceful''? Think about that for a second.  These folks were not peaceful. They were breaking windows, pushing  through law enforcement officers, waving the flag as they invaded this  Capitol Building. This was a violent, armed attack.   ``Stay peaceful''? How about: Stop the attack. Stop the violence.   ``Stay peaceful''? How about you say: Immediately leave. Stop.   And he said: ``Please support our Law Enforcement.'' How about he  actually support our law enforcement by telling these insurgents to  leave the Capitol immediately, which he never did. He didn't because,  the truth is, he didn't want it to stop. He wanted them to stay and to  stop the certification. And his failure had grave and deadly  consequences.   By 2:45 p.m., the warnings were tragically proven correct. Ashli  Babbitt was shot by an officer as she tried to break through a glass  door to reach the Speaker's Lobby.   At this point, the pleas to Donald Trump, publicly and privately,  grew even more desperate. At 2:54 p.m., Alyssa Farah, a former  strategic communications director, begged the President:   [[Page S642]]              Condemn this now. You are the only one they will listen to.       For our country!    Mick Mulvaney, the President's former Chief of Staff, his right-hand  man at one point, tweeted at 3:01:         The President's tweet is not enough. He can stop this now       and needs to do exactly that. Tell these folks to go home.        He can stop this now. Tell these folks to go home.    At 3:06 p.m., Representative McCarthy appeared on FOX News. Here is  what he said.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)
