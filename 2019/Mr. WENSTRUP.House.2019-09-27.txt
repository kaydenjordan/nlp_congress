 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career and  retirement of the Cincinnati Reds legendary Hall of Fame broadcaster,  Marty Brennaman.   Yesterday, Marty signed off for the last game of his famed career. He  has been part of our lives and the voice of our beloved Reds for 46  years.   Marty was with us for his very first broadcast when Hank Aaron tied  Babe Ruth for the most home runs hit ever.   He was with us when Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb's longstanding record for  most career hits.   He was with us through three World Series titles.   Marty Brennaman is an institution in Cincinnati. He feels like  family. Marty helped make both Riverfront Stadium and the Great  American Ball Park feel like a second home to so many.   I know we will all miss hearing his play-by-play, his insights, and  his stories.   Although I never saw Marty swing a bat, I will be glad to replay his  greatest hits for the rest of my life.   I know I join Reds fans across Cincinnati and the country in a  collective good-bye to one of our greatest, and this one belongs to  Marty.                            ____________________
