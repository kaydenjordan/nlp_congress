 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to introduce today's guest  chaplain from Vienna, West Virginia, Pastor Jon Lands. Since taking  over as senior pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church in 1996, he has led  the church through a period of tremendous growth. Attendance numbers  have risen from 65 to approximately 740 with a membership of over  1,200. This is a testament to his dedication to faithfully serving our  community.   He took his ministry to new heights when he started PraiseFM radio,  FaithTalk 1450, and the Word for Life, a daily and weekly radio program  now heard on 150 radio stations across the United States and two  international stations.   His service to the community doesn't stop at the church's door. He is  a member of the executive board of directors for the Wood County  Christian School, a member of the board for the Family Policy Council,  and serves on the board of the Women's Care Center of Mid-Ohio Valley,  a crisis pregnancy center dedicated to offering alternatives to  abortion and adoption services.   A husband and father of four, he is also a noted author, having  written ``Be Still: God's Strategy for Serenity,'' and ``Life on the  Level: The Balanced Christian Life.''   I am honored to welcome Pastor Lands to the House of Representatives.  He is a dedicated leader in the Parkersburg community, and his service  to others is inspirational.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues today to welcome Pastor Lands. May  God bless him, our Nation, and the church family at Fellowship Baptist  Church.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in strong support of  H.R. 3017, the Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and  Reauthorization Act, and I am pleased to be a sponsor of this  bipartisan effort along with my colleagues, Chairman Walden, especially  Chairman Shimkus, and Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko for their work.  I also want to thank the work of my colleagues on the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee who also were cosponsors of this  legislation, Mr. Katko and Ms. Esty.   The bill represents a broad, bipartisan compromise that will  reauthorize the brownfields program for the first time since 2006. In  addition to the reauthorization, the bill makes several key  improvements that you have heard about here today that will result in  more brownfield sites being cleaned up and returned to productive use.   A little history can explain why this bill was so important to pass.   When America's industrial manufacturing facilities and factories were  being constructed, they typically were located on prime property along  rivers, railroads, and roads. But, over the years, technologically  there were  [[Page H9543]]  changes that took place that transformed how our economy operates. It  also had to deal with unfair imports coming into America. As a result,  many companies failed and the sites became abandoned.   Rusting hulks of former factories and weed-infested sites have become  an eyesore and deter investment in downtown and urban areas. Today,  these locations could still prove to be valuable in creating jobs, and  that is what our prime responsibility is here. We need to improve this  negative stigma that these sites pose to communities and restore these  brownfields into productive resources.   America has, indeed, been identified as having 450,000 brownfield  sites across the country, but only 27,000 have been cleaned up. This  reauthorization is long overdue.   One great success story is Pietro Fiorentini, a supplier to the  natural gas industry who recently broke ground at a new manufacturing  facility in Weirton, West Virginia, that was cleaned up through the  brownfields program. Pietro Fiorentini spent 5 years preparing this  site because of the level of contamination.   I especially want to give a shout-out to Pat Ford, the executive  director of the Business Development Corporation in the northern  panhandle. His efforts have been tireless, working to do great things  like creating jobs in the First District of West Virginia.   His corporation, the Business Development Corporation, has already  received $2.5 million over the years in brownfields grants and has  leveraged those projects into $75 million in private sector money. It  has resulted in over 1,250 new jobs, and another 128 have been  preserved.   You heard earlier from Chairman Shimkus, talking about the 16-to-1  ratio. Pat Ford's group has a 35-to-1 ratio. For every dollar that we  put in for the Federal Government, Pat Ford's group has created $35 of  investment.   In the future, as businesses develop the Appalachian ethane storage  hub that is under way now in the Appalachian area, these newly  reclaimed properties will allow for even more industries and create  more jobs throughout this area.   This bipartisan bill makes very important classifications to CERCLA  liability and petroleum sites. It expands eligibility for nonprofit  organizations. It, indeed, increases the limit for remediation grants  from $200,000 to $500,000. It creates the multipurpose grants. But,  more importantly, it makes it easier for small, rural, or disadvantaged  communities to participate in this program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee, however, to fully fund this vitally important brownfields  program. Although $250 million is authorized, the appropriators have  only allocated $153 million to this program. Consequently,  revitalization of these former abandoned sites is delayed, and they  remain a stigma, deterring development in our downtown communities.   Overall, this bipartisan bill--and I thank my friends on the other  side of the aisle for how we are all working together on this--will  make great strides toward achieving the goals of getting more  contaminated sites cleaned up, promoting infrastructure, and,  importantly, creating jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
