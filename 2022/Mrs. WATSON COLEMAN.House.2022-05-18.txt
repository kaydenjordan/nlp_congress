 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in honor and  recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month.   Over the last 2 years, we certainly have seen tremendous stress on  the mental health and well-being of our loved ones, our communities,  and even our elected officials.   Back in 2019, I led a task force that looked at the impact of mental  health on Black youth and suicide, and I introduced a piece of  legislation that would address the gap in services to those individuals  who are underserved.   It is good that this is Mental Health Awareness Month. It is good  that we are paying attention to the mental health of all of our  citizens, including those who are elected officials.   I am glad to know that we can extend that service even to the members  of the Republican Conference who so desperately need mental health  addressing. I almost think it is la-dee-da-dee in everybody.                            ____________________
