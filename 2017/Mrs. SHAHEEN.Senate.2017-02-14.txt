 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the  Republican time for up to 10 minutes, with 5 minutes reserved for  Senator Risch, on the nomination of Linda McMahon to serve as  Administrator of the Small Business Administration.    Mr. President, today, in just a few minutes, the Senate  will be voting on the nomination of Linda McMahon to serve as  Administrator of, I believe, one of the very important agencies within  the Federal Government that sometimes doesn't get the recognition it  deserves; that is, the Small Business Administration.   Before I begin my remarks, I wish to take a minute to acknowledge the  good work of two previous SBA Administrators, Karen Mills and Maria  Contreras-Sweet. Both served in this very important role during the  Obama administration and, particularly during the financial crisis,  really served as a lifeline for so many of our small businesses. So I  thank these two leaders for their tireless work.   When I was first elected to the Senate in 2008, one of the reasons I  joined the Small Business Committee was its reputation as a place where  you could work across the aisle to get things done in a bipartisan way  because supporting small businesses is not a Republican or a Democratic  issue; it is an American issue.   That dynamic was on display at Mrs. McMahon's confirmation hearing,  where not one but two of her former rivals introduced her. Senators  Blumenthal and Murphy, both of whom ran very spirited campaigns against  Ms. McMahon--and both of whom defeated her--actually testified to her  passion for small business and her qualifications for this new  responsibility. After the hearing, the Small Business Committee  favorably reported her nomination to the Senate by a vote of 18 to 1. I  thank my colleague Chairman Risch for working with me during this  process and ensuring that the nomination was thoroughly vetted.   While I have opposed a number of President Trump's nominees, I want  to take a few minutes to explain why I will support Linda McMahon for  this important position.   My home State of New Hampshire is a small business State. More than  96 percent of our employers are considered small businesses, according  to the SBA's Office of Advocacy.   But small businesses aren't just important in New Hampshire. They are  really the engine that drives our national economy. Small businesses  create two out of every three new jobs in the United States. They are  also leaders when it comes to innovation, producing 14 times more  patents than large businesses.   Unfortunately, like so many of our larger businesses, many of our  small businesses still have not fully recovered from the great  recession. For our  [[Page S1141]]  economy to continue to improve, we need to level the playing field for  small businesses and unleash their potential. That is why the SBA and  its programs are so critical. Last year alone, the SBA backed more than  70,000 loans to small businesses, supporting $29 billion in lending and  nearly 700,000 jobs. The SBA also helped small businesses win more than  $90 billion in Federal contracts, provided counseling to more than 1  million entrepreneurs, and helped many small businesses reach foreign  markets.   I was in the New Hampshire State Senate in the early nineties when we  experienced a recession that closed five of the State's seven largest  banks and put so many of our small businesses into bankruptcy. The one  Federal agency that helped keep our small businesses going in New  Hampshire during those very dark years was the SBA. I have seen very  directly what a difference SBA makes to businesses in New Hampshire and  across this country.   As part of the confirmation process, I was able to work with my  colleagues on the Small Business Committee to look into Mrs. McMahon's  background as a successful entrepreneur, as well as her vision for the  SBA. I was pleased to learn that Mrs. McMahon shares my vision for a  strong SBA that will support America's entrepreneurs. I was  particularly pleased to learn, unlike some previous reports, that she  opposes efforts to merge the SBA into another agency, so she does not  believe it should be part of the Department of Commerce. Maintaining  the SBA's independence and keeping the Administrator of the SBA as a  Cabinet-level position is essential to ensuring that the voices of  small businesses are heard in Washington.   We also need to make sure the SBA programs are valued in this  administration. We have seen what can happen when SBA does not receive  the respect it deserves from the White House. The George W. Bush  administration cut the SBA's budget dramatically, by 32 percent--more  than any other agency during those years. We can't afford to repeat  that mistake. Entrepreneurs across this country, from rural communities  to inner cities, rely on the SBA and its programs.   I could cite countless success stories, but let me just note one  example I recently heard in New Hampshire from Julie Lapham, who is  founder and chief sales officer of a startup in Dover, NH, called  Popzup.   Popzup is a family-owned business that provides a new popcorn product  for health-conscious consumers. Julie's inspiration for her business  was her mother, who is diabetic and had started to eat popcorn every  day because of the food's low glycemic index. Julie wanted to give her  mother more options than the microwave popcorn you see in the grocery  store, so she created a convenient product that doesn't use chemicals,  plastic, or silicone. Her company's popcorn is environmentally friendly  and sourced from American farms that don't use GMO products.   As a startup, Julie faces a lot of challenges: getting funding to  expand her business, keeping the books, figuring out how to market her  products. Large companies have the resources to figure these things  out, but Julie needs a level playing field to compete, and that is  where the SBA and its resource partners come in.   Julie wrote:         We often feel vulnerable because we are self-funded and       need to master all aspects of running our business;       marketing, manufacture, selling, and accounting.    Julie has been working with advisers at the New Hampshire Small  Business Development Center, SBDC. They operate in every State, and  they are resource partners who provided counseling to Julie and also  provide counseling to small businesses like Julie's across the country.         I don't think there is a week that goes by when we are not       stopping by each other's offices, emailing, and talking on       the phone. I can honestly state that we would not have a       chance at success without their ongoing support and       encouragement.    I am sure my colleagues in the Senate are aware of similar SBA  success stories in their own States.   We all know this agency plays a vital role in our economy, but there  is more that can be done. For our economy to thrive, we need to focus  on ways to further strengthen the SBA so that it can increase  opportunities for entrepreneurs to start new ventures and help existing  small businesses grow. That is especially important in largely rural  States like New Hampshire where it can be harder to get a loan or  counseling. Entrepreneurs like Julie need a strong Administrator who  understands the value of programs like the Small Business Development  Centers. They need someone who will be their voice in Washington and  bring out the best in the SBA. During the confirmation process, Mrs.  McMahon pledged that she shares this view and wants to strengthen the  role SBA plays in assisting our Nation's small businesses. In fact, she  said she was passionate about small business.   For these reasons, I intend to support her confirmation today. I look  forward to continuing to work with Chairman Risch as we support SBA in  the coming years.   I yield the floor.
