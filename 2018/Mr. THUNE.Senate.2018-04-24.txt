 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I was reading a piece in the Wall Street  Journal last week by Kevin Hassett, who was the Chairman of the White  House Council of Economic Advisers. His piece made an important point  that doesn't often come out as clearly as it should, and that is that  when American businesses benefit, American workers benefit. My friends  on the other side of the aisle like to obfuscate that point.   Presumably they think they can gain political points by pitting  businesses and workers against each other, as if benefits for  businesses and benefits for workers were somehow diametrically opposed  and as if, somehow, workers could thrive while businesses struggle.   As the piece I was reading pointed out, ``In a modern competitive  economy, workers do well when their employers do.'' If you think about  it, it really is just common sense. The vast majority of working  Americans work for businesses, whether they are self-employed, an  employee of a small business, or an employee of a large corporation.  For those employees to thrive, the businesses they are working for have  to thrive as well.   Struggling businesses do not invest in workers; they can't. They  don't hire new employees. They don't raise wages. They don't improve  benefits.   On the other hand, thriving businesses do invest in their workers,  they do hire new employees, they do raise wages, and they do improve  benefits. Leaving aside the fact that most business owners want to  invest in their workers, successful business owners have to invest in  their workers if they want their businesses to keep thriving.   For starters, successful businesses tend to need new workers, and the  way to attract new workers is with good wages, good opportunities, and  good benefits. Once a successful business has good employees, it tends  to want to keep them so that the business can keep prospering and  thriving. How do businesses keep employees? The same way they attract  them in the first place--with good wages, good opportunities, and good  benefits.   As Mr. Hassett notes in the Wall Street Journal:         Research by economists Alan Krueger and Lawrence Summers,       both of whom served in the Obama administration, shows that       more-profitable employers pay higher wages. Any company that       attempts to pay a worker less than he is worth will quickly       lose that worker to a competitor. Thus, firms that want to       thrive must invest in their plants and their workers.    Ask any business owner in the country, and he or she will tell you  that it is a competitive labor market. Unemployment is at a 17-year  low. In a tight, competitive labor market, employers have to work to  keep their employees.   Our focus with last fall's tax reform was on making life better for  ordinary Americans, so we set out to put more money in their pockets  right away by cutting tax rates across the board, nearly doubling the  standard deduction and doubling the child tax credit. As a result, for  2018, a family of four making $73,000 will see a tax cut of more than  $2,000.   We knew the tax cuts, as helpful as they are, weren't enough.  Americans also needed access to profitable careers, good jobs, good  wages, and good  [[Page S2373]]  opportunities. We knew the only way to guarantee access to good jobs,  good wages, and good opportunities was to make sure businesses were  prosperous enough to create and maintain them. So when it came time for  tax reform, we set out to improve the playing field for American  workers by improving the playing field for businesses, as well, and it  is working.   Companies are putting tax reform to work. They are investing in new  equipment, expanding their facilities, and growing their lines of  business, all of which mean more jobs and opportunities for Americans.   Most importantly, companies are passing along the benefits of tax  reform. Company after company has announced pay raises, bonuses, 401(k)  match increases, and other benefits for their workers. Others are  passing tax savings on to their customers in the form of things like  utility rate cuts.   The tax reform law has been in place only for 4 months. As businesses  continue to see the benefits of tax reform, we can expect to see the  playing field for workers continue to improve.   Ultimately, by helping American businesses thrive, tax reform will  help give more Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and  opportunities that not only will benefit them right now but also will  give them access to security and prosperity for the long term.
