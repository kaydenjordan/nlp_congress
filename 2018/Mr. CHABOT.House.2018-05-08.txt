 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3170) to amend the Small Business Act to require cyber  certification for small business development center counselors, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3170         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Development       Center Cyber Training Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DUTIES OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER                     COUNSELORS.         Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(o) Cyber Strategy Training for Small Business       Development Centers.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `cyber strategy' means resources and tactics       to assist in planning for cybersecurity and defending against       cyber risks and cyber attacks; and        ``(B) the term `lead small business development center'       means a small business development center that has received a       grant from the Administration.        ``(2) Certification program.--The Administrator shall       establish a cyber counseling certification program, or       approve a similar existing program, to certify the employees       of lead small business development centers to provide cyber       planning assistance to small business concerns.        ``(3) Number of certified employees.--The Administrator       shall ensure that the number of employees of each lead small       business development center who are certified in providing       cyber planning assistance under this subsection is not fewer       than the lesser of--        ``(A) 5; or        ``(B) 10 percent of the total number of employees of the       lead small business development center.        ``(4) Consideration of small business development center       cyber strategy.--In carrying out this subsection, the       Administrator, to the extent practicable, shall consider any       cyber strategy methods included in the Small Business       Development Center Cyber Strategy developed under section       1841(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2662).        ``(5) Reimbursement for certification.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations and subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall       reimburse a lead small business development center for costs       relating to the certification of an employee of the lead       small business development center under the program       established under paragraph (2).        ``(B) Limitation.--The total amount reimbursed by the       Administrator under subparagraph (A) may not exceed $350,000       in any fiscal year.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before we get into the business at hand, I would like to  thank our ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, all of our minority and  majority members on the committee, and their staffs for working in a  bipartisan manner to produce this strong package of small business  bills.   Our committee strives to be bipartisan and an example, really, for  our fellow Members. That can't be done without equal effort on both  sides.   Again, I want to thank Ms. Velazquez for always working with us-- usually working with us--in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank  all the members in the committee for doing that as well.   Mr. Speaker, last week was National Small Business Week all across  America. I like to call small businesses our biggest asset as a Nation.  And because of the actions of this Congress and our President, small  businesses are the most optimistic they have been in more than three  decades.   It is vital to our Nation's economy that these small businesses  succeed. As technology evolves, so must our small businesses. Just as  important as the ice cream shop on Main Street is the online startup  company.   We have an obligation to do everything we can to create an economy  where all small businesses flourish, because a community that has  successful small businesses thrives, and this is good for all of us all  across the country.   This leads us to the first piece of legislation before us today.   Advances in information technology, or IT, have helped small  businesses to rapidly increase their productivity, enter new markets,  and offer consumers new and innovative services and products.   However, IT has advanced so quickly that it has been difficult to  keep pace with the ever-growing cyber threats. Unfortunately, small  businesses are becoming increasingly targeted by cyber criminals.   While larger companies have more resources to detect and combat cyber  attacks, small businesses often do not learn they have been hacked  until it is too late. As chairman of the House Committee on Small  Business, I have heard too many firsthand accounts of this occurring.                                time  1345    One story that stands out to me is the story of a small-business  owner who owned an indoor go-karting facility in Maine and had a number  of employees and their families who depended on it. He told our  committee that he was struck by a phishing scam. He logged on to his  business account, and, to his utter disbelief, his bank account was  zero. This happened on a payday, no less. So all these people, who are  depending on him to pay them, his bank account is zero because some  hacker got into it.   Stories like these are why Congressman Evans and I have introduced  H.R. 3170, the Small Business Development Center Cyber Training Act of  2017. This bipartisan and bicameral legislation would establish a cyber  counseling certification program in lead small business development  centers, or SBDCs, to assist small businesses with planning and  implementing cybersecurity measures to defend against cyber attacks.  The cyber assistance offered by trained staff at SBDCs would be  provided at no cost, or low cost, to small businesses.   Cyber planning assistance will encourage small businesses to take a  more proactive approach to defending themselves from cyber attacks by  leveraging the expertise from SBDCs and their partner agencies and  institutions, rather than being forced to react after an attack.   When provided with the right resources, small businesses can be  assured that they have an effective cyber plan in place. I would like  to thank Mr. Evans for his collaboration on this bill, and I would urge  my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I do not have any further speakers on this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close, and I will be brief.   Mr. Speaker, America's small business development centers must have  the best possible cybersecurity training so that they can better assist  small businesses to detect and combat cyber attacks.   In our committee's efforts to spotlight these serious and growing  threats, it has become clear that we need to think outside the box as  we work to thwart cyber attacks, and the bipartisan bill before us  today is a step in that direction.   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I want to  again thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking  member, for her leadership on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4754) to amend the Small Business Act to provide prospective  construction contractors with information about an agency's policies on  the administration of change orders to allow such contractors to make  informed business decisions regarding the pricing of bids or proposals,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4754         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Change Order Transparency       for Federal Contractors Act''.       SEC. 2. CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION.         Section 15 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(w) Solicitation Notice Regarding Administration of       Change Orders for Construction.--        ``(1) In general.--With respect to any solicitation for the       award of a contract for construction anticipated to be       awarded to a small business concern, the agency administering       such contract shall provide a notice along with the       solicitation to prospective bidders and offerors that       includes--        ``(A) information about the agency's policies or practices       in complying with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition       Regulation relating to the timely definitization of requests       for an equitable adjustment; and        ``(B) information about the agency's past performance in       definitizing requests for equitable adjustments in accordance       with paragraph (2).        ``(2) Requirements for agencies.--An agency shall provide       the past performance information described under paragraph       (1)(B) as follows:        ``(A) For the 3-year period preceding the issuance of the       notice, to the extent such information is available.        ``(B) With respect to an agency that, on the date of the       enactment of this subsection, has not compiled the       information described under paragraph (1)(B)--        ``(i) beginning 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this subsection, for the 1-year period preceding the issuance       of the notice;        ``(ii) beginning 2 years after the date of the enactment of       this subsection, for the 2-year period preceding the issuance       of the notice; and        ``(iii) beginning 3 years after the date of the enactment       of this subsection and each year thereafter, for the 3-year       period preceding the issuance of the notice.        ``(3) Format of past performance information.--In the       notice required under paragraph (1), the agency shall ensure       that the past performance information described under       paragraph (1)(B) is set forth separately for each       definitization action that was completed during the following       periods:        ``(A) Not more than 30 days after receipt of a request for       an equitable adjustment.        ``(B) Not more than 60 days after receipt of a request for       an equitable adjustment.        ``(C) Not more than 90 days after receipt of a request for       an equitable adjustment.        ``(D) Not more than 180 days after receipt of a request for       an equitable adjustment.        ``(E) More than 365 days after receipt of a request for an       equitable adjustment.        ``(F) After the completion of the performance of the       contract through a contract modification addressing all       undefinitized requests for an equitable adjustment received       during the term of the contract.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Mr. Bacon for introducing this good government legislation.  It is a protransparency bill, and it addresses an often overlooked  problem facing small Federal construction contractors. He has been a  leader on this issue, and we appreciate that very much because it is an  important bill.   Our Federal Government spends billions of dollars on construction  annually, an industry that is critical to rebuilding our Nation's aging  infrastructure. Small businesses are the lifeblood of construction,  performing in various roles across the entire supply chain.   Unfortunately, no construction project is immune to change. Contract  modifications or change orders are prevalent in construction  contracts--in fact, in virtually all construction contracts. The issue  arises when the Federal agency delays executing a change order or  issuing payment for the work completed. This leaves the small  contractor responsible for financing the work out-of-pocket while also  paying for overhead costs.   Extended delays in payment can result in severe financial  consequences, sometimes including bankruptcy for small contractors.  Agencies currently do not publish information regarding their contract  modification processes or payment records, leaving contractors  basically in the dark.   Without this information, small prime contractors and subcontractors  take an enormous risk every time they submit an offer with an agency  that may be acting in less than good faith. Furthermore, small  contractors are often unable to develop accurate bid prices if they  choose to risk working with the agency.   To offset the risk of delayed or nonpayment, contractors may inflate  the cost of their bids, passing on these costs to the taxpayer. Due to  the lack of transparency promoting a high-risk, high-stakes  environment, working with the Federal Government becomes less  appealing. Small contractors are leaving the marketplace in favor of  private sector projects, which reduces competition.   This bill, Mr. Bacon's bill, takes a critical step forward by  requiring the contracting agency to disclose, in their solicitations,  the details of their change order procedures, as well as a historical  record showing whether change orders are resolved in a timely manner.                                time  1400    Contractors can use this information to decide, first and foremost,  if they want to bid; and if so, they can formulate more realistic cost  estimates and better prepare for delays in payment.   This bill, Mr. Bacon's bill, should also encourage agencies to  improve their own internal change order processes, making the Federal  construction marketplace attractive again. Ultimately, this legislation  will result in expanding the industrial base, improving transparency  and government accountability, and ensuring that high-quality  structures are built at a reasonable cost.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the principal sponsor of  this legislation, Mr. Bacon, I would like to thank my colleague Steve  Knight from California for working on this as well; and also Al Lawson  from Florida, and also Stephanie Murphy from Florida. So we have two  Republicans and two Democrats again working together on this on behalf  of small businesses all across the country, and I want to thank all  four of those Members for their leadership on this on both sides of the  aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on the bill at  this time, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, this legislation provides a level of certainty for small  businesses who contract with the Federal Government. It is a  commonsense, bipartisan bill that benefits small firms and ought to  improve efficiency within the Federal contracting arena.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Ms. Velazquez for her work in a bipartisan  manner on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1680) to amend the Small Business Act to improve the women's  business center program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Administrator of Small Business Administration       shall publish in the Federal Register such regulations as are       necessary to carry out section 29 of the Small Business Act       (15 U.S.C. 656), as amended by this Act. The Administrator       shall accept public comments on such proposed regulations for       a period of not less than 60 days.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1680, the Women's  Business Centers Improvements Act of 2018, which was introduced by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), who is also the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce and who has been a very  active member of that committee for quite some time now.   This legislation makes key updates to the Small Business  Administration's Office of Women's Business Ownership and the Women's  Business Center, or WBC, program.   The WBC program provides grants to over 100 nonprofit organizations  across the country to provide socially and economically disadvantaged  women with technical and managerial training designed to meet the needs  of women entrepreneurs. Many women's business centers offer training at  night, or in multiple languages, to ensure that all women have the  small business knowledge, tools, and support they need when creating or  sustaining a business.   Last year, WBCs trained over 114,000 clients and advised over 26,000  individuals. This training and counseling contributed to the creation  of more than 17,000 new small businesses in the United States. Clearly,  the Women's Business Center program has a profound impact not only in  our local communities, but also on our Nation's economy overall.   H.R. 1680 authorizes the WBC program, requiring specific conditions  for participation and application criteria for organizations seeking a  WBC grant. While many of these requirements have been met in practice,  the inclusion of these standards in statute allows for increased  congressional oversight and program confidence.   H.R. 1680 also increases the WBC grant award to reflect inflation.  This minor increase provides new and existing women's business centers  with the support they need to provide an effective course curriculum to  small business clients.   Additionally, H.R. 1680 requires the SBA to establish a WBC  accreditation program. This program, similar to the successful small  business development center accreditation program, will ensure  pragmatic consistency among WBC locations and guarantee that each  center is providing women entrepreneurs with effective training  opportunities. These updates will ensure that the funds supporting the  WBC program are used efficiently and to foster economic growth.   H.R. 1680 is an important step to ensuring that the more than 11.6  million women-owned small businesses continue to grow and that the next  generation of women entrepreneurs have the opportunity to pursue  business creation. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1680.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, before I turn it over to the gentleman, the  principal sponsor of the bill, I want to thank our colleague Mr. Lawson  for his work on this bill as well. Again, we have been bipartisan,  Republican and Democrat, working together to advance, in this case,  women entrepreneurs all across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Knight), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Contracting and Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, almost 40 percent of all firms in the United States are  women-owned, and over the last 10 years that number has more than  doubled.   It is important to recognize women entrepreneurs as a driving force  in the American economy. This legislation, I think, goes a long way in  recognizing that and actually improving it over the upcoming years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1702) to amend the Small Business Act to improve the small  business development centers program, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 1702         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This subtitle may be cited as the ``Small Business       Development Centers Improvement Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1702, the Small Business Development Centers  Improvement Act of 2018, will expand the resources available to  America's entrepreneurs through the nearly 1,000 small business  development centers, or SBDCs, located throughout the country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for  introducing this bill.   Over 99 percent of all businesses in our Nation are small, and those  businesses employ nearly 60 million Americans. The U.S. economy depends  on the success of small businesses. Providing support to entrepreneurs  and small-business owners must be a priority for this Congress, and  SBDCs offer that support.   Small business development centers offer low- or no-cost business  counseling and training to aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small- business owners alike. The support offered at these centers ranges from  creating the first business plan, commercial advertising and branding,  and navigating the international trade market.   The importance of the assistance offered at SBDCs really cannot be  overstated. In fiscal year 2017 alone, last year, SBDCs trained over  245,000 clients and advised over 188,000 individuals, resulting in the  creation of over 14,000 new small businesses and the infusion of  roughly $5.6 billion into the American economy.   For every Federal dollar appropriated to the SBDC program, $43.50 in  new capital was generated. The legislation we are discussing today will  only serve to increase the impact of SBDCs.   H.R. 1702 includes a number of commonsense updates to the SBDC  program. This legislation will increase awareness of the technical and  managerial training opportunities offered at centers by allowing SBDCs  to market and advertise their products and services. This simple change  can have a significant impact on our economy by ensuring that those  entrepreneurs seeking to start or scale a business know where to turn  for help.   Additionally, H.R. 1702 will strengthen the SBDC accreditation  process and ensure client information remains confidential. These  changes facilitate the efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars  at every SBDC.   Through H.R. 1702, this legislation, we will provide greater support  to the men and women throughout our country who are working tirelessly  to create jobs, enhance our communities, and support our economies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), a very valuable member of the  Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Evans) for his leadership on this and many other issues on the  committee.   The small business development centers, SBDCs, serve, really, a very  important purpose in furthering entrepreneurship and business creation  throughout the United States. Many of the Nation's nearly 30 million  small businesses have utilized the services offered by the SBDCs, and  this bill improves and modernizes that network.   I again want to commend Mr. Evans for formulating this bill, pushing  it through, and now taking this important step in actually entering it  into the law.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4111) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to  improve the number of small business investment companies in  underlicensed States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4111         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Spurring Business in       Communities Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. IMPROVING THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT                     COMPANIES IN UNDERLICENSED STATES.         The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 661 et       seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 103 (15 U.S.C. 662)--        (A) in paragraph (18)(E), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in paragraph (19), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(20) the term `underlicensed State' means a State in       which the number of licensees per capita is less than the       median number of licensees per capita for all States, as       calculated by the Administrator.'';        (2) in section 301(c) (15 U.S.C. 681(c))--        (A) in paragraph (3)--        (i) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by striking ``and'' at the       end;        (ii) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) shall give first priority to an applicant that is       located in an underlicensed State with below median       financing, as determined by the Administrator.''; and        (B) in paragraph (4)(B)--        (i) by striking clause (i);        (ii) by redesignating clauses (ii) and (iii) as clauses (i)       and (ii), respectively; and        (iii) by amending clause (i), as so redesignated, to read       as follows:        ``(i) is located in a State that--         ``(I) is not served by a licensee; or        ``(II) is an underlicensed State; and''; and         (3) in section 308(g) (15 U.S.C. 687(g))--        (A) in paragraph (2)--        (i) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and licensing''       after ``financing'';        (ii) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) through (J) as       subparagraphs (E) through (L), respectively; and  [[Page H3809]]         (iii) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:        ``(C) Steps taken by the Administration to improve the       number of licensees in underlicensed States.        ``(D) The Administration's plans to support States that       seek to increase the number of licensees in the State.''; and        (B) in paragraph (3)--        (i) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(E) the geographic dispersion of licensees in each State       compared to the population of the State, identifying       underlicensed States.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, despite an improving lending environment, small  businesses still face challenges financing their projects and their  growth plans. Equity markets, which are regularly used by large  businesses, often prove out of reach for the Nation's true job  creators, small businesses.   To bridge the equity gap that exists for small businesses, the SBA  offers the Small Business Investment Company program, also known as the  SBIC program. The program utilizes a privately owned, SBA-regulated and  licensed model to deliver equity to the Nation's smallest businesses.   While running at zero cost to the American taxpayer, the SBIC program  creates a unique public-private partnership that translates into job  expansion and job creation.   In fiscal year 2017, SBIC financing supported more than 100,000 jobs  all across the Nation--100,000 jobs, so this is an important program.  However, the program can do more.   With only about 300 SBICs currently operating in the United States,  the program often does not geographically extend to those who truly  need it the most. To address this problem, the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers) introduced H.R. 4111, the Spurring  Business in Communities Act of 2017, which expands the reach of the  SBIC program by requiring the SBA to focus on areas that are  underrepresented in the program as they review and license SBIC  applications.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on this particular  issue. She has definitely taken a very important and active role on it  in looking for ways to expand the reach of the SBIC program.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this commonsense reform  within H.R. 4111, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the principal  sponsor of this legislation, who also has the number four ranking  leadership role on the Republican side of the House.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding, and I appreciate his leadership on all of these bills that  are going to help our small businesses.   I rise today in support of my legislation, the Spurring Business in  Communities Act, which would encourage investment in small businesses  through incentivizing small business investment companies, or SBICs, to  form and invest in communities all across the country.   Small businesses are the backbone of our community and our economy,  providing two out of three new jobs in America. SBICs serve an  important function in providing capital and support to startup  businesses across the country and are a significant source of job  creation. A 2017 Library of Congress study found that SBIC-backed small  businesses created 3 million new jobs and supported an additional 6.5  million.   According to SBA's most recent report, SBICs reported nearly $1  billion in financing during the fourth quarter of 2017 and created more  than 16,000 jobs. Over the same period, SBICs were able to finance 210  companies across the U.S., including 25 businesses in low- and  moderate-income areas, and 12 businesses owned by women, minorities, or  veterans.   Many well-known companies have achieved success through support from  SBICs, including Apple, Buffalo Wild Wings, Costco, and Staples.   While SBICs invest broadly in businesses across the country, the  location of the firms receiving SBA backing is not geographically  diverse. Instead, SBICs are primarily located in larger urban and  financial centers, which only further concentrates lending and  investment activity. Washington, my home State, has none. In fact, 72  percent of SBICs are located in 10 States.                                time  1445    This legislation will change that by easing the process for SBICs to  form in underlicensed States like Washington, invest in people in our  community, grow our local economy, and create jobs.   This legislation would increase SBA's accountability to Congress and  the public by exempting SBIC applicants from underlicensed States from  the full capital requirements, give first priority to new applications  from underlicensed or underfinanced States, and establish annual  reporting requirements on SBA's progress to increase the geographical  dispersement of SBICs.   Last week was Small Business Week, an important reminder of the  critical role small businesses play in our communities.   The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 declares a mission to  ensure the provision of Small Business Investment Company financing to  all of the country. This legislation will help meet that mission by  encouraging SBICs to form in the underlicensed areas and invest in all  corners of the country, which is why I encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support the Spurring Business in Communities Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to recognize and thank Mrs. McMorris  Rodgers for her leadership on this really very important issue which  will make a big difference in various parts of our country in the area  of small business development and job creation. The SBIC program  continues to produce results for job creators and job seekers.   To ensure the program reaches underserved areas, H.R. 4111, Mrs.  [[Page H3810]]  McMorris Rodgers' bill, institutes reforms to show how the SBA reviews  and processes SBIC applications and to improve those. This legislation  will grow the reach of a program that currently runs at zero cost to  the American taxpayer, which is certainly a mark that we should all  recognize and appreciate.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mrs. McMorris Rodgers for this important  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4111, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5236) to expand opportunities available to employee-owned  business concerns through Small Business Administration loan programs,  and for other purposes, as amended.

Section 3(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       632(c)(2)(A)(ii)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(ii) which provides that each participant is entitled to       direct the plan trustee as to the manner of how to vote the       qualified employer securities (as defined in section       4975(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), which are       allocated to the account of such participant with respect to       a corporate matter which (by law or charter) must be decided       by a vote conducted in accordance with section 409(e) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ownership structures of businesses come in numerous  shapes and sizes. Whether they follow a traditional model or an  employee-owned structure, small businesses across the Nation continue  to face a difficult lending environment.   Although the SBA bridges the gap for many of the Nation's small  firms, 100-percent-employee-owned firms face uncertainty as they  navigate the SBA's 7(a) Loan Program.   To strengthen the 7(a) Loan Program for employee-owned small  businesses and worker cooperatives, Ranking Member Velazquez introduced  H.R. 5236, the Main Street Employee Ownership Act of 2018.   In order to provide clarity for program participants, H.R. 5236 would  update reporting statistics to ensure accurate data is captured.   The bill also codifies ownership transition plans.   Additionally, H.R. 5236 requires the SBA's resource partners to have  educational material available to explain the nuances of these uniquely  structured businesses.   Although the requirements for personal guarantees within the 7(a)  Loan Program prove challenging to some of these business structures,  H.R. 5236 importantly preserves this hallmark and requires the SBA to  work with industry representatives to develop ways to satisfy the  guarantee while reducing its burdens.   Employee-owned small businesses are an important part of the small  business ecosystem. We must continue to streamline the processes and  procedures in place at the SBA for all small businesses. H.R. 5236, Ms.  Velazquez's legislation, is a step in the right direction that provides  clarity for employee-owned small businesses and worker cooperatives.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, who  has spearheaded this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5236, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by saying that employee-owned businesses  really populate the streets and neighborhoods of many cities across  this Nation. They are unique in form but face many of the same hurdles  that other small businesses face.   H.R. 5236 streamlines how employee-owned businesses operate under the  important rules of the SBA 7(a) Loan Program. While preserving  important characteristics of the program, H.R. 5236 will help employee- owned businesses as they seek capital to grow, expand, and create much- needed jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank and commend the ranking member,  Ms. Velazquez, for her leadership on this legislation.   I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5236, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4743) to amend the Small Business Act to strengthen the  Office of Credit Risk Management within the Small Business  Administration, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4743         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business 7(a) Lending       Oversight Reform Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act, the terms ``Administration'' and       ``Administrator'' mean the Small Business Administration and       the Administrator thereof, respectively.       SEC. 3.

REPEAL OF SMALL BUSINESS LOAN LOSS REPORT.         Subsection (b) of section 10 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 639(b)) is repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, although the economy is starting to recover, small  businesses continue to face a rigid lending environment that challenges  growth and job creation. With options limited, small businesses  regularly turn to the SBA, the Small Business Administration, for  assistance.   With nearly 70,000 loans made in fiscal year 2017, the 7(a) Loan  Program is the SBA's largest capital access tool and is reserved for  creditworthy small businesses that cannot access traditional or  conventional bank lending.                                time  1500    In recent years, the program has experienced rapid growth, which  spiked congressional interest and resulted in numerous hearings and  meetings to evaluate the SBA's oversight of lenders.   After careful consideration, I, along with the ranking member, Ms.  Velazquez, determined legislation was needed to ensure the integrity of  the program and to safeguard the American taxpayers' dollars. As a  result, in January of this year, we introduced H.R. 4743, the Small  Business 7(a) Lending Oversight Reform Act of 2018, this bill.   H.R. 4743 contains important oversight reforms that strengthen the  SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management and the SBA's Lender Oversight  Committee. H.R. 4743 also bolsters the credit elsewhere test which acts  as a gatekeeper into this government guarantee program.   With the reforms outlined in this provision, the credit elsewhere  test will be clarified and refocused on a borrower's ability to access  the program. The changes to the credit elsewhere test will ensure the  program is being used by eligible and deserving small businesses.   Additionally, H.R. 4743 outlines a portfolio risk analysis that the  SBA must perform. With any program that has a government role, healthy  and vigorous oversight is required to protect the taxpayers. H.R. 4743  provides this for the 7(a) Loan Program and for the Nation's small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, for  all of her hard work and interest in this topic, and I also want to  thank all of the members of the committee who have had a role in  exploring this issue.   The bill has broad, bipartisan support--as many of our bills often  do. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4743, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Investigations, Oversight and Regulations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for her leadership on  this  [[Page H3815]]  issue. I would also like to thank the staffs on both sides of the  aisle, and I would also like to thank the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, Rodney Frelinghuysen, for his assistance in a  bump that we ran into at the eleventh hour there.   He was a classmate of mine. We both came in in the historic class of  1994, and he will be leaving at the end of this term. He is going to be  greatly missed, but, in any event, I want to thank Chairman  Frelinghuysen.   Mr. Speaker, to conclude, the 7(a) Loan Program is an important  capital access resource for the Nation's small businesses. However,  with any government guarantee program, strong oversight is mandatory to  safeguard American taxpayer dollars. H.R. 4743 institutes strong and  critical reforms to make sure oversight is front and center as this  program is administered by the SBA.   H.R. 4743 ensures the program will only be utilized by small  businesses that truly require its services, and I urge my colleagues to  support the bipartisan reforms instituted in H.R. 4743.   Finally, I want to again thank the gentlewoman from New York and the  staffs and everyone else involved in this. I understand it might not be  the norm everywhere these days, but, in our committee, it is business-- and I should say--it is small business as usual. The gentlewoman was  really a pleasure to work with on this and many other issues, so I  thank the gentlewoman very much for her work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
