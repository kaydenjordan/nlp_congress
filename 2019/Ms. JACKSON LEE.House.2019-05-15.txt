 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule  governing debate of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and the underlying  legislation.   I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation and I  commend once more the tireless work of my colleague, the gentleman from  Rhode Island, Mr. Cicilline.   I was proud to stand by him at its introduction, and championed it  during our hearing on the matter in this committee, the first such  hearing on the matter, for which I would also like to commend the  Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jerry Nadler.   Much has changed in recent years about Americans' attitude towards  members of the LGBTQ community.   While Americans can be happy that we as a society have made strides  in marriage equality, there is much work to do.   Despite significant legal advances over the past several years-- including marriage equality, LGBTQ Americans remain vulnerable to  discrimination on a daily basis and too often have little recourse.   Fifty percent of the national LGBTQ community live in states where,  though they have the right to marry, they have no explicit non- discrimination protections in other areas of daily life.   In most states, a same-sex couple can get married one day and legally  denied service at a restaurant, be fired from their jobs or evicted  from their apartment the next.   The Equality Act is historic legislation that says, unequivocally,  that LGBTQ Americans deserve the full protections guaranteed by the  landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The Equality Act extends anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ  Americans with regard to employment, education, access to credit, jury  service, federal funding, housing, and public accommodations.   No American should ever be treated as less than equal in the eyes of  the law.   The Equality Act will guarantee that LGBTQ Americans in Texas and  across the country cannot be discriminated against because of who they  are or whom they love.   It is long past time for this legislation to become law and that is  why I proudly joined my colleagues today to get the job done.   In some areas, federal law prohibiting sex discrimination has already  been properly interpreted by federal courts and administrative agencies  to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender  identity.   The Equality Act affirms these interpretations of existing law and  makes the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual  orientation or gender identity explicit, in order to provide greater  clarity to members of the public, employers, schools, businesses and  others.   In areas where sex discrimination is not already prohibited, the bill  amends existing law to bar discrimination on the basis of sex, as well  as sexual orientation and gender identity.   The need for this legislation is all the more urgent following recent  news that the Supreme Court has granted a writ of Certiorari to a trio  of three cases to test the reach of the Civil Rights act to determine  if they cover gay and transgendered individuals.   With the political reality on the Court as it is, this body--the  House of Representatives--owes it to our constituents to ensure that  critical issues related to the civil rights of our fellow citizens are  handled by their elected representatives, and not left to the whims of  a reconstituted Trump Court demonstrably antagonistic towards the  interests of minorities.   This is why the Equality Act has the bipartisan support of Members of  Congress, the strong support of the business community, and the  overwhelming support of the American people--with more than 7 in 10  supporting the Equality Act.   On behalf of LGBTQ Texans and all Americans, I am proud to be one of  the original co-sponsors of H.R. 5, the Equality Act.   I look forward to voting YES when it comes to the House Floor,  tomorrow and working towards full enactment.   With this critical legislation, we will finally, fully end  discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, and move our nation closer to  fulfilling the promise of equality, opportunity and justice for every  American.   In the meanwhile, I support the rule governing debate of H.R. 5 and  the underlying legislation.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 377         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4.

All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendment described in section 5 of this       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader       and the Minority Leader or their respective designees; and       (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in Section 4 is an       amendment to H.R. 336 to add at the end of the bill the       following:       ``SEC. 406.
