 Mr. Speaker, in 2009, when gas prices were  very high and our dependence on foreign oil was at its peak, the  Environmental Protection Agency set standards to increase fuel  efficiency of trucks and cars. This helped achieve three main goals: It  lessened the burden on consumers faced with high gas prices, addressed  the urgent national security priority relating to our addiction to  Middle East oil, and sought to limit the admittance of harmful fumes  into our atmosphere.   At the same time, we made unprecedented commitment to our auto  industry, and in their most uncertain and darkest moment, facing  collapse and bankruptcy, America bailed them out. We did this, and it  came with political consequences, but we believe in their centrality to  the future of the American economy, and we still do.   That is why it is so disappointing to see the eagerness the auto  industry has with this administration's choice to cave--and cowardly-- on fuel efficiency standards. Gas prices may be low now, but they won't  be forever. It would be a misguided decision to shelve these fuel- efficiency rules now.                            ____________________
