 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019, of  which I am a proud cosponsor, delivers on the promise to reform  American democracy by protecting voting rights and our elections,  improving the transparency of campaign finance, and promoting ethics  and accountability.   Key to safeguarding voting rights is ensuring that our voting system  is secure and free from interference by foreign actors.   My amendment to H.R. 1 would help States implement voting system  security improvements in order to enhance the integrity of our Federal  election infrastructure.   Adapted from the FAST Voting Act, H.R. 1512, which I recently  reintroduced with my colleague, Representative  Jim Langevin of Rhode  Island, this amendment to H.R. 1 would award supplementary grants to  State applicants based on evidence of previous election security  reforms and plans for implementing additional innovations.   This race-to-the-top model would incentivize States to adopt best  practices, including providing voting machines that are less than 10  years old, maintaining offline backups of voter registration lists, and  providing a secure platform for disseminating vote totals.   According to the Brennan Center for Justice, in the 2016 Federal  elections, voters relied on outdated voting equipment that was more  than a decade old in 43 of the 50 States, Mr. Chairman.   My amendment would also instruct the Election Assistance Commission,  when evaluating State grant applications, to consider evidence of  collaboration between relevant stakeholders, including local election  officials, in developing the grant implementation plan and the State's  plan to evaluate the effectiveness of its grant activities.   We now know that Russia directly targeted State voter databases and  software systems in 39 States during the 2016 Federal elections. That  effort by Russia and additional foreign entities to conduct robust  influence operations persisted, sadly, in the 2018 midterm elections,  and the U.S. intelligence community expects such attacks to continue  through the 2020 Federal elections.   Numerous witnesses before the Homeland Security Committee testified  on the ongoing need for investment to protect us from such attacks. The  need to strengthen the integrity of our voting system is crystal clear,  Mr. Chairman. We have a moral obligation as Members of Congress to  protect the sacred nature of the results of every election, and it is  urgent.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this simple but, I think,  helpful amendment to move us toward voter security in the next election  and enhance cybersecurity for all of our Federal election  infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to see there is no opposition here on  the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1900
