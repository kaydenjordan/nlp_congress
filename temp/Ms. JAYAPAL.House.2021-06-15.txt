 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Bowman for yielding  to me and also for his tremendous leadership in the Progressive Caucus.  We are so proud to welcome him into the Progressive Caucus, into  Congress, and to have the benefit of his tremendous experience in  education, in caregiving, on so many fronts. I am so proud to cosponsor  the Care resolution with the gentleman. I think it is a very important  statement.   Madam Speaker, I am also very proud to be here as the chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus. This is our Special Order hour that  we get to devote to any topic that we want; and, today, it is a real  privilege and an honor to devote it to the American Families Plan.   Why?   Because the American Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan are  what this country needs and what this country wants. Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents across the country have said clearly that  they are ready for a big, bold investment that allows us, allows  America, to build back better.   That is what the President has proposed because, Madam Speaker, at  the core of any society is how we care and look out for each other.  That reality was made undeniably clear as we have struggled to overcome  the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 600,000 deaths.   And at the root of our recovery is how we look out for each other,  how we give each other opportunities, how we ensure that America truly  is a country where we are all better off when we are all better off.   For me, coming to this country by myself at the age of 16, now  getting to serve in the United States Congress as the first South  Asian-American woman, I have watched how too many people across America  do not have that opportunity. They do not have the investments that we,  as a Federal Government, should make in order for them to be  successful.   Now, our care economy is broad. I am not just talking about essential  healthcare providers, like nurses and doctors who cared for patients  struck by COVID-19. I am talking about the broader care infrastructure,  and that includes childcare. It includes home- and community-care  services. And it includes providing everyone with basic paid family and  medical leave and more.   The American Families Plan also includes investing in healthcare for  everyone across America, investing in education, the kind of education  that gave me my opportunity to come here. We need to provide that 2  years of free community college or college for people across this  country so that they can get the additional skills they need.   We need to invest in housing and, of course, we need to invest in  this broader care economy.   At the end of the day, our American Families Plan, the President's  American Families Plan, the jobs plan, has to be about every person  across this country, working-class, poor, people who are seeking  opportunity, people who deserve to have the American Dream that is no  more; to make sure that every person, White, Black, and Brown, with  understanding that the disproportionate burden of our inequities and  racial injustices in the United States have fallen on Black, Brown, and  Indigenous people, we need to make sure that all people are taken care  of and have opportunity.                                time  1900    Care infrastructure is the critical infrastructure that allows our  families and communities to thrive and stay healthy.   Take, for instance, the home care workers across the country who have  been serving on the front lines of the pandemic. For those most  vulnerable to COVID, such as people with disabilities and seniors, home  care workers were often the difference between life and death. Home  care workers allowed many of those most vulnerable to avoid congregate  settings, like nursing and group homes, that saw a high spread of  COVID.   Yet, this critical workforce shrunk by 280,000 people at the  beginning of the pandemic, despite an increasing need for home care  services. That is why the Biden administration has proposed investing  $400 billion to expand the home care workforce, something I was very  proud to help negotiate last year as part of our Unity Task Force on  healthcare.   But we can't stop there, and the American Families Plan doesn't stop  there. The American Families Plan also recognizes that the majority of  caregivers, as Mr. Bowman said, are women and disproportionately women  of color. Many of them are responsible for care at home, which is a  huge reason why we have seen women forced out of the workforce in  record numbers.   In December 2020 alone, women accounted for nearly all the jobs lost,  with a disproportionately high number of job losses coming from women  of color.   That is why we need robust investments in universal childcare. No  family, regardless of income, should pay more than 7 percent of their  income on childcare. And we have to eliminate administrative barriers,  like work requirements, that make it much more difficult for low-income  White, Black, Brown, and indigenous people to access childcare.   Finally, we have to ensure strong labor standards for this care  workforce. We cannot entrust people to care for the most valuable  people in our lives and deny them a living wage, the right to join a  union, and paid leave. These workers give our loved ones dignity. They  give so many of us the ability to work outside of our homes to support  our families.   As we talk about domestic workers, I am so proud to have the Domestic  Workers Bill of Rights that I have introduced in Congress. Let's  remember that this care work is the work that allows all other work to  be possible.   This is an important moment for us to pass the American Families Plan  to invest in education, to invest in healthcare, to lower the Medicare  eligibility age, to take on prescription drugs, and to invest in this  oh-so-important care economy. It is time to deliver for the American  people so we continue to build back better and ensure that everyone has  the support they need.
