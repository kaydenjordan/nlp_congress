Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 838 provides for  consideration of H.R. 4820 and H.R. 4821  [[Page H5236]]  under a structured rule and makes in order Democratic as well as  Republican amendments. The rule further provides for consideration of  H.R. 6126 under a closed rule and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have made a promise to the American  people. We promised to deliver single-subject appropriations bills that  responsibly fund government by cutting wasteful spending and investing  in necessary services. We have passed six such bills so far, which is  nearly three-quarters of overall discretionary spending. I am proud to  say that we are keeping that promise here again today as we work to  pass two more.   H.R. 4820 and H.R. 4821 will cut billions in unnecessary government  spending and prevent overreaching regulations while prioritizing vital  programs. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill reduces funding for Department of  Transportation grant programs by over $6.6 billion and the Department  of Housing and Urban Development by over $1.7 billion.   The Appropriations Committee made these cuts by rejecting the  administration's request to increase bureaucracy and their request to  increase wasteful climate and equity initiatives. It rejects their  request for additional program initiatives, including one to make the  DOT's Federal vehicle fleet electric to the tune of $26 million and  $300 million for Green New Deal grants promoting environmental justice  priorities in public housing of all places.   It cuts all this and more while funding key programs. It will  strengthen our infrastructure; prioritize transportation safety,  including funding the training of 1,800 new air traffic controllers;  and focus on housing assistance for vulnerable Americans, including the  elderly, the disabled, and veterans.   The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill  rightsizes agency funding levels while expanding access to critical  minerals. It also repeals this administration's waters of the United  States regulation, something so important to States like Minnesota that  know full well how to manage their waters and do not need the  government telling them how to do their job.   Can you imagine having to go through the Federal Government when your  field floods because now those waters fall under WOTUS authority? WOTUS  is just another example of unnecessary government overreach.   The bill also limits the abuse of the Endangered Species Act. This  also impacts States like Minnesota where the gray wolf population is  not just maintained but is actually thriving. Because in California the  gray wolf population is dwindling, the administration would force  Minnesota to follow the same regulations as California. Complete  nonsense.   I am proud to support this legislation that prioritizes public safety  while trusting the States to do what is right for them.   Mr. Speaker, finally, I stand here today in full support of our ally  Israel. The supplemental package we are debating today will provide  critical aid to our friend, as they defend themselves against  terrorists, while respecting taxpayer dollars.   On October 7, our allies in the Middle East were attacked by Hamas  terrorists, murdering 1,400 people. The victims include women,  children, innocent bystanders, and even American citizens since the  attacks started.   Israel and the U.S. enjoy a unique and longstanding relationship as  one of our closest non-NATO allies. We have, for decades, provided  assistance to help Israel defend itself, and House Republicans are  continuing that tradition today.                                time  0930    The Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act provides $14  billion for Israel to defend itself against foreign terrorists. This  includes funds for Iron Dome and David's Sling defense systems and  further development of the Iron Beam defense system.   Perhaps more significantly, this bill is offset through rescissions  of the Democrats' IRS army funding provided under the Inflation  Reduction Act. This rescission represents an important effort to  respect the taxpayer and the dollars they entrust in us. America's  support for Israel is unwavering, but there is simply no reason why the  funds we provide should be placed on the backs of future generations by  furthering our debt crisis.   This is a commonsense solution, and I commend Speaker Johnson and  Chairwoman Granger in putting forth this bill at such a timely  juncture. I look forward to supporting this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I urge all Members to do so.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring the focus back to the discussions  in front of us.   It is worth reminding everyone that while we may have had a delay, we  have still passed six appropriations bills this Congress. The Senate  has just passed their first three appropriations bills this week. The  House has passed bills representing the majority of the Federal  discretionary spending, which is roughly three-quarters of the budget,  and the Senate has passed just 17 percent.   Make no mistake: we still have a lot of work to do, but Speaker  Johnson and the House Republicans will continue to work towards passing  every bill individually before our November 17 deadline. I do invite my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I will bring the discussion back to the real issues at  hand and talk about the fact that the American people and my  constituents sent me to Washington to responsibly fund government and  to stop overregulation and unnecessary interference from Washington.  Overturning WOTUS, reining in the EPA, and investing in transportation  safety, these bills do exactly that.   The appropriations bills we are debating today cut unnecessary  programming and prioritize the programs that serve the American people  while allocating critical funding for vulnerable populations.   I am proud of the work that my colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee have done to take an honest look at government spending and  make the sometimes hard decisions about where realistic cuts can be  made. It is especially important because the national debt continues to  rise and burden the next generation.   I support the rule and the underlying bills, and I encourage Members  to do the same to make sure that we are responding responsibly to the  national debt and the crisis that we are facing.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 838 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
