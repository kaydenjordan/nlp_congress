 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   We are here today to protect our constituents and save lives. We have  waited far too long for this day.   Elements of my bill, the Prevent Gun Trafficking Act, are included in  this legislation to crack down on the illegal gun trafficking and straw  purchasing that is bringing guns into communities across the country.   I know just how detrimental trafficking can be to a community. Last  year, in Chicago, a single stolen gun was linked to at least 27  separate shootings before it was taken off the street. Two dozen people  were shot during its use and two of them killed.   More than half of guns used in Chicago shootings are brought into the  city by trafficking. Thank you, Wisconsin and Indiana.   We have lost so many people and traumatized countless others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation to help make Chicagoland a safer place.
