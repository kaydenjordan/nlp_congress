 Mr. Speaker, Officer Floyd East, Jr., of the Texas  Tech Police Department recently responded to a routine student welfare  check at the dormitory. Callers reported a 19-year-old individual named  Hollis Daniels, who was acting erratically and potentially had a  weapon.   So Officer East went to Daniel's dorm room, and he discovered drugs  and drug paraphernalia. Hollis, the defendant, was arrested and taken  to the station for a standard debriefing.   But that is when the intake procedure at the police station went  haywire. The defendant was not adequately searched before booking.  Suddenly, the dastardly criminal whipped out a gun and fired pointblank  into 48-year-old Officer East's head, instantly killing him. This is a  photograph of Officer East. Yet another peace officer, another guardian  of the thin blue line, murdered for no reason.   The suspect then fled, going on the lam, taking Officer East's body  cam with him. The university went on lockdown, anxiously waiting for  the killer to be found. Sure enough, thanks to the quick actions of the  Texas Tech police force, the outlaw was located on campus and  apprehended again.   Officer East was an El Paso, Texas, native. He is survived by his  wife, Carmen, and two daughters, Anna and Monica. The funeral was a  solemn remembrance wrapped up with the release of over 1,000 black and  blue balloons, which flooded the west Texas blue sky, all in Officer  East's memory.   Peace officers from all over Texas, and even other States, showed up  for the funeral. As the body passed the Army National Guard Armory,  officers and military stood at attention and saluted Officer East's  body.   Officer Floyd East began his career with the Texas Tech Police  Department on December 1, 2014. He started as a security guard at Texas  Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso, Texas.   While working as a security guard, he went on to school at El Paso  Community College Law Enforcement Academy to obtain his basic peace  officer license to be a peace officer in the State of Texas.   Court documents show that the defendant, when he was arrested,  concealed a weapon in his pants; and when Officer East's back was  turned, the coward drew the weapon and murdered Officer East. The  weapon that he had was stolen.   The defendant is charged with capital murder, and a $5 million bond  is set. May Texas justice occur.   Mr. Speaker, our men and women in blue voluntarily do everything they  can to help protect and serve our communities, especially at our  colleges and universities. For these remarkable men and women, their  safety, like all peace officers, is never guaranteed. While the badge  and the uniform represent safety for citizens, for some reason, in our  society it becomes a target for other people, like this defendant.   Officer East worked with university students, helping protect young  Texans eager to learn on their university campus. He was senselessly  killed. There is never an answer for murder, except to hold the person  who did the murder accountable.   The defendant's friends quickly jumped to the defendant's defense  online, claiming Daniels was not a monster. Mr. Speaker, college  students do make mistakes. A mistake is like missing class and sleeping  in. Mistakes are not murdering people.   The defendant is totally responsible for his own actions. He can't  blame the drugs, he can't blame the fact that he was young, or he can't  blame the fact that he was not thinking right.   Mr. Speaker, I was a judge in Texas for 22 years and heard cases like  the murder of Officer East. People are responsible for what they do. In  our society, we cannot have this feeling that people are not  responsible and that something else calls them to do things. People are  totally responsible for the choices that they make.   I have heard all of the excuses. I have heard: ``Oh, I was too  young.'' ``Oh, I was too old.'' ``I was on drugs.'' ``I was affluent.''  ``I wasn't affluent.'' I have heard all of the excuses.   There is no excuse. People, like this defendant, are responsible for  their actions.   Officers like East are a cut above the rest of us, and they protect  us from harm's way and they protect us from evildoers. He is of a rare  breed, he is the Texas breed of law officers that sacrifice for the  rest of us.   Taps have been played for Officer East. He has been laid to rest. We  pray for his family, friends, and those officers in west Texas and  Texas Tech University.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for bringing forth this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I am a lawyer, like many of our members on the Judiciary  Committee. I served as a prosecutor and as a judge, and we have a lot  of those legal beagles on our Judiciary Committee.   Although I worked primarily in State court as a judge and a  prosecutor, I have always had great respect for those people in the  Justice Department who work on behalf of the people of the United  States in Federal court. However, over the last few years, my opinion  of the Justice Department has changed, and it has changed not for the  better.   It has changed because I see that the Justice Department is acting as  a political entity. I didn't say partisan entity. I said as a political  entity, making decisions that appear to be based on politics rather  than the law and policy.   This legislation does one thing: it tries to elevate the Justice  Department back to a nonpolitical entity, which it has, unfortunately,  in my opinion, become a political entity. It is unfortunate that it has  become that. Some of the things that the Justice Department has done,  and this legislation I think would prevent, would be to make sure that  the Justice Department does not become a political entity in  determining settlements of lawsuits that the Justice Department files  on behalf of the American public.   So what happens is that these lawsuits are settled, and then the  Justice Department tells the defendant: We the people are suing. You  contribute to this entity and this will all go away. This case will be  settled. There won't have to be a trial.   So that is what has been happening over the last few years.   In 2012, the Department of Justice forced Gibson Guitars to pay a  $50,000 ``community service payment'' to the National Fish and Wildlife  Foundation, even though the Foundation was not a victim of the crime  that Gibson Guitars was involved in. It had no connection to that case.   The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation received a bigger windfall  again in 2012, when the government required British Petroleum--we all  remember the BP spill--to donate $2.5 billion to the Foundation over a  5-year period in connection with the criminal investigation of the Gulf  of Mexico oil spill.   Discretion on the part of the Department of Justice on where the  money goes smells, Mr. Chairman. It doesn't pass the smell test.   In 2006, the Department of Justice forced a wastewater plant that had  been accused of violating the Clean Water Act to give $1 million to the  United States Coast Guard Alumni Association. Now, I love the Coast  Guard. We probably all love the Coast Guard. But government shouldn't  be making a decision to give taxpayer money, or money, to any  association. It is political decisions that the Justice Department has  been making.   The wastewater treatment firm was also forced to pay another $1  million to the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority in  Connecticut to fund unspecified environmental improvement projects.   A recent attack on the DOJ bank settlement with Goldman Sachs  required a $250 million fee to be assessed, financing donations toward  affordable housing. This is a political decision by the Justice  Department. And there are many other examples that we will put into the  Record. This should not be a Department of Justice decision on a  settlement. If they sue somebody and  [[Page H8112]]  they settle the case, the money should go to the victims of that  lawsuit. It should not go to the Department of Justice's discretion to  pick political entities.   Remember, I didn't say partisan. I just said political entities. Go  to the victim. Go to the Victims of Crime Act. Go to where crime  victims get funds. Go back to the U.S. Treasury, but the money should  not be discretionary with the Justice Department.    But let's take the politics, the decisionmaking,  and the credibility--or lack of credibility--of the Justice Department  in settling cases on behalf of the United States people, and take it  away from the Justice Department and put it where it is supposed to go:  to the victims of that lawsuit.   That is where it should go. And if it doesn't go there, then it  should go to the Victims of Crime Act, a Federal Government entity  where funds for criminal violations go into a fund. Or it should go to  the United States Treasury.   Remove the politics no matter who the President is. Remove the  politics of the Justice Department so they can regain credibility with  the American people for being involved in justice, not politics.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey ravaged the coast of  Texas, hammering it with 50 inches of rain, massive flooding, and  massive damage.   After the rain stopped, the decision to release water from Addicks  and Barker Reservoirs and Lake Conroe have left many questions in the  Houston area. The release of this water caused even more flooding  downstream.   Why did the Corps of Engineers open Barker and Addicks Reservoirs for  15 days? Why weren't the communities of Humble and Kingwood given  proper notice of the historic release of floodwater from Lake Conroe by  the San Jacinto River Authority? And there are more questions.   I have introduced the Texas Flood Accountability Act. This  legislation requires the Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate the cause  of the floods and what can be done for long-term plans to prevent  flooding in the future. They must produce this plan within 90 days  after enactment.   We must move from paying for disasters to preventing them. We need a  plan, Mr. Speaker.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
