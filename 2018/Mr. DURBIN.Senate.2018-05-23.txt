I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, on September 5, 2017, President Trump  announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program, known as DACA. As a result of that, hundreds of thousands of  immigrants who came to the United States as children and are known as  Dreamers have faced losing their work permits and face deportation to  countries they barely remember.   DACA provided temporary legal status to Dreamers only if they  registered with the government, paid a fee of almost $500, and passed a  thorough criminal background check. This DACA Program has been a  success. More than 800,000 Dreamers have come forward and received DACA  protection, which has allowed them to become a part of the only country  they have ever called home.   Many of these Dreamers were brought here as infants and toddlers,  raised in this country, pledging allegiance to that flag. They believed  they were part of America, and usually at some point when they became  teenagers, their parents gave them the terrible news that they were  undocumented.   When President Trump decided 8 months ago to repeal DACA, he set  March 5 as the deadline for the final expiration of the DACA Program.  However, two Federal courts have stepped in and issued orders blocking  the President's repeal of this DACA executive order. This means that  Dreamers who have DACA can continue to apply to renew their status for  now.   I urge every DACA recipient to file their renewal application  immediately. The Trump administration is doing everything in its power  to fight this court protection, and that court protection could be  lifted any day. This means there is a need for Congress to do  something.   Again, I urge the Republicans who control Congress to immediately  pass the Dream Act--bipartisan legislation I first introduced 17 years  ago that would finally give these Dreamers a path to becoming citizens  of the United States.   The reality is that tens of thousands of Dreamers are already at risk  of losing their work permits and being deported. The Department of  Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, has promised me that her  Department will not deport any DACA recipient with a pending DACA  application, even if their status expires. I am going to hold her to  that commitment because lives hang in the balance.   However, for DACA recipients whose status has expired, the Department  will not authorize them to work unless and until their DACA is renewed.  This means that tens of thousands of DACA-eligible individuals could be  forced to leave their jobs while their applications are pending and  before the renewals are approved.   Then consider the fate of Dreamers who are eligible for DACA but  never quite reached that status. They can no longer apply for  protection because of President Trump's decision to prohibit new DACA  applications after September 5, 2017. For example, a child turning 15-- the youngest age at which you can apply for DACA--is now blocked from  applying. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that in  addition to 800,000 DACA recipients, there are an additional 1 million  Dreamers who are eligible. Thanks to President Trump's harsh decision  to end DACA, 1.8 million Dreamers are at risk of deportation and cannot  work to support themselves or contribute to the country they love.  [[Page S2870]]    On September 5, Trump called on Congress to ``legalize DACA.'' But  since then, he has rejected six bipartisan proposals to achieve that.  He has even rejected a $25 billion bipartisan offer to build his border  wall. Mexico, of course, was supposed to pay for that wall.   We provided the money in a bill that also provided protection for the  Dreamers. The President rejected it. Instead, he has tried to put the  entire hard-line immigration agenda on the backs of the Dreamers.  President Trump has said that he will support legalization for Dreamers  only if Congress passes his plan, which would, among other things, cut  legal immigration to the United States by more than 40 percent.   There are people within this administration and some within the  Senate who really despise immigrants, and you can see it. They want to  cut legal immigration to the United States. That would be the largest  cut in immigration in almost 100 years.   Earlier this year, the Senate decided to vote on President Trump's  plan--the one he supports. It failed; it failed badly when 39 Senators  voted for it, and 60 voted against it. President Trump is holding  Dreamers hostage to an immigration plan that is so extreme that many of  his own party members do not support it.   Over the years, I have come to the floor of the Senate more than 100  times to tell the stories of Dreamers. I could give these speeches  endlessly. I don't think they have the impact of coming to know the  young people who are engaged and involved and at risk in this political  debate.   This is Dalia Larios, the 114th Dreamer I have introduced on the  floor of the Senate. She was brought to the United States from Mexico  when she was 10 years old. She grew up in Mesa, AZ. She remembers  celebrating the Fourth of July, going to school dances, and of course,  watching the Super Bowl.   Her parents were hard workers who usually had two or three jobs. They  taught her that although there were many things she could not control,  she could control how long she studied and how much time she devoted to  school. She did; Dalia graduated from high school in the top 1 percent  of her class. She was named the most outstanding life science student  in school. Not only did she excel academically, she completed over 150  hours of community service.   She is a remarkable young woman. She started an after-school dance  program for at-risk children and was the first place State champion in  both French and constitutional debate.   Dalia then attended Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State  University. She majored in biological sciences--specifically genetics,  cell, and developmental biology. She continued her community service  volunteering as an English and biology tutor at a number of health  clinics. Dalia graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA and received a number  of awards, including the School of Life Sciences award for plant-based  research on cervical and breast cancer vaccines.   Today, Dalia is a fourth year medical student at Harvard Medical  School. She is researching lung cancer and lung transplants at Brigham  and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.    In 2016 she won the Robert Ebert Prize for Healthcare Delivery  Research or Service for her work on designing a student-led health  coaching program to improve health outcomes in complex diabetic  patients, and what did she dream to be? A cardiothoracic surgeon.   Dalia wrote me a letter. She said:         For many, DACA may be a political bargain. For me, it is my       life. And [because of DACA,] for the first time ever, I have       been able to live a life that is not just rooted in dreams       but rather the realization of those dreams. It has been a       gateway to change, inclusion and meaningful integration into       the country I call home and desperately hope to serve.    At least 65 additional Dreamers were enrolled in medical school this  last school year, but without DACA these Dreamers could be deported  back to their countries, where they haven't lived since they were  little kids. Will America be a stronger country if we ask Dalia to  leave--this Harvard Medical School graduate, who wants to be a  cardiothoracic surgeon? If we tell her, ``We don't need you; go to some  another country,'' are we better off for that? Of course, not. We are  stronger to have people like Dalia in the United States.   The Association of American Medical Colleges states that the Nation's  doctor shortage is going to continue. Both the AMA and the Association  of American Medical Colleges have warned that ending DACA could make it  even harder to deal with the physician shortage in the United States.  They caution that President Trump's reversal in policy ``could have  severe consequences for many in the health care workforce, impacting  patients and our nation's health care system.''   I personally think it would be a tragedy to deport someone like  Dalia, who has so much to contribute to America.   President Trump created the DACA crisis. Instead of working toward a  solution, he has sabotaged every effort we have made to support and  save the Dreamers. Now it is up to the Republican majority in Congress  to accept one of the six bipartisan solutions on the table to save  these young people.   Congress should do its job and make the Dream Act the law of the  land, or we are going to be responsible for the fate of wonderful young  women like this. This amazing young woman could be saving lives in  America as a surgeon, or we can deport her back to Mexico. What sense  would that make?   Currently, the U.S. House of Representatives is debating when and if  to return to the immigration debate. It is fortunate that 20  Republicans have had the courage to step up so far, and I hope more  will join them to say: We have to do something. We can't just let this  happen without an effort to pass a bill to solve the problem.   The same thing could be said of the Senate. That is why I am hoping  that at the end of the day, we can put this kind of Dream Act and DACA  bill back into active consideration on the floor of the Senate.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as in legislation session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1615; that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am just going to respond briefly.   The bill that I asked to be called today for a vote was debated at  length over a period of 17 years with numerous committee meetings. This  is not an open-ended bill. There is a deadline. To qualify for it, one  must have been in  [[Page S2871]]  the United States already for over a year. So it would not be a magnet  for those who would like to come and take advantage of it in the  future. It wouldn't apply to them, but it does apply to 1.8 million who  would be eligible for citizenship.   I am sorry that there was an objection, but I will continue to work  with Members on both sides of the aisle to resolve this. We owe it to  Dalia and to many others like her who are waiting for Congress to act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senate today passed the VA MISSION  Act, a long overdue piece legislation of that would finally provide an  overhaul of the healthcare system at the Department of Veterans Affairs  that is desperately needed. The bill would  [[Page S2872]]  streamline and consolidate community care into a single comprehensive  program, standardizing eligibility for this program and repealing the  Choice program after 1 year.   The MISSION Act also includes a phasing in of an expanded Caregiver  program, so that veterans of all eras can access this important  benefit. This is an issue I have long worked on, having helped create  the original Caregivers program at the VA. This expansion will likely  help thousands of family caregivers.   In addition, the MISSION Act will help the VA better recruit quality  healthcare professionals with academic and financial incentives, as  well as help ensure access to care in rural and underserved areas.   I understand that there are some concerns about this legislation.   The asset and infrastructure review provision, which has been  compared to the BRAC review of DOD facilities, is contentious. I joined  Senator Manchin in efforts to pass a version of this without the AIR  provision. I am disappointed that effort was blocked by our Republican  colleagues, but I also appreciate the efforts of my Democratic  colleagues in helping ensure safeguards in the bill around the AIR  provision, so that any process includes coordination with and review by  Congress, veterans service organizations, the public, and other  stakeholders every step of the way.   I also recognize that there is a serious concern about privatization  at the VA, a concern that is especially acute under this administration  and given the fact that the VA lacks senior leadership.   Congress will need to ensure continued strong funding for the VA so  that we are not sacrificing investments in VA infrastructure, direct  patient care, medical research, and more in exchange for community  care--which will be costly--under the MISSION Act.   We will need to continue to provide oversight during the process of  selecting a VA Secretary, one who will balance the need of some  veterans to access authorized private care with protecting the VA  system. I look forward to meeting with the VA Secretary nominee to  assess his qualifications on this and other matters soon.   It is easy for us Members of Congress to speak about this bill on the  floor--to thank our veterans and their families for their service--but  it is more meaningful, more important to do what we can through action.   Some of my proudest moments in Congress have included efforts to  recognize, honor, and thank our veterans, but the very least we can do  for our veterans is to ensure they get the care they need.   I have been working with my colleague, Senator Duckworth, to help  ensure that veterans and their spouses at the Illinois Veterans Home at  Quincy receive high quality care, because, for the past 3 years, IVH  Quincy has been dealing with several Legionnaires' outbreaks, outbreaks  that have sickened more than 65 and, sadly, killed 13.   It is unacceptable that 13 veterans died from contracting the  Legionella bacteria before this Governor finally produced a  comprehensive plan of action.   I have worked with and will continue to work with State and Federal  officials to ensure that IVH Quincy has the technical and financial  support it needs.   Let me close with this: The VA MISSION Act reflects this sentiment as  well--too often, our servicemembers return home only to find themselves  facing challenge after challenge, suffering from the physical and  mental wounds of war. This bill will help ensure that we uphold the  promise we have made, to provide the care, support, and respect our  veterans have earned and deserve.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Isakson and Tester for their  good-faith efforts on this bill. I am pleased to join them and others  in the Senate in supporting this legislation.
