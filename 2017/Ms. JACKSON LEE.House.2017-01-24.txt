 Madam Speaker, I rise again in strong opposition to  the rule for H.R. 7, the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act,'' and the underlying bill.   I oppose this bill because it is unnecessary, puts the lives of women  at risk, interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, and diverts our attention from the real problems facing the  American people.   A more accurate short title for this bill would be the ``Violating  the Rights of Women Act of 2017''!   Instead of resuming their annual War on Women, our colleagues across  the aisle should be working with Democrats to build upon the ``Middle- Class Economics'' championed by the Obama Administration that have  succeeded in ending the economic meltdown it inherited in 2009 and  revived the economy to the point where today we have the highest rate  of growth and lowest rate of unemployment since the boom years of the  Clinton Administration.   We could and should instead be voting to raise the minimum wage to  $15.00 per hour so that people who work hard and play by the rules do  not have raise their families in poverty.   A far better use of our time would be to provide help to unemployed  job-hunters by making access to community college affordable to every  person looking to make a new start in life.  [[Page H631]]    Instead of voting to abridge the constitutional rights of women for  the umpteenth time, we should bring to the floor for a first vote  comprehensive immigration reform legislation or legislations repairing  the harm to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the Supreme Court's  decision in Shelby County v. Holder.   Madam Speaker, the one thing we should not be doing is debating  irresponsible ``messaging bills'' that abridge the rights of women and  have absolutely no chance of overriding a presidential veto.   The version of H.R. 7 before us now is as bad today as it was when  the House Republican leadership insisted on bringing it to a vote a  year ago. The other draconian provisions of that terrible bill are  retained in H.R. 7, which would:   1. Prohibit federal funds from being used for any health benefits  coverage that includes coverage of abortion. (Thus making permanent  existing federal policies.)   2. Prohibit the inclusion of abortion in any health care service  furnished by a federal or District of Columbia health care facility or  by any physician or other individual employed by the federal government  or the District.   3. Apply such prohibitions to District of Columbia funds.   4. Prohibit individuals from receiving a refundable federal tax  credit, or any cost-sharing reductions, for purchasing a qualified  health plan that includes coverage for abortions.   5. Prohibit small employers from receiving the small-employer health  insurance credit provided by the health care law if the health plans or  benefits that are purchased provide abortion coverage.   If H.R. 7 were enacted, millions of families and small businesses  with private health insurance plans that offer abortion coverage would  be faced with tax increases, making the cost of health care insurance  even more expensive.   Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are able to offer abortion  coverage and receive federal offsets for premiums as long as enrollees  pay for the abortion coverage from separate, private funds.   If enacted, H.R. 7 would deny federal subsidies or credits to private  health insurance plans that offer abortion coverage even if that  coverage is paid for from private funds.   This would inevitably lead to private health insurance companies  dropping abortion coverage leaving millions of women without access to  affordable, comprehensive health care.   Currently, 87% of private insurance health care plans offered through  employers cover abortion.   If H.R. 7 were to become law, consumer Options for private health  insurance plans would be unnecessarily restricted and the tax burden on  these policy holders would increase significantly.   H.R. 7 would also deny tax credits to small businesses that offer  their employees insurance plans that cover abortion, which would have a  significant impact on millions of families across the nation who would  no longer be able to take advantage of existing tax credits and  deductions for the cost of their health care.   For example, small businesses that offer health plans that cover  abortions would no longer be eligible for the Small Business Health Tax  Credit--potentially worth 35%-50% of the cost of their premiums-- threatening 4 million small businesses.   Self-employed Americans who are able to deduct the cost of their  comprehensive health insurance from their taxable income will also be  denied similar tax credits and face higher taxes.   H.R. 7 would also undermine the District of Columbia's home rule by  restricting its use of funds for abortion care to low-income women.   The Hyde Amendment stipulates that no taxpayer dollars are to be used  for abortion care, and has narrow exceptions for rape, incest, and  health complications that arise from pregnancy which put the mother's  life in danger.   H.R. 7 would restrict women's access to reproductive health care even  further by narrowing the already stringent requirements set forth in  the Hyde Amendment.   When the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, the President  issued an Executive Order to ``ensure that Federal funds are not used  for abortion services.''   This version of H.R. 7 goes far beyond the safeguards established  under the Affordable Care Act, and sets a dangerous precedent for the  future of women's reproductive health in this country because it  includes two new provisions that were added at the nth hour but have  never received a hearing or a mark-up.   These new provisions would (1) ban abortion coverage in multi-state  health plans available under the ACA; and (2) mandate that health plans  mislead consumers about abortion coverage by requiring all plans in the  health-insurance exchanges that include abortion coverage to display  that fact prominently in all advertising, marketing materials, or  information from the insurer but interestingly, does not require the  same disclosure from plans that do not cover abortion.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 7 would also force health plans to mislead  consumers about the law's treatment of abortion.   As a concession to anti-choice lawmakers, the ACA requires insurance  plans participating in the new health system to segregate monies used  for abortion services from all other funds.   In order to aid in identifying these funds and simplify the process  of segregating general premium dollars from those used to cover  abortion services, the ACA requires that health plans estimate the cost  of abortion coverage at no less than $1 per enrollee per month.   H.R. 7 would require plans covering abortion to misrepresent this  practice as an ``abortion surcharge,'' which is to be disclosed and  identified as a portion of the consumer's premium.   By describing abortion coverage in this way, H.R.7 makes it look as 7  though it is an added, extra cost, available only at an additional fee,  when in fact it is not.   Taken together, the provisions in H.R. 7 have the effect, and  possibly the intent, of arbitrarily infringing women's reproductive  freedoms and pose a nationwide threat to the health and wellbeing of  American women and a direct challenge to the Supreme Court's ruling in  Roe V. Wade.   Madam Speaker, one of the most detestable aspects of this bill is  that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of  circumstances.   Women like Danielle Deaver, who was 22 weeks pregnant when her water  broke. Tests showed that Danielle had suffered anhydramnios, a  premature rupture of the membranes before the fetus has achieved  viability.   This condition meant that the fetus likely would be born with a  shortening of muscle tissue that results in the inability to move  limbs. In addition, Danielle's fetus likely would suffer deformities to  the face and head, and the lungs were unlikely to develop beyond the  22-week point.   There was less than a 10% chance that, if born, Danielle's baby would  be able to breathe on its own and only a 2% chance the baby would be  able to eat on its own.   H.R. 7 hurts women like Vikki Stella, a diabetic, who discovered  months into her pregnancy that the fetus she was carrying suffered from  several major anomalies and had no chance of survival. Because of  Vikki's diabetes, her doctor determined that induced labor and  Caesarian section were both riskier procedures for Vikki than an  abortion.   Every pregnancy is different. No politician knows, or has the right  to assume he knows, what is best for a woman and her family.   These are decisions that properly must be left to women to make, in  consultation with their partners, doctors, and their God.   H.R. 7 lacks the necessary exceptions to protect the health and life  of the mother.   H.R. 7 is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to privacy,  as interpreted by the Supreme Court in a long line of cases going back  to Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965 and Roe v. Wade decided in 1973.   In Roe v. Wade, the Court held that a state could not prohibit a  woman from exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy in order to  protect her health prior to viability.   While many factors go into determining fetal viability, the consensus  of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not  occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation.   Supreme Court precedents make it clear that neither Congress nor a  state legislature can declare any one element--``be it weeks of  gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor--as the  determinant'' of viability. Coloyal v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379,388-89  (1979).   The constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses the right  of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability, and even  later where continuing to term poses a threat to her health and safety.   This right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate.   The bill before us threatens this hard won right for women and must  be defeated.   I urge all members to join me in opposing the rule and the underlying  bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 55 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on  [[Page H632]]       Ways and Means and Oversight and Government Reform. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition ``        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Madam Speaker, these are the faces of innocent and  wonderful women like Dakota and Chenoa, who indicate that, if they did  not have Planned Parenthood, they would not be able to be where they  are today, or Chenoa, who indicated, without Planned Parenthood and the  Affordable Care Act, they wouldn't have access to health care.   That is what H.R. 7 intends to do, to deny these young, beautiful  women an opportunity. But more importantly, my colleagues on the other  side want to suggest they only--they only--have religion and faith. But  as a mother, let me say that every child I have loved and every woman  who has had a decision to make I have loved and respected for her  choice of a faith, her God, and her doctor.   Rather than having this war on women by Republicans, we need to be  dealing with the voting rights law. Rather than prohibiting individuals  from receiving a refundable tax credit on cost-sharing reductions for  purchasing a qualified health plan that encourages coverage for  abortions or denying the District of Columbia their rights, we should  be standing for rights. This is a constitutional right. It is also a  choice by a woman of her God, her doctor, and her family.   Vote against H.R. 7. It is violence against women. It is not helping  women or the unborn child.   Madam Speaker, I rise again in strong opposition to H.R. 7, the so- called ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.''   I oppose this bill because it is unnecessary, puts the lives of women  at risk, interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, and diverts our attention from the real problems facing the  American people.   A more accurate short title for this bill would be the ``Violating  the Rights of Women Act of 2017.''   Instead of resuming their annual War on Women, our colleagues across  the aisle should be working with Democrats to build upon the ``Middle- Class Economics'' championed by the Obama Administration that have  succeeded in ending the economic meltdown it inherited in 2009 and  revived the economy to the point where today we have the highest rate  of growth and lowest rate of unemployment since the boom years of the  Clinton Administration.   We could and should instead be voting to raise the minimum wage to  $15.00 per hour so that people who work hard and play by the rules do  not have to raise their families in poverty.   A far better use of our time would be to provide help to unemployed  job-hunters by making access to community college affordable to every  person looking to make a new start in life.

Holder.   Madam Speaker, the one thing we should not be doing is debating  irresponsible ``messaging bills'' that abridge the rights of women and  have absolutely no chance of overriding a presidential veto.

The constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses the right  of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability, and even  later where continuing to term poses a threat to her health and safety.   This right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate.   The bill before us threatens this hard won right for women and must  be defeated.
