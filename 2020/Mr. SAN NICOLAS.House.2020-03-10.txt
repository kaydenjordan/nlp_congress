 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a group that  oftentimes doesn't get recognized. I rise to recognize this Congress of  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Speaker Pelosi, Leader Hoyer,  Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Grijalva, Minority Leader  McCarthy, Committee on Natural Resources Ranking Member,   Rob Bishop.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Senate Majority Leader McConnell,  and Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Graham, Senate Minority Leader  Schumer, and Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Feinstein.   I rise to recognize the staff of this House: Trent Bauserman,  Shuwanza Goff, and Ray Salazar of Leader Hoyer's office; David Watkins  and Sarah Lim, leading Chairman Grijalva's staff on the Committee on  Natural Resources; Elliot Waldman of the Senate Judiciary; Sara Zdeb of  Senate Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Feinstein's office.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise to recognize staff of the administration:  Rob Howarth of the Department of the Interior; Michael DiRoma of the  U.S. Treasury; and Doug Hoelscher of the White House.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize these individuals because without  them, we would not have been able to move forward as expeditiously as  we have over the past 13 months with H.R. 1365, which was addressed by  this House yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1365 brings closure to a long saga of suffering  from the people of Guam at the hands of Imperial Japan during World War  II, that finally sees closure with the recognition and compensation--as  much as we can try and call it that--for the sufferings of the Chamorro  people during the war.   Oftentimes, Mr. Speaker, it gets very, very difficult for us,  especially as territories, to be able to find closure on longstanding  issues because of the fact that territories are underrepresented in  this body by the very nature of their existence in this country. And  yet, despite that, we are able to finally bring this issue to closure  by the individuals I mentioned.   Mr. Speaker, I put their names in the Record today, because I want  the Chamorro people to be able to look back and identify generations  from now the individuals who made such justice possible in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I further rise to address another injustice, one that  has been longstanding in territories, and one that also addresses a  community that, really, in this country should never be ignored.   Mr. Speaker, supplemental security income is something that is  afforded to U.S. citizens throughout this country, but once you move to  a U.S. territory, you immediately become ineligible for supplemental  security income.   Mr. Speaker, as we are aware, that is something that is provided to  the most vulnerable in our community--those with disabilities, those  who are at certain ages that require that kind of support. Mr. Speaker,  for us to be neglecting our very own citizens in our territories just  because of where they live, I think is something that this body very  much needs to address.   Unfortunately, we run into fiscal constraints and the price tag of  having to move forward something of such magnitude. And while we really  shouldn't put dollars and cents to the quality of life of those most  vulnerable in this country, we still face those fiscal realities as  territories, and the fiscal realities that this Congress must grapple  with if they were to extend supplemental security income to the  territories.   Mr. Speaker, we introduced H.R. 208 in the 116th Congress. That was  intended to address the fiscal constraints in a manner that all  territories are willing to come to the table and work together on. And  rather than having all territories at once try and pursue supplemental  security income for their residents, we have decided to try and  snowball this and handle it one territory at a time. And Guam has taken  the lead with H.R. 208, allowing for supplemental security income in  Guam that we may, for just 170,000 people, extend a critical quality of  life service that this country has made available everywhere else in  the United States.   After we are able to secure this for Guam, perhaps we can move this  to another small territory, and to another small territory, and  incrementally address this in our budget, that really on the greater  picture of the cost of supplemental security income, would be a  fractional rounding error for justice for those who so desperately need  it in areas that are so highly affected.   Mr. Speaker, Guam, as you are aware, is thousands of miles away in  the middle of the Pacific Ocean. We are closer to every Asian city than  we are to Hawaii. It is very, very difficult for  [[Page H1563]]  people with disabilities to be able to avail themselves of service  providers because they can't just drive to the next county or drive to  the next State. And the thought of flying to Hawaii to be able to get  those services is so exorbitant that it is actually cheaper to go from  Japan to Dulles International Airport than it is to go from Guam to  Hawaii.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to take the next step and pursue  further justice for our territories.   I wanted to recognize those individuals who made it possible for us  to finally close a chapter on war claims. May we now move on to the  chapter of addressing those people who have disabilities in our country  that we really should be taking care of that just so happen to be  living in the U.S. territories.                            ____________________
