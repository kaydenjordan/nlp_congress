 Mr. President, most of you know that I have a real job  besides being a U.S. Senator, and that real job includes farming the  land, which includes spending--starting in the spring--12 to 16 hours a  day on a tractor, where you get an opportunity, after you are going  around and around and around, to think about anything you want to think  about.   Before I got in this job, I used to do math problems. Since I have  gotten in this job, I think about this job when I am on a tractor, and  I think about the U.S. Senate. I think about how over the last 15 years  this place has been incredibly dysfunctional. I have been here 15  years; I can't speak to what it was like before that. But it has never  worked since I have been here. The reason it has never worked is  because--I had this idea in my head that, being the U.S. Senate, it  would be a place where we could have debate. In the greatest  deliberative body, you ought to be able to have debate. I think I saw  Senator Durbin once almost get into a debate here, maybe twice. But it  just simply doesn't happen, and it doesn't happen because we are not  forced to do it because you take the easy way out. All you have to do  is put a hold on a bill, and then you can walk out. In fact--I think it  was my second year here--there was a Senator who put a hold on a bill  and then went back to his home State. He didn't even stick around.   I don't think that is what the forefathers had in mind. I think what  the forefathers had in mind is to stay here and have a discussion and  have a debate, and when people disagree, don't be disagreeable, but try  to find common ground. That doesn't happen but rarely.   So you ask yourself what can be done about it. I have had the  opportunity over the last 3 months to work pretty extensively with my  friend Senator King and Senator Kaine and Senator Manchin and talk  about ways we can move forward in a way that encourages people to come  to the floor and debate, and I think there is a proposal to do exactly  that. This is a carve-out today, but the truth is that there is a  proposal to protect minority rights and encourage people to come here  and debate.   We ought to be doing that. It isn't nuking the body. It is not  destroying the U.S. Senate. It means we get a chance to stand here in  front of these cameras and challenge one another because we have to,  because the rules force us to do that--not to go home to our home  State, not to put a hold on a bill or a person and then not say a word  why, not to be able to justify why you are doing that on the floor.   So I see this in a little different light than has been described by  some across the aisle, and I don't think this is blowing the Senate up  at all. I think the Senate--if the forefathers looked at the Senate  today, they would sit there and shake their heads and say: What has  gone wrong?   I think what has gone wrong is, we have gotten lazy. It is the truth.  The last place, truthfully, I want to be is on the floor of the U.S.  Senate trying to justify my position. I mean, that is a lot of work. It  takes time. It takes effort. We ought to be forcing people to do that.  That is part of this debate we are having here today.   We ought to realize that there is not a single Member of this body on  either side of the aisle who wants to ``blow this place up.'' They  might describe it that way. But the truth is, everybody who serves in  this body knows that this body doesn't function as the U.S. Senate. It  doesn't function. We don't do what we need to do. We don't empower  committees. We don't make sure our chairmen are doing what they need to  do. We don't debate on the U.S. Senate floor anymore, and we haven't  for 15  [[Page S289]]  years and probably a heck of a lot longer.   I happen to sit in the seat of Mike Mansfield. I don't think  Mansfield would look at this and say: This body works, and we ought not  change the rules because it works so well.   I think Mike Mansfield would say: Do you know what, guys? We did some  changes in 1976. You need to take a look back. Things have changed  here.    We have cameras now we didn't have in 1976. We have folks who come on  the floor and raise a lot of money on this floor by talking to those  cameras instead of talking to one another about what is important here,  about the policies we need to take up.   So that is first thing. I don't think we should be afraid about  adjusting the filibuster to make the U.S. Senate work. I think it is  the right thing to do--not blowing it up but making some adjustments to  make it work.   Now, let's talk about voting rights for just a moment. I believe  there are 19 States in the United States right now that, on a purely  partisan basis, have changed the way votes--either access to the polls  or the way votes are counted when they are done. I can't imagine  anybody in here, when you look at that--and it has all been done on a  partisan basis by Republican legislatures--when you would look at that,  you would say: Boy, this is moving our democracy forward.   You know what. When I got in the State senate in 1999, I worked with  a very conservative Republican on the State Administration Committee to  make voting easier. We worked together. We both had the same ideas in  mind. We wanted to make voting easier in Montana, and we did it.   Now, it is a different world out there, and I really don't know why.  Let me give you an example. When I ran in 2018, there were a record  number of votes cast in Montana, and I won. A Democrat won. In 2020,  there was even a larger number of votes that were cast in 2020, and a  Republican won. This isn't about advantages for Democrats or advantages  for Republicans; this is about making it so everybody can have their  voice heard--something very basic to this country, by the way. We stand  up here and talk on the floor about how people have sacrificed for the  rights and the freedoms in this country, and one of those freedoms is  the freedom to vote. Lives have been sacrificed for it, but yet we want  to limit certain groups of people from voting.   In Montana, for example, they have said that student IDs--a college  student ID won't work as an ID to go to the polling place. Are you  kidding me? I mean, first of all, what kind of message are you sending  to the young people who are going to be running this show--and probably  a heck of a lot better than we are--in just a few years? You are  saying: Your voice doesn't count. You want to talk about  disenfranchising? This is crazy. It doesn't make any sense. It is  really hard for me to think how you justify--how do you justify saying  this is a good thing to have happen?   Voter registration. OK. Now, we are in this job. We all do this every  day, think about it every day. So voter registration is probably no big  deal to us. But to working people who have to pay the bills, having to  take a half a day off of work to be able to go register when you can't  do it on election day--that is a big deal.   We all stand up here, and we always say: We are for working families;  they are the heartbeat of this country. And they are. But the truth is,  what message are we sending to them when we say: No, you know what, no  more same-day voter registration--which, by the way, in Montana, it was  a vote of the people, and the legislature, a year ago right now,  repealed a vote of the people on same-day registration. So what message  are we sending to those folks?   My good friend Raphael Warnock, Senator Warnock, talks about standing  in line for 8 or 10 hours to vote. First of all, I don't know that I  have the will to stand in line, personally, for 8 or 10 hours to vote.  I complained when they moved the polling place 3 miles from my house to  15 miles from my house. But to stand in line for 8 to 10 hours--I mean,  that is a commitment to vote. Now we are going to make it tougher? We  are going to make it so that when there are Good Samaritans out there  handing out water and maybe some soda crackers, we are going to say  ``No, that is illegal'' and punish them--breaking the law; punishment  by--God knows what. A fine? Jail? I don't know.   What is it?    It is a felony.   This is crazy, guys. We shouldn't be acting like the stuff that is  going on in this country right now and has been going on mainly for the  last year--and my fellow Senators have talked about why it is the  case--we shouldn't act like it is no big deal. It is a huge deal. If we  disenfranchise voters in this country, our democracy is on a slide away  from democracy.   As my friend Angus King has said many times on this floor,  democracies are the exception, they are not the rule in history. They  have happened rarely, and they happen because people understand the  sacrifices it takes.   We have sacrifices we need to make in this body, and part of it is,  we need to ensure that everybody has equal access to the polls so that  they can vote. It is fundamental to our democracy. That is why we are  all sitting here. If it wasn't fundamental to our democracy, do you  know what? I would be doing something else. I would be in my office  working on papers or something like that--who knows. But the truth is,  this is fundamental to our democracy.   We can try to, you know, move the conversation and say: Why aren't we  talking about the economy? Senator Kaine said it very, very well. We  have dealt with economic issues. We need to continue to deal with  economic issues. We have dealt with supply chain issues with the  bipartisan infrastructure bill. We need to continue to work with supply  chain issues as we move forward, and we will. But I will tell you, if  we disenfranchise enough folks from the polls, we won't have a  democracy to talk about anything because it is fundamental to our  democracy.   I would just encourage everybody to take a look at the bill that is  presented today, the two bills. Look at it. Don't talk about the one  that was presented in 2018 or 2019. We can all do that. That distracts  from what is really going on. Look at the bill and ask yourself, ``Is  this really a Federal takeover of elections?'' It absolutely is not. It  is about making it so people can go to the polls and make their voices  heard and feel like they are making a difference in the country by  voting for the candidates whom they want or, in some cases, voting  against the candidates they don't like.   And as far as the filibuster goes, times change, things change. And  one of the things that has changed in this body is we don't debate  anymore. I am for anything that will get people to the floor so we can  debate the issues that are so important to the future of this country.   I yield the floor.    I wasn't going to speak, but I have to speak because I  wanted to clear up the record on one thing.   The people in the State of Montana voted for same-day registration.  The people of the State of Montana went to the ballot box and voted for  same-day registration. The State legislature repealed that. We should  ask what the people of Montana really want. They want same-day  registration.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.
