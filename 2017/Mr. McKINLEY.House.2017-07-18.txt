 Mr. Chairman, today the House will vote on a bill  addressing the ozone standards issued by the Obama administration.   Look, with the comments you have heard today, we all want clean air.  But America has made great strides already. Ozone is down by one-third  since 1980.   But the regulations imposed by President Obama in 2015 would cost the  economy billions of dollars each year and hamper job growth. In many  parts of the country, it is literally impossible to meet the new  standards due to the background levels of ozone.   Much of the country, as you just heard the chairman talk about, was  still trying to comply with the previous standard when, suddenly, a new  level was imposed. This has resulted in confusion and duplication.    The bill that is before us this afternoon provides a commonsense  approach. It delays the implementation, but, more importantly, it gives  the States flexibility to deal with this issue. It revises the  timeframe for changing standards from 5 years to 10 years. That is all.  It requires the EPA to consider--very important--the economic and  technical feasibility of the new standards.   So, Mr. Chairman, passing this bill today will remove a barrier to  economic growth while, at the same time, still protecting our  environment.
