 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an  invaluable member of my staff on her well-deserved retirement.  Jacquelyn Smith, ``Jackie'' to those of us who love her, retires this  week, Mr. Speaker, after two decades of service to the Fourth  Congressional District and more than a half century of work in  government, education, and politics.   Her contributions to the State of Florida and to her colleagues are  immeasurable, and our Nation is truly better off thanks to her efforts.   Jackie began her life of service as a teacher, moving often because  of her husband's assignment as a United States Air Force pilot.   She eventually found herself in politics, working on a Presidential  campaign before eventually becoming district director to my  predecessor, former Congressman Ander Crenshaw. When I took office in  2017, I was fortunate that Jackie stayed on as the director of special  operations in my Jacksonville office.   Mr. Speaker, for over 20 years, Jackie has served northeast Florida.  She has helped countless families with casework, served as my  representative throughout the district, and made a significant impact  on thousands of young people and students in our community.   Jackie has truly helped shape the next generation of Americans,  especially those who will be going into military leadership. Each year,  Jackie runs the military academy nomination program. She works  tirelessly with students who apply, coaching them through the process  and vouching for their selection.   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you no one knows nor works that system harder  and better than Jackie Smith. And she does it simply for the benefit of  her students. Thanks to her efforts, District Four historically has one  of the highest selection rates in the country.   Jackie also runs our congressional arts program and the congressional  medal program, both recognizing the many talented students in our  community of northeast Florida.   Jackie often serves as my liaison to community groups, many of which  she is already a part of, including the Rotary Club, the USO, and the  local Chamber of Commerce. It often seems she knows everyone in  northeast Florida, and unsurprisingly, they all consider her a friend.  She loves them, and they love her.   Every day, Jackie comes to work with a servant's heart, a sharp wit,  and a contagious optimistic attitude. No job is too big; no job is too  small. Most importantly, she embodies the virtues of integrity, hard  work, and selflessness that Americans expect from their government.   Jackie leaves big shoes to fill in my office. However, as she is  known to do, she leaves it better than when she found it.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida,  congratulations, Jackie. May your retirement be filled with warm, sandy  beaches and continued memories with your husband, David, and your many  friends and loved ones. We are so proud of your many achievements, and  we thank you, Jackie, for your service to this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you, I look forward to hearing all about  her next career as a used shoe salesman for Ocean Sole Africa, as they  improve the lives of citizens of Kenya and boost the economy here at  home.                            ____________________
