 Mr. Speaker, I am outraged, but not surprised, that the  political appointees in the EPA's Washington, D.C., office have decided  that the Redwood City salt ponds in my district do not include waters  of the United States under the Clean Water Act.   This administration has completely hijacked the jurisdictional  process away from the experts on the ground, putting politics ahead of  science. No surprise.   Stunningly, after experts at the EPA's Region 9 had drafted a  determination in 2016 that came to a completely opposite conclusion,  the EPA trampled on that evidence-based determination.   The administration was, no doubt, counting on the fact that the draft  would not be released to the public. Well, I am not willing to allow  that to happen.   Let the Record reflect that, after being designated an EPA special  case, Region 9 experts conducted an extensive review of the property  and finally concluded that 1,270 acres within the Redwood City salt  ponds property are, in fact, waters of the United States for the  following reasons.   First, the tidal channels within the property were part of the  traditionally navigable waters of the San Francisco Bay and were not  converted to ``fast land'' or ``dry solid upland'' prior to the  enactment of the Clean Water Act. This is because waters that have been  severed from tidal influence but are regularly inundated are not fast  lands.   Secondly, the salt ponds in their current condition have been shown  to be navigable in the past and could be used in interstate or foreign  commerce with reasonable improvements, such as removing levees. In  fact, large portions of former salt ponds in proximity to the site have  been restored to tidal marshes.   Third, the salt ponds are impoundments of water otherwise defined as  waters of the United States.   Finally, the salt ponds have significant nexus to the traditionally  navigable waters of the adjacent San Francisco Bay, providing food and  habitat to certain species of microorganisms, invertebrates, and birds.   The most recent EPA determination directly contradicts the findings  of Region 9 experts, but it is completely in line with this  administration's record of gutting environmental protections in the  name of corporate interests.   I realize that this administration struggles to recognize any body of  water that is not a murky, scum-filled swamp, but I refuse to let this  180-degree political flip-flop occur without public disclosure. Believe  me, the decision by Administrator Wheeler is a flop. That is why I am  submitting this draft determination in its entirety for the public  record.                      Draft Redwood City Salt Ponds JD                              Executive Summary         This document constitutes the U.S. Environmental Protection       Agency's (EPA) determination of the federal jurisdictional       status of the Redwood City Salt Ponds for purposes of the       Clean Water Act (CWA). This CWA jurisdictional determination       applies to the Redwood City Salt Ponds property (``Redwood       City Salt Ponds'' or ``the Property'') depicted in Figure 1.       The Property is approximately 1,365 contiguous acres adjacent       to Westpoint Slough, a part of San Francisco Bay, located       near Seaport Boulevard, Redwood City, San Mateo County,       California. Within the boundaries of the subject area,       approximately 95 acres of the Property are not ``waters of       the United States'' where they are above the High Tide Line       on the outer side of the perimeter levees bounding the       Property, and above the Ordinary High Water Mark on the levee       interiors. These non-jurisdictional areas consist of levees,       building pads and other features converted to fast land       before passage of the CWA.        The remaining estimated 1,270 acres within the subject area       are ``waters of the United States'' as defined by the CWA,       because: (1) the tidal channels within the Redwood City Salt       Ponds were part of the traditionally navigable waters of San       Francisco Bay, and were not converted to fast land prior to       enactment of the CWA; (2) the salt ponds in their current       condition have been shown to be navigable in fact, and are       susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce with       reasonable improvements; (3) the salt ponds are impoundments       of waters otherwise defined as waters of the United States;       and (4) the salt ponds have a significant nexus to the       traditionally navigable waters of the adjacent San Francisco       Bay.
