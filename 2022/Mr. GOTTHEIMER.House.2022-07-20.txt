 Mr. Speaker, I thank the House Appropriations  Committee for their hard work on this important piece of legislation.   I rise today in support of the passage of H.R. 8294, which contained  a crucial amendment I introduced to help find and prosecute cases of  fraud within COVID-19 economic relief.   My amendment provides critical investment for the Small Business  Administration Office of the Inspector General to ensure that they  continue to hold Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Paycheck Protection  Program fraudsters accountable.   It is deeply disturbing to hear about the recent flurry of fraud  convictions related to these two relief programs that provided vital  resources to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are  dollars that were meant for small businesses struggling due to the  pandemic, and to help their families, not to help greedy cheats looking  to profit off the backs of their neighbors.   My amendment supports efforts for the SBA to identify and prosecute  cases of EIDL and PPP fraud more aggressively. Applicants from  businesses in my district may have been denied critical financial  resources because of the actions of these crooks, and we owe it to all  of our constituents to hold these bad actors accountable.   I strongly urge all my colleagues in the Senate to pass this  critically important provision.  [[Page H6903]]                                ____________________
