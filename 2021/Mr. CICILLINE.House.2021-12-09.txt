 Madam Speaker, the blatant and corrupt actions that we  saw during the Trump administration demand that Congress take action to  prevent any future President or administration officials from  committing these same abuses of power.   Our laws have to be equipped to protect the Office of the Presidency  and hold anyone privileged enough to hold that office accountable for  their actions.   The Protecting Our Democracy Act will prevent Presidential abuse,  restore our system of checks and balances, strengthen accountability,  and protect our elections.   I am proud that this package includes one of my pieces of  legislation, the White House Open Data Act, which will make White House  visitor logs and salary information easily accessible and available to  the public. The Presidency demands integrity and transparency. The  Protecting Our Democracy Act gives us the tools to defend and protect  our democracy; our most sacred responsibility.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Schiff for his leadership, and I  thank Chairwoman Maloney. Let's all stand up today, vote for democracy,  protect the right to vote so that the world, when they watch this,  knows that America remains committed and renews today its commitment to  a great democracy.
