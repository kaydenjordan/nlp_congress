 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I need to begin today with some  tragic news. This weekend, as Americans joined together to salute our  heroes, five soldiers deployed out of Fort Campbell, KY, were killed  while operating in dangerous conditions in the Mediterranean Sea: CW3  Stephen Dwyer, CW2 Shane Barnes, SSG Tanner Grone, SGT Andrew Southard,  and SGT Cade Wolfe.   These fallen warriors were members of Fort Campbell's 160th Special  Operations Aviation Regiment, known by their brothers- and sisters-in- arms as Night Stalkers.  [[Page S5467]]    The Night Stalkers are elite, highly trained fighters who take on the  most sensitive missions. They are ready to respond at any time there  are serious threats anywhere in the world, and they ground their  service in two principles: never quit and never surrender.   Night Stalkers live, breathe, and--tragically--often die by a creed  which reads:         I serve with the memory and the pride of those who have       gone before me, for they loved to fight, fought to win, and       would rather die than quit.    This weekend, five brave men honored their creed. Their memory will  live on, carried by Night Stalkers who continue to profess it and by  every American who mourns their loss. This tragedy is a stark reminder  of the incredible dangers our men and women in uniform face and of the  debt we owe them.   So, today, I join our Nation in grieving these fallen warriors, and I  extend my prayers to their families, children, and comrades.
