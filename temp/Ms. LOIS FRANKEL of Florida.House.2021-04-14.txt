 Madam Speaker, just to follow Chairman  McGovern, I thank him for his very kind words on my friend and  neighbor, Alcee Hastings, who was a brilliant and forceful advocate for  justice and the great senior leader of the Florida delegation. We miss  him dearly.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Urban League in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act.                                          National Urban League,                                                     April 14, 2021.      Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on           harmful amendments.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Urban       League, with 90 local affiliates in 36 states and the       District of Columbia, I strongly urge you to pass the       Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without amendments that limit       its scope or undermine its critical protections.        The National Urban League is a civil rights organization       dedicated to the economic empowerment of African Americans       and other underserved populations. The National Urban League       and our affiliate movement have a strong interest in ensuring       equity in the workplace, including payment.        Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps       persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the       financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily       on women of color and the families who depend on their       income. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed       three previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly       recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much-needed update       to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle       pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination.        Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in       their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any       longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically       paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to       a loss of more than $400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap       varies by race and is often larger for women of color: Black       women working full time, year-round typically make only 63       cents, Native American women only 60 cents, and Latinas only       55 cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic       male counterparts. Over the course of a 40-year career, Black       women lose nearly $1 million in earnings and Latinas lose       more than $1 million. While Asian American and Pacific       Islander (AAPI) women make 85 cents for every dollar paid to       white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities experience       drastically wider pay gaps. Moms are paid less than dads. And       even when controlling for factors like education and       experience, pay gaps persist and start early in women's       careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them       throughout their lifetimes. Persistent pay discrimination,       often cloaked by employer-imposed pay secrecy policies, is       one factor driving these wage gaps.        These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the       legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and       employers are provided with effective incentives and       technical assistance to comply with the law.        The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal       Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection       against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions,       this comprehensive bill:        ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against       workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and       requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC;        prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not       follow women from job to job;        closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women       less than men for the same work without any important       business justification related to the job;        ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-      based pay discrimination that are currently available to       those subjected to discrimination based on race and       ethnicity; and provides much needed training and technical       assistance, as well as data collection and research.        The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how       the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black       and brown women, has long been and continues to be       undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is       newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. We       cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without       ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and       dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the Paycheck       Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step toward       ensuring this becomes reality.        We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without       harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections. If       you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Joi       Chaney at the National Urban League.            Thank you for your consideration,                                                    Marc H. Morial,                                                   President & CEO.     Madam Speaker, I rise to support the  passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.   I have some important questions and simple answers.   First, do rent and food cost less for women than men?   The answer is no.   Do women work less hard than men?   Absolutely not.   Do children depend on the financial support of their mothers?   That answer is yes.   So should women make less money than men for doing equal work?   Obviously not.   Yet, for many reasons, women are paid an average of just 82 cents for  every dollar paid to men--it is even lower for women of color--causing  struggling families and eventually lower Social Security benefits and  retirement savings for our grandmothers.   No wonder it is women and their children who are the majority of poor  in this country.   As we emerge from a pandemic that has hit women workers the hardest,  isn't it time for an economy that compensates women fairly for their  work?   Of course it is.   This requires numerous actions, including making sure that women and  girls have full access to healthcare, education, and financial  resources; family-friendly workplaces; combating on-the-job sexual  harassment and violence; making child and adult care more affordable;  and raising the pay for minimum wage workers, two-thirds of whom are  women.   Today, we can take a giant step toward this moral and legal  imperative of closing the gender wage gap by passing the Paycheck  Fairness Act and giving workers the tools to enforce the Equal Pay Act  of 1963, that requires pay equity.   Isn't it time, Madam Speaker, that our mothers, daughters, and  sisters get paid fairly for their hard day's work?   Of course.   That is my final question and final answer for today.
