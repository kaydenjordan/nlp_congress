 Mr. President, my staff recently had the pleasure  of visiting with Jen Kimmich of The Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, VT.   The Alchemist owners Jen and John Kimmich are model employers who  have shown considerable dedication toward creating positive working  conditions for their employees. Their workers receive excellent  benefits and working conditions, including livable wages, paid sick  days, vacation time, health insurance, wellness opportunities, paid  family leave, and generous retirement benefits. The Alchemist not only  produces an internationally award-winning product, but it has also  fostered a workplace culture where people are put before profits.   Further, I would like to thank Jen for her statewide leadership  championing workers' rights. She serves on the State Workforce  Development Board helping to create opportunities for good jobs in  Vermont. Through her volunteer work with Main Street Alliance, Jen has  advocated for paid sick leave and paid family leave legislation.   I also commend the company for developing The Alchemist Foundation.  [[Page S3917]]  The Foundation provides college scholarships and career pathway  opportunities for area youth.   I am grateful for all that they do for their employees, their  community, and the entire State of Vermont. Companies across the Nation  should follow in The Alchemist's footsteps by supporting workers'  rights and creating a positive workplace.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me be as clear as I can be. The so- called healthcare bill that passed in the House of Representatives  several months ago, strongly supported by President Trump, is the most  anti-working-class legislation that I have ever seen. The Senate bill,  also supported by Mr. Trump, in some respects is even worse.   At a time when working families in Vermont and all across this  country are working longer hours for low wages--many people in my own  State are working two or three jobs just to bring in enough income to  maintain a family--this legislation will cause devastating harm to  millions of our families from one end of America to the other.   The American people are united. This weekend I was in West Virginia  and Kentucky--so-called conservative States--but I tell you that what  is true there, what is true in Vermont, and what is true all over this  country is that the American people are standing up and saying loudly  and clearly that we will not allow 22 million Americans to be thrown  off of the health insurance they currently have in order to give over  $500 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent, to the drug  companies, to the insurance companies, and to other profitable  corporations. We will not support a bill that takes from the most  vulnerable people in our country--the children, the elderly, the  disabled, the sick, and the poor--in order to make the very, very rich  even richer. This is unconscionable, un-American, and the American  people will not accept it.   Plainly stated, this so-called healthcare bill is really nothing more  than a massive transfer of wealth from the working families of this  country to the very rich. While this bill contains massive cuts to  Medicaid; while seniors will pay far, far more in premiums; while  Planned Parenthood will be defunded, the 400 highest income taxpayers,  most of whom are billionaires, will get about $33 billion in tax cuts.    There is no State in this country--none, not the most conservative-- that thinks that you throw 22 million people off of health insurance,  including disabled children, in order to give $33 billion in tax breaks  to the wealthiest 400 Americans. At a time when so many people in  America are struggling, the very wealthy are already doing phenomenally  well. They do not need more tax breaks.   Not only is this bill a disaster, but the secretive, backroom process  by which it has been written is unprecedented and literally beyond  belief. That is not just me speaking; I think a number of my Republican  colleagues who disagree with me on everything make that point as well.  This bill impacts one-sixth of our economy--over $3 trillion--and by  definition, dealing with healthcare, it impacts virtually every  American. Yet the discussions and negotiations on this legislation have  never been made public. In fact, I suspect they are going on right  now--not here on the floor but behind closed doors.   Unbelievably, with legislation that would completely revamp our  healthcare system, there have been no doctors, no nurses, no hospital  administrators, no representatives of senior citizens, no experts on  the opioid crisis--which is sweeping our country--who have testified in  public about the impact this legislation will have in our country. How  can one possibly dream of drafting a bill of such enormous magnitude  without hearing one public comment from the most knowledgeable people  in America with regard to healthcare?   How can you possibly go forward without one public hearing where  Senators have the opportunity--Democrats, progressives, Independents-- to ask questions? But that is precisely the process this legislation  has gone through.   I fully understand there are a lot of people who will say: Well, big  surprise, Bernie Sanders, a strong progressive, opposes this Republican  bill. What else is new?   But I want you all to understand that it is not just Bernie Sanders  or Democrats here who oppose this legislation; this legislation is  opposed by virtually every major healthcare organization in the United  States.   I am not quite sure how we can go forward with major legislation  impacting one-sixth of the economy, opposed by every major healthcare  organization in the country, and not have one hearing. I am not quite  sure how that can be done, but that is precisely what the Republican  leadership here is doing.   It is not just Bernie Sanders who opposes this legislation. It is the  AARP, which is the largest senior group in America. It is the American  Medical Association. Hey, those are our doctors. When you get sick, you  go  [[Page S3928]]  to a doctor. Many of them are members of the American Medical  Association. They say this bill is a disaster. It is not just doctors.  It is nurses. It is hospital administrators. It is the American Cancer  Society, the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Family  Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American  Psychiatric Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the  Catholic Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Cystic  Fibrosis Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National MS Society, and  the American Nurses Association, among many other organizations that  oppose this bill being written behind closed doors.   Several months ago, as I think everybody knows, with the strong  support of President Trump, the House passed their disastrous  healthcare bill. Now, we know what is in the House bill. The Senate  bill probably is being worked on as we speak, so we don't know what is  in that exactly, but let me tell my colleagues what the House bill  does. At a time when 28 million Americans today--before the Republican  bill--have no health insurance and millions more are underinsured, with  high deductibles and copayments, this bill from the House will throw  another 23 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently  have.   Think about it. Gee, if we have 28 million Americans off of health  insurance, what most Americans would say is: OK, how do we lower that  number? In fact, the Affordable Care Act added another 20 million  people to the ranks of the insured. This bill throws 23 million on top  of the 28 million we currently have uninsured, almost doubling the  uninsured in America to over 50 million people. Think about it. People  have a hard time even beginning to believe that legislation that is  being seriously debated would almost double the number of uninsured in  America.   Everybody understands--there is no debate about this--that the  Affordable Care Act is far, far from perfect. This is a point I have  been making from the day the Affordable Care Act was passed. Premiums  in my State of Vermont and around this country are too high,  deductibles are too high, copayments are too high, and too many  Americans remain uninsured or underinsured. But in each and every one  of these legitimate concerns, the Republican legislation that has been  brought forward and passed in the House would only make a bad situation  much worse.   The Republicans say: Oh, the Affordable Care Act is a bad piece of  legislation. It has problems. The Affordable Care Act does have  problems. Their legislation exacerbates every single one of the  problems that it has.   So our job today, and I think what the average American understands-- OK, we have problems. What are the problems? We have listened.  Deductibles are too high. Copayments are too high. Premiums are too  high. Prescription drug prices are way too high. OK. Let's discuss it.  What is your idea? How do we deal with these problems? That is what the  American people want. The American people want us to address  the problems that are in the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.    It seems to me clearly that our job right now--and the American  people are rising up. They are not going to accept this Republican  legislation. Together we are going to defeat it.   I wish to speak for a moment about what it means if this legislation  were to pass. What are the implications of throwing 22 million people-- that is the Senate bill--off of health insurance, and 23 million people  in the House bill? Let me tell my colleagues. I want every American to  think about this. Just think about it. Think about somebody today who  has cancer and is maybe in chemotherapy or maybe in radiation, somebody  who has heart disease, somebody who has diabetes or some other life- threatening disease. There are God knows how many people in this  country right now who are sick. What happens if they lose their health  insurance? A simple question. You have cancer, you are getting  treatment today, and the Republican bill takes away your health  insurance. What happens to you when you cannot afford to go to the  doctor when you feel a lump in your breast or when you have problems  with your heart? What happens to you if you have a heart attack or a  stroke and need significant care, but you have no health insurance and  you don't have the money to pay for the outrageously high cost of care?   Here is the horrible and unspeakable truth that has to be brought out  into the open; that is, if this legislation were to pass, many  thousands of our fellow Americans would die, and many more would suffer  and become much sicker than they should. Now, I am not suggesting that  there is anybody in this body who wants to see anybody die  unnecessarily. Nobody does. But people have to take responsibility for  their actions, and if you throw 23 million people off of health  insurance, many of whom might have life-threatening illnesses,  thousands of people will die.   Several weeks ago I was on a television program, and I said just  that, and then right after that, I was criticized by Republicans and  rightwing critics: Why did you say that? What a terrible thing. Why are  you frightening the American people? ``Some people will die''--that is  not true.   Well, PolitiFact is a nonpartisan organization that checks out what  public officials say, and they took a look at well over 10 different  studies on the issue of mortality rates and lack of insurance coverage.  That is what they studied. They looked at more than 10 different  studies looking at mortality rates and lack of healthcare coverage.  What PolitiFact concluded is that the point that I made--that many  thousands will die--is well supported. It is not Bernie Sanders. I am  not coming up with some idea off the top of my head. This is what many,  many medical and scientific studies have told us.   Obviously nobody can predict exactly how many people will die if 23  million people lose their health coverage, but what experts at the  Harvard School of Public Health estimate is that if 23 million people  are thrown off of health insurance, as the House bill does, up to  28,000 people could die each and every year--28,000 people. That is  nine times more than the tragic loss of life we suffered on 9/11, and  that would take place each and every year. In the wealthiest country in  the history of the world, we must not allow that to happen.   This bill would impact the children, many of whom are covered by the  CHIP program, covered by Medicaid. You tell me what happens to a kid  who has a disability right now and whose family receives Medicaid. Some  of those children may have Down syndrome. Some of those children may  have cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, maybe autism. They may have  mental health needs, such as depression or anxiety, or complications  from premature birth. Today, Medicaid and CHIP cover 5 million--or 44  percent--of those kids, providing them with coverage so that they can  live with dignity and security.   But it is not just the children who will be impacted, it is also the  elderly. What every person in America should understand--and many do  not--is that Medicaid now pays for over two-thirds of all nursing home  care. So I ask my Republican friends: What happens when you slash  Medicaid? Who will pay for somebody's mom or dad in a nursing home  dealing with Alzheimer's disease? How many seniors in this nursing home  will get thrown out on the street or be forced to live in their  children's basement? Well, we don't know the answer to that. We haven't  had any hearings. We haven't heard any people testify to that. But I  think we will see a whole lot of families disrupted, having to make the  choice about whether to take care of their parents or provide for their  kid to go to college.   It is not just nursing home care. What happens if you are just an  older worker. Maybe you are 60 years of age. Well, the likelihood is  that if you are a 60-, 62-year-old worker, the cost of your premiums is  going to soar. Again, this is not Bernie Sanders' view; it is what the  AARP says.   This is a quote from the AARP from June 22:         This new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed       doors without a single hearing or open debate--and it shows.       The Senate bill would hit millions of Americans with higher       costs and result in less coverage for them.        AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which will allow       insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more       for coverage than everyone else while reducing tax credits       that help make insurance more affordable.    That is the AARP.   What about the opioid epidemic, which is hitting my State of Vermont  hard and hitting States all over this  [[Page S3929]]  country? Each and every day, more than 90 people in America die from an  opioid overdose. Can you believe that? Ninety people die every single  day. Nearly 4,000 people begin abusing prescription painkillers, and  about 600 start using heroin. We have a major, major crisis in opioid  addiction and heroin overdoses.   It turns out that if you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, which is what  the Republicans are talking about, our ability to address the opioid  crisis will be severely curtailed. At a time when we should be  expanding prevention efforts, expanding treatment efforts, the  Republican bill will make it much harder for us to deal with the opioid  crisis.   This legislation is not what the American people want. I understand  that the Republican leader today suggested that Members of the Senate  may have to stay here for a few more weeks in August, and I can  understand that. If I were the Republican leader, I would not want my  Senators to go home to hear what the American people have to say about  this legislation.   The truth is, poll after poll shows overwhelming opposition to this  disastrous legislation. According to the latest USA TODAY/Suffolk  University Poll, just 12 percent of the American people support the  Republican bill.   As a matter of fact, according to a recent report, this is the most  unpopular piece of legislation in the last three decades. It is more  unpopular than the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. That is pretty  unpopular. The American people are catching on as to what is in this  bill, and they do not want to see it.   Let me conclude by saying what is as obvious as can be. It is what  the American people want. Are there problems with the Affordable Care  Act? Absolutely. Premiums are too high, deductibles too high,  copayments too high, prescription drug prices are off the charts.   Let's deal with it. What is the problem? Let's deal with it. Put it  on the table, and let us address those problems. The American people  want to improve the Affordable Care Act, not destroy it.   Let me now, speaking for myself only, say this. I hope very much  there can be bipartisan efforts to improve the Affordable Care Act, but  I happen to believe we have to go further than that. I intend to help  lead that effort.   In my view, there is something profoundly wrong when the United  States of America is the only major country on Earth--the only one-- that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people as a right, while at  the same time we spend far more per capita on healthcare. We spend far  more per capita on prescription drugs, and our healthcare outcomes are  not particularly good compared to many other countries.   I think the time is long overdue as to why we do not ask ourselves:  How is it Canada can guarantee healthcare to all people, the UK can do  it, Germany can do it, France can do, Scandinavia can do it? Every  major country on Earth recognizes that healthcare must be a right, not  a privilege.   I happen to agree with that. That is why I will--as soon as this  debate is over and as soon as, hopefully, we defeat this disastrous  Republican legislation--introduce a Medicare-for-all, single-payer  bill, which will in fact guarantee healthcare to all of our people in a  cost-effective way.   Let me conclude by saying that the current Republican bill in front  of us is a moral outrage. There are very few people in America who  think you should throw 22 million of our people off of health insurance  in order to give huge tax breaks to billionaires. This is a moral  outrage, and it must be defeated. I will do everything in my power to  see that it is defeated.   I yield the floor.
