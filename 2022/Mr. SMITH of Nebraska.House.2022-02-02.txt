 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  4521, the so-called America COMPETES Act.   The trade division of this bill falls squarely within the Ways and  Means Committee's jurisdiction, yet the first time we saw these  provisions was last week when bill text was released by House  Democrats. There was no committee process, no interest in putting  together a thoughtfully vetted solution to address China.   In fact, House Democrats wouldn't even bring my TPA amendment to the  floor for a vote, an amendment that reflected years of bipartisan work  and consensus about the importance of a close partnership between  Congress and every President to achieve high-standard, enforceable  trade agreements that open new markets for American goods and services.   Instead, what we have before us today is a bill that fails to address  China and fails American small businesses and consumers with provisions  that would actually discourage work during a workforce shortage by  expanding and delinking Trade Adjustment Assistance from new trade  opportunities.                                time  1530    It would add more red tape to and narrows eligibility of trade  programs like GSP and MTB that small businesses and manufacturers rely  on to compete in the global marketplace.   It would also exacerbate the supply chain crisis by making unvetted  changes to the de minimis rules. That would also do nothing to address  the administration's minimal effort to compete with China in the Indo- Pacific and around the world.   Clearly, this bill is more about talking points than actual effective  and proactive policymaking.   President Biden and his party may be content with America sitting on  the sidelines as China and our other competitors set global trade  standards and divvy up the world's consumers, but I am not.   This is a missed opportunity to spur momentum on a proactive trade  agenda, protect American innovation, and alleviate some of the supply  chain and workforce pressures our Nation is facing.   Therefore, I will vote ``no'' on this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
