 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Last night, the President shared a hopeful vision of a  bright future for our country. In part, he reminded us that the future  is bright because of the big steps we have taken together in the past 2  years to move the Nation forward--steps such as historic tax reform  that has helped middle-class families across America keep more of what  they earn; the regulatory reforms that have amped up our economy and  fueled job creation; the landmark legislation we passed to combat the  opioid epidemic; the long-needed investment in our Armed Forces that  gives our servicemembers the tools and training they need to keep us  safe.   As I mentioned yesterday, some of these accomplishments were  delivered by Republicans alone, but the lion's share of them were  bicameral and bipartisan. They combined the ideas and priorities of  both sides of the aisle and both Chambers of Congress. So even though I  know our Democratic colleagues' first instinct these days is to  reflexively criticize anything President Trump says or does, I hope  they took some pride in the strong state of our Union which the  President described.   This great country belongs to all of us, and it is going to take all  of us to keep moving forward. As the President put it, ``cooperation,  compromise, and the common good.''   Last night, the President highlighted, in particular, the national  challenges he sees as most urgent and as top priorities for his  administration this year. Tackling them will require that same  bipartisan spirit in Congress. He restated the administration's  commitment to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our  Nation's southern border, to fighting on behalf of American workers and  job creators, to rebuilding America's infrastructure, and to helping  simplify families' budgets by lowering the cost of healthcare and  prescription drugs. On these and other challenges, the American people  deserve the full attention of a fully functioning Congress. They  deserve a Democratic Party that puts the public interest ahead of  political spite and comes to the table to negotiate necessary  compromises.   Well, it will not be long before we will see if this institution can  rise to the occasion. The next deadline for appropriations will arrive  in a little over a week, and Members in both Chambers will need to  prove we can move past making points and start actually making a  difference.   Throughout the coming year, if we are serious about advancing  meaningful policy, this basic requirement will remain the same--good- faith efforts between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican- controlled Senate and President Trump's administration.   Another challenge the President mentioned is the ongoing obstruction  of his nominations to the executive branch and the Federal courts. He  was absolutely right about that. To a historic degree, Senate Democrats  have slow-walked well-qualified nominees, gumming up committee  consideration and burning weeks of valuable time on the floor. As I  have said time and  [[Page S876]]  again, this mindless obstruction is unacceptable.   So I was encouraged the President took an opportunity last night to  highlight for the Nation exactly what we are up against in this regard.  We are into the third year of his Presidency--the third year--and the  American people deserve a fully functioning and fully staffed Federal  Government after 3 years. It is time for their elected representatives  to be part of the solution.   I know several of our colleagues are discussing ways to help the  Senate better fulfill its duty in this area. I hope there will be  cooperation from the other side of the aisle to identify and advance a  durable and fair solution.   President Trump offered a clear picture of the ways in which our  policies are delivering significant results to families across America  and the urgent challenges we still need to confront together. He  offered us a powerful reminder that America's strength and goodness are  inextricably linked with our commitment to individual liberty and free  enterprise and that we can never allow the United States of America to  dim our light by sliding into the failures of socialism. Socialism has  failed everywhere it has been tried, and we are not going to try it in  this country. We need to do right now what we need to in order to move  forward together.   The brief Democratic response showed us one potential way forward.  Our colleagues across the aisle could simply deny the facts in front of  us about the progress that has taken place--progress which middle-class  families all across America can tangibly feel--and use the same, tired,  forgettable cliches to divide our Nation along political lines, but the  President offered a chance to walk together, unified, along a higher  road. Both the tone and the substance of his speech would strike any  fair observer as reasonable and thoroughly bipartisan.   Once again, the only way this divided Congress will be able to choose  greatness and deliver significant legislation to the American people is  by focusing on, as President Trump put it, ``cooperation, compromise,  and the common good.''   That will need to be our motto moving forward. The Nation we love  deserves no less. The American people will be watching us.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
