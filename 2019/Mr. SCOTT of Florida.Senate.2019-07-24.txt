 Mr. President, Judge Wendy Williams Berger has  honorably served the State of Florida for several years, and I proudly  support her confirmation as a district judge for the Middle District of  Florida today. Throughout her distinguished legal career, she has  remained committed to upholding the rule of law, prosecuting criminal  offenses as an Assistant State Attorney for Florida's Seventh Judicial  Circuit, and subsequently presiding as a circuit court judge for that  same judicial circuit. As Governor of Florida, I was honored to appoint  Judge Berger to the Fifth District Court of Appeal in 2012, and I am  proud to support her confirmation to the Federal bench, where she will  continue her exemplary service to our State and Nation.
