 Madam Speaker, this weekend, millions of women marched  across the country to send a clear signal to Congress and President  Trump: Hear our voices and protect our rights.   Yet here we are, just 2 days later, voting on the same extremist  policies that House leaders have been pushing for years.   Women will not be fooled. We know H.R. 7 is another direct attack on  our health and our families. It creates sweeping new restrictions on  abortion care for women who purchase coverage under the Affordable Care  Act, with no meaningful exceptions to protect a woman's health.   That means women like Stephanie, from my district, who faced  heartbreaking complications during her wanted pregnancy, would be left  without coverage for the doctor-recommended care she needed.   We should not be injecting ideology into a woman's personal medical  decisions. This bill is an insult to the millions of women who marched  this weekend, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
