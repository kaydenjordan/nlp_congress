 Mr. Speaker, we can't truly address the mental health  crisis in this country without addressing the stigma head-on. For that  reason, I rise today to say that I am one of the millions of Americans  who balance day-to-day life with managing anxiety and depression.   It isn't always easy for me to share my struggles with mental health,  but I know that facing mental health challenges does not make you weak.  It makes you human, and it gives others permission and courage to also  speak openly.   We have to change the national conversation so that we can pull  together bipartisan support to finally address our mental health  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to turn  their attention to our country's growing mental health crisis.   Addressing mental health gets to the root of some of our country's  most challenging issues. The issues do not exist within a vacuum. They  touch education; they touch housing; and they touch substance use  disorder.   I will not stop bringing up this issue until our communities feel  heard and receive the support they desperately need.  [[Page H659]]                                ____________________
