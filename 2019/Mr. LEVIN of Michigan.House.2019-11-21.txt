 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment ensures that our  incredible healthcare and social service workers are aware that they  are legally protected from retaliation by their employers.   I begin by thanking my colleague, Congressman   Joe Courtney, for his  hard work on this outstanding bill, and Chairman Scott for leading this  issue and bringing the bill to the floor today.   Healthcare and social service workers are some of this country's most  precious workers, taking care of us and our loved ones, sometimes under  some of the most trying conditions imaginable.   H.R. 1309 will help protect these workers by requiring employers in  the healthcare and social service sectors to develop workplace violence  prevention plans. My amendment will require that mandatory violence  prevention plan trainings include the critical information that these  workers, when faced with any violent or unwanted behavior in the  workplace, can safely report the incident without fear of retaliation.   Bureau of Labor Statistics data tell us that private-sector injury  rates from workplace violence in healthcare and social service sectors  increased 63 percent between 2006 and 2016, in just a decade. And due  to underreporting, injury rates and workplace violence are widely  assumed to be higher than the reported levels.   This is a huge problem for workers but also for those they care for,  as violence in healthcare settings compromises quality of care. We  cannot expect healthcare and social service workers to be able to  deliver essential lifesaving services under the threat of violence and  assault and fear of repercussions for reporting any incident that may  occur.   The same goes for social service workers. A safe and violence-free  workplace is essential to a functioning social service system that will  help our communities thrive. We cannot expect workers to come forward  with reports of violence if they fear retribution.   My straightforward amendment aims to ensure that healthcare and  social service workers covered by this bill are aware of their right to  come forward and report any incident of violence at work without fear  of retribution.   Madam Chair, let me add that this is really personal for me. I don't  want to reveal my age, but I started organizing healthcare workers for  SEIU in 1983, and I remember my very first campaign at Shore Haven  Nursing Home in Grand Haven, Michigan.   Some of the workers in the nursing home did face violence on the job,  and they really had no way to handle it. So Mr. Courtney's bill, his  leadership on this, is so essential for all the health and social  service workers of the country.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am sure we can all agree that  retribution for people reporting violence in the workplace is something  that is important, that people should not face retribution, that they  should not fear reporting when they personally or their coworkers face  violence on the job. So I hope that we will have broad support for this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1045
