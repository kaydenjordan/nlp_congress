 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's own words: Show me your  budget, and I will show you your priorities.   President Biden's budget is not only a reflection of his priorities;  it is a mirror into the soul of the Democrat Party. Biden's budget  exposes Democrat leadership's complete disregard for fiscal  responsibility, adding trillions of dollars in new spending and sending  us hurtling toward an incalculable national debt of $45 trillion by  2032.   The budget proposal includes a staggering $2.5 trillion in tax hikes  that would weaken our global competitiveness, stifle wage growth, and  send prices skyrocketing even higher than the current 40-year high  inflation. The result would be devastating for American investment,  innovation, and jobs.   The deficit spending in Biden's proposal will leave our children  steeped in debt and at risk of an economic crisis they cannot borrow  their way out of. His budget doubles down on the radical socialist  policies, including the Green New Deal and its extreme environmental  policies and a whole-of-government assault on oil and gas, which is  undermining our energy independence and making us weaker and more  vulnerable, like our friends in Europe. It also includes tax hikes that  will make America less competitive, raising taxes higher than Communist  China, and hiring tens of thousands of new IRS agents to harass  hardworking Americans.    This is his vision for a stronger and more prosperous America.   While the President's expansion of nondefense domestic spending is on  pace to double over the next several years, his budget effectively cuts  spending for the Defense Department by 4 percent. If our adversaries  weren't already emboldened by the disaster at the southern border, the  debacle in Afghanistan, the weak negotiations with Iran, or the slow  and feckless response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they certainly  will be now.   The President's budget is not only a failure in the area of  readiness; it is more advertisement of weakness in an increasingly  dangerous world.   Lastly, the President's budget uses an outrageous budget gimmick to  prevent his massive, multitrillion-dollar Build Back Better from  affecting the budget score.   Mr. Speaker, if the American people did that--that off-balance,  Enron-like accounting scheme--they would go to prison. This is not just  intellectually dishonest; it is downright deceitful.   From the top-line numbers to tax hikes, from partisan policies to  bureaucratic bloat, President Biden's budget highlights the Democratic  Party's real priorities: the largest expansion and most radical  reimagination of the Federal Government in the lives of its people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, the America Energy  Independence from Russia Act. That would not only strengthen our  security and independence, it would lower gas prices by approving the  Keystone pipeline, removing restrictions on LNG exports, restarting  production on Federal lands and waters, and overall encouraging more  American energy development.   In the midst of skyrocketing inflation and surging prices at the  pump, along with the geopolitical context where Europe is dependent on  Russian oil and gas, you would think the Biden administration would  abandon their whole-of-government approach to targeting American energy  production. Since Biden took office, he has used every tool at his  disposal to undermine the oil and gas industry and our energy  independence along with it.   In addition to the onslaught of his unilateral attacks, his first  Presidential budget was released and called for $35 billion in punitive  tax increases on the oil and gas industry. His administration has  weaponized and abused their regulatory authority to attack the industry  at every turn; SEC reports for permitting on the directives, and EPA  radical regulations.   What is more astonishing is Biden's latest budget, which is $4  trillion in taxes, and includes $45 billion in taxes on oil and gas.  These are the same provisions that his own party rejected and had to  abandon their build back broke proposal.   Just like he has done with the regulatory regime, it appears our  President is weaponizing the tax code to cancel an entire sector of our  economy, one that is paramount to our prosperity and security. As  events around the world constrain supply, he seems hellbent to ensure  that anyone but American energy producers, the most efficient, the  cleanest producers in the world, are positioned to supply the United  States and our people and our allies around the world.
