(6) For the purpose of administering any provision of law       (including any rule or regulation that provides premium pay,       retirement, life insurance, or any other employee benefit)       that requires any deduction or contribution, or that imposes       any requirement or limitation on the basis of a rate of       salary or basic pay, the rate of salary or basic pay payable       after the application of this subsection shall be treated as       the rate of salary or basic pay.        (7) Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to       permit or require the payment to any employee covered by this       subsection at a rate in excess of the rate that would be       payable were this subsection not in effect.        (8) The Office of Personnel Management may provide for       exceptions to the limitations imposed by this subsection if       the Office determines that such exceptions are necessary to       ensure the recruitment or retention of qualified employees.        (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), the adjustment in rates       of basic pay for the statutory pay systems that take place in       fiscal year 2022 under sections 5344 and 5348 of title 5,       United States Code, shall be--        (1) not less than the percentage received by employees in       the same location whose rates of basic pay are adjusted       pursuant to the statutory pay systems under sections 5303 and       5304 of title 5, United States Code:  Provided, That       prevailing rate employees at locations where there are no       employees whose pay is increased pursuant to sections 5303       and 5304 of title 5, United States Code, and prevailing rate       employees described in section 5343(a)(5) of title 5, United       States Code, shall be considered to be located in the pay       locality designated as ``Rest of United States'' pursuant to       section 5304 of title 5, United States Code, for purposes of       this subsection; and        (2) effective as of the first day of the first applicable       pay period beginning after September 30, 2021.

Sec. 739.  None of the funds made available by this or any       other Act may be used to implement, administer, enforce, or       apply the rule entitled ``Competitive Area'' published by the       Office of Personnel Management in the Federal Register on       April 15, 2008 (73 Fed.

Such form or agreement shall, at       a minimum, require that the person will not disclose any       classified information received in the course of such       activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the       United States Government. Such nondisclosure forms shall also       make it clear that they do not bar disclosures to Congress,       or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the       Department of Justice, that are essential to reporting a       substantial violation of law.        (b) A nondisclosure agreement may continue to be       implemented and enforced notwithstanding subsection (a) if it       complies with the requirements for such agreement that were       in effect when the agreement was entered into.        (c) No funds appropriated in this or any other Act may be       used to implement or enforce any agreement entered into       during fiscal year 2014 which does not contain substantially       similar language to that required in subsection (a).

Sec. 744.  None of the funds made available by this or any       other Act may be used to enter into a contract, memorandum of       understanding, or cooperative agreement with, make a grant       to, or provide a loan or loan guarantee to, any corporation       that was convicted of a felony criminal violation under any       Federal law within the preceding 24 months, where the       awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless a Federal       agency has considered suspension or debarment of the       corporation and has made a determination that this further       action is not necessary to protect the interests of the       Government.

Such an employee may not receive a pay rate increase       during calendar year 2022, except as provided in subsection       (i).        (c) Notwithstanding section 401 of the Foreign Service Act       of 1980 (Public Law 96-465) or any other provision of law, a       chief of mission or ambassador at large is subject to       subsection (b) in the same manner as other employees who are       paid at an Executive Schedule rate.        (d)(1) This subsection applies to--        (A) a noncareer appointee in the Senior Executive Service       paid a rate of basic pay at or above the official rate for       level IV of the Executive Schedule; or        (B) a limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee       in the Senior Executive Service serving under a political       appointment and paid a rate of basic pay at or above the       official rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule.

(h) This section does not apply to an individual who makes       an election to retain Senior Foreign Service pay entitlements       under section 302(b) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980       (Public Law 96-465) for such time as that election is in       effect.        (i) Notwithstanding subsections (b) through (e), an       employee in a covered position may receive a pay rate       increase upon an authorized movement to a different covered       position only if that new position has higher-level duties       and a pre-established level or range of pay higher than the       level or range for the position held immediately before the       movement. Any such increase must be based on the rates of pay       and applicable limitations on payable rates of pay in effect       on December 31, 2021, by operation of section 748 of division       E of Public Law 116-260.        (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for an       individual who is newly appointed to a covered position       during the period of time subject to this section, the       initial pay rate shall be based on the rates of pay and       applicable limitations on payable rates of pay in effect on       December 31, 2021, by operation of section 748 of division E       of Public Law 116-260.        (k) If an employee affected by this section is subject to a       biweekly pay period that begins in calendar year 2022 but       ends in calendar year 2023, the bar on the employee's receipt       of pay rate increases shall apply through the end of that pay       period.        (l) For the purpose of this section, the term ``covered       position'' means a position occupied by an employee whose pay       is restricted under this section.        (m) This section takes effect on the first day of the first       applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2022.        Sec. 747.  During the current fiscal year-- (a) with       respect to budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that       is set to be reserved or proposed to be deferred in a special       message transmitted under section 1012 or 1013 of the       Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974,       such budget authority--        (1) shall be made available for obligation in sufficient       time to be prudently obligated as required under section       1012(b) or 1013 of such Act; and        (2) may not be deferred or otherwise withheld from       obligation during the 90-day period before the expiration of       the period of availability of such budget authority,       including, if applicable, the 90-day period before the       expiration of an initial period of availability for which       such budget authority was provided.

(a) No assistance shall be provided under section       8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f)       to any individual who--        (1) is enrolled as a student at an institution of higher       education (as defined under section 102 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002));        (2) is under 24 years of age;        (3) is not a veteran;        (4) is unmarried;        (5) does not have a dependent child;        (6) is not a person with disabilities, as such term is       defined in section 3(b)(3)(E) of the United States Housing       Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3)(E)) and was not receiving       assistance under such section 8 as of November 30, 2005;        (7) is not a youth who left foster care at age 14 or older       and is at risk of becoming homeless; and        (8) is not otherwise individually eligible, or has parents       who, individually or jointly, are not eligible, to receive       assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act       of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).        (b) For purposes of determining the eligibility of a person       to receive assistance under section 8 of the United States       Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), any financial       assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition and any       other required fees and charges) that an individual receives       under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et       seq.), from private sources, or from an institution of higher       education (as defined under section 102 of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)), shall be considered       income to that individual, except for a person over the age       of 23 with dependent children.        Sec. 211.  The funds made available for Native Alaskans       under paragraph (1) under the heading ``Native American       Programs'' in title II of this Act shall be allocated to the       same Native Alaskan housing block grant recipients that       received funds in fiscal year 2005, and only such recipients       shall be eligible to apply for funds made available under       paragraph (2) of such heading.        Sec. 212.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in       fiscal year 2022, in managing and disposing of any       multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by       the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and during       the process of foreclosure on any property with a contract       for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United       States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or any other       Federal programs, the Secretary shall maintain any rental       assistance payments under section 8 of the United States       Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached to       any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the       Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants and       the local government that such a multifamily property owned       or having a mortgage held by the Secretary is not feasible       for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8       or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of       rehabilitating and operating the property and all available       Federal, State, and local resources, including rent       adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted       Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (in this section       ``MAHRAA'') (42 U.S.C. 1437f note), and (2) environmental       conditions that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective       fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation with the tenants       of that property, contract for project-based rental       assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing       housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The       Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that       project-based contracts remain in effect prior to       foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual abatement       remedies to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major       threats to health and safety after written notice to and       informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other       available remedies, such as partial abatements or       receivership. After disposition of any multifamily property       described in this section, the contract and allowable rent       levels on such properties shall be subject to the       requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.        Sec. 213.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400       or fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any       asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary in       connection with the operating fund rule:  Provided, That an       agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy       under the operating fund formula shall not be exempt from       asset management requirements.        Sec. 214.  With respect to the use of amounts provided in       this Act and in future Acts for the operation, capital       improvement, and management of public housing as authorized       by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act of       1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d),(e)), the Secretary shall not impose       any requirement or guideline relating to asset management       that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital funds       for central office costs pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of       section 9(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42       U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public housing       agency may not use capital funds authorized under section       9(d) for activities that are eligible under section 9(e) for       assistance with amounts from the operating fund in excess of       the amounts permitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of section       9(g).        Sec. 215.  No official or employee of the Department of       Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an       allotment holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial       Officer has determined that such allotment holder has       implemented an adequate system of funds control and has       received training in funds control procedures and directives.       The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a       trained allotment holder for each HUD appropriation under the       accounts ``Executive Offices'', ``Administrative Support       Offices'', ``Program Offices'', ``Government National       Mortgage Association--Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed       Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and ``Office of       Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and       Urban Development.        Sec. 216.  The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 2022,       notify the public through the Federal Register and other       means, as determined appropriate, of the issuance of a notice       of the availability of assistance or notice of funding       opportunity (NOFO) for any program or discretionary fund       administered by the Secretary that is to be competitively       awarded. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for       fiscal year 2022, the Secretary may make the NOFO available       only on the Internet at the appropriate Government website or       through other electronic media, as determined by the       Secretary.        Sec. 217.

The annual budget submission for the program  [[Page H4043]]       offices and the Office of General Counsel shall include any       such projected litigation costs for attorney fees as a       separate line item request.        Sec. 218. (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the       Secretary may transfer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000,       whichever is less, of funds appropriated for any office under       the headings ``Administrative Support Offices'' or ``Program       Offices'' to any other such office under such heading:       Provided, That no appropriation for any such office or       account shall be increased or decreased by more than 10       percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, without prior       written approval of the House and Senate Committees on       Appropriations: Provided further, That the Secretary shall       provide notification to such Committees not less than 3       business days in advance of any such transfers under this       section up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less.        (2) The authority under paragraph (1) to transfer funds       shall not apply to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal       Opportunity, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy       Homes, or the Office of Departmental Equal Employment       Opportunity.        (b) The Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 10       percent of funds appropriated for any office under the       headings ``Administrative Support Offices'' or ``Program       Offices'' to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal       Opportunity, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy       Homes, or the Office of Departmental Equal Employment       Opportunity: Provided, That no amounts may be transferred       pursuant to this subparagraph unless the Secretary provides       notification to such Committees not less than 3 business days       in advance of any such transfers under this subsection.        Sec. 219. (a) Any entity receiving housing assistance       payments shall maintain decent, safe, and sanitary       conditions, as determined by the Secretary, and comply with       any standards under applicable State or local laws, rules,       ordinances, or regulations relating to the physical condition       of any property covered under a housing assistance payment       contract.        (b) The Secretary shall take action under subsection (c)       when a multifamily housing project with a contract under       section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.       1437f) or a contract for similar project-based assistance--        (1) receives a Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS)       score of 60 or less; or        (2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary within 3       days that all Exigent Health and Safety deficiencies       identified by the inspector at the project have been       corrected.      Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured       projects with assistance attached to the units under section       8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f),       but shall not apply to such units assisted under section       8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public       housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under       section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.       1437g).        (c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the Real Estate       Assessment Center (``REAC'') inspection, the Secretary shall       provide the owner with a Notice of Default with a specified       timetable, determined by the Secretary, for correcting all       deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide a copy of the       Notice of Default to the tenants, the local government, any       mortgagees, and any contract administrator. If the owner's       appeal results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary       may withdraw the Notice of Default.        (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all       deficiencies specified in the Notice of Default, if the owner       fails to fully correct such deficiencies, the Secretary may--        (A) require immediate replacement of project management       with a management agent approved by the Secretary;        (B) impose civil money penalties, which shall be used       solely for the purpose of supporting safe and sanitary       conditions at applicable properties, as designated by the       Secretary, with priority given to the tenants of the property       affected by the penalty;        (C) abate the section 8 contract, including partial       abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all       deficiencies have been corrected;        (D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, approved by       the Secretary under established procedures, who will be       obligated to promptly make all required repairs and to accept       renewal of the assistance contract if such renewal is       offered;        (E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to another       project or projects and owner or owners;        (F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including suspensions or       debarments from Federal programs;        (G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to manage the       property and cure all project deficiencies or seek a judicial       order of specific performance requiring the owner to cure all       project deficiencies;        (H) work with the owner, lender, or other related party to       stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property       through compliance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of       capital provided by a third-party that requires time to       effectuate; or        (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies       available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the       Secretary.        (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to ensure       that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the       exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist       relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety       after written notice to the affected tenants. To the extent       the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants       and the local government, that the property is not feasible       for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8       or other programs, based on consideration of--        (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property       and all available Federal, State, and local resources,       including rent adjustments under section 524 of the       Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of       1997 (``MAHRAA''); and        (2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in a       cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may contract for       project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or       owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other       rental assistance.        (e) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all properties       covered by this section that are assessed through the Real       Estate Assessment Center and have UPCS physical inspection       scores of less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory       management and occupancy review within the past 36 months.       The report shall include--        (1) identification of the enforcement actions being taken       to address such conditions, including imposition of civil       money penalties and termination of subsidies, and       identification of properties that have such conditions       multiple times;        (2) identification of actions that the Department of       Housing and Urban Development is taking to protect tenants of       such identified properties; and        (3) any administrative or legislative recommendations to       further improve the living conditions at properties covered       under a housing assistance payment contract.      This report shall be submitted to the Senate and House       Committees on Appropriations not later than 30 days after the       enactment of this Act, and on the first business day of each       Federal fiscal year quarter thereafter while this section       remains in effect.
