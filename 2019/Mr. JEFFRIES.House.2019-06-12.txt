 Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, let me first just thank the  distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut, the chair of the  subcommittee, for her tremendous work in connection with this bill.   The mission of the Office for Civil Rights is to ensure access to  education and to promote educational excellence throughout the Nation  through vigorous enforcement of civil rights. However, this  administration and Secretary DeVos have methodically worked to limit  the effectiveness of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of  Education.   This amendment would prohibit any funds in the underlying measure to  be used to thwart the important work that is done by the Office for  Civil Rights. This administration has gone out of its way to hurt  students of color and undermine diversity in a variety of ways. They  have eliminated guidance, encouraging schools to endeavor towards  diversity in admissions, and they have rescinded guidance issued by the  previous administration directing schools to reduce racial disparities  in how they discipline students.   Frederick Douglass said: ``It is easier to build strong children than  it is to repair broken men.''   Excellence in academic and educational preparation is an important  part of the American Dream, and every single child in this country,  regardless of race, regardless of gender, and regardless of religion  should have access to the highest quality education. That is the  mission of the Department of Education and the role of the Office for  Civil Rights within that department.   By prohibiting the use of funds in the underlying measure from being  used to limit the functions of the Office for Civil Rights, we are  taking a necessary step toward ensuring that in this country, the  pursuit of excellence in education will be available to every single  child.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished  chair of the subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).  [[Page H4605]]         Madam Chair, the Brown v. Board of Education decision  was a historic and important step and a strong step in the right  direction. We have come a long way in this country, but we still have a  long way to go as it relates to providing equal access to education.   This amendment is pretty simple. It says to the Secretary: Keep your  hands off the Office of Civil Rights.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
