 Madam President, in reserving the right to object, here  is my problem.   Yesterday--and I mean yesterday--the Secretary of Defense released  out a memorandum. The memorandum was about pay for National Guard  members and the vaccine. We have National Guard members in very large  numbers and percentages all around the country who have not been  vaccinated at this point.   Now, there are two sets of rules for the National Guard--one for the  Air National Guard. Their deadline for the vaccination is tomorrow.  Now, remember, this memorandum came out yesterday. Their deadline for  the vaccination is tomorrow, December 2. For the Army National Guard,  their deadline is the 30th of June--so two sets of rules for the Air  National Guard and for the Army National Guard. They are completely  different--6 months apart, plus.   For the Air National Guard, this word came out yesterday with this  statement:         No Department of Defense funding may be allocated for       payment of duties performed under title 32 for members of the       National Guard who do not comply with Department of Defense       COVID-19 vaccination requirements.    Then there is this statement:         No credit or excused absence shall be afforded to members       who do not participate in drills, training, or other duty due       to failure to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.    What does this mean in real life?   Well, in real life it means, as of tomorrow, members of the Air  National Guard, not the Army National Guard--they have 6 more months,  plus. But members of the Air National Guard, as of tomorrow, even if  they are not on Federal duty, will no longer be paid, will no longer be  allowed to drill. That means, this coming weekend, Air National Guard  members who were headed to drill who have not been vaccinated can't  drill.   What does that mean in real life?   Well, National Guard members don't get TRICARE free and taken care of  and provided for by the taxpayers like Active Duty does. To get TRICARE  from them, it comes out of their checks, but if they are not getting a  check, then it interrupts their payments.   So what the Secretary of Defense did yesterday was announce that Air  National Guard members, as of this weekend, will not be paid anymore,  will not be allowed to drill anymore, and we have thousands of them all  over the country. At the last check, the Guard had about 50 percent  compliance on the vaccination.   In some areas of the Guard, they have very serious concerns--well,  let me just identify this--not just as a readiness issue in that we  have individuals who have served in the Guard for years who now are,  suddenly, not going to be paid and are going to have their insurance at  risk. It is not just that, but this is also a federalism issue. I know  this gets lost in the conversation, but the National Guard is not  Active Duty. They are not reservists. The National Guard, when they are  under title 32, actually work for the State. The National Guard in my  State works for the Governor of my State. The Governor of my State is  their commander in chief. According to the U.S. Constitution, for the  Guard members, their officers are selected by the Governor of the  State. That is how we set up the National Guard. It is not the Active  Duty. It is not the Reserves. They are different. The time when they  are federally connected is in what is called title 10, and the U.S.  President actually calls them up, and they shift from title 32, under  the States' authority, to title 10.   Do you want to know what the separations are even in funding? Let me  make it clear.   The way the statute actually lays this out under title 32, section  108, is, if there is a Guard unit that is not complying, then the DOD  can cut funding to the State, not to individual members. What is this  memorandum? It is not cutting funding to the State; it is cutting  funding to individuals who are within the Guard. That is not allowed  under title 32, section 108. The consequences for a Guard unit not  being ready is to cut off funding to the State. That is how the section  works. In fact, even just a few years ago, in an NDAA just like what we  are debating, there was a section to allow the DOD to be able to reach  into units and to be able to take on and punish individuals with their  pay, and that was blocked here in this body. It was not allowed. But  this administration is going around Congress, around the States,  reaching into  [[Page S8858]]  individual airmen and docking their pay, and, so far, this body is  letting them.   That is a terrible precedent. That is terrible for the families in  this National Guard unit. It is terrible for the morale, even because  the Pentagon gave one set of rules to the Army Guard and another set of  rules to the Air Guard, and these individuals, as of this weekend, will  not be paid anymore unless this body acts.   So my request is very straightforward. The amendment that I bring to  the floor protects the National Guard not just in my State but all over  the entire country because there are Air Guard members in every one of  our States who are worried about what is going to happen tomorrow to  them when they have been faithfully serving their country.   All that I ask is we file this simple amendment; that we allow a vote  on this simple amendment in this body; and that we prohibit the  discharging of the withholding of pay and benefits to National Guard  members based on their COVID-19 vaccination status.   It is very straightforward. It is very clean. It does nothing but  say: We stand with our National Guard members, and we will not allow  their pay to be cut, not only because we stand with them individually,  but we also disagree with the interpretation of the Pentagon, which is  not allowed to reach into a unit, select individual members, and not  pay them. That is not the way that it works under title 32, section  108.   So, yes, I ask to modify the request to include my amendment No.  4863.
