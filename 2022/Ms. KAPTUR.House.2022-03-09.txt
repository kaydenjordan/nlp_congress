 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal and Congressman Lloyd  Doggett for allowing me this time tonight to rise in strong support of  liberty by suspending energy imports from Russia to help crush Putin  for his crimes against humanity.   Putin is murdering innocent men, pregnant women, children, and the  elderly. He is bombing them into pieces. The brutal savagery unleashed  by Putin and allowed by his treacherous oligarchs requires crushing and  unflinching retribution.   The time has come to terminate the flow of Russia's blood-soaked oil  into our land. We must also suspend Russia from the World Trade  Organization. And let us sanction Putin and his enablers as far into  the pits of hell as we possibly can.   As the gold standard for freedom and democracy, the world is watching  America right now. This is not the time for holdouts or cowards. Every  Member of this body must rise up without delay and lead by example.   Pass this legislation. Hit Putin and his enablers where it hurts. The  just cause of liberty demands nothing less.    Mr. Speaker, please let me thank Chair DeLauro for her  persevering leadership on this critical bill, and I would like to thank  Ranking Member Simpson for his productive partnership, as well as the  Energy and Water Subcommittee staff and majority clerk, Jaime Shimek,  for their work.   The Energy and Water division of this bill is a historic investment  in American jobs, innovation, and competitiveness. It engages and  advances all energy technologies to assure America's energy  independence in perpetuity and for our security while sustaining life  on Earth.   Our bill delivers for the American people by investing $8.3 billion  in the Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild America's water  infrastructure and prepare for increasing rainfall, rising sea levels,  and desertification;   $1.92 billion in the Bureau of Reclamation for the West's water  management;   $44.9 billion in the Department of Energy, including $3.2 billion for  energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to spur good-paying  jobs and lower costs for the middle class.   Importantly, our bill responsibly funds our nuclear deterrent and  enhances nonproliferation efforts.   In sum, the energy and water division builds forward for America's  critical goals. Our bill invests in the hardworking men and women who  make, build, and grow America. Now more than ever, our bill is needed  to unleash American progress in this new century.   Finally, as chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I want to  highlight the Congress' swift and essential support for Ukraine. On a  bipartisan basis, it is this House, as Article 1 of the Constitution,  that has always led on providing aid to Ukraine. The $13.6 billion in  emergency funding includes vital resources for Ukraine and her brave  people to meet their urgent economic and humanitarian needs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure  unanimously.                                time  2030
