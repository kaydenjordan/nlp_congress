 Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee not only for yielding me time, but for all her scholarship and all  of her commitment to making a difference against sex trafficking.   Mr. Chair, today is a proud day for me. I am proud to stand here on  this House floor to urge the support and passage of the Allow States  and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, known as FOSTA, as  well as the Walters amendment.   Human trafficking and sex trafficking is happening in all areas: big  cities, little cities, rural and suburban areas, Democratic districts,  Republican districts. It happens in every congressional district in  America, regardless of whether that district is red or blue.   Trafficking, Mr. Chair, is a nonpartisan issue, and that requires  bipartisan solutions. And if Congressman Poe were still here, I would  add, ``And that is just the way it is.''   I am so honored to be joined today with so many colleagues. I also  want to thank Congresswoman Roby for her leadership in managing the  time. What an honor it is for me to join the leadership of  Congresswoman Ann Wagner, not only the sponsor of this bill, but a  friend, a colleague, someone who is my classmate. And early on, she  started talking about human trafficking, and we shared our mutual  interest; and we have been, so to say, joined at the hip ever since.  And I could not thank her enough for all of her leadership.   Mr. Chair, it tells you that we must work together. Congresswoman  Wagner has done that with this legislation and more. So I am very  honored to be the lead Democrat. You have heard what the Fighting  Online Sex Trafficking Act will do, so I won't go in great details with  that again. But I will tell you, it will address a critical problem.   Our laws have not kept pace with how technology has been used to  exploit the innocent. The internet has changed how humans are  trafficked. It has taken something that was once done in the streets  and made it easier and more anonymous. Trafficking online is a well- documented problem, yet we have seen a few websites turn a blind eye,  even as they profit on the buying and the selling of children, women,  and men.   FOSTA will help solve this in many ways, as you have heard. On this  last point, I would like to say FOSTA is targeted in a way that will  not only affect websites engaged in the online trafficking trade; it  will recognize some of the concerns that some of the tech communities  initially raised. But I think that the process that FOSTA has gone  through in the Judiciary Committee and now with the Walters amendment  shows how the legislative process can be used.    It shows how the legislative process can be used to  result in a better product. The bill now has the support not only of  the trafficking victims' advocates, but also of law enforcement and  many of the internet and tech companies.   So, again, I thank the hard work of Congresswoman Wagner. I want to  say that we won't solve the problem of human trafficking overnight, but  if we get this bill signed into law, we will make it harder for  traffickers to exploit the innocent and we will keep countless  children, women, and men out of the cycle of abuse.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. More  importantly, I thank her for her amendment. As the lead Democrat  sponsor of this bill, I proudly join her with that amendment.   Like my colleague Congresswoman Roby said, it is always good when you  have a great bill that you can have an amendment that asks for a study  to make sure that it is effective.                                time  1530    Lastly, let me just say, I thank the Congresswoman for sharing those  stories, whether it is the story of Cathy, whether it is the story of  Erika, or in my district, Theresa, it makes me proud to stand with her.  And I thank her not only for this amendment but for her work in  judiciary because what we know her amendment will do, it will protect  the innocent.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member, Congresswoman  Maxine Waters, for yielding me time and also for her steadfast  leadership in opposing the Financial CHOICE Act and many of the  provisions included in the bill, including the one that we are  considering on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, this bill flies in the face of the old maxim: Those who  do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.   This bill would effectively blindfold our regulators when calculating  operational risk capital at our largest institutions--it is worth  repeating again: not our community banks, but our largest  financial institutions--by precluding them from looking at an  institution's historic losses as an indicator of possible future  losses.    Now, earlier, the ranking member injected an example of asking about  our credit scores. I think it is worth elaborating on this, Mr.  Speaker. Imagine if I go to a bank for a mortgage loan and they ask me  for my credit score, and I simply told them they couldn't look at my  past financial behavior in order to decide whether or not they are  going to give me the loan.   So when you talk about good or commonsense regulation, we all know  the answer to that question, Mr. Speaker.   Well, this bill would effectively do just that to our regulators.  Instead of a credit score, which determines creditworthiness,  operational risk determines the risk of loss resulting from inadequate  or failed internal processes, people, and systems.   I would tell our regulators, when determining the appropriate level  of capital a financial institution needs to hold against operational  risk, you cannot look at an institution's past losses, especially if  they got out of that business.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is common sense. I think whether you are a  banker or a regulator, you clearly understand that we need to make sure  that we don't blindfold our regulators.   So I oppose this bill, which would reduce capital in our country's  largest financial institutions and blindfold our regulators' ability to  safeguard the stability of our economy. I urge all of my colleagues to  vote ``no.''                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  this time.   Maybe I should try to right that wrong analogy that our chairman  thought; but maybe if I take his analogy that it is not based on the  house I sold but it is based on the house I am living in, well, what is  the difference?   If I went to the bank and wanted to put my house up for collateral  but I hadn't paid the payment on it in 4 months and it was getting  ready to be foreclosed on, I think they would want to know that. And  that would be maybe a better analogy on it, because what we are trying  to say to the people who are out there watching and listening to this:  You cannot let our larger banks put us at risk, what we know also  happened in 2008.   So that was the point I was making. So let's say the analogies don't  work so we don't have to go back and forth. Let me just say that I am  voting ``no'' on this because I don't want to blindfold or tie the  hands of the regulators' being able to do their jobs.
