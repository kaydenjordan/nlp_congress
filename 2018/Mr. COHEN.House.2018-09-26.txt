 Mr. Speaker, the soul of our country is in jeopardy and in  question. It couldn't be more directly seen than in the Senate on  Thursday with the hearings for Judge Kavanaugh.   The two most pressing issues that will be heard are the #MeToo  movement and respect for women and their safety from sexual assault,  and the  [[Page H8896]]  truth and whether or not the truth is something that matters to people  anymore or whether it is just spinning lies to get ratings.   The man who has been nominated to the Supreme Court went on FOX News  and said he didn't drink illegally when he was 18 years old. Well, he  did. The drinking age was 21.   The lady who accuses him has passed a lie detector test administered  by a former FBI agent and has told more than four or five different  people about this incident over the last 6 years, which has been very  difficult for her. She should be given respect, and there should be an  attempt to find the truth.   But the third person in that incident has not been subpoenaed by the  Senate, because they don't want to know the truth. They fear the truth.  They are keeping the truth from the American people, and they are  failing in respecting women.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member DeFazio and Chairman  Shuster for their excellent efforts to work out this compromise on the  FAA reauthorization and finding consensus with our Senate counterparts.  I am glad to have successfully included four important measures in the  final package.   Special thanks to Senator Nelson and Ranking Member DeFazio for  keeping in many key Democratic priorities that support labor, airports,  and consumers; and, most notably, preserve the safety of the flying  public.   I should comment that the SEAT Act, which I am most proud of, a 3- year effort that I worked on with Adam Kinzinger, was accepted by voice  vote in committee. I thank Mr. Shuster for that. It is a watershed  moment for safety for the flying public. We have never before been  forced to regulate seat sizes, but the reality is, the safety of the  flying public is at risk unless we do.   Representative Kinzinger and I worked on this to see to it that we  put an end to the shrinking sizes of seats on airplanes through the  SEAT Act, or the Safe Egress in Air Travel Act, so it would become law.   Americans have become larger. Seats have become smaller. They have  become more dangerous. There needs to be a study on the width and the  pitch of seats to make sure that they are safe to be evacuated within  the approximate 90 seconds they are supposed to be able to evacuate a  plane. Flyers Rights and the National Consumers League also supported  this.   I would like to thank Senators Blumenthal, Markey, Warner, and  Whitehouse, and others. I look forward to voting for this bill, and I  encourage everybody to vote for it.                                time  1430
