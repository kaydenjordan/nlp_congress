 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 497, the  Freedom for Health Care Workers Act.   Mr. Speaker, this is not about political points. This is about  freedom. Our workers in the healthcare industry fight every day on the  front line for us. These precious workers should never have been placed  in this position to choose between a forced medical procedure and  losing their employment.   Today, we are going to vote on this bill. I will tell you the story  of Melissa Thomas from my district. Melissa lives in Cass County,  Missouri. She is a nurse who has served her community for more than 40  years. When CMS, a government bureaucracy, implemented the vaccine  mandate, Melissa was presented with three different outrageous choices:  to fight for her job, to comply with the mandate, or be forced out of  the medical field entirely.   Ultimately, Melissa fought. She was granted an exemption, but  Melissa's story does not hold true for thousands  [[Page H547]]  of frontline workers, workers who were forced out of their jobs, where  they worked for years to protect us.   Today, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill to end this mandate, to  take a stand. This is a stand for freedom.
