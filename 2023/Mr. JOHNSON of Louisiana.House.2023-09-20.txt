 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rogers and  Representative Jackson for their important work on this really critical  issue.  [[Page H4422]]    Mr. Speaker, historically, Americans have transitionally held the  most positive view of the U.S. military among all of our institutions,  but something changed last year. Right now, less than half of Americans  now have a great deal of confidence and trust in the military.   You want to know why? The reason stated is because the military  leadership has become overly politicized. They are addressing issues  that don't have anything to do with our national defense.   The best example of that probably is Secretary Austin's policy of  reimbursing travel expenses for servicemembers seeking an abortion.   The law is clear, as the chairman has stated. Title 10, section 1093,  explicitly prohibits funds available to the DOD from being used to  perform abortions.   The statute was drafted, passed, and signed into law by the people's  duly elected representatives. This politicized Department of Defense  has decided to create a workaround.   Thankfully, the House-passed NDAA will end this lawlessness. We have  to stand for that. The House has spoken on the issue, and the House's  position is very clear.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this motion to instruct.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, this week House Republicans  will pass a resolution condemning the actions of New Mexico Governor,  Michelle Lujan Grisham, a former Member of this body.   Late on a Friday night earlier this month, the Governor took action  to suspend open carry and concealed firearms in her State. Yeah, you  heard that right. She claimed so-called emergency powers to combat a  public health crisis, she said, and on a whim, she attempted to  restrict the Second Amendment rights of every law-abiding New Mexico  resident, the citizens of her State, the citizens of this country.   Her action, of course, was overtly unconstitutional. It is  functionally useless, and it will only divide Americans further.  Someone with elementary-level knowledge of the Constitution would, of  course, know this. Fortunately, New Mexico residents and law  enforcement openly defied her order, and it was panned by lawmakers  across the country, even some of our Democratic colleagues in this  body.   Mr. Speaker, here is the interesting thing I wanted to note today: It  is ironic that Attorney General Merrick Garland was here on the Hill  and has been in the Judiciary Committee in an oversight hearing for the  last several hours. He is America's top law enforcement officer in  charge, of course, of our top law enforcement agency, the Department of  Justice. One would think that this type of issue, this event in New  Mexico, regardless of the politics, that that is something the DOJ  might intervene in, but they haven't.   Now, by principle, of course, we are conservatives, and we believe in  less Federal Government intervention. The less the Federal Government  is involved in State affairs, the better overall. But this is not the  case. In this situation, the issue here is the DOJ's selective  application of justice and its clear targeting of red States for  passing laws that its duly elected Representatives voted for.   Think about these few examples.   In 2021, the DOJ sued the State of Georgia for passing election  integrity reform. That suit failed, and Georgia had record voter  turnout just a year later.   Months later, the DOJ sued the State of Texas over laws--your State,  Mr. Speaker--passed to protect unborn children. The Supreme Court  refused to intervene, and statistics show that abortions in Texas have  plummeted, thankfully, as a result.   Earlier this year, the DOJ sued the State of Tennessee for a ban on  child sex change procedures. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals  rejected the suit, and now it is State law.   The DOJ, Attorney General Garland in particular, has displayed a  penchant for filing public lawsuits against red States for passing  conservative policy through their democratically elected legislature.  They do so with weak charges, based on unconstitutional arguments on  cases they know they cannot win, but that is not the point. They have  politicized the DOJ.   Here is the big question. Given those examples and the trend of this  Department of Justice, why hasn't Merrick Garland hosted a press  conference or announced a Federal lawsuit into the State of New Mexico  for arbitrarily suspending the constitutional rights of its citizens?   I will tell you why. It is no secret. It is because New Mexico's  action serves the Biden administration's stated political goals.   The DOJ will sue red States for passing conservative policy, while  turning a blind eye to Democrat Governors who unilaterally curtail  constitutional rights. They will put grandmothers behind bars for  protesting abortion but refuse to prosecute violent offenders who  actually attack the pro-life pregnancy centers. They will prosecute  President Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents, but  they give President Biden a complete pass for even worse infractions.   When we say the DOJ has been weaponized, this is exactly what we are  talking about, and this is what the American people see.   Mr. Speaker, today the House Judiciary Committee, as I mentioned,  asked Attorney General Garland about these questions and many more.  Right now, 65 percent of the American people have no faith in the  Department of Justice. It is because of his leadership. He has eroded  the rule of law. He has destroyed public trust in an essential American  institution.   I used my time this morning, I was the first questioner on our side  in Judiciary, and I asked the Attorney General about the DOJ's Hunter  Biden investigation. This is a big question on the minds of my  constituents and most of ours around the country.   I asked him plainly:         Have you had personal contact with anyone at FBI       headquarters about the Hunter Biden investigation?''        His answer was, I don't recollect the answer to that       question.        Really?        Okay. Let me get this straight, I told him, the Attorney       General of the United States cannot remember if he discussed       an FBI investigation into the son of the sitting President of       the United States? That is your testimony under oath?  [[Page H4431]]         Yes, it is, he said.    It is extraordinary.   Mr. Speaker, frankly, we didn't expect full transparency today from  this Attorney General. He and his top DOJ lieutenants have shown us,  they have demonstrated over and over that they hold no regard for the  rule of law and really are just acting as political hatchet men  protecting their boss, President Biden.    The Attorney General was clearly unwilling or unable to provide the  essential answers that we needed today. We will continue to press for  them. That is our job. That is our constitutional duty on Judiciary to  provide oversight over the DOJ.   Mr. Speaker, we have a great lineup of Members here to speak this  afternoon on some very important topics to the country.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. He is  exactly right. We had no choice but to proceed to the impeachment  inquiry phase because that is where the evidence has led us, as you  noted. We have a responsibility. Article II, Section 4 of the  Constitution says very clearly that a President shall be removed from  office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, high  crimes and misdemeanors. We have credible allegations of a number of  those infractions. Bribery is one of them. High crimes and misdemeanors  are another. We have mounds of evidence now stacking up to support  those allegations, so we do not have a choice under the Constitution  but to proceed accordingly, and that is what we will do. We will do our  constitutional duty.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens), my  good friend and Super Bowl champion.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. That  was well said.   If time permitted today, I am sure we would have every Republican in  the Conference come to the floor and speak to the same issue because it  is so outrageous that we have this trampling upon some of our most  fundamental freedoms; the Second Amendment, of course, being among  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman and former mayor from Texas  (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend; that was  well said.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, very well said by the  gentleman.   Look, let's hasten to say we take no pleasure in this. There are a  lot of big challenges that the country needs to fix. We don't want to  spend time and resources investigating the President, impeaching a  President.   Next to declaring war, this is the heaviest power that we have in the  House of Representatives, but Article I of the Constitution does give  us the ``sole power of impeachment'' here.   We have no choice in the matter. Given the evidence, given the  allegations, we have to pursue it, and we will. We are often asked: Why  is the House majority, why are the House Republicans spending so much  time investigating? If we had not done these investigations, we  wouldn't have all of this evidence.   Why?   It goes back to the theme of what I was saying earlier: The  Department of Justice is simply not doing its job. Under normal  circumstances, the DOJ would be investigating all these allegations of  corruption but they simply looked the other way.   As I noted earlier, Attorney General Garland, who is just now leaving  the Committee on the Judiciary, he has been here all day, has abused  the Department to pursue political agendas. He has sued conservative  States over their local policies. He has raided the home of President  Biden's main political opponent. The Department is obstructing at the  same time the Hunter Biden investigation and impeding the House's  impeachment inquiry into President Biden.   What are we to do?   I was home on the August district work period. I was doing townhalls  in my district in Louisiana, and I will tell you that at every venue,  the number one question everybody has is: When will there be  accountability?   I mentioned earlier that 65 percent of Americans now have no faith.  They  [[Page H4433]]  don't trust the Department of Justice. We are losing faith in our  institutions because the people do not see accountability. They don't  see a fair system of justice. They see a two-tiered system of justice.   It is frightening. You cannot maintain a Constitutional republic if  the people do not trust the system of justice. They don't believe it is  fair. They don't believe that they are going to get a fair shake, that  every American, regardless of who they are, is going to have equal  justice under law. That is the threat right now. There is nothing more  serious than that.   Mr. Speaker, we will pursue the truth, and we will follow it wherever  it leads and try to return that accountability to the people.   Mr. Speaker, I end the Special Order hour here, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
