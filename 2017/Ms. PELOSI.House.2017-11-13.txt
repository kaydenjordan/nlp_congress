 Mr. Speaker, the resolution rightfully expresses the  urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Yemen, which  remains a stain of the conscience of the world.   The resolution condemns violations of international law and  specifically denounces those actions taken by Iran that are illegal.  Saudi Arabia should also be subjected to that judgement.   When the resolution ``denounces the conduct of activities in Yemen  and areas affected by the conflict that are, directly or indirectly,  inconsistent with the laws of armed conflict, including the deliberate  targeting of civilian populations or the use of civilians as human  shields'' and ``calls on all parties to the conflict to allow for  unobstructed access for humanitarian organizations, human rights  investigators, medical relief personnel, and journalists,'' those calls  should apply both to the Iranians and to the Saudis.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, November 1, 2017,  the previous question is ordered on the resolution.   The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
