Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1294.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1294, the Protecting  American Intellectual Property Act of 2021.   The United States of America has the most innovative people,  researchers, and companies in the world. In the depths of the pandemic,  American government research institutes partnered with private sector  companies to create the world's best vaccines. These miracles of modern  medicine have saved millions of lives here at home and tens of millions  of people around the world. From weapons systems to enterprise software  and semiconductor design to smart phones, America is at the leading  edge of the technological frontier.   Innovation is crucial to our health, our wealth, and our security.  But many of the benefits we reap from research and development go out  the window if thieves can literally steal our intellectual property  without cost or consequence. While trade remedies and criminal statutes  can be applied to intellectual property theft, they have proven  incapable of stemming the flow of digital hacks and in-person espionage  against our Nation. We need a true systemic deterrent, and this  legislation is a crucial part of the solution.   By creating an authorized and codified sanctions regime for  intellectual property violators, we are letting the world know that  would-be hackers, digital pickpockets, and copycats of the world know  that their actions will draw a forceful response from the United States  Government.   The sanctions regime laid out in this bill are modeled off of several  sections of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.  The bill is very clear: sanctions against IP violators are mandatory  and will be imposed. The bill also provides appropriate flexibility to  the executive branch and allows the President to choose from an array  of travel, procurement, and financial sanctions to impose upon IP- violating foreign businesses. In other words, the President will have  the flexibility to impose more targeted or even tougher sanctions  depending upon the scale and significance of the IP theft in question.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and I strongly ask  all of my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for his statement because this is  truly a bipartisan effort trying to make sure that we preserve American  ingenuity and American leadership on intellectual property and not have  it stolen.    Madam Speaker, I was moved last night in this very Chamber by the  statements of President Zelenskyy, which were really inspiring and  important to me. I got tied up, I wanted to talk about this bill. This  bill is important. I also thought it was important that right before,  this we had a conversation about S. 4240, the Justice for Victims of  War Crimes Act. No, it is not completely relevant, but on this it has  some connection.   On February 24 of this year, Russia launched its full-scale invasion  of Ukraine. With each passing day since, the world has witnessed in  horror as Putin's forces brutalize the Ukrainian people.   We have seen Russian forces commit mass murder, target civilian areas  like schools and hospitals, forcibly transferring hundreds of  thousands, including young children to Russia. We have heard so many  testimonials about the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian  people during Russia's occupation.   What has happened in Ukraine shocks the conscience of humanity, and  the images of these atrocities are seared into our collective memory.   Yet, as of right now, if someone guilty of these war crimes were to  come to the United States, we would not have the jurisdiction to bring  them to justice. That important legislation, S. 4240, is saying that we  have got to bring them to justice because, as Dr. King said,  ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' So the United  States has to make sure that no one escapes justice simply by coming  through our borders and that anyone guilty of war crimes, regardless of  where they were committed, are held accountable.   Similarly, those that violate our intellectual property rights, they  can't just walk free and think that they can take our ingenuity, our  leadership, our advancement with reference to intellectual property,  and just take it and use it for anything.   It is the same kind of thing with the transfer of weapons or anything  of that nature.   We have got to stand and show that we are serious. We are serious  about those victims of war crimes and we are just as serious about  those individuals who violate our intellectual property rights. We have  got to make sure that they are all held accountable and that they  understand that there will be consequences if, in fact, there are  violations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The lifeblood of the American economy is innovation, and individuals  and companies that steal our trade secrets and pickpocket our patents  are doing no less than undermining the health of this Nation. It is  time that we impose real costs on intellectual property thieves, and  that is exactly what this bill does.   I, again, thank my friend and colleague,   Joe Wilson. I thank  Ranking Member McCaul for working in a bipartisan way on this committee  as we combat some of these ills that are facing our Nation by those who  mean us or democracy no good.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation. Let's send it to the President's desk and let the world  know we will not tolerate the theft of our intellectual property.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
