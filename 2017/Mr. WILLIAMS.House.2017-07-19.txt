 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to speak on  behalf of H.R. 2910, Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of  Natural Gas Pipelines Act, and the potential impact it could have on  our Nation.   Right now, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, is the  lead agency for coordinating required reviews and authorizations for  interstate natural gas pipelines. In order to start a pipeline project,  you need multiple permits from a variety of platforms as well as  coordination from Federal, State, and local governments.   As history has shown us time and time again, a multistep approval  process just does not work. Mixing three different levels of government  has and always will be a recipe for total disaster. It makes for  unnecessary delays that are caused by too many cooks in the kitchen.   I fully support my friend and colleague Representative Bill Flores'  bill that will promote more timely and efficient reviews. We need to  strengthen FERC's lead agency role that it was designed to create  accountability and transparency.   Overall, this bill will encourage more timely and efficient reviews  and keep energy prices affordable for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, I  urge all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.   In God we trust.
