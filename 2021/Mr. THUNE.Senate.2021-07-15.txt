 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks before the vote.    Madam President, it didn't take long. Just a year since  ``defund the police'' became a rallying cry and cities started cutting  money from police budgets, crime is surging.   At the beginning of June, the New York Times reported:         Homicide rates in large cities were up more than 30 percent       on average last year, and up another 24 percent for the       beginning of this year.    Homicides are up in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los  Angeles, Columbus; and the list goes on. And it isn't only homicide  rates that have risen. During the first 4 months of the year, Los  Angeles saw a 73-percent increase in shootings.   As of the end of May, Portland, OR, which has been ravaged by violent  riots over the past year, was on track to exceed 1,000 shootings for  this year, as compared to 389 in 2019.   A Washington Examiner piece from June reported:         Through the first 14 weeks of this year, New York City saw       an 81 percent increase in shootings, the highest number of       shootings during the same time period since 2002. Robberies,       grand larcenies, felony assaults, and shootings have all       increased in April and May compared to last year.    San Francisco has seen a surge in car break-ins, among other crimes,  with the San Francisco Chronicle reporting in June that ``last month,  the Police Department's Central Station saw a 753 percent increase in  auto burglaries compared to the previous May.''   In Oakland, CA, carjackings are up almost 88 percent, shootings are  up 70 percent, and homicides are up 90 percent.   Unfortunately, I could go on all day. The crime surge is real, and it  is frightening. I quoted a lot of statistics and percentages, but there  are real people behind every one of those crimes--people whose lives  have been cut short or ravaged by violence, people whose sense of  safety has been destroyed.   It turns out that--surprise--defunding the police is a terrible idea.  It is no coincidence at all that cities that have slashed their police  budgets have seen huge increases in violence. Some of them are even  recognizing the mistake they made and seeking to restore the funding  that they cut. A Fox Business piece reports:         Cities like New York City, Oakland, Baltimore, Minneapolis,       and Los Angeles are planning to reinstate tens of millions       for the construction of new police precincts, increase police       department budgets, among other plans to bankroll more       efforts to confront the uptick in crime.    Unfortunately, the problem won't necessarily be fixed that easily  because ``defund the police'' rhetoric has not just resulted in smaller  police budgets; it has also resulted in police demoralization and left  departments worried about deploying officers to do their jobs. It has  resulted in a wave of police retirements and resignations.   The New York Times reports:         Thousands of police officers nationwide have headed for the       exits in the past year. A survey of almost 200 police       departments indicated that retirements were up 45 percent and       resignations rose by 18 percent in the year from April 2020       to April 2021 when compared with the previous 12 months.    That is from the New York Times.   The city of Asheville, NC, has lost one-third of its police force-- one-third, Mr. President. It is not surprising. It turns out that when  you spend months vilifying police officers and demonizing them for  doing their jobs, some of them no longer want to stay. This is perhaps  the worst consequence of the ``defund the police'' movement.   Cutting police budgets is not a good idea, but resources and  equipment can be built back up again, sometimes fairly quickly. It is a  lot harder to replace good seasoned officers with years of experience  protecting public safety. While it would be hard to replace them at any  time, it is particularly hard today because it is difficult to imagine  why anyone would want to become a police officer right now. Why would  good men and women sign up for a job where they are regularly  characterized as the worst kind of criminals? Why would they sign up  knowing they may  [[Page S4915]]  be prevented from or punished for doing the job we ask them to do?   Violence against police officers--always a danger--is up. The  sickening scene of protesters shouting ``death to police'' outside a  hospital where two ambushed law enforcement officers were fighting for  their lives has to be emblazoned on the minds of police officers  nationwide. Again I ask, why would anyone want to join the police under  these conditions?   The ``defund the police'' movement is not only costing us many good  officers today, it has depleted the pool of good officers for the  future, and that is a travesty.   The unfortunate truth is, the Democrats bear a substantial amount of  responsibility for the situation we find ourselves in because this is a  party that either actively contributed to the ``defund the police''  rhetoric or implicitly endorsed it by largely staying silent, not to  mention the less-than-censorious attitude the Democrats frequently  displayed when it came to the violence and property destruction of last  summer and the past year.   California Representative Maxine Waters said protesters in  Minneapolis this April should ``get more confrontational'' should the  verdict in the Chauvin trial not go their way.   Far-left Members of the House of Representatives spent the past year  making statements like these:         Policing in our country is inherently and intentionally       racist.        No more policing, incarceration, and militarization.    Now, more mainstream Democrats have become wise to the fact that  their party's association with the ``defund the police'' movement may  threaten their electoral chances next year. As polling demonstrated,  Americans are squarely against the idea of defunding the police. So the  President and other Democratic leaders all of a sudden announced their  concern about surging crime, but they are still trying to have their  cake and eat it, too, because missing from their messaging is any real  condemnation of ``defund the police'' rhetoric and the terrible toll it  has taken on our cities and police departments.    In fact, President Biden, who is currently trying to reinvent himself  as tough on crime, filled key roles in the Department of Justice with  individuals who have gone on record with their support for defunding  the police. President Biden's Secretary of Labor actually cut police  funding while serving as Boston's mayor, and his Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development has suggested that we should consider decreasing  police budgets.   Democrats' actual crime-fighting plans are long on punishing gun  dealers and gun manufacturers and short on actually going after  criminals. The President's nominee to head the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives seems more interested in targeting  law-abiding gun owners than in dealing with the surge in gun crime.   I have one last point to make about the ``defund the police''  movement, and that is its fundamental injustice. Are there bad police  officers out there? Of course there are. There are bad teachers out  there, too, and bad social workers and bad small businessmen. But just  as it would be outrageous to demonize all teachers because of a few bad  apples in their profession, it is outrageous to demonize the hundreds  of thousands of dedicated men and women defending public safety in this  country because of a handful of bad offers.   We owe our men and women in law enforcement a great debt--a debt we  can't even fully comprehend. These men and women go out and risk their  lives every day of the week, every month of the year, to keep us safe.  But they don't just risk their lives; they also bear a heavy physical  and emotional burden. Most of us go about our daily lives without  having to confront much evil because our law enforcement officers go  out every day to confront it for us. They confront violence so that we  don't have to, and they pay a price. It is tough to have to see evil on  a daily basis, to spend years rescuing children who are in trouble or  supporting victims of violence or bringing rapists to justice, but it  is a price most of them are glad to pay. They signed up to protect the  innocent, to keep the public safe and evil at bay, and they are proud  to do it. We owe them and their families our profound gratitude.   It is abhorrent that anti-police rhetoric has become such an accepted  part of our national conversation and has been winked at or endorsed by  so many Democratic leaders. We owe our police officers much better.   I hope the belated realization among some that police officers are  essential to keeping our communities safe will spell the end of the  ``defund the police'' movement. It is time to focus on protecting  public safety and honoring men and women who spend every day working to  promote it.   I yield the floor.
