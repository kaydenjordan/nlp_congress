 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the work of  Reverend Jesse Jackson as he steps down as president of Rainbow PUSH  Coalition.   Reverend Jackson has fearlessly fought for the rights of marginalized  communities, serving as a beacon of hope and inspiration for millions.   His Presidential campaign in 1988 was a defining moment, not only for  our brothers and sisters in the African-American community, but for all  Americans who believed in a more inclusive society.   Jesse Jackson has taught us many lessons, among them, that political  empowerment is vital to improving our communities. He has encouraged  countless individuals to exercise their fundamental right to vote and  ensure that every voice is heard and every vote is counted.   There is no doubt that his relentless pursuit with the Rainbow  Coalition played a crucial role in the election of Congressman Harold  Washington as Chicago's first progressive and Black mayor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Jackson for his lifelong commitment to  civil rights and his role in helping shape our country's politics to  reflect its diversity.                            ____________________
