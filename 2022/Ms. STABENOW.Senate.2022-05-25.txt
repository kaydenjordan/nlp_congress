 Madam President, I had originally, before yesterday,  planned to speak today at length about the fact that in 36 days  children across the country are going to lose healthy meals they have  been getting in the summer, as well as meals during the school year,  and schools are going to be put in a very difficult situation--up to  one-third of the schools may not be able to offer school meals at all.   So that was my intent in coming to the floor, but after what  happened, the horrible situation in Texas, 19 more children, a teacher,  a grandma dying, now I wonder if it is how many more kids will be  killed in the next 36 days.   We don't have to live like this. We don't have to live like this  where we are begging for 8 more Republicans to join us, 52 of us, who  want to make sure kids get healthy meals. We don't have to live like  that, and we don't have to live in a situation where parents are  afraid--where people are afraid to go to their place of worship or they  are afraid to go to the grocery store, where they are afraid to just  live because of some random shooting by somebody who got a hold of a-- of a gun, a military assault weapon or didn't have to go through a  background check and went to a gun show or whatever it is, whatever it  is that is causing the carnage in our country related to guns and mass  shootings.   It is not happening in other countries--it is not happening in other  countries, and they have as many challenges as we do. But in other  countries, that may be somebody going into school with a knife and the  kids get hurt, but they live. Here, it is assault weapons. It is  shooting children indiscriminately in an elementary school. We don't  have to live like this. We don't have to live like this.   The question is, how many Republicans would join us to save  children's lives from gun violence? How many? Can we just get started?  You know, Leader Schumer has put two bills on the calendar related to  background checks: the bipartisan Background Checks Act--closing the  gun show loophole, requiring background checks for gun purchases made  through private unlicensed dealers--and the Enhanced Background Checks  Act, which would provide a national background check system, enough  time to thoroughly review gun sales.    Now, these are not controversial. Neither is feeding children by the  way. These are not controversial. Ninety percent of the public says,  duh, of course, of course.   Now, the folks that don't want us to do it are the folks that make  the guns. They make a lot of money. They are trying to pit us against  each other. They put out all kinds of crazy theories. They are funding  our Republican colleagues to stop anything from happening because, God  forbid, if the profits of the gun manufacturers would go down because  maybe there were a few less guns that were on the street.   This is not rocket science. We know what to do. I grew up in a  northern Michigan community surrounded by legal gun ownership--my own  family, my friends, my relatives. You know when the assault weapon ban  went in for 10 years, nobody in my family stopped hunting. Nobody in my  family had to say, oh, well, we can't do what we want to do because  military assault weapons aren't available.   That was put in by Democrats. It was then repealed by Republicans.  And we saw violence--violent shootings that had gone down tremendously,  suddenly go up. So there is a lot of different things that we could do.  And the question is, will we come together on any of them? Will we  start with comprehensive background checks? That is the question.   Will we have Republicans joining us? Every action we take--or  inaction--relates to our values, and it relates to our will to do it.   We can do anything if we want to do it. I mean, last week we came  together on this floor to address baby formula for the WIC program, and  we did it together. It was great. One of the fastest things I have ever  seen move through here, and I appreciate that. I appreciate Senator  Boozman joining me in that.   But why can't we then extend that, first of all, to making sure in  the summer, kids get healthy food that they are going to start losing  in 36 days and that during the school year we are supporting our  schools to provide healthy meals for all of our children in a time of  supply chain breakdowns, costs going up.   And what happens when we start hearing in the fall from those schools  that have to stop all school meals because somehow we couldn't come  together and prioritize feeding children?   And on top of that--I mean, I hate to say feeding children is, you  know--all of this is important, but their lives--we can't even come  together around basic commonsense measures that will begin to address  what is happening with the random shootings and the killings of our  babies, of our children. We can do better than this. We have to do  better than this. We have to do better than this.   We only need 10 Republicans--we need 8 Republicans to help us feed  healthy kids in the summer and on into the--give kids healthy meals  this summer and in the fall, 8. We only need 10, we only need 10  Republicans to join us on background checks, closing the gun show  loophole.   We don't need everybody. We don't need everybody. Some folks can go  run and stand with the gun manufacturers and what has become incredibly  extreme NRA dangerous positions.   Folks, we just need 10--10 people to stand up and go: This is too  much. This has gone too far. We can do better than this.   Because if not now, what is the number? I would like to ask Leader  McConnell, what is the number?   How many children will he describe and how much sympathy will he show  for dead children on the floor of the U.S. Senate before it is enough?  How many? One hundred more? Two hundred more? A thousand more? When is  it enough, when too many children have been killed? When is it enough?   It is past enough right now. We can do better than this for our kids,  and I hope this is the moment that Republicans in the U.S. Senate will  step up and join us.                            ____________________     As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the following  bills, en bloc: Calendar No. 185, H.R. 767; Calendar No. 186, H.R.  1170; Calendar No. 187, H.R. 1444, Calendar No. 189, S. 2932; Calendar  No. 325, S. 3825; Calendar No.  [[Page S2679]]  326, S. 3826; Calendar No. 328, H.R. 735; Calendar No. 329, H.R. 1298;  Calendar No. 330, H.R. 2324; Calendar No. 332, H.R. 3579; Calendar No.  333, H.R. 3613; and Calendar No. 334, H.R. 4168.
