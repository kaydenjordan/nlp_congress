 Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member for yielding and  also for his steadfast commitment to protecting the health and well- being of all Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which  would advance the repeal of the Affordable Care Act without any  replacement in sight.   Let me be clear. This resolution would wipe away health care from 30  million Americans and raise premiums for millions more. It would also  create chaos through our community and our economy and our Nation. It  would put the insurance companies back in charge.   It is not just the Affordable Care Act that is on the chopping block.  Republicans also want to cut women's reproductive health care. Once  again, they want to defund Planned Parenthood, one of the Nation's  leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for women and  families. Women would be denied breast cancer screenings and preventive  health care. Community clinics in rural and urban communities would be  devastated.   We know that Planned Parenthood is one of the Nation's leading  providers of high-quality, affordable health care for women and their  families. Denying access to healthcare providers such as Planned  Parenthood will hurt women who need these services the most: low-income  women and women of color. That is why I offered an amendment to protect  these critical services. Shamefully, the Rules Committee refused to  make it in order and even allow for a debate on this floor.   I also cosponsored the amendment with Representative Pocan and others  within the Congressional Progressive Caucus opposing cuts to Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security benefits. Republicans refused to allow a  debate on this critical issue as well.   The most vulnerable--the poor, seniors, and disabled individuals-- would be left to fend for themselves, and their lives would be  shattered through these Republican cuts.   Mr. Chairman, we must stand up for the millions of people who have  coverage because the Affordable Care Act really does save lives. It is  a disgrace; Republicans continue to raise this war to kill the ACA  without replacing it.   Once again, it will hurt the most vulnerable. People will be sicker  again.  [[Page H498]]  America will be sick again. This is a matter of life and death.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the anniversary of the  devastating earthquake that struck the nation of Haiti on January 12,  2010. This Thursday marked 7 years since a magnitude 7.0 earthquake  struck Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, killing Haiti's population  center and the seat of its government.   The aftermath of the quake was unimaginable. 316,000 people perished,  and 1.3 million were displaced. This tragedy struck a nation already  hobbled by grinding poverty, health disparities, and food insecurity.  Approximately 147,000 people remain internally displaced in Haiti, with  countless others displaced outside IDP camps.  [[Page H535]]    The world and the American people, though, responded to the  earthquake with generosity. To date, the United States has contributed  billions to recovery efforts, along with donors from around the world.   The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act, which was a bipartisan effort  with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and was signed into law 3 years  ago, provides us critical oversight to ensure that aid continues in the  most effective way possible.   Unfortunately, more work needs to be done. Haiti continues to be  struck by natural disasters, including severe drought and devastating  effects of Hurricane Matthew in 2016.                            ____________________
