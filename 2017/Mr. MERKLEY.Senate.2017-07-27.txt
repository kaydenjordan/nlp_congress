 Madam President, the first three words of our  Constitution are ``We the People.'' Indeed, our entire system was set  up to be a government which produces results of, by, and for the  people, but certainly right now, that is not what we are getting.   We are getting a secret plan which has not yet been put on this  floor, with a promise that there will be a debate in the middle of the  night--no chance for committee hearings on it, no chance to consult  with experts, no chance for us to go home and talk to our constituents.  This is about as far away from a deliberative democratic republic as  you can possibly get.   It makes us think of 1787, when Ben Franklin came out of the  Constitutional Convention and was stopped by someone in the crowd and  asked: What do we have--a monarchy or a republic?   He answered: A republic, if you can keep it.   Well, we are not keeping it right now through this secret, middle-of- the-night, non-consultative process. We are disgracing the notion that  our Founders fought for the ``we the people'' Republic.   This is something which touches so many Americans. We are not talking  about the weight limit on a highway. We are not talking about what  kinds of signs to post. We are talking about fundamental access to  healthcare.   If the rumors are right, my colleagues plan to bring forward a bill  that will blow up insurance on the exchange for millions of Americans.   An insurance pool is a little bit like a swimming pool. You tear a  hole in the side of a swimming pool, the water drains out and there are  only a few inches left, and the only people who would bother to go into  that depleted swimming pool would be those who really, really want to  swim. It is the same with the healthcare pool. The bill coming out  tonight, we are told, will rip a big hole in the side of the insurance  pool, and it will do so in a fashion that only those who have  preexisting conditions, only those who are sick, only those who are  old, will truly try to get that insurance. This means the price will be  driven up, and many of them can't afford it, so they will drop out. So  it means the pool will have even more people who are sick and older.  This is the death spiral.   My colleagues today are planning to put forward a bill tonight, we  are told, that creates a death spiral insurance. Who pays the price?  Who pays the price? Our Nation pays the price with an estimated 16  million people who would lose insurance. We are talking about those who  have every desire to have the peace of mind that if their loved one  gets sick, they will get the care they need. We are talking about  Americans who have every desire to know that if their loved one gets  injured, they won't end up bankrupt. But all of that is at risk  tonight.   A few moments ago, my colleague from Nebraska came to the floor, and  he started out by saying we need to ensure that the President doesn't  overstep his powers. Let's talk, too, about this Senate not destroying  its procedures designed to ensure a ``we the people'' republic, which  means we should all vote to send whatever bill comes out tonight to  committee, where it can be duly considered in a bipartisan fashion,  with experts, with consultation. In fact, my colleague from Arizona,  who came back and gave a dramatic and beautiful speech just 2 days ago,  said it should be considered by committee.   Let's work together to take whatever plan comes out tonight and put  it where it needs to be--in committee for due deliberation. This issue  touches too many lives. It is too core to the quality of life of our  fellow Americans. Let's not allow any bill to pass out of this Chamber  that would do so much destruction.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motions  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the  Record.
