 Madam Speaker, my heart breaks today. I say that  sincerely. My heart breaks to hear the words of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, who I respect highly for many reasons, who  disregard the fact that we are talking about life.   On this floor, we have talked about the need for formula this morning  for the same babies we are talking about. We have heard our Speaker  many times imploring us to do it for the children. Who are we talking  about today?   It breaks my heart to think that my colleagues don't trust women to  make decisions about life before life is conceived. It breaks my heart  to think that we don't hold men accountable to make decisions to love  our girls and women.   It breaks my heart that we would say this is a human right to take  life when our Declaration of Independence brought us into being with  unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   We are better than this. We have had 50 years of death. Think about  the over 100 years before that we applauded life.   Madam Speaker, it is time for us to stand for individuals taking  responsibilities that God has made us capable of, to decide for the  best interests of others, including those little children.   Why is the safest place on Earth today the maternity ward nursery in  a hospital, but not the womb?   We must change. H.R. 8296 is a bill of death, and it is a bill that  takes away responsibility for us, as adults, to do what we must do.                                time  1030
