 Mr. President, last week, Americans woke up to the news  that was perhaps not unexpected but still stunning.   It appears that in a matter of weeks, we may soon live in a country  where women have fewer constitutional rights than their parents or  grandparents.   In one bold move, the ultraconservative, activist majority on the  Supreme Court appears poised to erase the constitutional right to  choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.   I want to be clear: The leak of the majority draft opinion in Dobbs  v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is an unprecedented breach of  the Court's confidential deliberations. It may harm the trust the  Justices have with one another, as well as the public's trust in the  Court.   Still, one must wonder, Why is it that our Republican colleagues have  been focused so exclusively on the leak of the draft opinion rather  than the substance of the opinion itself? And why do we hear in the  last few days a continued reference to the security of Supreme Court  Justices without a real discussion of where the proposed opinion will  take us?   Let's make it clear--unequivocally clear--in a bipartisan fashion:  Violence is never acceptable. Violence is never acceptable against  Supreme Court Justices, their families, their staff, or anyone  associated with that branch of government.   Nor is violence acceptable on January 6, 2021, in this Chamber, when  the mob--the insurrectionist mob--leaving a Trump rally came here and  tried to stop the business of the U.S. Senate and the House of  Representatives, and we left as fast as we could move out the back door  to try to escape that. That was violence which led to five deaths and  the assaults on 150 members of law enforcement. That violence is  unacceptable as well, and I hope my friends on the other side of the  aisle, who vetoed an effort for a bipartisan commission to investigate  the violence of January 6, will step up now and say they were wrong.   Violence against a Supreme Court Justice, violence against a Member  of the House, and a Member of the Senate--none of those is acceptable,  period. Unequivocally. Period.   I am in favor of protecting the Justices, of course. I have been  party to efforts in my home State of Illinois, after a tragic incident  over 10 years ago, when a disgruntled client ended up killing a Federal  judge's mother and husband in their home.   Since then, I have called for more security, and I am glad to add my  name to this effort now to provide security to this Court and all the  members of the Court, their families, and the staff who are involved.   It is unacceptable. Violence, either in this building or across the  street, is unacceptable.   But I would like to speak as well to the substance of the statement  just made by the Senator from Texas.   He recalled the case of Kermit Gosnell, a case where a doctor in  Philadelphia was convicted, virtually of infanticide--repeated cases of  infanticide--and he was sentenced, ultimately, to life in prison, where  he still spends his time serving that out, with no chance of parole,  nor should he ever have a chance at parole.  [[Page S2391]]    I struggle to get the connection between the crime of infanticide and  the debate we are having, because there is nothing in the bill coming  to the floor by the Democrats which is going to change that basic  finding in the case in Pennsylvania.   That doctor, now removed from his profession and serving time in  Federal prison, was guilty of a crime, and the bill before us on the  floor of the Senate will not change that reality at all. I don't know  if that was the inference, but I took it to mean that. I hope I was  wrong.   We need to acknowledge the basics that a critical constitutional  right may be removed by the Supreme Court.   I am an amateur historian studying the history of this country. I  can't think of another time when a constitutionally guaranteed right by  Supreme Court opinion of over 50 years has been removed by the Court.  But that is what we face now--on the right of Americans to make the  most basic decisions about their health, their lives, and their future.   Sadly, many Republicans are desperately trying to deflect from this  ruling and what it means for every single American.   If the legal reason in the Court's draft opinion becomes final, that  decision in Dobbs will end a half-century guarantee that the right to  abortion is protected in our Constitution.   Republicans know that overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating access  to a woman's healthcare is extremely unpopular.   When asked point-blank whether we should do it, only 28 percent of  Americans say that they agree.   In a world without Roe, Americans would not only be denied healthcare  services they are entitled to, it is possible--it is possible--that  some will be prosecuted.   Far-right lawmakers have been feverishly anticipating this moment.  Over the past week, some of these same officials have introduced  legislation around the country designed to punish women for making the  basic decisions about reproductive health.   State legislators in Louisiana introduced a bill to allow prosecutors  to bring murder charges against a woman who undergoes or anyone who  provides an abortion.   The same Louisiana bill would seemingly call into question the  legality of in vitro fertilization, as well as IUDs, the morning after  pill, and other forms of emergency contraception.   I am glad I was on the floor a few minutes ago. My colleague, Senator  Duckworth, talked about her two little girls--cutest kids you can  imagine.   I remember those kids from the earliest time. When I was in a car  driving in the State of Illinois to an event in Bloomington, the phone  rang and it was Tammy Duckworth. She was my colleague in the U.S.  Senate and--she was going to be my colleague in the U.S. Senate, and  she was a Member of the House of Representatives, and she told me that  she was going to have a baby. I couldn't believe it.   Tammy and I have known one another since a few weeks after her, I  should say, terrible crash of the helicopter in Iraq. I had known what  she had gone through, surgeries and recovery, and I was the one who  encouraged her to run for office, and I am sure glad I did. She has  become the voice of the military, the voice of veterans, and one of  most powerful voices in the U.S. Senate.   And when she told the story about those two little girls, born  through the process of in vitro fertilization, it struck home.   I am fortunate enough as a grandfather to have two in vitro  grandbabies. I love them to pieces, and I thank goodness that there was  a science achievement available to help my daughter deliver those  beautiful kids.   A Republican lawmaker in Idaho said he is open to banning certain  forms of birth control if this decision goes forward at the Supreme  Court. He wanted to include plan B emergency contraception and IUDs.   Think about that. State by State, legislator by legislator, will  decide what is acceptable when it comes to contraception.   Now, some people are going to think: Durbin, you are exaggerating.  Democrats are at it again exaggerating.   But I am old enough to remember before Griswold, the regulation of  contraception in those days when it was virtually, in many States, even  illegal to buy a condom.   And so you think I am exaggerating? We lived at that time.   It wasn't until Griswold v. Connecticut, decided by the Supreme  Court, that established a right of privacy under our Constitution,  which then led to Roe v. Wade. That was America. It was an America  which, sadly, many Republican lawmakers long for.   A lawmaker in Missouri introduced a bill that deputizes bounty  hunters to sue anyone who helps a woman seeking an abortion outside the  State of Missouri.   I wanted to remind my colleague from Texas, who spoke just before me,  it was the Texas bounty hunter's law that started this conversation in  earnest.   In Texas, they decided that there would be a civil penalty that can  be charged against those who were engaged in an abortion, and the  person could claim that penalty if they disclosed that to the public.   Just a few days ago, the Republican leader in this body, Senator  McConnell of Kentucky, said that a national ban on abortion could be  ``possible''--a national ban if Roe is overturned and the Republicans  take control of the Senate.   Leaving it up to each State to decide a woman's reproductive rights  is creating a patchwork quilt of uncertainty. Your constitutional  rights would depend on your ZIP Code, but that is exactly the future we  are facing.   To be sure, Democratic State legislatures will continue to protect  access to abortion unless, of course, Republicans in Congress enact the  national ban that Senator McConnell said is possible.   In the absence of a national ban, if you can afford to travel, you  will be able to access reproductive care in States like Illinois and  Connecticut. But what about everyone else? If the right to have an  abortion now depends on where you live or how much money you make,  millions of women, many from historically marginalized communities,  will face even greater hurdles in obtaining an abortion.   America already has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the  developed world. Drastically restricting access to abortion or banning  abortion altogether will make those rates worse.   Republicans and anti-choice activists are trying to minimize the  impact that erasing Roe would have. They talk about other times the  Supreme Court has overturned precedent, and they argue--disingenuously,  I think--that this is how the Court has always worked. It corrects its  own past mistakes.   They claim that overturning Roe is no different than the Supreme  Court overturning Plessy v. Ferguson--a decision which gave us the  odious fiction of ``separate but equal'' that was later overturned by  Brown v. Board of Education. But there is a profound difference. It  appears that never before in the history of America has a Supreme Court  decision to abandon settled law made Americans less free--never. In the  past, when the Court has taken the serious step of overturning settled  law, it has done so to expand freedom, expand opportunity, not  eliminate it. What the activist, anti-choice majority on this Court  will do is unprecedented, radical, and dangerous.   Here is another fact that Republican lawmakers are hoping you will  not notice: It is not just the right to abortion that is in jeopardy;  Justice Alito's draft opinion in the Dobbs case questions the very  existence of the right to privacy. It argues that unenumerated rights-- that is, rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution--must be  deeply rooted in U.S. history and tradition in order to be recognized  as a constitutional right. Who decides what is deeply rooted in history  and tradition?   The Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision established marriage  equality only 7 years ago. Will the Court's reactionary majority put  that next on the chopping block?   What about the right to contraception, as I mentioned before,  established by Griswold v. Connecticut 11 years before Roe? A  Republican Member of this body recently criticized that decision  establishing the privacy right of every individual to choose the  contraception  [[Page S2392]]  right for their family. He described this as ``constitutionally  unsound.''   Rather than settling the debate on abortion, the draft Dobbs opinion  would further divide our fractious Nation and set the stage for a  radical majority in the Court to erase even more constitutional rights.  It would give government the power to dictate your rights and dictate  your future. That is why we must take action to protect women's  productive rights.   Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the Women's Health Protection Act.  This bill will codify the right to provide or obtain an abortion free  from medically unnecessary restrictions. The American people deserve to  know where their Senators stand. I will not stop fighting for the right  of every American, especially the women of America, to have these  rights as established for over 50 years.   For years, the Republicans have claimed they are the party of  families, the party of family values. Yet they have spent decades  ignoring the needs of working families. Republicans are willing to  force women to carry unwanted or unexpected or even dangerous  pregnancies to term, but they are not willing to help them raise their  children.   There are aspects of their voting patterns in the Senate that make it  clear that when it comes to helping families with the basics, such as  tax credits for children, making sure that families have paid medical  leave for their newborns or other family members--all of these things  are family friendly and family values. Unfortunately, they are not  supported by many, if any, Republicans. That would be a demonstration  that they truly care for families.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary Committee being  tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge the Committee on  the Judiciary from further consideration of the nomination of Charlotte  N.
