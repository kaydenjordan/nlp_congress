 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 30th  anniversary of the Outdoor Industry Association, OIA. Based in Boulder,  CO, OIA is the leading trade organization of the outdoor recreation  gear and apparel industry.   Founded by a group of 14 brands and specialty retailers, OIA has  grown to include 1,300 companies that are the backbone of an $887  billion outdoor recreation economy supporting 7.6 million jobs across  the United States. For the past three decades, OIA has represented  American businesses and individuals whose vocations and avocations are  connected to this Nation's best idea: our public lands and waters. OIA  is motivated by a shared commitment to protecting, maintaining, and  expanding outdoor recreation infrastructure and ensuring every person  in the United States has equitable access to nature.   From its earliest days, OIA has partnered with conservation  organizations to advocate for our public land and water. OIA helped to  permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and they  continue to press for full funding. They have also supported wildfire  funding legislation, rails-to-trails, and similar transportation  infrastructure programs and continue to work toward responsible climate  and energy policy. The organization also produces outdoor recreation  economy report that highlights the influence of the outdoor recreation  sector on the national economy, including statistics on consumer  spending, tax revenue, and job creation. This report is an incredible  resource for lawmakers, land managers, and local planners. As a result,  over the past half decade and following Colorado's leadership, States  have created State offices of outdoor recreation to ensure that  government leaders and business leaders are working together to grow  their recreation economies.   I am honored to continue to work with OIA to protect our public land  and water. Earlier this year, OIA announced their support for the  Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act, S. 241/H.R. 823, our bill  to protect 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado while safeguarding  existing outdoor recreation opportunities. OIA stated that they are  ``one hundred percent in support of the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and  Economy Act because it would protect nearly half a million acres of  public lands across Colorado and support the state's $28 billion  outdoor recreation economy while honoring its history in protecting  Camp Hale, the origin of the 10th mountain division during WWII.'' I  appreciate OIA's support for conserving public land in Colorado.   OIA members exemplify the collaborative and altruistic stewardship at  the heart of the outdoor recreation industry. For that, I congratulate  OIA on this 30-year anniversary and thank them for their contributions  to our American outdoor heritage.                            ____________________
