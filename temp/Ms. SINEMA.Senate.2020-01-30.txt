 Mr. Chief Justice, I submit a question to the desk for  the President's counsel on behalf of myself, Senator Manchin, Senator  Murkowski, and Senator Collins.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Sinema and the other Senators for counsel  for the President:         The Logan Act prohibits any U.S. citizen without the       authority of the United States from communicating with any       foreign government with the intent to influence that       government's conduct in relation to any controversy with the       United States. Will the President assure the American public       that private citizens will not be directed to conduct       American foreign policy or national security policy, unless       they have been specifically and formally designated by the       President and the State Department to do so?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   Let me preface--let me answer in several parts.   The first is, I just want to make clear that there was no conduct of  foreign policy being carried on here by a private person.   The testimony was clear from Ambassador Volker--and I assume that the  reference would be to Mr. Giuliani, the President's private counsel.  Ambassador Volker was clear that he understood Mr. Giuliani just to be  a source of information for the President and someone who knew about  Ukraine and someone who spoke to the President.   And, in fact, it was the testimony that it was the Ukrainians, Andriy  Yermak, who asked to be connected to Mr. Giuliani simply because he was  someone who could provide information to the President.   And Ambassador Volker testified that it was not his understanding, he  did not believe, that Mr. Giuliani was carrying out policy directives  of the President but, rather, indicating his views of what he thought  would be something useful for the Ukrainians to convince the President  of their anti-corruption bona fides. So I just wanted to make that  point.   It is, of course, the President's policy always to abide by the laws,  and I am not in a position to make pledges for the President here, but  the President's policy is always to abide by the laws, and we continue  to do so.  [[Page S709]]    I think it is worth pointing out that many Presidents, starting with  President Washington, have relied on persons who are their trusted  confidants but who are not actually employees of the government to  assist in the conduct of foreign diplomacy.   President Washington relied on Gouverneur Morris to carry messages in  certain circumstances, I believe, to the French. FDR had his confidants  whom he relied on in certain circumstances to be a go-between with  foreign powers, and there is a list of others. They were mentioned in  some of the testimony during the House proceedings.   So I don't think that there is anything--again, as I said, it was not  here, but there would not be anything improper for a President in some  circumstances to rely on a personal confidant to be able to convey  messages or receive messages back and forth from a foreign government  that would relate to the President's conduct in foreign affairs. That  is not prohibited but within his authority under the Constitution under  article II.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
