 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, Richard Shelby  delivered his farewell address here in the U.S. Senate.   It is difficult to think of the Senate without some of our retiring  Members; it is nearly impossible to think of it without Richard Shelby.   Like Jim Inhofe, he is a Senate institution. He has proudly served  the State of Alabama for six terms in the Senate. That is 36 years of  tireless work to make life better for the people of Alabama and for the  American people as a whole.   He is currently the longest serving Senator in Alabama's history, as  well as the longest serving Member in the history of the Senate  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.   Throughout his Senate career, Richard has always kept his eye on  getting things done for the people of Alabama, whether that is  supporting Alabama military installations or the work NASA does in his  State. He is a longtime NASA advocate, and as chairman and ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Defense at the Senate Appropriations  Committee, he has worked to ensure robust funding for our national  security priorities.   He has also been a champion of funding to support Ukraine in its  fight for freedom.   He has been a supporter of scientific research at various government  Agencies, as well as in partnership with research universities.   Richard is also notable for being one of the tallest United States  Senators. And that is significant to me because, as a tall guy myself,  I don't often run into people I can look up to, but I look up to  Richard, both literally and figuratively.   Richard's record of service and his dedication to people of his State  are an inspiration to me and to many others as we carry out our work  here in the U.S. Senate.   And I will miss his presence and his example as well as his sense of  humor, which has lightened the mood around here on many challenging  days.   But if anyone has earned his retirement, it is Richard Shelby. And I  wish him and Annette, his wife of 62 years, some very well-deserved  relaxation and the very best of everything in the years ahead.
