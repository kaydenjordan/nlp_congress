 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation,  and I, too, want to thank all of the Members and staff who were engaged  in preparing this bill for a vote on the floor of the House.   I wanted to focus on two of the amendments that are included in the  bill--I am grateful for that--that I sponsored.   First, it includes my amendment to create a pilot project to evaluate  postmarket safety of medical devices. It also includes my amendment  which states that Congress and Federal agencies need to work together  to lower drug prices. Everyone has been impacted by rising costs of  prescription drugs, which is why 60 percent of Americans believe  addressing the cost of prescription drugs needs to be a top priority.   The drug pricing crisis cannot be attributed to a single bad actor or  a few blockbuster drugs. A recent study found that 97 percent of widely  used brand name drugs had a price increase that exceeded inflation.   This crisis requires a comprehensive solution that increases  transparency; lowers prices for patients, Medicare, and Medicaid; and  ensures that every American can get access to the drugs that they need.    It is time for Congress to get serious about lowering the cost of  drugs for Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
