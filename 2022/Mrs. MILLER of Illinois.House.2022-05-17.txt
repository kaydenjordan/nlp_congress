 Madam Speaker, my amendment puts strong  protections in place so that no funds in this bill can go toward  harming the unborn.   The underlying bill includes a provision that allows taxpayer dollars  to be used for health and mental healthcare support.    Without the protections my amendment offers, this funding could go to  counseling young pregnant women to seek abortions. This is wrong. A  child in the womb is a distinct, developing, whole human being.   In my home State of Illinois, our leftist Governor announced this  week he will take Federal funding from title 10 and give it to Planned  Parenthood of Illinois. This goes directly against Federal law and the  Hyde amendment.   Those on the other side of this aisle, in this body, use every  opportunity to get rid of the Hyde amendment. That is why my amendment  is so important. The growing hostility toward the Hyde amendment is  alarming and means we must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure program  dollars authorized by Congress cannot be used for abortions or abortion  services.   God is the author of life, not Congress. The taking of life through  abortion is an assault on the image of God.   Abortion is not healthcare, despite what the left says, and we should  not force taxpayers to violate their morals or strongly held beliefs by  forcing them to pay for it. My amendment ensures that they won't.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
