 Mr. President, our Nation was founded on a powerful  principle encapsulated by the first three words of our Constitution:  ``We the People.'' We are meant to be a nation, in the words of Abraham  Lincoln, ``of the people, by the people, and for the people,'' not a  nation by and for the most powerful, not a nation by and for the most  privileged. Yet time and time again, we are seeing a complete and total  corruption of the vision of our Constitution.   We saw this earlier this year with one TrumpCare bill after another  designed to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million Americans to  deliver tax giveaways to the richest in America. We have seen it just  recently in the consideration of a budget that reversed that and said  that in order to give $4.5 trillion of tax giveaways almost entirely to  the richest Americans, we will take $1 trillion out of Medicaid and  half a trillion out of Medicare. We have seen this powerful conversion  of standing our Constitution on its head, and now we have the Supreme  Court fully participating in this effort in a case called Janus v.  AFSCME. It is the very epitome of the principle of a nation so  corrupted that it honors the opposite of what our Constitution stands  for.   The sole purpose of this case, Janus v. AFSCME, is to undercut the  ability of workers to organize. This is an assault on the freedom of  working Americans to associate with their coworkers. It is an assault  on the freedom of working Americans to negotiate a fair wage. It is an  assault on the freedom of Americans to fight for fairer benefits and a  safe workplace. Bottom line: It is an assault on the freedom of workers  to participate in the wealth they work so hard to create.   In short, this is the right to exploit that our Supreme Court-- majority of five--is so determined to elevate. I have read the  Constitution, and I have never seen embedded in it a right to exploit,  a right to cheat, a right to take advantage of. Yet here is the  majority of the Court prepared to fight for exploitation on behalf of  the 1 percent of Americans at the very top.   The key strategy in this case is to attack the finances of workers  when they organize. Former President Jimmy Carter once said: ``Every  advance in this half-century--Social Security, civil rights, Medicare,  aid to education, one after another--came with the support and  leadership of American labor.'' It has been workers banding together to  say: We can create a better foundation for families to thrive. And that  hasn't just created a better foundation for those who belong to unions;  it has created a better foundation for all workers. We saw them  successfully band together and fight for a 40-hour workweek, fight for  minimum wage, fight for sick leave, and fight for healthy and safe  working conditions--again, benefits that every worker enjoys because  workers were able to organize and fight to receive and win these  provisions.   What is really going in the Janus case? Any organization, in order to  function, has rights and responsibilities. Rights are the rewards you  get for participating, and responsibilities are the requirement that  you be part of the team and you contribute to the effort.   When I was small, probably just 2 or 3 years old, my mother had a  book she would read to me that involved the animals in the barnyard.  Animal after animal was asked to participate in making the bread, and  animal after animal turned it down, but when the bread was baked, they  wanted a full share even though they had refused to participate in the  effort to create it. This is what Janus is all about. It is about the  right to the rewards, divided from any responsibility to get the work  done.   When workers organize, they say: We are going to have to be able to  have the finances to drive this organization, and to do that, we need  to have every worker contribute a fair share. Those fair share fees  mean that all the workers  [[Page S6961]]  are in it together, they are all contributing, and they all benefit  from the rewards.   Forever, the courts have said: Yes, with the reward goes the  responsibility. That is true of any organization. It is fundamental in  how organizations work. If you don't show up here on the floor, you  don't get to vote. Every organization has its responsibilities that go  with its rewards. But the 1 percent have chosen a strategy that says:  We will take one organization in America--and that is workers  organizations--and we will drive an absolute wedge between the  responsibility and the reward.   These fees that we are talking about, these fair share fees, are not  fees that go to political purposes. They don't go to donations to  candidates. They don't go to organizing campaigns walking door-to-door  for candidates. They don't go to advertising on the television or the  web. They are simply the cost of having a team that works to negotiate  an agreement with a company.   I find it absolutely evil that a majority of the Supreme Court is  excited about embracing this right to exploit other workers by saying  in this one case in America, you get the rewards without the  responsibilities. If the Court was applying that to a stockholder in a  company, the equivalent would be to say that the stockholder doesn't  have to contribute to the costs of the management of the corporation,  so they can demand back their share of what the management spends on  their salaries, on their office spaces, on their private jets, and on  their trips to do whatever they do, of the time they spend negotiating  acquisitions to build the size of the company or striking deals to sell  their products. That would be the equivalent, that a stockholder gets  the rewards of all of that negotiation without having to participate in  the cost. But this is not a situation in which five Justices want to  apply consistent principle because their goal isn't to honor the  Constitution, and their goal is not fairness; their single goal is to  demolish the ability of workers to organize, to get a fair share of the  wealth they work to create.   We can see that already our Nation is in trouble on this principle.  For the three decades after World War II, we had workers who had the  strong ability to organize and demand a fair share, and we saw a  revolution in the prosperity of workers in those three decades from  1945 through 1975. Individuals who had lived in shacks, individuals who  had been wiped out by the Great Depression suddenly were able to buy,  on a single worker's income--it didn't even take two incomes--a three- bedroom ranch house with a basement and a single-car garage and were  still able to save money for an annual camping trip and perhaps to save  some to help their children launch themselves into life. That is what  we had when workers got a fair share.    Yet, in the midseventies, the multinational companies said: Do you  know what? Let's undercut the American worker by making our goods  overseas in China and importing them. That way, we will demolish the  jobs here in America, and we, the company, will have made things at the  lowest price in the world, have sold them at the world market price,  and have made a lot more money. This strategy worked for the  multinational companies. They made vast sums of money for their  stockholders and for their executives.   This application of different rules for foreign workers and domestic  workers really gave a huge advantage to our competitor overseas and to  a company that spanned both shores and could move its production  overseas. So we saw the loss of 50,000 factories; we saw the loss of 5  million factory jobs; we saw the loss of an enormous number of supply  chain jobs; and we saw, without those payrolls being spent in the  community, an enormous loss of retail jobs in the community, but it  made the wealthy wealthier, and that was the goal of the strategy.   So here we are, facing this case that will come before the Court  later this year, but the members of the Court have, essentially,  already declared their positions. Four members of the Court were on the  previous version of this when the Court tied 4 to 4, and Neil Gorsuch,  who was added to the Court, has been very clear on which side of this  he stands.   Should we put an asterisk by Neil Gorsuch's name? Should a 5-to-4  decision, with Gorsuch being in the majority, even carry weight here in  our society? This is the seat that for the first time in U.S. history  was stolen from one President and delivered to another. The majority of  this body right here stole the seat, undermining the integrity,  dishonoring the oath, the responsibility for advice and consent, and  damaging the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. It was done because it  was a strategy to enable the 1 percent to rip off ordinary working  Americans. The prize for that was a position on Citizens United that  now allows the wealthiest Americans to continue to fund campaigns  across this country to drown out the voices of ordinary people and a  position on this case, the Janus case, that says that we will take one  organization in America, that of the workers, and divide the rewards  from the rights.   We know who is behind this strategy. It is the Koch brothers through  their organizations, the National Right to Work Foundation and the  Liberty Justice Center. They were behind the strategy for the theft of  the Supreme Court seat. They were behind the massive increase in third- party spending that polluted the campaigns across this country. They  are behind this strategy to destroy the vision that is embedded in our  Constitution.   Eleanor Roosevelt once said: I am opposed to this legislation because  it gives employers the right to exploit. Eleanor Roosevelt was a real  champion for workers, and she called a spade a spade. The right to  exploit is not a right that any Member of this body should pursue, and  it certainly should not be pursued by the Supreme Court.   We know that there is a chapter 2 to this strategy. The first is to  get the Supreme Court so that you can divide the rights from the  responsibilities; therefore, you as a worker do not have to contribute  to the cost, but you will benefit from the rewards. Pretty soon, very  few people will be contributing; therefore, it will undermine the  financial ability of the union to negotiate.   Then they have a second strategy. This fundraising letter was sent  out last year by the State Policy Network. By the way, the State Policy  Network is an alliance of 66 State-based think tanks that are designed  and funded by the Koch brothers and their friends to undercut the  ability of workers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create.  They said: Here is our plan to defund and defang our opponent, the  unions--to deal a blow to the left's ability to control government.   Ah, they are fancy words, but what they really meant was our goal is  to take and undo the ability of workers to organize so as to get a fair  share of the wealth they create. It is one evil act after another that  is funded by the Koch cartel.   In our Nation, we have stood up to this type of abuse time and again.  The American historian who created the phrase the ``American dream''  said, in each generation, there is a group of Americans who rises up to  take on the forces that appear to be overwhelming us. We need to call  on the people of the United States who believe in the vision of our  Constitution, to be that group to rise up and take on this effort to  turn our Constitution on its head--to strip ``we the people'' out of  our Constitution and replace it with ``we the powerful''--and to stand  up against this type of right to exploit, whether it is a bill here on  the floor of the U.S. Senate or it is a begotten majority of the  Supreme Court.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Isamar Chavez, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder of  the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
