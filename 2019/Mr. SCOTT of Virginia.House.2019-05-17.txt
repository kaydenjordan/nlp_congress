 Madam Speaker, today is a historic day. Sixty- five years ago today, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of  Education that racially segregated schools were inherently unequal and,  therefore, unconstitutional.   Today is also a historic day for the LGBTQ community, because today  the House of Representatives will pass the Equality Act.   Over the last decade, we have made progress in securing rights for  the LGBT community, including marriage equality and the repeal of Don't  Ask, Don't Tell. However, many legal barriers still remain.   Only a handful of States have explicit laws barring discrimination  based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public  accommodations, and even fewer have protections for gender identity.   The inconsistent patchwork of State laws leaves many people  vulnerable to discrimination at work, at school, and in many other  parts of their daily lives.   As chairman, I was proud to hold a hearing on this important civil  rights legislation in the Committee on Education and Labor. Witnesses  testified that all too many Americans are experiencing discrimination  in their everyday lives, especially the workplace, and even in the  educational system, where many of them are experiencing discrimination,  even in elementary school. This is not acceptable.   This bill also ensures that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,  the RFRA, cannot be used as a free pass to discriminate.   RFRA was originally enacted as a shield to serve as a safeguard for  religious freedom, but recently it has been used as a sword to cut down  the civil rights of too many individuals.   Freedom from discrimination is a core American value.   Madam Speaker, passage of this bill is long overdue. We must affirm  that all Americans are equally protected from discrimination under the  law. I, therefore, urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.
