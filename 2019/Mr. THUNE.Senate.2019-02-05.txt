 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last night, our colleague from Nebraska,  Senator Ben Sasse, brought a bill to the floor to protect infants who  are born alive during abortions.   The legislation is simple. In the words of the bill, it finds:         If an abortion results in the live birth of an infant, the       infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of       the United States, and entitled to all the protections of       such laws. Any infant born alive after an abortion . . . has       the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise       for any newborn.    In other words, any living, breathing baby outside of its mother's  body should be protected. That is a pretty basic standard of decency.  One would assume that there is no human being alive who would object to  such a bill--that even my colleagues across the aisle who don't think  that living, breathing unborn babies should be protected could get  behind this bill--but you would be wrong because, last night, Senate  Democrats objected to the consideration of this bill. They objected to  the consideration of legislation to protect babies who are born alive.   Let's take a step back and remember why Senator Sasse brought this  bill up in the first place.   Last week, the Democratic Governor of Virginia was asked about an  extreme proposal from a Virginia Democrat to remove restrictions on  late-term abortions. In his comments on the bill, the Virginia Governor  had this to say:         If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would       happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be       kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's       what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion       would ensue between the physicians and the mother.    In other words, the Democratic Governor of Virginia not only endorsed  [[Page S844]]  late-term abortions--abortions performed on babies old enough to  survive outside of the mothers--he left open the door to infanticide.  He left open the possibility of killing a baby born alive.   I would think those would be comments that my Democratic colleagues  would be recoiling from in horror. I would think they would be rushing  to make it very clear that they absolutely do not support the killing  of a baby born alive. Yet, yesterday, my Democratic colleagues objected  to a bill that would do nothing more than declare that any infant who  is born alive during an abortion is entitled to be protected--to be  given the basic medical care that would be afforded any other baby.   Most Americans think there should be, at least, some limits on  abortion. Most countries in the world think there should be some limits  on abortion. Only China, North Korea, the United States, and two other  countries allow elective abortions through all 9 months of pregnancy-- not a list we ought to be on. At least some of my Democratic colleagues  used to be a little bit more moderate on the issue of abortion. Safe,  legal, and rare was their claim, which you always heard them say, but,  yesterday, my Democratic colleagues made it very clear that they have  decided to dispense with moderation and espouse the most radical and  extreme position possible--no restrictions at all on abortion, ever, up  to and, apparently, now after the moment of birth.   Chuck Colson, the founder of Prison Fellowship, once noted: ``A  government cannot be truly just without affirming the intrinsic value  of human life.''   I think it is fair to say that pretty much every great injustice in  human history sprang from a failure to affirm the intrinsic value of  every human life--from a decision that certain individuals' rights were  not equal to those of others or that their life or liberty could be  sacrificed for the greater good.   Today, we unfortunately see another great injustice with the failure  to affirm the value of the lives of the most vulnerable among us.   I am horrified by my Democratic colleagues' decision to object to  legislation to protect babies born alive, and I will continue to fight  to ensure that the right to life of every human being, born and unborn,  is protected.                                 The Economy    Madam President, here are just some of the news stories we saw at the  end of last week. This is from the Guardian: ``U.S. jobs growth smashes  expectations''; from CNBC: ``Worker wage gains just broke 3% for the  first time in more than 10 years''; from Fox Business: ``U.S. employers  added 304,000 jobs in January, soaring past expectations''; from the  Wall Street Journal: ``U.S. Stocks Post Best January in 30 Years'';  from USA Today: ``Employers add booming 304,000 jobs in January,  marking 100th straight month of employment gains''; and from the  Associated Press: ``A robust job gain in January shows US economy's  durability.'' The list goes on. Simply put, the U.S. economy is  flourishing.   After years of stagnation under the Obama administration, the economy  has come roaring back. Job creation is strong, and unemployment is low.  January marked the 11th straight month that unemployment has been at or  below 4 percent. That is the strongest streak in nearly five decades.   The economy grew at a robust 3.4 percent in the third quarter of  2018. In 2018, for the first time ever, the number of job openings  outnumbered the number of jobseekers. The Department of Labor reports  that for 9 straight months there have been more job openings than  people looking for work.   Wage growth is accelerating. Wages have now been growing at a rate of  3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage growth  reached this level was in 2009.   Median household income is at an all-time inflation-adjusted record  of $6,372.   Small business optimism hit record highs in 2018. The year 2018 saw  the most impressive job growth in the manufacturing industry since  1997.   The list goes on and on and on. My point, very simply, is that  Republican economic policies are working.   When Republicans took office 2 years ago, the economy had been  underperforming for years, and American families had been feeling the  effects. We were determined to remove the obstacles that were holding  the economy back, like burdensome regulations and an outdated Tax Code  that was acting as a drag on economic growth. So, along with the  President, we got right to work, lifting excessive regulations.   In December 2017, we passed a historic, comprehensive reform of our  Tax Code. We cut taxes for American families, doubled the child tax  credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. We lowered tax rates  across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses,  farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate,  which previously was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed  world. We expanded business owners' ability to recover the cost of  investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that  they can invest in their operations and in their workers. And we  brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century so that  American businesses are not operating at a competitive disadvantage  next to their foreign counterparts.   Now we are seeing the effects: a thriving economy, good jobs, higher  wages, and low unemployment.   So what is the Democratic response to all of this good economic news  and economic growth? Is it to continue the policies that are creating  prosperity for American families and look for ways for grow these  policies to expand the economic benefits even further? No.   Democrats want to reverse the policies that are producing economic  growth. They want to undo the tax cuts that are creating jobs and  opportunities for American workers, and they want to increase-- increase--the tax burden of American families.   That is right. Democrats are currently advocating various proposals  that would not only reverse the gains the economy has made but would  severely damage economic growth for the long term. For example, there  are the proposals to impose a government-run healthcare system, like  the so-called Medicare for All plan, whose price tag is so staggeringly  large--by one estimate, more than $32 trillion--that no one has even  come close to figuring out how to pay for it. Doubling the amount of  individual and corporate income tax collected would still not be enough  to pay for the mammoth cost of this plan.   Think about that. All of the revenue collected--income tax on the  individual side and on the corporate side, double it--double it--and  you still wouldn't be able to pay for this massive, massive plan.   The Democrats' promise that if you like your healthcare plan, you can  keep it will be broken again. More than 175 million Americans get their  health insurance through their jobs. That will be no more under this  proposal. The Vermont Senator's government-run Medicare for All plan,  which many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  cosponsored, would eliminate private sector insurance for millions of  families who like the coverage they currently have.   Then there is the so-called Green New Deal, which could raise  families' energy bills by more than $3,000 each year. When I travel in  my State of South Dakota, I hear a lot about the high cost of living  and how it is still difficult for families to make ends meet. The last  thing my constituents in South Dakota or any hard-working family needs  is to have their energy costs go up by more than $3,000 a year.   Then there are the plain old tax bills that some of the Democrats are  proposing to raise the top marginal tax rate to 70 percent or higher.  House Democrats are also proposing to substantially increase business  tax rates.   Prior to the passage of the tax reform, America's global companies  faced the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. That put  American businesses at a serious disadvantage on the global stage,  which, in turn, put American workers at a disadvantage.   Part of the economic growth that we are experiencing now and all of  the benefits for workers that come along with it are direct results of  the lower corporate tax rate that we passed as part of the tax reform.  [[Page S845]]    It is staggering--staggering--that Democrats can look at all of the  benefits that come from lowering the corporate rate and all of the  positive effects it is having on the economy and workers and then turn  around and propose a tax rate hike.   In short, here is what our country would look like if the Democrats'  far-left agenda is forced upon the American people: Government-run  Medicare for All would eliminate employer-sponsored insurance for 175  million people, increase government spending by $32 trillion,  jeopardize Medicare for today's seniors, and raise taxes on just about  everyone under the sun. The Green New Deal would increase energy costs  by up to $3,000 or more per year for our families, and Democrats' new  taxes would slow economic growth, destroy jobs, and reduce economic  opportunity for hard-working Americans.   Our economy is thriving, and that is bringing real benefits to  American families and to American workers. We want to continue heading  in the right direction with more policies to grow the economy, to  reduce the cost of living, and to help Americans save for retirement.  We will strongly oppose Democrats' attempts and proposals to undo the  progress that our economy has made and to burden Americans with higher  taxes, fewer jobs, and fewer opportunities.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
