 Madam Speaker, Don Young was my friend.  Years ago, before I entered Congress to serve my country at this level,  as a police officer I was called upon to address the annual gathering  of the Alaskan State Troopers. I will always remember, as our plane  entered Alaska, the mountains rose from the Earth, and I had never  witnessed such magnificent splendor of the Lord's creation. It was awe  inspiring. Frightening even.   A couple of years later I met Don Young, and I understood more both  about Alaska and creation and, by extension, I understood more about  all children of God.   Don Young, his spirit, his voice echoed through this Chamber, and  every day that I sat next to him for over 5 years I recalled the  Scripture that came to my mind when I felt and saw those magnificent  mountains arising from the Earth. I recalled the Scripture advised us  in Micah, said, ``Hear ye now the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou  before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.'' This Chamber  has echoed the voice of Don Young for five decades, and now he has gone  to his reward.   May I say to you, Don, you are the mountain of Alaska, you have been  a dear and honored friend. You will be missed, loved, respected, and  your memory shall always be honored. I am a better man, having known  you. I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves),  for leading this Special Order.
