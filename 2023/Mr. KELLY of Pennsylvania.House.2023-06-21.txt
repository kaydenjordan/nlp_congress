 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Jacques ``Jay'' Rougeau, a Pennsylvania State trooper who died  in the line of duty just this past Saturday, June 17.   Trooper Rougeau was shot and fatally injured while responding to a  call in Juniata, Pennsylvania. Trooper Rougeau was only 29 years old.   Now, Trooper Rougeau is a native of Corry, Pennsylvania, which is in  my district where, today, he remains on the minds of so many family,  friends, neighbors, and loved ones.   According to reports, a man had arrived at Troop G, Lewistown Station  armed with a rifle and fired at patrol vehicles in the parking lot and  shot one officer. After a search, troopers located the shooter where  they exchanged gunfire. Both the shooter and Trooper Rougeau were shot  and killed. Those who knew Trooper Rougeau say he knew from a young age  that he always wanted to be a police officer. After graduating from  Corry Area High School in 2012, he first interned with the city of  Corry Police Department in 2014.   During the internship, Rougeau said his ultimate goal was to become a  Pennsylvania State trooper. He enlisted in 2020 and started with Troop  G just 3 months ago. Trooper Rougeau is the 104th member of the  Pennsylvania State Police to make the ultimate sacrifice in the line of  duty.   If we can, take a look at this picture. This is somebody that is in  the prime of their life, just starting off, in the position that he so  coveted being a part of this group. He wanted to be a police officer.  He wanted to serve Pennsylvania's citizens by being a Pennsylvania  State policeman.   Unfortunately, he is gone. He leaves behind a wife, Chloe, who I am  told was his high school sweetheart. I know that he has made the city  of Corry and the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania proud for so  bravely serving in law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his service, and offer a moment of  silence in honor of his memory. I ask if we could all please think for  a moment about this young man, think about the unlived part of his  life, and all who serve in the line of duty.    Mr. Speaker, I wish his family could be  here to see that the entire gallery just stood up and, even though you  did not know Trooper Rougeau, you stood up to honor what he did in his  line of duty.   This is a tragic loss not only for the community of Corry, but the  entire  [[Page H3000]]  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This morning, I am praying for the  family, friends, and colleagues of Trooper Rougeau, another person in  law enforcement who died while responding to help others in danger.                            ____________________
