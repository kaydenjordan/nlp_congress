 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the  town of Southbury on its 350th anniversary. In 1673, 15 families  seeking free religious expression traveled up the Housatonic River and  settled on land that is known today as Southbury. Those humble  beginnings have grown into a vibrant community of almost 20,000 people.  As the only town in the Nation to bear its name, Southbury is truly one  of a kind. I was grateful to be invited this past November to  participate in the town's 85th anniversary of Southbury's residents  coming together to stop the Neo-Nazi organization, the German-American  Bund, from establishing a presence in the town. Their determination  reminds us of the importance of standing with our neighbors and calling  out hate and bigotry in all its forms.   During my 6 years as Southbury's Congressman and the past 10 years as  its U.S. Senator, I have come to know many of the town's past and  current citizens. Dr. Mark Taylor, a friend and mentor, became  nationally known for his knowledge and passion about critical water  sources from the Pomperaug River. Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Hinman  was a Revolutionary War hero who also took part in the Constitutional  Convention. Gladys Taber was a prolific writer, best known for her  series about life at Stillmeadow, her farm in Southbury.   Congratulations to the Town of Southbury on this impressive milestone  of 350 years and counting. It is a privilege to represent a community  with such a storied past and bright future, and I look forward to  continuing to work together to strengthen Southbury for many years to  come.                            ____________________
