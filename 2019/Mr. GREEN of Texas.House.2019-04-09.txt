 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise because  I love my country. I rise today on a mission of mercy.   I am on a mission of mercy for people that I will likely never meet  and greet. Perhaps by some fortuitous circumstance, I may encounter  some of them, but I know not who they are currently in the sense that I  know them personally.   I rise on behalf of the many people who are seeking asylum, and I do  so, Mr. Speaker, because it has been reported on many news stations-- outlets, if you will--that our President intends to reinstate the  family separation policy.   I rise on a mission of mercy, and I make an appeal to the most  powerful man on the planet Earth. My appeal is that you would not--N-O- T--you would not reinstate this policy.   I beseech you to please, Mr. President, treat these people the way  you would want to be treated if you found yourself in similar  circumstances. I beg that you would understand that separating babies  from mothers is unacceptable by any standard that we know of.   No one supports the notion of taking babies from their mothers,  children from their parents.                                time  1015    So I am begging and pleading with the President of the United States  of America, the most powerful man on Earth: Please, Mr. President, do  not reinstate this policy.   I also appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  encourage the President to do the right thing, the just thing.  [[Page H3135]]    If we are not pleased with the laws in this country, we have a means  by which we can address the law. If we believe that something is  unacceptable, there is a way for us to address it. The way to address  this problem is with immigration reform.   I beg the President and all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle:  Please, let's try to resolve this with legislation. Let's not do what  we have done and, quite frankly, have not atoned for.   Some of the children are still not back with their parents who were  separated previously. This is the United States of America. This is not  what we do. We don't take children from their parents and then place  them in places where we cannot find them such that we can reunite them.   This is my appeal, Mr. President. I make the appeal because, as a  Member of Congress, I believe that at some point we are going to have  to account for the actions that we engage in while we are here. I don't  want it on my record that while I was in the Congress of the United  States of America and I had the opportunity to at least speak to power,  to speak truth to power, and make an appeal on behalf of those who are  among the least, the last, and the lost--I am making my appeal. I am  doing what I can to help those who are fleeing harm's way.   Mr. President, you don't have to do this, and I beg that Members of  both parties would please encourage him not to do so.   This is a moment for us to reflect and a moment for us to demonstrate  to the world that what we preach, we will practice. We have, for years,  encouraged other countries to take in refugees. We have gone so far as  to pay countries to take in refugees. We have funded countries to take  in refugees. We ought to practice what we preach.   Those who are not qualified should not come, should not be brought  into our country. But I would also say this, that we should not say to  the world: Go back, refugees, asylum seekers. You are not welcome in  the United States of America.   This is not the country that would proclaim such a thing. Our laws we  stand on, and I stand on those laws.
