 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1031) to require the Comptroller General of the United States  to conduct a study on disparities associated with race and ethnicity  with respect to certain benefits administered by the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1031         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY ON                     DISPARITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY                     WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN BENEFITS ADMINISTERED                     BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study--        (1) to assess whether there are disparities associated with       race and ethnicity with respect to--        (A) compensation benefits administered by the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs;        (B) disability ratings determined by the Secretary, with       specific consideration of disability evaluations based on       pain; and        (C) the rejection of fully developed claims for benefits       under laws administered by the Secretary; and        (2) to develop recommendations to facilitate better data       collection on the disparities described in paragraph (1).        (b) Initial Briefing.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General       shall brief Congress on the initial results of the study       conducted under subsection (a).        (c) Final Report.--Not later than 240 days after the date       on which the briefing required by subsection (b) is       conducted, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a       final report setting forth the results of the study conducted       under subsection (a), including the recommendations developed       under paragraph (2) of such subsection.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1031.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1031. To build a better, more  welcoming, and more equitable Department of Veterans Affairs, we must  take a hard look at how VA can earn back trust. Too many veterans have  experienced barriers to receiving the benefits that they have earned  from service to our country.   I believe that VA care and benefits must be distributed fairly to all  eligible veterans, regardless of social or physical disparities. That  is why we must look back to document whether veterans have been  unjustly denied benefits, address the root causes of disparities, and  ensure equitable treatment moving forward.   Such an important evaluation will certainly require digging into vast  datasets, evaluating agency processes, and laying the framework for  meaningful recommendations to effectively make any needed course  corrections at VA. That is why this bill mandates that the nonpartisan  Government Accountability Office perform this examination.   Under Senator Raphael Warnock's legislation passed by the Senate, GAO  would study racial and ethnic disparities regarding VA compensation  benefits, including VA disability ratings and rejections of fully  developed claims for benefits under laws administered by VA.  [[Page H6252]]    The VA Secretary would brief Congress within a year after passage of  the bill and then prepare a report that includes recommendations to  address identified disparities.   The companion legislation I sponsored, H.R. 3856, was approved by the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I am pleased to support Senator  Warnock's legislation today. I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, ask all of my colleagues to join  me in passing S. 1031, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 894) to identify and refer members of the Armed Forces with a  health care occupation who are separating from the Armed Forces for  potential employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 894         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hire Veteran Health Heroes       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED                     FORCES WITH A HEALTH CARE OCCUPATION FOR                     POTENTIAL EMPLOYMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS DURING SEPARATION FROM THE                     ARMED FORCES.         Section 207 of the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of       2017 (Public Law 115-46; 38 U.S.C. 7401 note) is amended to       read as follows:       ``SEC. 207. IDENTIFICATION AND REFERRAL OF MEMBERS OF THE                     ARMED FORCES WITH A HEALTH CARE OCCUPATION FOR                     POTENTIAL EMPLOYMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS DURING SEPARATION FROM THE                     ARMED FORCES.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in       consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall establish a       program to identify and refer members of the Armed Forces       with a health care occupation for employment with the       Department of Veterans Affairs during the separation of such       members from the Armed Forces.        ``(b) Referral of Interested Individuals.--        ``(1) In general.--If a member of the Armed Forces       identified under subsection (a) expresses an interest in       working in a health care occupation within the Department of       Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       refer the member to a recruiter of the Department for       consideration of open positions in the specialty and       geography of interest to the member.        ``(2) Timing.--Any referral of a member of the Armed Forces       conducted under paragraph (1) shall be made not earlier than       one year before the separation of the member from the Armed       Forces.        ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Any identification of a member       of the Armed Forces under subsection (a) or referral of such       member under subsection (b) shall not be construed as a       guarantee of employment of such member with the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        ``(d) Reports.--Not later than each of one year and two       years after the date of the enactment of the Hire Veteran       Health Heroes Act of 2021, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a       report on the program established under subsection (a).        ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Appropriate committees of congress.--The term       `appropriate committees of Congress' means--        ``(A) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on       Veterans' Affairs of the Senate; and        ``(B) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on       Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives.        ``(2) Health care occupation.--The term `health care       occupation' means an occupation for which an individual may       be appointed for employment with the Department of Veterans       Affairs under section 7401 of title 38, United States       Code.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 894.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Senator Braun and Senator  Hassan's S. 894, the Hire Veteran Health Heroes Act.   We all know that there are many ways for our military personnel to  continue to serve after they separate from Active Duty. This bill  provides a potential pathway for those servicemembers in healthcare  occupations to move into careers with VA.   It couldn't come at a better time because we know VA has significant  hiring needs to ensure it can continue providing high-quality, timely  care to our veterans.   S. 894 directs VA to consult with the Department of Defense and  establish a program for identifying separating servicemembers who are  interested in healthcare positions at VA. VA would then refer  interested servicemembers to VA recruiters for consideration of open  positions in the specialty and geographic locations veterans prefer.   I see this as a win-win situation for veterans and for VA, and  exactly the kind of ideal employment warm handoff we all talk about.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 894, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, S. 894, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3665) to designate the medical center of the Department of  Veterans Affairs in San Diego, California, as the Jennifer Moreno  Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and to support the  designation of a component of such medical center in honor of Kathleen  Bruyere.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) As of January 2021, of 1,255 health care facilities of       the Department of Veterans of Affairs, two are named for       women veterans.        (2) From 2002 through 2006, Jennifer Madai Moreno was an       active member of the San Diego High School Junior Reserve       Officer Training Corps (JROTC), which is a Department of the       Army Honor Unit with Distinction, the highest rating by the       Army. She was also chosen to be a member of the San Diego       Unified School District Brigade Staff. As a high school       senior, she rose quickly to become the top junior marksman in       California through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.        (3) Moreno accepted a JROTC scholarship to the University       of San Francisco (USF) for Nursing, becoming the first person       in her family to go to college. While at USF, she was chosen       for Leadership Development Training. She ultimately achieved       the highest level of physical fitness in her ROTC unit.        (4) Following her graduation from USF with a Bachelor of       Science degree in Nursing in 2010, Moreno received her       commission in the United States Army as a Second Lieutenant       Nurse Corps Officer.        (5) Upon commissioning, Moreno served as a Gold Bar       Recruiter from July 2010 to September 2010.        (6) Moreno was chosen to attend and completed the Basic       Airborne Course in Fort Benning, Georgia and Army Medical       Department Officer Basic Course at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas.        (7) Moreno was then assigned to Madigan Army Medical       Center, Joint Base Lewis McCord, Washington in January 2011,       where she served as a Clinical Staff Nurse on medical-      surgical unit. Moreno earned her certification as a Medical       Surgical Registered Nurse in February 2011.        (8) Moreno volunteered for a position with U.S. Army       Special Operations Command in 2011. She was selected into the       SOC Cultural Support Team program. She was deployed to       Afghanistan in June 2013 with the Army's 75th Ranger       Regiment.        (9) On October 6, 2013, Moreno was attached to a U.S. Army       Ranger unit on a night mission in the Zhari district in       Kandahar province to capture a high-value target when four       explosive devices were triggered.        (10) During the last moments of Moreno's life, she       reportedly heard a call to help a wounded soldier struck by a       blast. Moreno did not hesitate to respond to the call for       help. As she made her way to help a fallen soldier, she       triggered the fifth explosion, which ended her life.        (11) Moreno was the first Nurse CST member to die in       action. Part of her legacy is the number of young women       coming from medical fields seeking out voluntary assignments       to join the CST program.        (12) Moreno was the first combat casualty to be buried at       Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego since the post-      9/11 conflicts began. She received full military honors.        (13) After graduating from college in 1966, Kathleen Mae       Bruyere was accepted into U.S. Navy Officer Candidate School,       after which she was assigned as an on-campus Navy recruiting       officer in California.        (14) Bruyere was named to the staff of Rear Admiral Allen       Hill in 1975, becoming the first woman to serve as flag       secretary to an admiral.        (15) In January 1976, Bruyere was chosen as one of 12 Women       of the Year on the cover of Time Magazine.        (16) In 1977, Bruyere joined five other women officers who       sued the United States Secretary of the Navy and the United       States Secretary of Defense over restrictions that prevented       women from serving on combat aircraft and ships. This led to       the 1948 Women's Armed Services Integration Act being struck       down as unconstitutional, overturning a ban on women serving       at sea.        (17) In 1987, as Special Assistant to the Chief of Naval       Operations for women's policy, Bruyere helped conduct an       examination of the status of Navy women, including career       opportunities and complaints of sexism. The study led to       9,000 sea-duty and command jobs opening up for women on 24       combatant ships.        (18) In 1991, Bruyere was assigned as Commanding Officer       for the Navy Recruit Training Command at Orlando, Florida. At       the time, it was the Navy's only boot camp that included       women. Bruyere oversaw the training of 30,000 enlistees, one       third of them women.        (19) In 1994, Bruyere retired from the Navy as a Captain       after 28 years of service.        (20) From 2012 until shortly before her death in September       2020, Bruyere was an active volunteer at Miramar National       Cemetery, devoting almost 4,300 hours to helping visitors       locate their loved ones' graves and providing information       about veterans' burial benefits.        (21) Bruyere was buried at Miramar National Cemetery with       full military honors.        (22) In May 2021, a panel of San Diego-area members of the       Armed Forces, veterans, and military spouses recommended that       the San Diego VA Medical Center be renamed in honor of       Jennifer Moreno and an internal space be renamed in honor of       Kathleen Bruyere.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF JENNIFER MORENO DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER.         (a) Designation.--The medical center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in San Diego, California, shall after the       date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as       the Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical       Center.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be       considered to be a reference to the Jennifer Moreno       Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DESIGNATION OF MEDICAL CENTER                     PHYSICAL COMPONENT AFTER KATHLEEN MAE BRUYERE.         It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs should designate a prominent physical space within       the Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical       Center, as designated pursuant to section 2, in honor of       Kathleen Mae Bruyere.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3665.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the lives of Army Captain Jennifer  Moreno and Navy Captain Kathleen Bruyere. I thank my colleague, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin), for introducing this legislation  to pay tribute to these two distinguished servicemembers who went above  and beyond in their service to this Nation.   When Jennifer Moreno graduated from the University of San Francisco  with a nursing degree, she joined the Army. She completed airborne  training and served with Special Operations Command. As a cultural  support team member, Captain Moreno was tasked with outreach to the  Afghan women they encountered.  [[Page H6254]]    On October 5, 2013, Captain Moreno and a dozen other special  operators were struck by 12 bombs in a night raid to disrupt a plot to  kill civilians. While attempting to save an injured soldier, she was  killed.   For her heroic acts and unwavering support of her comrades, Captain  Moreno was awarded a Combat Action Badge, the Purple Heart, and the  Bronze Star.   Captain Bruyere was a true changemaker. The daughter of an Army  servicemember, Captain Bruyere joined the Navy following her graduation  from Chestnut Hill College.   She climbed her way through the Navy's ranks, becoming the Navy's  first female flag secretary. As an advocate for women servicemembers,  Captain Bruyere was featured as one of Time magazine's Women of the  Year in 1976.   Despite her high ranking, Captain Bruyere was limited in her ability  to be promoted due to the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of  1948. In a potential career-ending move, Bruyere and five  servicemembers sued the Department of Defense in 1977. The rules were  deemed unconstitutional, paving the way for thousands of women to serve  in leadership positions at sea. She retired at the rank of captain in  1994 and passed away on September 3, 2020.   Both Captain Moreno and Captain Bruyere exemplify the highest  qualities of service and are true American patriots. I was honored to  remember them both on Veterans Day.   H.R. 3665 has letters of support from the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  the Disabled American Veterans, and the American Legion, and I include  them in the Record.                                        Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                                      June 22, 2021.       Rep. Mike Levin,       Washington DC.         Dear Rep. Levin: On behalf of the sixty-four thousand       members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of       California, I am writing to endorse your bill, H.R. 3665 to       rename the San Diego Medical Center after U.S. Army CPT       Jennifer M. Moreno as the ``Jennifer Moreno Department of       Veterans Affairs Medical Center'' and support the designation       of a component within the facility in honor of U.S. Navy CAPT       Kathleen M. Bruyere.         It is our privilege to help recognize and support the       contributions of women in military service, notably CPT       Moreno, who we believe embodies the requirements necessary to       rename a federal building in her honor. The panel convened in       the San Diego consisting of area service members, veterans       and community leaders, made the recommendation after review       of CPT Moreno's distinguished service to her country, and who       was ultimately killed in action during a deployment to       Afghanistan in October 2013.         In addition, we endorse naming a prominent space within       the facility after CAPT Bruyere, a longtime San Diego       resident who helped shape the military's policies on sexual       discrimination and expanding opportunities for women in the       Navy.         The VFW is committed to improve VA medical centers       services for women veterans through legislative advocacy and       fully support your work on behalf of our nation's veterans.         Thank you for your time and consideration.             Sincerely,                                                      John G. Lowe,       State Commander.                                   ____                                         Department of California,                                                       July 7, 2021.      Re: H.R. 3665 to rename the San Diego Medical Center       Hon. Rep. Mike Levin,      Member of Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Mike Levin: As Commander of the Department of       California Disabled American Veterans representing over       70,000 DAV Life Members in the State of California and in       recognition of our fallen veterans and their survivors. I am       writing to endorse your bill H.R. 3665 to rename the San       Diego Medical Center after U.S. Army Capt. Jennifer M. Moreno       as the ``Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs       Medical Center'' and support the designation of a component       within the facility in honor of U.S. Navy Capt. Kathleen M.       Bruyere.        It is our honor and priveledge to recognize and support the       contributions of women in armed service, notably Cpt. Moreno,       who's service went above and beyond the requirements       necessary to rename a federal building in her honor. DAV will       never forget Capt. Moreno's service this country and ultimate       sacrifice. The panel convened in the San Diego consisting of       area service members, veterans, and community leaders, made       the recommendation after review of Capt. Moreno's       distinguished service to her country, and who was ultimately       killed in action during a deployment to Afghanistan in       October 2013.        In addition, we endorse naming a prominent space within the       facility after Capt. Bruyere, a longtime San Diego resident       who helped shape the military's policies on sexual       discrimination and expanding opportunities for women in the       U.S. Navy.        Thank you for your support of America's disabled veterans       and their survivors.            Sincerely,      Michael Kerr,        Commander.      Daniel Contreras,        DAV National 3rd Vice Commander, Adjutant/CEO.      Gerald G. Wilson, Jr.,        Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                The American Legion,                                        Department of California,                                          Sanger, CA, July 21, 2021.       Hon. Mike Levin,       Washington, DC.         Mr. Levin: The American Legion Department of California is       proud to support H.R. 3665, which includes the renaming the       San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center after Army Capt.       Jennifer Moreno and renaming a component therein after Navy       Capt. Kathleen M. Bruyere.         Since its founding in 1919, the American Legion has served       veterans, servicemembers, and communities throughout our       nation. Our commitment to serving all veterans has been one       of the main pillars outlining our purpose. As the United       State Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to make       strides in the way it supports and cares for women veterans,       I believe by renaming VA facilities after brave female       veterans it is a great step towards recognizing the       contribution of this nation's woman warriors.         On behalf of the 80,000+ American Legion members in       California we urge congress to take action to rename this       facility to honor these two women veterans who embody the       true essence of duty and service to our community, state, and       nation.             Respectfully,                                              Autrey B. James, Jr.,                                              Department Commander.    Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support the naming of the  San Diego, California, VA Medical Center in honor of Captain Moreno and  Captain Bruyere, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin), my good friend who is back from  a very warm welcome at the White House, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity and also the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Bost) for facilitating this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3665, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Colonel John M. McHugh       Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS DISAPPROVAL OF COURSES                     OFFERED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER                     LEARNING THAT DO NOT CHARGE VETERANS THE IN-                    STATE TUITION RATE FOR PURPOSES OF SURVIVORS'                     AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Section 3679(c) of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``or 33'' and inserting       ``33, or 35'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following       new subparagraph:        ``(D) An individual who is entitled to assistance under       section 3510 of this title.''; and        (3) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and 33'' and inserting       ``33, and 35''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 1095.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1095, the Colonel John M.  McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act.   This bill codifies an important protection for beneficiaries using  the Department of Veterans Affairs Survivors' and Dependents'  Educational Assistance Program, or DEA. Through the DEA program, VA  helps cover the cost of a beneficiary's school or job training.   This bill requires that public institutions of higher learning only  charge in-State tuition for those utilizing the DEA program.   There are currently over 150,000 beneficiaries utilizing the DEA  program. These beneficiaries are the survivors of brave women and men  who died serving our country and the dependents of 100 percent service- connected disabled veterans.   Currently, this benefit equates to about $11,000 a year for most  students. With the increasing costs of higher education, $11,000 does  not cover all of a beneficiary's tuition costs at most schools,  including public institutions where the student beneficiary would be  considered out-of-State.                                time  1730    S. 1095 would provide parity for students using the DEA program with  the Forever GI Bill program by requiring public institutions to charge  in-State tuition for student veterans. This legislation has the strong  endorsement of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for  bringing this legislation to the floor, and I urge the rest of my  colleagues to support this legislation to ensure the survivors and  dependents of those who bravely serve our country are not hindered by  tuition costs when pursuing their education.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 1095, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H6257]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5671) to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  furnish seasonal influenza vaccines to certain individuals, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5671         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO                     FURNISH SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINES TO CERTAIN                     INDIVIDUALS NOT ENROLLED IN PATIENT ENROLLMENT                     SYSTEM OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 2 of the SAVE LIVES Act (Public Law 117-4; 38       U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended--        (1) by striking ``a vaccine for COVID-19'' each place it       appears and inserting ``a vaccine for COVID-19, a seasonal       influenza vaccine, or both'';        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by inserting       ``and seasonal influenza vaccines'' after ``vaccines for       COVID-19''; and        (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, seasonal influenza       vaccines, or both'' after ``vaccines for COVID-19'';        (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``Vaccine Allocation''       in the heading and inserting ``COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation'';        (4) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f);        (5) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new       subsection (e):        ``(e) Limitation on Furnishing Seasonal Influenza       Vaccine.--A seasonal influenza vaccine may not be furnished       under this section after April 29, 2022.'';        (6) in subsection (f), as so redesignated--        (A) by redesignating paragraph (6) as paragraph (7); and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following new       paragraph:        ``(6) Seasonal influenza vaccine.--The term `seasonal       influenza vaccine' means any product that is--        ``(A) approved by the Food and Drug Administration;        ``(B) commercially available; and        ``(C) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention for the prevention of influenza in a particular       season.''; and        (7) in the section heading by striking ``vaccine'' and       inserting ``and influenza vaccines''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5671, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5671, as amended. Earlier this  year, the SAVE LIVES Act was passed unanimously by both Chambers and  signed into law. It has allowed VA to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to  veterans, their caregivers, and spouses.   With flu season in full swing and COVID-19 continuing to burden our  health systems, the urgency to provide both flu and COVID vaccines has  never been greater. Public health officials are clear. It is completely  safe to receive both inoculations, even at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I introduced this legislation to build on  the lifesaving work of the SAVE LIVES Act and allow VA to administer  flu vaccines in addition to COVID-19 vaccines to the same population.  By providing easy access to both vaccines at the same time, I hope we  can begin to reduce the burden on the broader healthcare system this  winter.   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Bost), the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for  working with me on this legislation in committee.   I ask all my colleagues here today to join this bipartisan effort and  support this important legislation to increase access to both vaccines.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, and before asking all of my colleagues to  join me in passing H.R. 5671, I truly believe that passing the SAVE  LIVES Act and passing this legislation today, H.R. 5671 constitutes one  of the best moments that I have had as chairman where all four corners  of the Congress came together.   Ranking Member Bost, I know walked a very delicate balance to bring  his Members together, but I appreciate his persuasive abilities with  his side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage that we do this more, and I have no  doubt that we really did save lives. And I have no doubt today that we  are going to save lives because of this effort before us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
