 Mr. President, soon the Senate will pass a supplemental  appropriations bill that provides much needed relief for folks across  the country who are recovering from hurricane and wildfire devastation.  While some of these resources will impact Texans who are recovering  from Hurricane Harvey, I stress that much more will be needed in my  State.   I will make one point abundantly clear, which is that Harvey has not  been permanently handled in Texas. It is not over and done with, and it  is not time to just move on. There was the storm, and now there is the  storm after the storm.   Nearly 2 months after the hurricane--the most extreme rain event in  U.S. history--many Texans are still waiting for normalcy to return to  their debris-littered lawns and their torn-up living rooms, to their  daily routines, their workplaces, their children's schools. The waters  may have receded, but their troubles have not.   I have read, for example, about people having to wait 2, 3, or 4  hours before they can actually even speak to Federal Emergency  Management Agency, FEMA, representatives, who themselves are  overwhelmed with requests that are related not only to Hurricane Harvey  but to Hurricane Irma's devastation in Florida and to Maria's flooding  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Never before do I remember  a series of natural disasters hitting our Nation in such quick  succession.   Yet I know, even as the inspectors are still evaluating damaged  properties--moving as quickly as they can--FEMA is hiring hundreds of  additional staff in the next few weeks to help with the backlog. I am  hopeful this will help my fellow Texans, who have grown frustrated and  discouraged by the procedural hurdles. As of Sunday, three shelters  remain open in Texas, and over 60,000 people are living in hotels  because their homes--reeking of mold--are still not ready, and they  will not be for months.   A teacher I heard about is living on a cot in her classroom while her  house undergoes repairs. The mayor of Rockport, one of the most  devastated communities along the gulf coast, has said that perhaps one- third of the destroyed areas in his town may never be rebuilt. Hundreds  of businesses have yet to reopen, and if they don't, it will make  matters much tougher on local residents than they already are. The  number of houses yet to be repaired is even larger than the number of  businesses. The mayor of Port Aransas says that 75 percent of the homes  in his community--three-quarters, just imagine--were severely damaged  or destroyed. These are just a few of the reasons the situation demands  ongoing attention, as well as the full extent of government resources.   Last month Congress got started--that was before subsequent  hurricanes occurred--and the first wave of disaster relief was $15.25  billion. Then the House passed the second wave, a $36.5 billion  disaster relief package to replenish FEMA's nearly depleted coffers and  to address the National Flood Insurance Program, which should help pay  some Texas claims.   Here in the Senate, the cloture vote on this second wave was  yesterday, and I am glad we moved to end debate. It is clear to me that  Texas will need significant additional Federal assistance for our  recovery efforts. As I have told folks back home, we don't expect to be  treated any better than anyone else, but we are not going to be treated  any worse.   Last week, I spoke with President Trump and OMB Director Rick  Mulvaney, and they made a commitment to me that there would be another  funding request coming over in mid-November that would include Texas- specific hurricane relief. I realize that the folks impacted by Irma  and Maria are also reeling, as well, and we want to make sure that we  are locking arms with all of our colleagues who represent the areas hit  by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and also those hit by the  wildfires out West. We are working together.   I appreciate the President's pledge, and I will continue to work with  Senator Cruz and with Governor Abbott to make sure that Texas has what  it needs, not only to make a full recovery but a timely one as well.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, at lunch, the President of the United States will be  joining us to discuss a different but very important topic, and that is  Federal tax reform. We want to make sure that hard-working Americans  get to keep more of what they earn in their paycheck and that we can  help them improve their standard of living by reducing their tax  burden.   We passed a budget resolution last week that was step one to getting  where we need to be. So I am excited the President is joining us today,  and I look forward to hearing his ideas. It is important that we all  pull together to accomplish this joint goal. We appreciate his  engagement on the issue, which has been clear from day one.                     Congressional Review Act Resolution    Finally, Mr. President, I would like to bring up one additional  matter that we will be voting on soon, and that is the repeal of the  recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule, which governs how  community banks, among others, resolve disputes with consumers. This  rule that the CFPB issued bans using arbitration. Arbitration is a  widely accepted method of resolving disputes between consumers and  banks and other financial institutions, and it actually increases the  benefit that flows to the consumer, as opposed to the alternatives,  which are class action lawsuits that enrich lawyers, whereas consumers  get pennies on the dollar.   The CFPB's own data shows that the rule would transfer hundreds of  millions of dollars from businesses to plaintiffs' lawyers over the  next 5 years. According to a recent Treasury report, the rule could  generate 3,000 additional class action lawsuits over the next 5 years,  costing businesses $500 million in defense fees alone and obviously  enriching those who would benefit more than the consumers themselves;  that is, their lawyers.   The CFPB data itself shows that the vast majority of class action  lawsuits delivered next to no relief to the class in question-- consumers. And the Treasury report found that the agency, the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, failed to consider much less onerous  alternatives, like increased disclosure or a more limited ban.   I have been around long enough to remember that back in the eighties  there was a movement called alternative dispute resolution, led by the  Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who pointed out that while  access to courts was absolutely critical, unfortunately, because of the  delay and expense of litigation, alternative dispute resolution  mechanisms could actually benefit consumers more if they chose to  resort to those alternative dispute mechanisms, and that is exactly  what arbitration is. I believe that the CFPB has gone above and beyond  its authority in eliminating this very meaningful way for consumers to  get compensated when they get involved in disputes with their bank or  other financial institutions, and there is no reason for us to enrich a  class of lawyers who bring these lawsuits and see consumers end  [[Page S6728]]  up with pennies on the dollar, which is what the status quo would  permit.   Thankfully, we have the power of the Congressional Review Act to  overturn the rule, as the House has already done. I urge my colleagues  to repeal the CFPB arbitration rule so that we can get rid of this  harmful regulation, which imposes obvious costs and offers invisible  benefits.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know, for people watching this debate,  it is easy to be confused. You hear the Democratic leader claiming that  this is about the people who have no power, fighting against the most  powerful institutions this country has to offer in their, somehow,  trying to disadvantage them when, in fact, the opposite is true.   In situations like this, it is frequently a good thing to follow the  money. The reason the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to ban  arbitration as a means of alternative dispute resolution is that the  trial lawyers, who benefit from the huge attorneys' fees awards, do not  like the idea that they are, basically, being boxed out of that dispute  resolution system; whereas, we know from the studies that have been  done that consumers actually benefit from a cheaper, more efficient,  more timely way of resolving disputes with financial institutions with  which they may have disagreements.   Back in the eighties, I still remember when I was a district judge in  San Antonio, TX. Warren Burger, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme  Court, made the point that it was so expensive and so time-consuming  for individual citizens to resolve their disputes in courts of law that  we needed what we all called an alternative dispute resolution system  that was able to resolve these disputes in a more timely, more cost- effective sort of way, recognizing that very few people could afford to  pay a lawyer an hourly fee or even a contingent fee for protracted  civil litigation. Basically, ordinary consumers were frozen out of the  dispute resolution process and were denied their day in court.   That system actually worked pretty well, including arbitration,  which, according to a Federal statute--the Federal Arbitration Act--is  an impartial tribunal that, basically, decides these disputes in an  efficient, cost-effective sort of way. In fact, we know from the  studies that have been done that consumers actually benefit more from  arbitration than they do as members of a class in class action  lawsuits, where consumers typically get pennies on the dollar and the  class counsel, the lawyers involved, are, perhaps, awarded millions of  dollars.   You have to ask the question: Whose benefit is that for? Is it really  for the consumers or is it for the lawyers? I think the answer is  pretty clear. It is not for the consumers. So, when I hear our friend  across the aisle, the distinguished Democratic leader, cry crocodile  tears for consumers, really, those are for the class action lawyers who  are not part of the arbitration process.   I think it is really important to make that point, which is that  every single study that has been done shows that consumers actually  benefit from arbitration compared to ordinary litigation. Not everybody  can afford to be O.J. Simpson and hire the very best lawyers in America  and try a case for weeks on end at a cost of millions of dollars. It  just, simply, does not work that way for most people. So this is a very  efficient, cost-effective, fair way to resolve those disputes in a way  that consumers benefit.   I do not understand, honestly, our colleagues across the aisle,  except for their desire to demonize banks and large financial  institutions, but it is not just large banks and financial  institutions; it is community banks. We are talking about contractual  arbitration provisions, which allow consumers to benefit from a means  to resolve disputes with their local community banks, and they do not  often involve huge amounts of money. Typically, lawyers are not going  to be interested in a claim that do not involve much money, which is  why most often, when one does get litigated, it is in the context of a  class action, in which they aggregate all of these claims for thousands  of people. Then, as we know, typically, it ends in some sort of  settlement from which the consumers get coupons--frequently, no money-- and the class lawyers reap millions of dollars.   Our colleagues across the aisle act as if they have the better part  of this argument when, actually, they are arguing on behalf of one of  the narrowest, wealthiest special interests in America today, and that  is the trial lawyers. They act as if they are the friend of the  consumer when they are actually arguing to the detriment of the  consumer, because the consumer benefits from this less expensive, more  efficient, more timely resolution of disputes with financial  institutions, which is through contractual arbitration.   There is the fact that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  which is sort of an anomaly in our system, is accountable to no one and  not susceptible to oversight by Congress because of the way it was  created. It is not even funded by appropriations of Congress as other  government agencies are. It is really a rogue agency in so many ways-- not accountable to the American people, not subject to the oversight of  Congress, not dependent upon Congress for the appropriations to,  basically, do its work. So, when it overreaches like this and  essentially outlaws this efficient, cost-effective, impartial way of  resolving civil disputes, this is, perhaps, the greatest demonstration  of the abuse that was wrought by the creation of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau in the first place.   When consumers benefit and trial lawyers do not, I don't know how you  can justify the arguments on the other side, except to say that they  are the party of the trial bar and that they really don't care about  the consumers because they realize that consumers will end up with  pennies on the dollar and that they would actually be better off in  using the arbitration provisions in these contracts that are subject to  the Federal Arbitration Act. Actually, this is a Federal law that  mandates the procedures by which these arbitration panels are created.  It is not as if the banks get to choose who sits on the arbitration  panels. It is not as if they get to pick the judges in the cases. These  are nonpartisan arbitrators who will decide the facts in law and let  the chips fall where they may.   I, for one, am not buying the crocodile tears of our friends across  the aisle. They are not arguing in favor of the consumer; they are  arguing on behalf of the trial bar, which gets rich on these cases.   It is not just the fact that this handful of cases from which the  lawyers get rich solves the problem, because there are many people who  have legitimate disputes that need to be resolved from which the  lawyers just simply turn away and say that that case will not get me  enough money to justify my involvement. So guess what. You are out of  luck. Good luck in finding a lawyer to litigate your case for $100 or  $200. You are just not going to get a chance to do that. If a class  action lawyer will not take the case, you are out of luck. I guess our  friends across the aisle do not care.   As for the fact that consumers could get recourse through arbitration  in their using the Federal Arbitration Act--from an impartial panel  that will decide what the facts are and grant awards without having to  go to the expense and time associated with ordinary litigation--they,  simply, do not really care about that.   I would say, notwithstanding the dystopian view of our friends across  the aisle that, somehow, this is a great conspiracy against the  forgotten man and woman in our country, the opposite is actually true.  What they are trying to do is advocate for the rich  [[Page S6756]]  and the powerful--the trial lawyers in America--and against the best  interests of the consumer, who benefits from this contractual  arbitration provision.   I hope that our colleagues will not be persuaded by the arguments on  the other side, because there is just, simply, no factual basis for  them. I hope that in a little while here, when we vote on this  congressional resolution of disapproval, we will have a solid vote in  the disapproving of this ban on the use of alternative dispute  resolution to resolve disputes, because a ``no'' vote, basically, is a  vote on behalf of the rich and the powerful--the trial lawyers in  America--who get enriched by the status quo in the absence of an  alternative dispute resolution system.
