 Madam Speaker, today we mourn the lives of over 100,000  Americans who lost their lives and pray for the recovery of over 1.75  million Americans infected by COVID-19. This represents an unimaginable  pain, but the numbers really don't tell the story. I want to take a  moment to describe four central Floridians we lost by this pandemic:   Rob Carlos, Poinciana, a retired Disney cast member known as Pirate  Bob;   Dr. Neil Powell, Orlando, an Air Force veteran and dentist who made  central Florida smile brighter;   Bill Smith of Lake Wales, an electrician who worked on national  launchpads and the Magic Kingdom;   And Virgilio German of Kissimmee, a retired carpenter, who loved to  sing Mexican ballads to his wife, Gigi.   These and other stories throughout central Florida will continue to  be in our hearts as we do everything we can to get beyond and survive  this pandemic.                            ____________________
