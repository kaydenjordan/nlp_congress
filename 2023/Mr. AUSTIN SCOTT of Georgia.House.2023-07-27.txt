 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Crisp County Sheriff's Deputy Tyee Browne, who lost his life in  the line of duty on July 10 at the age of 26.   Deputy Browne was a graduate of Mary Persons High School in Monroe  County, and he served the Crisp County community with the sheriff's  department for less than a year before he was shot and killed in a  traffic stop.   Before serving Crisp County, he served our Nation in the Army  National Guard and dedicated his life to protecting others. His service  is a powerful reminder of the sacrifice our law enforcement officers  make daily to keep our communities safe.   To the family of Deputy Tyee Browne, I offer my deep condolences on  behalf of Georgia's Eighth District. I  [[Page H4059]]  thank Sheriff Billy Hancock and the Crisp County Sheriff's Department  for their dedication to protecting our district and the people of  Georgia.                            ____________________
