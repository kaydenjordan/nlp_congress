 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my grave concern  with the fiscal state of our Nation, as someone who spent over a decade  in the finance and accounting profession.   We are going to be voting on the Fiscal Responsibility Act today. One  side will say how great it is, and the other side will say how awful it  is, but really it is meaningless, considering the immense gravity of  our fiscal problems.   As Michelangelo once said: ``The greater danger for most of us lies  not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our  aim too low, and achieving our mark.''  [[Page H2671]]    Unfortunately, this Congress is not setting its aim high enough for  all of the people who died for our Republic and for future generations.  I hope we will have a backbone to do it someday.                            ____________________
