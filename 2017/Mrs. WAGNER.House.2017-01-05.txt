Mr. Speaker, I stand today to express my extreme  disappointment in the Obama administration's betrayal of Israel. The  administration's destructive decision to undercut Israel has given  leverage to anti-Israel boycotters and anti-Semites across the world.   This act screamed of personal vengeance and hostility, directly  harmed American interests, and undermined peace in the Middle East. It  was a cowardly and foolish parting shot for an administration that  flagrantly ignores serious global challenges--Syria, Aleppo, ISIS,  Iran, China, Russia, and the list goes on.   By abstaining from the vote to censure Israel, President Obama vetoed  the U.S.-Israel alliance and violated the faith of the American people.  I look forward to a new day, to a new administration that will support  Israel and refuse to abandon our allies on the world stage.                            ____________________
