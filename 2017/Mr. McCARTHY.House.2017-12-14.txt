 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30  p.m.   On Tuesday and the balance of the week, the House will meet as early  as 10 a.m. for legislative business.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   This list will include several bills from the Science Committee that  are part of the House Innovation Initiative. These bills support  Americans pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and  math, with a focus on veterans and individuals historically  underrepresented in those fields.   Mr. Speaker, my friend and I recently cohosted the third  Congressional Hackathon, and I think he and I would agree that STEM  education is an issue of national competitiveness, and I look forward  to the House passing these bills next week.   In addition, the House will consider two measures from the Financial  Services Committee. First, H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform  and Transparency Act sponsored by Representative Sean Duffy. This bill  will improve the quality of the proxy research while increasing  transparency for public companies and their investors.   Second, H.R. 3312, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act  sponsored by Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer. This bill replaces  Dodd-Frank's arbitrary thresholds with a process that analyzes each  institution of its individual risk factors.   Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider the conference report to  accompany H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act sponsored by Representative  Kevin Brady. This historic legislation will cap off a 31-year journey  to reform America's broken Tax Code. We will double the standard  deduction, making the first $12,000 of income for an individual and  $24,000 for a family tax free.   We will increase the child tax credit because investing in families  is among the most important investments we make. We will reduce the tax  rate on small businesses to the lowest rates that have been seen in 40  years. And we do all this while simplifying the Tax Code so Americans  can file in minutes on a form the size of a postcard.   Republicans have championed cutting taxes and growing our economy for  years, and I am excited to deliver this important promise.  [[Page H9919]]    Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are expected,  including legislation related to government funding and a number of  other end-of-the-year priorities. I will be sure to inform all Members  if additional items are added to our schedule.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   I expect the report to be filed online tomorrow. As you know, you  have got to go through and make sure, from joint tax, filling in the  dollar figures, and all anticipation is it will be online tomorrow for  all of America to read.    Yes, that is accurate.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   There were a lot of questions about the schedule. I took notes  because there were a lot of things said, but let me first make sure I  can try to get through all of them.   You first mentioned many times, what I did not mention. Now, I was  asked a question, when would we vote on the tax bill, so I want to be  very clear. I answered the question. I said, yes, we will vote on it  Tuesday. You said you have heard that it could be Tuesday, so I just  said yes, and I didn't mention others because I wasn't asked other  questions. But now that you have, let's walk through this.   One of your first arguments was debt. Do you realize, in this  progrowth, tax-cutting, job creation bill, if it just grows four-tenths  of 1 percent, it pays for all of it?   But what is interesting here is--don't take my word for it--what  happens every day to the market when they realize Congress and the  Senate is 1 day closer to passing the tax bill? Everybody with a 401(k)  gets a pay raise.   The market has set more than 59 records since the election and our  movement to passing a tax bill, and that is for all Americans who  invested. Everybody's retirement is getting a little better because of  it.   Now, what about on the jobs perspective? Well, Broadcom, which was  created in America but left America based upon the current Tax Code, on  the day of the announcement of our tax bill, said: We are coming back.  It is not just that we are bringing so many jobs back. We are going to  spend $3 billion a year in R&D. We are going to spend $6 billion in  manufacturing.   And that is $20 billion a year in revenue for that company that is  going to pay taxes now in America.   But I wonder, that is a big company. Do you know what I just read the  other day? A company announcing they are going to Syracuse, New York,  based upon our tax bill.   Yes, things are changing in America. People are excited about it.   But it is not just those that are going to hire these thousands of  Americans to work. I want to make sure it happens in Maryland as well,  so I wanted to look at your district, so here we go. My good friend  represents Maryland's Fifth. He has done it for quite some time. Here  are a few facts.   Currently, you have 47 percent of filers in Maryland Five that take  the standard deduction, so they will be better off because they will  get a doubling the day the President signs it.   Another 11 percent have itemized deductions that are less than our  new higher standard deduction, so they, too, will save. Not only are  they going to save money, they are going to save time. Instead of  spending weeks trying to fill out a tax form, it is going to be done in  minutes. And you know when they fill out their tax form, they are going  to get money.    But they don't have to wait until April 15. Not only in your  district, but across this country, check your check come February,  because you know what is going to be in that check? More money because  the standard deduction goes up.   So that is 58 percent of my friend's district is better off on day  one. But from what you tell me, you don't think that is good enough to  vote for. A majority of your district is better off on day one. That is  not even talking about the small businesses.   Do you know, the small businesses in your district, those that are  earning $400,000, they are going to save $19,000. I know we are dear  friends, but I am not sure if I have ever known that you have owned a  business.   You know my background. When I was 20, I started my first business.  There were three lessons I learned that have never left me: I was the  first one to work; I was the last one to leave; and I was the last one  to be paid.   This is going to create more entrepreneurship, more opportunity, and  more people are going to be hired.   Now, I know you are worried about the debt, but it just strikes me,  this year, you voted for a budget just a couple of months ago--I am not  going to go back to another Congress--that increased the deficit by  $6.8 trillion. So we are only worried about the debt at certain times?   Well, this bill is actually going to grow the economy, as we have  watched quarter after quarter after quarter of the administration.   Now, I have got to make sure I got all of it.   You talked about hearings. We have had 59 public hearings. We printed  out, before we even ran to continue the majority, about what we would  do on tax.   But let's get to the core. That was your district. Let's say to all  Americans, it doesn't matter where you live. So anybody, it doesn't  matter if you sit on that side of the aisle, on this side of the aisle.  It doesn't matter if you are Democrat, Republican, or you are a  Socialist. It doesn't matter what you are. You are an American first.   And you know what your constituents are going to see? Let's take the  average family, the average family of four, making $55,000. You can  write this down. You know how much tax they are going to pay? Zero.  Zero. But that still is not good enough for you.   It is very interesting, in my social science studies, what the party  on the other side of the aisle used to say they were for. I believe,  back in the day, if you would have stood up here and said, ``I have got  a tax bill that is going to make sure the average family of four, on  the first $55,000, is going to pay zero,'' they not only would be  excited, they would vote for it.   And you talk to me about bipartisanship. I really think that is a  question for you, bipartisanship.   Is it bipartisanship when we reach out to you about CHIP, about  healthcare for children, a place not to play politics?   We even stopped a hearing and a markup that we had scheduled well in  the future because you came to us, your side of the aisle, and asked us  to because you thought you could come to an agreement. Then we were  told by your leadership, no, nobody could vote for it. We put things in  the bill that we thought you would even want, but, no, you still voted  ``no.''   And how many times have you told me on this floor, I think it was  just a few months ago--and I will quote you, if I may--about government  funding, because I was concerned because I had read some articles in  The New York  [[Page H9921]]  Times that suggested, ``as a minority party struggling to show  resistance in an era of President Trump, the Democrats are now ready to  let the lights of government go dark.'' I read that to you because I  wanted to know was that true or was that false.   Well, you said to me, when I asked my friend whether that rumor was  true, he replied: ``. . . nobody on my side is talking about wanting to  shut down the government. We don't want to shut down the government''  was your quote.   You continued to say: ``I would assure my friend that it is neither  our intent nor our desire. As a matter of fact, we want to work quickly  to avoid that happening. That is not good for, obviously, the American  people; it is not good for managers trying to plan on how to deliver  services; and it is certainly not good for our Federal employees. So I  would want to work with you to make sure that doesn't happen.''   Mr. Speaker, that was in March, just 9 months ago. I wonder what  changed in those 9 months because just last week--and I tell my friend,  there was no partisanship in putting a continuing resolution on the  floor for 2 weeks. There was no poison pill on this side of the aisle.  It was a clean one. And I watched, sitting at this desk, how the vote  was going, and I watched the other side, Mr. Speaker. I watched people,  not that they just voted ``no.'' They were whipped into the position to  vote ``no.'' I watched the tally. And once that tally got past the  magic number of 218, I watched my good friend put his thumb up, because  he gave the okay to those 14 Democrats in his conference that were  sitting there, that were told not to vote until it passed. I just  wonder what happened to bipartisanship on something that is so  bipartisan.   I know the thousands of Federal employees you have in your district,  but that is just--I listened, Mr. Speaker, to the leader of the  Democratic Party on the other side who said, just 2 days prior, the  only person talking about the shutdown is President Trump. Well, the  only person taking action and whipping to get to a shutdown was on this  floor.   We have had open hearings, Republican and Democrats. We have had an  open, bipartisan, bicameral conference. They have walked through an  entire bill. We have made sure Americans are going to get a tax cut and  jobs are going to be created. It is already happening before the bill  is even signed.   I am not sure if I didn't mention something else, because you try to  correct if something was not mentioned. But I want to make sure I  answered all those questions for you because I know, not just in your  district, that every family of four making $55,000 will pay nothing,  that all the small businesses that are going to hire new people--and I  differ from you.   Maybe you will whip strongly against it like you whipped strongly  against the CR and keeping government open, But I still think, when I  look upon that tally on the tax bill, I think there will be some on  your side. And why do I think that? Because they told me so.                                time  1200    But I still think, when I look upon that tally on the tax bill, I  think there will be some on your side. And why do I think that? Because  they told me so.   The only difference will be, at the end of the day, if they don't, if  you keep the strong arm, and instead of releasing the thumb up once it  passes and put it down, that is the only reason we won't have  bipartisanship on the floor that day.   But I believe in America. I believe in this floor, and I believe in  the individuals who fight so strongly to get here to represent their  constituents; that they know the new jobs in their district, they know  how much those families will save, and they will not let politics get  the best of them. They will go against the tide to stop it. They  believe that it will even be better. I look forward to that day.   I also look forward to my friend coming back to the quote he told me  9 months ago, because you know what? It is close to Christmas. We have  military men and women defending us. The gentleman talked about that  bill the President recently signed that, yes, he worked to strong-arm  with me, that is going to make government more effective, efficient,  and accountable. It also had a pay raise for our men and women. And  when he voted ``no,'' he told them they weren't getting their raise.  But worse, he went even further.   The gentleman questioned whether they could actually have the funds  to continue the battle where they needed to be. We have been through  shutdowns. We know nobody wins. I believe what he told me 9 months ago.  I just want him to come back.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I do look forward to these colloquies, and I first want to make sure  history has it right. 137 economists sent a letter to Congress  supporting our tax reform effort and saying it will accelerate growth.  I don't know if the gentleman dislikes these 137, but these are  economists. I don't judge the difference.   History says President Obama added more than $8 trillion to the  national debt.   Now, how does that measure against all of the others?   Well, that is more than 43 prior Presidents combined. That is what  history shows.   My friend is correct. He has been here much longer than I have. He  actually had the majority for 40 years. He didn't balance the budget  during that time. There was a common denominator that got the budget  balanced in those 4 years, and that was the Republican majority who had  to fight for it to get there.   The gentleman raised some other issues. He brought an issue up with a  number of days. I don't think we should waste any time. He brought an  issue up of we don't have a cap agreement to be able to work forward.  It wasn't the gentleman, but it was his leader on the other side who  decided not to go to the meeting at the White House.   The gentleman says that we should not waste our time on the floor. It  wasn't this side, but we did have to take time up on this floor to make  a motion to impeach the President. We took that time up on the floor.  We didn't take the time up for CHIP and for the others.   I do remember the quote from my friend. We differ, sometimes  philosophically, but we are friends and we are friends because I admire  him. I admire principles. There are times when I have watched the  gentleman stand for what he has said for years, and maybe his party has  a different position. He doesn't hide from it. It is what he told the  American public he would do, and he voted that way. And he will stand  and oppose me because it is what he said in the past and what he said  he would do.  [[Page H9923]]    But this is not something new. He has always said: ``Funding our  government is not a game. When one side wins and the other side loses,  a shutdown is not a political football to be tossed around so  casually.'' I was personally shocked last week.   I wondered what would have happened as I watched your operation whip  people to a ``no;'' as we watched the time click; as you watched, you  held those who stood by the voting booth who wanted to vote ``yes'' but  could not.   Had we not gotten enough votes to keep government open, would your  side of the aisle have applauded? Would your side of the aisle thought  they won victory?   And you do go back and it is correct, there were 90 Members on this  side of the aisle who didn't vote for a CR, but you, like myself,  understand a CR is usually a responsibility of both because it is  bipartisan. No one is getting anything, and no one wants to end in that  position.   We don't want to be in a CR and we don't want to vote for a CR. That  is why we came to you so many times in the past when it came to CHIP.  But, yes, I understand sometimes people can use it for politics. Let's  push it all to the end so maybe we get an advantage with something  else.   We wanted an agreement. That is why staff of those four leaders have  been meeting, and actually came to a pretty close agreement.   So what do they do next?   Take it to the next level. Let's go to the White House because the  White House has been in those meetings at the same time because the  President has to sign the bill, the Senate, the House, and leaders on  both sides. But when that meeting came just a few short weeks ago, your  leaders wouldn't show up. And I take you at your word that you are  willing to sit down. The rest of your leadership has to be willing to  sit down, too.   But this idea that we want to hold government hostage, so many times  I have heard the gentleman in the past say that was wrong. He asked  about the things that haven't been done.   The thing I love the most--I believe in metrics. They have to be  honest metrics. I will share them with you because I share them with  our side of the aisle because I want us to be judged. I want us to know  exactly where we are. And if we are not where we said we are going to  be, we should actually work harder.   So I took the first Congress of every new President since George H.W.  Bush. I wanted to see how many bills came through committee. Because  the gentleman is right. When he read the ``Young Guns'' book--and I am  not saying to buy it in any shape or form because I don't want to cause  any ethics issues, but I don't get any money from it anyway. I give it  to the veterans.    I don't even know if it is in print. I want the bills  to come through committee because that is where the expertise is; that  is where the open public process is; that is where amendments get to be  offered, won or lost. More bills in a first Congress since George H.W.  Bush have gone through committee.   Now, let's measure how many bills have gotten off this floor.   Does the gentleman realize that more bills have been passed out of  this Congress than any Congress in the first term of a President in  modern history back to George H.W. Bush?   And we did it by going through a transparent, open process; exactly  what we pledged we would do in that book. So, yes, I am glad you read  it and I am glad you took the words, and I would love to show you the  graphs.   But let's walk back to this: government funding is important. Let's  talk about it. Here are the facts: By mid-July, all 12 appropriations  bills passed both subcommittee and full committee. That was July. On  July 27, we passed the four appropriations bills off the House floor,  which provided for critical national security. Now, my friend and  nearly all of the Democrats voted ``no.''   On September 14, we passed the remaining eight appropriations bills  off this floor. Now, my friend and nearly all of the Democrats voted  ``no.''   But the most disappointing vote, as I mentioned, was last week on  December 7 to fund the government. My friend and the Democrats all  voted ``no.''   When I was young and I didn't always get my way, I would go to my  parents and I would complain. But it is really odd that we got to this  floor in a different nature, that someone would complain about  something not getting done and never vote for anything.   Mr. Speaker, I like my friend. I want my friend, who, for decades,  has talked about not playing games with the funding of government. I  don't know where you have gone, but I want you to come back. I think  America needs you back. I think that leadership will be important for  both sides. And I will tell you, I would have been disappointed in you  if I watched you applaud if you were successful in shutting down the  government. Because I know that is not the man you are. I know that is  not the person and the principles of what you stand for.   All of those votes that you said this side of the aisle didn't vote  for, I stood and voted for those because leadership is different. We do  take votes that are tougher than others. We do have to put politics  aside, and we do have to look out for the best of this country. It may  not be the mood of the politics on TV that maybe wants to fight more,  or throw another motion on the floor to impeach, but there is a time  that we should rise above.   I think going into the end of this year, we should think anew and act  anew. I think America should not see a bad Christmas because one side  of the aisle wanted to shut it down, and not for any other reason than  they voted ``no'' on all of the bills that would have kept it open. If  you had a cause, if you had a desire, and if you had a big desire, you  would have shown up to the meeting to actually get the answer.   We could have a cap agreement. We could be done with it. We could  make sure our men and women get the raises they deserve. We could make  sure that those in battle theater have every opportunity so they are  able to carry out their mission that we asked them to do in the safest  manner possible. That is what I want to see.    Will the gentleman yield?    Let's make sure we are comparing apples to apples. That  had a debt ceiling in it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   But if you are going to compare a CR that you said was simple, it is  not simple. We all know that. If you are going to compare it to the CR  that you voted against last week, that had no debt ceiling on it. You  explained to me numerous times of how many CRs you voted for in the  past in this body and how Democrats came over with Republicans.  Because, you know what, you and I both know that is normally how it  works.   A CR is not an advantage for one or the other. And this is what I am  most upset with. Our Founding Fathers created a body that could have  compromise. But for some reason, in today's society, it is not just  that you want one side to win. You want to try to crush the other side.  That is not crushing one side or the other. That is actually hurting  the American public.   So in a situation where we know that a continuing resolution is going  to be short term, in 2 weeks, yes, I would expect half of the votes to  come from your side and half of the votes to come from ours. That is  what has happened in the past. I am just wondering where that went.    Will the gentleman yield?    The gentleman is correct. There are many times we have  worked together, on sanctions, on homeland and others. We work very  well together.   The gentleman knows I came to you about CHIP when the committee was  directed, on your side of the aisle, not to do anything with the  majority party, so I came to you because of our history.    I came to the gentleman. I was under the impression. A  Member came to me and said that. Maybe that is not true. Maybe that is  not what Mr. Pallone wants.   But I came to you and said: Let's get together and work this out. I  don't want to make CHIP partisan in any shape or form. We met, and we  tried to work.   You came back to me and said: You have to go alone.   I said: That is not how I want to do it.   So what we did was we took everything we heard from the hearings. In  good faith, the chairman of that committee, Greg Walden, stopped a  markup because you requested--not you, but your ranking member. They  weren't prepared. They wanted more time.   So we want to do everything in our power; but, at the end of the day,  you couldn't be there. Twice, your side of the aisle voted against  CHIP. You can't argue against it now. You voted against it.   When you talk about appropriations, I am very proud of what we did on  appropriations. We haven't been able to do that in quite some time. But  there were, in those first four bills--every single one of those 12  bills went through subcommittee and full committee. There were 126  amendments on the first four and 342 on the second.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   No. That is why I want you to join with me and get the Senate to  move, because, as the gentleman knows, you don't control the Senate  when you have 51 or 52 Members. Do you know what happens? It takes 60.   Now, I don't firmly believe in that, but that is the way they play it  over in the Senate. That is why, when you don't have a cap agreement,  that you need all four leaders to go to the White House. But when the  two won't show up, the best thing to do is, is you don't show up, then  don't complain I don't have an agreement.   The best way to complain is get all 12 bills off this floor with a  simple majority. If that is good enough for America inside Congress, it  should be good enough on the Senate side. But, unfortunately, that is  not the case. So your side is able to hold it up, and I'm ashamed of  that as well.    No. No. No.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   The gentleman is correct about compromise, but there is a real big  difference between compromise and obstruction, to obstruct, when you  talked about the Senate. It takes 60 votes to even get on to a bill. I  know as well as my friend that you can utilize the Senate and the  leadership of the House to stop something if you want to.   I will tell my friend that I am disappointed. What will you say to  the 62,000? What will you say to the 62,000 Federal employees who live  in your district? What will you say to them about every quote you made  in the past that you should not play games with funding and shutting  down the government?   You may think you can make that statement here. Your leader may think  that she can say that only the President was talking about a shutdown.  The President never whipped one vote to shut it down. He whipped it to  stay open. History won't be kind.   Yes, we will come to a conclusion next week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I understand what his words said. I also watched his  actions. I also watched what he did last week to get Members to vote to  keep it open because things did change. There was not compromise even  though the bill was a compromise because there was no poison pill in  it.   If we are going to carry everything ourselves, maybe we should put  something in it. It was a compromise, but, unfortunately, you changed  on the other side. You decided now is the time to shut the government  down, try to blame somebody else.   The American people will see through that, and I will guarantee you  that 62,000 people who work for the Federal Government in the Maryland  Fifth District will not take that as an answer.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns on Friday, December 15, 2017, it adjourn to meet on  Monday, December 18, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
