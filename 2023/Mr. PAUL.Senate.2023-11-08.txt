 Madam President, reserving the right to object, we are here  once again faced with the proposal to ban TikTok and to forbid millions  of Americans from expressing their opinion.   This is not a subject that we should entertain lightly. If there is a  better national strategy to permanently lose elections for a  generation, I have not heard of it. Banning TikTok, a social media app  used by 150 million Americans, primarily young Americans, is a recipe  for electoral disaster for Republicans.   This GOP strategy comes just after an election year in which a  national survey indicated that 71 percent of young women and 53 percent  of young men voted for the Democrat candidate for Congress. Now,  admittedly, many Democrats have also joined Republicans in calling for  this ban, but like most issues, the blame tends to stick to Republicans  more.   The banning TikTok strategy also comes while the GOP simultaneously  complains of liberal U.S. social media companies canceling and  censoring conservatives. So without a hint of irony, many of these same  ``conservatives'' now agitate to censor viewpoints they don't like.   So on the one hand, Republicans complain about censorship, while with  the other hand, these same Republicans advocate to censor social media  apps that they worry are influenced by the Chinese. The concern over  TikTok seems to be over what the social media app might do. Propagating  hysteria and fear of subtle communist subversion from the People's  Republic of China through a social media app in the 21st century, is  similar or akin to basically McCarthyist paranoia.   Today, in a move that Chairman Mao himself would approve, the Senate  considers banning a platform because it seems one Member doesn't  approve of how it handled content about the war between Israel and  Hamas.   Just this week, the Senator from Missouri wrote to Secretary Yellen:         While data security issues are paramount, less often       discussed is TikTok's power to radically distort the world-      picture that America's young people encounter.    The Senator from Missouri wants to censor TikTok users who are biased  against Israel. The Senator from Missouri wants to ban the speech of  young TikTok users he disagrees with. Sounds more like a Chinese  solution than an American one.   The Chinese solution to combating speech those in power do not like  is to ban it. In fact, TikTok is banned in China. So is YouTube,  Twitter, and Facebook.   There is an app similar to TikTok called Douyin that operates in  China, but it is heavily censored. Try to search for ``Tiananmen 1989''  on Douyin, and nothing will come up.   The American solution, with the high value that our country places on  the free exchange of ideas, is to counter flawed ideas--flawed ideas-- or falsities with more speech and better arguments that persuade and  reveal the truth.   Do we really want to emulate China's speech bans? Do we really want  to intrude into the lives of Americans and deprive them of their First  Amendment right to receive and consider information?   The ham-fisted ban under consideration today empowers the government  to determine what Americans are allowed to see, hear, and contemplate.  The headline of an opinion piece recently by John Tamny says it all:  ``Nauseating Harassment of TikTok Presumes Americans Will Be Saved From  Chinese Authoritarianism If U.S. Politicians Act Like Chinese  Authoritarians.''   A ban on TikTok is what they do in China. You are worried about  Chinese communism and Chinese authoritarianism, and you want to ban  speech in our country? It is inconsistent with our very American  primary principles. TikTok must be banned, the censors say, because  they are owned and controlled by the Chinese Communist Government. In  actuality, TikTok is owned by international investors and two Chinese  software engineers who designed the app.   Does TikTok do the Chinese Government's bidding? Well, go to the app  and search for Falun Gong, the anti-communist religious sect that is  persecuted in China. Go to TikTok and search for videos advocating  Taiwan's independence, criticism of Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. These  videos are all over TikTok that are critical of Chinese positions. That  is why TikTok is banned in China.   TikTok is banned in China, but you want to ban it in the United  States. We are going to become like the Chinese to prevent the Chinese  from taking over our country?   As Drs. Mueller and Farhat of Georgia Tech write, ``If nationalist  fears about Chinese influence operations lead to a departure from  American constitutional principles supporting free and open political  discourse, we will have succeeded in undermining our [very] system of  government more effectively than any Chinese propaganda could ever  do.''   We will be doing what the Chinese want. If you are worried about  becoming Chinese communists, you will now be emulating them by banning  speech. To those who were worried that the Chinese Government might  somehow have access to millions of American teenagers' info, realize  that all social media, regardless of whether their ownership is foreign  or domestic, sucks up all your personal data, and this is what people  provide voluntarily.    And, people, if you don't want your information--don't join these  groups. If you are going to ban TikTok, what is next? Arguably, several  domestic apps censor conservatives more. I know because I have been  censored and banned by American companies. I have got no love lost with  any of these companies. I have a host of complaints about domestic  social media platforms that cancel conservatives, but I am not in favor  of banning them or forcing them to accept my opinion. They are private  companies. They have speech rights. I have speech rights, but I don't  have the right to force them or to ban them if they don't post my  stuff.   If you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them. But  don't think any interpretation of the Constitution gives you the right  to ban them. The First Amendment isn't necessary to protect speech that  everybody likes or everybody accepts. The First Amendment exists to  protect speech that might be unpopular or might be controversial.   I hope saner minds will reflect on which is more dangerous, videos of  teenagers dancing or the President of the U.S. Government banning  speech. For me, it is an easy answer. I will defend the Bill of Rights  against all comers, even, if need be, from Members of my own party.   I object.    Madam President, the bill before us to ban TikTok is  clearly infringement of the First Amendment. It would ban 150 million  people who regularly post on TikTok from expressing themselves.   It is without question speech. These folks, the 150 million users of  TikTok, would have standing in court to sue over infringement of their  speech.   This isn't about who was advocating for this or that in the Middle  East or in Israel or in the Hamas situation. The Supreme Court has  looked at speech over time, and there is some speech that is not  protected.   But in Europe, they have gone one step further, in the sense that  they ban all kinds of speech in Europe. You have certain opinions that  can't be expressed. We have never done that in our country. You can  have a foul, despicable opinion in our country, and we counter it with  better ideas. We counter it with better speech. It is very, very  dangerous to the primary principles of our founding, of our government,  of our Bill of Rights, of the Bill of Right that is listed first, and  that is freedom of speech. And my hope is that this will not be seen as  a serious proposal and will be rejected.    Mr. President, I rise to honor and pay tribute to one of  the most patriotic and dedicated Kentuckians I have had the pleasure of  knowing, Mrs. Bobette Franklin.   A Bowling Green, KY, native, Bobette is a graduate of Western  Kentucky University. She married Steve Franklin, and they made their  home in Bowling Green. They have been married for 24 years and have a  son, Noah, who is their pride and joy.   Upon being elected to office in 2010, I set out to hire a director of  constituent services for my State office in Bowling Green. I asked for  recommendations for the very best and received one clear answer from  many: Bobette Franklin. Bobette began her congressional career in  constituent services with Congressman Ron Lewis and, upon his  retirement, continued her career with Congressman Brett Guthrie. I was  thrilled when Bobette accepted my offer to lead my constituent services  operation. My constituent services team is second to none and would not  be known for their stellar reputation throughout the Commonwealth of  Kentucky without Bobette's leadership. Anyone who knows Bobette knows  she takes tremendous pride in her work and strives to excel in all  aspects of her life. Her commitment to excellence and attention to  detail is evident in every interaction she has with Kentuckians who  need assistance, no matter the size or scope of the request. During  Bobette's tenure in my office, she has overseen more than 20,000  constituent service cases, which has directly impacted thousands of  Kentuckians and people across the Nation.   While Bobette has served Kentuckians in numerous ways, her  outstanding reputation is most evident through her outreach and  advocacy for veterans. Bobette has received numerous awards from the  veteran community. In 2016, the Southern Kentucky Veterans Council  presented her with its Distinguished Service Award for over 20 years of  devoted service assisting veterans. And earlier this year, the  Department of Defense Joint Executive Council of Veterans presented her  with an award in recognition of her work for veterans and their  families across Kentucky.   After 29 years of Federal service and nearly 13 years in my office  alone, Bobette has decided to retire and close this chapter in her  lifelong commitment to serving her community and her country. I will  always be thankful to have had Bobette as a part of my team from the  very beginning. Thank you, Bobette, for your service to Kentucky and to  this country.                            ____________________
