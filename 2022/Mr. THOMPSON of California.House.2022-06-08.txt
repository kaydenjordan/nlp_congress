 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support  of this bill, the Protecting Our Kids Act. I point out that every  argument we have heard against it so far is nonsense.   Every student deserves to feel safe in school, and every parent  should know that their child is safe when they walk out of their house  in the morning.   After each mass shooting, too many people are content to offer their  thoughts and prayers. The Protecting Our Kids Act is more than thoughts  and prayers.   I was proud to work on this bill with Chairman Nadler, Chairwoman  Jackson Lee, and all of our colleagues who have contributed bills and  input that have made this bill the important bill that it is.   As a lifelong hunter, gun owner, and as a combat veteran, I believe  in law-abiding citizens' ability and right to own firearms. As a gun  owner, I believe that all responsible gun owners have that  responsibility to support efforts to help keep our schools, streets,  and communities safe from mass shootings and from the everyday gun  violence that often goes unreported by the media.   Each provision in this bill helps reduce gun violence, and it saves  lives. Raising the age to buy an assault weapon saves lives. Limiting  magazine capacity will limit the carnage of mass shootings, and it  saves lives. Going after traffickers keeps guns out of the hands of  people who shouldn't have them, and it saves lives. Safe storage helps  reduce suicides and keeps kids safe at home and school, and it saves  lives. The unregulated sales of bump stocks and ghost guns is tearing  up our communities; regulating ghost guns and regulating bump stocks  saves lives.   This bill respects the Second Amendment while taking steps to protect  our communities from the epidemic of gun violence. None of our careers  are worth more than the lives of the children in this country. We need  to pass this bill, and I hope we do it with strong bipartisan support.
