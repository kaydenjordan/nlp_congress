 Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the  Equality Act, and as a co-founder and Vice-chair of the House Equality  Caucus, I want to voice my full support of this bill. I want to thank  the Speaker and Chairman Nadler for acting quickly on this legislation.  I also want to thank my friend Rep. Cicilline, as well as my fellow  caucus co-chairs, for their efforts.   Our federal laws still do not protect lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender and queer people from discrimination. Almost two-thirds of  LGBTQ Americans report having experienced discrimination--and LGBTQ  people of color often face compounded injustices, including higher  rates of unemployment and health challenges.   The Equality Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing,  credit, education, public spaces and services, federally funded  programs, and jury service. The Equality Act will help ensure that  LGBTQ Americans can play their vital role in our nation and our  communities without fear of harassment and discrimination.   As a Black woman in America, I know what it is like to face injustice  and inequality. I applaud House passage of the Equality Act as an  historic milestone in our effort to build a more just society. I hope  the Senate will pass it quickly and send it to the President for  enactment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of raising the  federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. I want to thank my friend and  colleague Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez from New Mexico's 3rd  district for convening this special order hour. Raising the federal  minimum wage to $15 an hour is one critical step towards ensuring an  equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal minimum wage  has been at $7.25 for more than a decade. This is the longest period of  time without an increase in the minimum wage in US history. Inflation  has eroded this amount to a fraction of its previous value. We must  increase the wage and we must do it now.   Someone working a full time job at the current federal minimum wage  only earns $15,000 a year. That is a disgrace. A full time worker in  this country should be able to put  [[Page H714]]  food on their table and a roof over their head and be able to pay their  other expenses with their earnings. Many of these minimum wage workers  are essential workers, helping our communities endure this pandemic.   Raising the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour isn't a cure-all.  In high cost urban areas, such as the one I represent in the Bay Area,  fifteen dollars an hour still is not enough to get ahead. But raising  the federal minimum wage has been shown to help lift wages across the  board for people at the lower end of the income scale.   A fifteen dollar minimum wage would give 27 million low-wage workers  a raise and lift nearly one MILLION people out of poverty. But this  isn't just an economic need--it's a racial justice imperative. Many  people of color have been paid poverty wages for too long--deepening  the long standing racial and economic divisions in this country.  African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans are all much more  likely to make only the minimum wage.   Recent polling shows that 72 percent of Americans, a vast majority,  support raising the minimum wage, including Republicans and  Independents. We need to ensure workers get paid living wages,  especially in times of crisis. Raising the minimum wage is a necessary  first step to growing our economy and recovering from this pandemic.  Additionally, it will also lessen the need for full time workers to be  receiving public assistance. When you raise the wages of the lowest- paid workers, it is good for our communities and our country. Those  workers can then spend money in their communities, boosting local small  businesses and our entire economy.                            ____________________
