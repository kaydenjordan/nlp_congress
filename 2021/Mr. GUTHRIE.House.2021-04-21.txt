 Madam Speaker, I rise today very concerned about the  deadly threat of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.   Last week, the Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on  this exact issue.   Here are the facts: More than 88,000 overdose deaths were reported by  the CDC in a 12-month period ending in August of 2020. This is a record  for the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.   In 2018, synthetic opioids, which includes these dangerous fentanyl  analogues, were involved in 744 deaths in just Kentucky. I learned from  a substance use healthcare provider in my district that almost all  their patients have some sort of fentanyl in their system. Many of the  patients are not aware of it themselves. Just last month a 2-year-old  in Kentucky died from exposure to fentanyl; therefore, I support a  permanent solution of scheduling fentanyl analogues.   Last week, some of my colleagues--and we had witnesses--tried to  argue that a long-term solution for banning fentanyl is a social  justice issue. In fact, one witness shared, ``it is being argued that  fentanyl class scheduling is suddenly unnecessary because of the low  number of prosecutions to date--eight. However, eight mandatory minimum  sentences in 3 years, four of them being members of a cartel, proves  that prosecutors are not going after low-level users.   The witness also argued that this scheduling of fentanyl analogues-- the decrease of new fentanyl analogues coming to this country was 90  percent.   If someone is being unjustly prosecuted for fentanyl analogues, then  that should be addressed.   However, not scheduling fentanyl analogues, when we had a witness  testify it drops 90 percent being imported, would be deadly for  Americans since fentanyl and its analogues are responsible for  thousands of deaths each year.
