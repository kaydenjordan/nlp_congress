 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague from the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Ros- Lehtinen; as well as my colleague, the ranking member of the Middle  East and North Africa Subcommittee, Ted Deutch, for their work on this  important piece of legislation.   The United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Extension Act would  ensure Jordan's continued eligibility for a more streamlined process  for accessing defense articles, acknowledging the very difficult  challenges that Jordan faces from extremist organizations both within  Jordan and on its borders.   The legislation supports a new memorandum of understanding to enhance  Jordan's military capacity and economic growth, and it authorizes an  enterprise fund that would invest in Jordan's economy.   I am glad that this bill reflects our comprehensive relationship with  Amman, which is so vital at this point in history in the region.                                time  1715    The legislation acknowledges the key role Jordan plays as a partner  against ISIS, or Daesh, and as a home to thousands of Iraqi, Syrian,  and Palestinian refugees.   I would like to note the important work that Jordan does in  facilitating cross-border assistance to Syria, preventing further  destabilization. Jordan also plays a critical role in the Israeli- Palestinian peace process, and I hope that Jordan and Israel are able  to soon return to the normal level of diplomatic cooperation.   The bottom line is this: it is in our national security interest to  work with Jordan on the security threats facing the region, as well as  opportunities for economic growth within Jordan. This bill will help  advance both of those goals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to go ahead and close now and just reiterate  what I said earlier. This is such important legislation and really  achieves both goals on the security front as well as the economic  front.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  chairman.   We have one of the two main sponsors for the bill who has just joined  us and wants the opportunity to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing up my bipartisan  bill, and I especially want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr.  Royce of California, for his action and moving on our bipartisan piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I believe cybersecurity is the national security  challenge of our time. Cyber warfare is inexpensive to carry out and  easy for adversaries to hide behind, making it especially damaging,  difficult to detect, and impossible for the victim to quickly respond.   In January, the CIA attributed to Russian military hackers a cyber  attack that crippled computers in Ukraine last year. This attack wiped  data from the computers of banks, energy firms, senior government  officials, and an airport. The virus went on to affect computer systems  in Denmark, India, and even here in the United States.   For years, Putin has been using Ukraine as a field test for these  cyber attacks. Ukraine, after all, is on the front line for these  nation self-directed cyber attacks, and they are potential harbingers  of attacks on the United States.   By assisting Ukraine, we can learn best practices to best defend  ourselves. For these reasons, I introduced H.R. 1997 with my Republican  colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, which  encourages cooperation between the United States and our ally Ukraine  on matters of cybersecurity and requires a report from the State  Department on best practices to protect ourselves--to the benefit of  both nations.                                time  1730    In Ukraine, it is no coincidence that cyber attacks against itself  increased when the Ukrainian people self-organized to demand an open  and democratic society in 2014 contrary to Putin's interests.   Days before the 2014 Presidential election, hackers infiltrated  Ukraine's Central Election Commission with a series of attacks that  disabled the website in an attempt to sow distrust in the outcome of  the election of President Poroshenko.   In December of 2015, hackers remotely shut down power at three  regional electricity distribution companies, creating a power outage  affecting more than 200,000 people. We can only imagine what it must  feel like to lose electricity and heat during the winter in Ukraine.   Cyber attacks, unfortunately, have only continued since. Ukraine's  next Presidential election is just next year. Our own elections are  right around the corner later this year, and, of course, the  Presidential election is in 2020.   Both the United States and Ukraine have clear interests in  strengthening our cyber defenses. Moreover, our cooperation toward this  goal will send a strong and important signal of Western support for  Ukraine at a time when it is literally fighting to protect its own  democracy.   We must stand strong with the people of Ukraine and our NATO allies  and come together in furtherance of our cybersecurity defenses. This  bill is a reasonable first step to do just that, and it is obviously  very timely.   I thank Chairman Royce again, as well as Ranking Member Engel for  their hard work and support for this bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support it. It is time we address this vital issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is someone who grew up  a strong Philadelphia sports fan.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Let me say one thing that strikes me and saddens me. When I hold  townhalls or meetings with constituent groups, usually some variation  of this comment will be made: Why don't you guys get along? Why don't  you do something?   Actually, I then tell them about our work on the Foreign Affairs  Committee. I tell them that, under the leadership of Ed Royce and Eliot  Engel as well as the other members of the committee from both sides of  the aisle, a lot of work does get done and a real spirit of cooperation  prevails in our committee meetings. I think that this piece of  legislation is an example of that.    This is an important issue. We are standing up for Ukraine, but as I  mentioned earlier, we are also doing what is clearly in the best  interests of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, at the risk of sounding immodest, I urge passage of my  legislation, legislation that I have worked on very hard with Brian  Fitzpatrick.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   I would like to recognize Congresswoman Virginia Foxx and Ranking  Member Eliot Engel, along with Congressmen Randy Hultgren and James  McGovern, for their work on this bipartisan piece of legislation.   The War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act would clarify the War Crimes  Rewards Program. This program is an important tool for bringing to  justice the perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and  genocide.   Under current law, the United States uses the program to pay rewards  for the arrest or conviction of foreign nationals who commit some of  the most heinous acts. In the past, bounties have helped find fugitives  from the former Yugoslavia to Rwanda.   The statute providing authorization for this program specifies that  rewards can be paid to individuals who furnish information leading to  arrests or convictions for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or  genocide, as those terms are defined under the statutes of  international tribunals.   H.R. 3851 clarifies that the Secretary of State can also choose to  pay rewards for arrests and convictions that take place under the laws  of the United States as well as other individual countries.                                time  1745    Under certain circumstances, prosecutions will have the greatest  impact when they take place in domestic courts within the societies in  which those crimes occur. Doing so can help ensure the parties  understand the law, witnesses have access to the trials, and public  awareness is maximized. The clarification provided in this bill will  help build on the program's success, providing the State Department  with clear authority to use rewards for a wide range of prosecutions,  when appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Congresswoman Foxx, as well as Ranking  Member Engel, for their legislation, as well as the other legislators  who worked on it.   This bill will help ensure that the War Crimes Rewards Program can be  used to the greatest possible effect, bringing the perpetrators of war  crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide to justice. It will give  the State Department clear authority to use rewards for perpetrators  who are brought to justice under international tribunals and in  domestic courts.   America must stand against human rights abusers and war criminals  abroad, and this bill helps advance that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
