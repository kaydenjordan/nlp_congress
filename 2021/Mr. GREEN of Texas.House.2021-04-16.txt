 Madam Speaker, whatever employers are doing in  the main is not enough. Workplace violence is the third leading cause  of job death. Whatever they are doing is not enough.   Twenty percent of registered nurses in one survey reported an  increase in workplace violence. Whatever they are doing is not enough.   It is not unreasonable to ask people to have a plan to protect  employees. It is not unreasonable to ask them to enforce that plan. And  it is not unreasonable to provide cover for those who report these  workplace violence incidents in the form of protection from retaliation  from reporting. It is just not enough.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   I rise to call to the attention of our Nation a symbol of national  shame. And I rise to give commentary as I read a letter that I intend  to send to certain colleagues. This is not a letter that I enjoyed  producing, that I enjoyed writing, but it is necessary, in my opinion,  to call to the attention of my colleagues a symbol of national shame,  the Russell Senate Office Building.   This building is right here on the campus in Washington, D.C. It is a  building with the name of a person who should not be honored in such a  way. It reads--and for our purposes today, I will simply say, ``Dear  Colleague.''   It is with love of country above politics that I send this request to  remove the name of the racist Democrat--commentary: I will be saying  some things about Democrats today because this involves Democrats-- remove the name of the racist Democrat, Richard Russell, from the  Senate office building named in his honor and revert to using the  building's original name, the Old Senate Office Building until the  Senate selects another nominee who will be honored.   The letter goes on to say:   In 1972, the Old Senate Office was renamed the Russell Senate Office  Building, hence for 49 years, the Old Senate Office Building has been a  symbol of national shame bearing the name of an unapologetic white  supremacist.   Richard Brevard Russell, Jr., was a segregationist who worked  throughout his career to disenfranchise and dehumanize people of color  in our country, especially Black Americans.   He participated in his first filibuster of a civil rights bill in  1935. And in 1937, he was a part of the filibuster against antilynching  legislation. In his 1936 reelection campaign, Russell committed himself  to preserving and ensuring white supremacy in the social and economic,  as well as the political life of our Nation. He also blocked the  passage of a 1942 bill to eliminate poll taxes, and stated:         If progressives want to force social equality and       commingling of races in the South, I can tell you now that       you are doomed to failure.    In 1956, Russell coauthored the ``Southern Manifesto'' with Senator  Strom Thurmond in opposition to integration of public schools after the  Supreme Court unanimously ordered it in Brown v. The Board of  Education.   In 1964, during a civil rights movement, he proposed a voluntary  relocation program, a racial relocation program to adjust the imbalance  of the African-American population between the 11 States of the old  Confederacy and the rest of the Union.   My dear friends, this causes me to reflect upon the Trail of Tears.  The Trail of Tears, quite similar but not nearly the same as what  happened. The Trail of Tears was from 1938 to 1939, when the Cherokee  Nation was forced to give up its land east of the Mississippi and to  move to an area that we now know as Oklahoma. Thousands died.  Thousands. Many others suffered; they cried. It was a trail of tears.   I suppose this was then-Senator Russell's contemporary version of  what could have been a Trail of Tears for African Americans. What a  shame and sinful thing to propose that people simply be relocated  because you have the power to do it, not because it was the right thing  to do, not because it was a thing that would be done with some degree  of honor and dignity. It was done because he had the power and he had a  racist mentality, Democrat Senator Richard Russell.   That same year, Russell and 17 fellow Democrats--all senators--along  with one Republican--let me pause for just a moment. Some things will  bear repeating. I will repeat that. But I know that there seems to be  this unwritten rule that you don't say negative things about Democrats  if you are a Democrat. But there is a higher calling, and we all have  to speak the truth about injustice and that trumps any of these rules  related to politics. You have to put country above politics, and the  people within the country should be always placed in a position such  that justice will prevail.   So I will read again: That same year, Russell and 17 fellow  Democratic senators, along with one Republican, led the 60-day  filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I don't care what  party they were in; it was wrong.   When this filibuster failed and President Lyndon B. Johnson signed  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law, Russell, a Democrat, led a  southern boycott of the 1964 Democratic National Convention as an act  of rebellion. He was wrong then and it is wrong now.    Regrettably, dear friends, our Nation's history is stained with the  bigotry of men like Russell. And although racism still dwells in our  country, we do not have to honor it, and that is what we are doing with  the Russell Senate Office Building. We are honoring bigotry and racism.  We are honoring, in a sense, the anti-Semitism and the hate and the  bigotry that he espoused and was proud to do so. He never repented. He  never atoned. And taxpayer dollars are being used to maintain this  facility, the Russell Senate Office Building.   Friends, by reverting the name of the Russell Senate Office Building  back to the Old Senate Office Building, we are given the opportunity to  atone for honoring this bigotry for 49 years, as well as we are given  the opportunity to honor someone worthy of having a Senate office  building named in their honor. This would be the appropriate thing to  do.   And by the way, I, in no way, advise that a certain name should be  utilized. I simply say remove the name of Russell, and after removing  the name of Russell, let it revert to the name that it had, the Old  Senate Office Building. And in so doing, the Senate has time to select  a new nominee, another person to be honored.   No building maintained with taxpayer dollars should bear the name of  Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.   To this end--and it actually reads ``therefore''--I will introduce a  resolution calling on the Senate to remove  [[Page H1886]]  the shameful name of Richard Brevard Russell, Jr., from the taxpayer- maintained Senate office building bearing his name. And I am going to  request serious consideration of this resolution in the 117th Congress.   But that is not all that I plan to do. I shall not go into great  detail about the rest of what I intend to do, but I will say this: When  I go over next to the building, I will go over there to stand in the  area where there is a statue of Richard Russell, Senator Richard  Russell, a statue. There is a rotunda. He is the prominent figure;  there are no other statues in that rotunda. If you traverse the  Capitol, you will find many statues but none, in my opinion, honored to  the extent that Richard Russell is being honored. He has an area unto  himself.   I am going to go there, and I am going to point out that this is the  statue that we have to move. I am going to talk about it from the  statue itself, and I am going to point out some things about the  statue, because we can't tolerate this kind of legacy being  perpetuated. It is time to end it. It is time to stop glorifying  bigotry and hate with taxpayer dollars.   How can we insist on renaming military bases that bear the names of  racist Confederate generals and others, or military people, and then  have an office building that we traverse on a daily basis that we are  in and out of that is named after a racist and a bigot? How do we  justify this?   We have the power--not the House--but the Senate has the power to  change this. I will ask that the Senate change it, but I will also go  over to the Senate. And I want to let the world see what's going on in  that hallowed facility wherein we allow to occur what we desire to  change--and what we are changing, in fact, in other facilities. It is  time to change it.   Madam Speaker, I believe that this change should take place  immediately. It has been 49 years. We have had enough time to consider  it.   Madam Speaker, 49 years under various Presidents; 49 years Democrats  in control, Republicans in control.                                time  1430    Some would say that we are just realizing how insidious this  invidious behavior has been. Well, now that we know, we ought to move  posthaste to change that which we could have changed many years ago.   I love my country. I have great respect for people who hold public  trust. But I do believe that when we hold public trust, it is important  for us to point out these kinds of circumstances that demean the  reputation of the United States of America.   This symbol of national shame puts a stain on the notion that we  believe in liberty and justice for all. It puts a stain on the notion  that all persons are created equal, endowed by their creator with  certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness. It puts a stain on the notion that we would speak to the  world about their shortcomings but won't address one that the  government has the power to change. It is shameful. This has to change.   Now, there are some who would want the change to take place, but they  don't want it to appear as though someone has called this change to the  attention of people and that they somehow will feel that it was done  because it was called to the attention of the public.   Friends, when others speak out about injustices against other subsets  of society, I have always been there to fight for that change, and I  will continue to be there to fight for that change. It doesn't have to  originate with me. If it is something that requires a righteous  movement to make a positive change, I am going to be a part of that.   I am going to continue to support and fight for the rights of persons  in all the various subsets of society who have been discriminated  against. Just today, I was on the floor to fight for the rights of  people who work in certain venues, who are being hurt, harmed, and some  even die. That is my calling. That is why I was sent to Congress. I  wasn't sent here to go along by trying to get along, not calling to the  attention of my constituents and this country the changes that have to  be made.   This is where I stand. This is where I will not retreat from. This is  a position that means something to me and my constituents, and it ought  to mean something to every person in this country.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time. I thank the leadership for  the time. And I thank the people who have taken the time to hear these  words. But there is much more to be said and much more to be done about  a symbol of national shame.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
