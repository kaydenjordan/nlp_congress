 Mr. Speaker, I will just take a minute of your time to  follow up on what Congressman Garrett just said. It seems to me, in my  lifetime--I am not an expert on foreign affairs--there are good things  the United States has done, and bad things. But the worst things are,  when people who are counting on us, people who we set up and relied on  us, we decide to leave them to whatever will happen.   I think, in particular, a much bigger thing is when we stopped  funding people in Vietnam. Obviously, during the Obama administration  leaving Iraq, we left all sorts of people who were our friends, and  created a huge vacuum. I am just very afraid today, and I would  encourage President Trump to reconsider the decision to withdraw what  troops we do have in the Syrian area because we have a lot of allies  who felt they could count on the United States, whom I am afraid now  will be left to whatever other forces in the region--who are not  friendly to Western values--left to whatever they want to do with them.  And I hope that is being taken into account right now.
