 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Navajo  code talker Alfred Newman, who passed away this week.   Mr. Newman was one of the last surviving members of the Navajo code  talkers, a group of brave Navajo marines who used their native language  to create unbreakable codes that were used in the Pacific during World  War II.   He served our Nation with honor, from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima. He was  recently honored with other code talkers at a White House ceremony and  was awarded the Congressional Silver Medal for his service in 2001.   Mr. Speaker, Alfred Newman was a hero. He and his fellow code talkers  saved the lives of countless troops with their unbreakable codes, and  they deserve our respect and honor every day.   My prayers are with Alfred's family and loved ones and the entire  Navajo Nation as they mourn the passing of this hero and celebrate his  life.                                time  1015                        Honoring Milton Bluehouse, Sr.     Mr. Speaker, I was saddened to hear of the passing of  former Navajo Nation President Milton Bluehouse, Sr.   Raised in a traditional Navajo lifestyle, President Bluehouse  graduated from Ganado Mission School and served in the United States  Army for 3 years.   Throughout his life, he represented the interests of his community on  the  [[Page H607]]  Tribal Council before serving as president for a short time.   He had many ambitious plans to assist at-risk youth, create good- paying jobs, and expand programs to improve safety in Tribal  communities.   President Bluehouse will always be remembered for his commitment to  the Navajo people and for ensuring the Federal Government upheld its  obligations to the Tribe.   My prayers are with his family and loved ones and the entire Navajo  Nation as they mourn his passing and celebrate his life.                       It Is Time to Open Up Government     Mr. Speaker, it is time to open up government. We can  no longer think that we are not having an impact on our economy. We can  no longer think that the safety of Americans who fly in our skies or  eat the food in America is not at risk. We can no longer imagine that  the millions of families who are being impacted are not suffering.   It is time. This is the greatest Nation on Earth. It is the only one  in my entire lifetime that I have seen that has closed down government.  Our counties don't do it; our States don't do it; our cities don't do  it. But the greatest Nation on Earth can find a way to close down  government?   This should never, ever happen in our country. We should never put  our citizens through this. We have the money to pay the staff. We have  to find ways to get out of this problem and never let it happen again.                            ____________________
