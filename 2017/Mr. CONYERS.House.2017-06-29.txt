 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear at the outset of this debate that  this legislation does nothing to make our communities safer, and it  does nothing to improve our immigration system. Instead, H.R. 3003 will  trample the rights of States and localities to determine what is in the  best interest of their public safety, and it will conscript law  enforcement to enforce Federal immigration law.   The ultimate experts on community safety are communities themselves,  and hundreds of them have determined that, as community trust  increases, crime decreases. This is because immigrants will come out of  the shadows and report crimes to local law enforcement when they are  not threatened with deportation. In fact, a recent study found that  community trust jurisdictions are actually safer than their  counterparts.   Against this considered judgment, H.R. 3003 forces localities to  abandon community trust principles and mandates the conscription of  local offices into Federal immigration enforcement. Some localities, of  course, would rightfully resist this conscription. As punishment, H.R.  3003 would rob them of vital law enforcement funding that they depend  on to prevent crime, prosecute criminals, and boost community policing  ranks.   Localities, therefore, would face a losing choice: they can abandon  community trust policies and leave their communities in danger, or they  can leave community trust policies in place but forgo law enforcement  funding, leaving their community in danger.   It is important that we consider that this is more than just bad  policy. It is also likely unconstitutional for multiple reasons. First,  H.R. 3003 likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to  comply with detainer requests that drain their resources.   In addition, the bill's changes to the Department of Homeland  Security's detainer authority exacerbate the current Fourth Amendment  concerns associated with immigration detainers. The bill does not  require any particularized finding about the individual that may form  the basis of a probable cause determination and fails to provide for a  prompt judicial determination of probable cause.   The bill further compounds constitutional concerns by eliminating the  ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent,  individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral  decisionmaker.   For these reasons--and there are others--I urge my colleagues to  please oppose this dangerous, mean-spirited, and constitutionally  suspect legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), who is a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), a gentleman on the committee who has worked  tirelessly with myself and Ms. Lofgren to make this measure more  understandable.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations Subcommittee of the  House Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I venture to say that none one of us  who comes to this floor doubts that any local law enforcement, our  neighbors, do any second-guessing to arrest drunk drivers, murderers,  and others, and that they are held to the high calling of justice. I do  not want to be associated with being mild-mannered and weak on those  who would do serious harm, kill, and maim, no matter who they are. That  is not this debate.   This debate is whether or not this bill interferes with the  legitimate enforcement of the law and whether or not it takes away the  mercy that we are known for in the United States. Let me tell you why.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Fraternal  Order of Police--which, by no means, is shy about enforcing the law-- writing to oppose this legislation, saying that local police  departments answer to local civilian government, and it is the local  government which enacts statutes and ordinances.                                            National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                       Washington, DC, 27 June 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to reiterate the FOP's opposition to any       amendment or piece of legislation that would penalize law       enforcement agencies by withholding Federal funding or       resources from law enforcement assistance programs in an       effort to coerce a policy change at the local level. The       House will consider H.R. 3003 on the floor this week and       Section 2 of this bill would restrict the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS), the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance       Grant (Byrne-JAG) programs, as well as programs administered       by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.        The FOP has been very clear on this issue: we strongly       believe that local and State law enforcement agencies should       cooperate with their Federal counterparts. That being said,       withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies--      which have no policymaking role--also hurts public safety       efforts.        Local police departments answer to local civilian       government and it is the local government which enacts       statutes and ordinances in their communities. Law enforcement       officers have no more say in these matters than any other       citizen and--with laws like the Hatch Act in place--it can be       argued they have less. Law enforcement officers do not get to       pick and choose which laws to enforce, and must carry out       lawful orders at the direction of their commanders and the       civilian government that employs them. It is unjust to       penalize law enforcement and the citizens they serve because       Congress disagrees with their enforcement priorities with       respect to our nation's immigration laws.        The FOP issued a statement in January of this year       regarding the approach of the Administration on sanctuary       cities as outlined in President Trump's Executive Order. The       President recognized that it is unfair to penalize the law       enforcement agencies serving these jurisdictions for the       political decisions of local officials. It allows the U.S.       Attorney General and Secretary of the U.S. Department of       Homeland Security to make an informed decision about the       public safety impact without an automatic suspension from       Federal grant programs. In Section 2 of H.R. 3003, there is       no such discretion and it countermands the Administration's       existing policy.        The FOP opposed several bills in the previous Congress,       which were outlined in a letter to the Senate leadership, and       we will continue to work against proposals that would reduce       or withhold funding or resources from any Federal program for       local and State law enforcement. If Congress wishes to effect       policy changes in these sanctuary cities, it must find       another way to do so.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to urge the House to reject H.R.       3003's punitive approach and work with law enforcement to       find a better way to improve public safety in our       communities.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____           Committee on Migration, United States Conference of             Catholic Bishops,                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 2017.                                          Catholic Charities USA,                                      Alexandria, VA, June 26, 2017.        Dear Representative: We write on behalf of the Committee on       Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB/      COM), and Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) to express our       opposition to H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.        The Catholic Church holds a strong interest in the welfare       of migrants and how our nation welcomes and treats them. Our       parishes include those with and without immigration status,       unfortunately some who have witnessed or been victims of       crime in the United States, including domestic violence,       armed robbery, and assault. We understand the importance of       fostering cooperation and information-sharing between       immigrant communities and local law enforcement.        We oppose H.R. 3003 because it would impose obligations on       local governments that we fear--and that many of them have       warned--would undermine authority and discretion of local law       enforcement. This, in turn, would hamper the ability of local       law enforcement officials to apprehend criminals and ensure       public safety in all communities.        Furthermore, Section 2 of H.R. 3003 would deny to       jurisdictions vital federal funding related to law       enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, and       naturalization if those jurisdictions are deemed to be non-      compliant with H.R. 3003. The Catholic service network,       including Catholic Charities, works in partnership with the       federal government on a number of Department of Justice and       Department of Homeland Security initiatives, including       disaster response and recovery, naturalization and       citizenship services, and services for the immigrant,       including victims of human trafficking, and domestic       violence. These services are incredibly valuable to the       protection and promotion of the human person and in some       instances life-saving. Cutting grants related to these       important national objectives, or threat of such cuts, is not       humane or just, nor is it in our national interest.        Also, we oppose H.R. 3004 as it would lead to an expansion       of incarceration and does not include adequate protections       for people who re-enter the U.S. for humanitarian reasons or       seek protection at the border. While H.R. 3004 makes notable       efforts to protect us from those convicted of violent       criminal offenses, the legislation goes far beyond this goal       by expanding the government's ability to prosecute illegal       re-entry cases and heightening the criminal penalties in       these cases. In an era of fiscal austerity, it is vital that       important judicial resources are efficiently utilized to       prosecute and convict the most violent offenders of violent       crimes. Expanding who is eligible to be prosecuted for entry       or re-entry as well as enhancing sentencing requirements does       not advance the common good nor will it ensure that       communities are safer. Furthermore, we are concerned that, as       introduced, H.R. 3004 would also prevent vulnerable asylum       seekers and unaccompanied children, (who have presented       themselves repeatedly at the U.S. border in the flight from       violence), from being able to access protection, and instead       face fines, imprisonment or both.        We respectfully urge you to reject these bills in favor of       a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration       reform; an approach that upholds human dignity and family       unity and places a greater emphasis on balancing the needs       and rights of immigrants with our nation's best interests and       security.        The United States has a long and proud history of       leadership in welcoming newcomers regardless of their       circumstances and promoting the common good. We stand ready       to work with you on legislation that more closely adheres to       this tradition and appreciate your serious consideration of       our views in this regard.            Sincerely,                                             Most Rev. Joe Vasquez,          Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.                                        Sr. Donna Markham, OP, PhD,      President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                   ____                 [From the Houston Chronicle, Apr. 30, 2017]               Police Chiefs: SB 4 is a `Lose-Lose' for Texas                   (By Art Acevedo and James McLaughlin)         No one believes in the ``rule of law'' more than the Texas       Police Chiefs Association and the Texas Major Cities Chiefs,       which besides Houston include Austin, Arlington, Dallas,  [[Page H5323]]       Fort Worth and San Antonio. We work tirelessly to make our       communities safer, within the confines of the U.S.       Constitution, by arresting those who commit criminal actions       that threaten our communities. We specifically target those       individuals committing violent crimes and arrest anyone who       threatens the safety of our communities, regardless of their       immigration status.        Police chiefs across the state work extremely hard to       develop law enforcement agencies that build and maintain       trust, communication and stronger relationships with minority       communities through community-based policing and outreach       programs. So we know well that no good can come of Senate       Bill 4, which the state House of Representatives, joining the       state Senate, passed last week.        SB 4 requires local law enforcement to take a more active       role in immigration enforcement; this will tear down what       we've worked so hard to build up. Officers will start       inquiring about the immigration status of every person they       come in contact with, or worse, only inquire about the       immigration status of individuals based on their appearance.       This will lead to distrust of police, less cooperation from       members of the community and will foster the belief that they       cannot seek assistance from police for fear of being       subjected to an immigration-status investigation.        This is a lose-lose situation for everyone.        Distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police has       already become evident among legal immigrants. Legal       immigrants are beginning to avoid contact with the police for       fear that they themselves or undocumented family members or       friends may become subject to immigration enforcement. Such a       divide between the local police and immigrant groups will       result in increased crime against immigrants and in the       broader community, create a class of silent victims, and       eliminate the potential for assistance from migrants in       solving crimes or preventing crime.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Law enforcement officers have to be able to abide by  the law. It is unjust to penalize law enforcement and the citizens they  serve because Congress disagrees with the enforcement priorities with  respect to our Nation's immigration laws. And they are right. But they  also say that they need to build trust in our communities.   This bill destroys community trust. It also penalizes hardworking  governments of mayors and county leaders who are, in fact, trying to  run the government and ensure that victims of domestic violence and  crime, even as immigrants, are able to be treated in a manner where  justice is had.   What about the National Sheriffs' Association or the Texas Police  Chiefs in Texas' major cities who indicate that this bill will serve no  good and no good can come to a similar bill in the States?   Let me say to you, I stand with the Catholic church, and I am not  Catholic. What are our values? This church opposes the idea of our  values.   Let me be very clear as I close. We are doing the sanctuary cities  bill, but I want to know about the integrity of this place.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3003, the ``No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' which requires state and local  cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, expands DHS detainer  authority, and expands detention authority.   I oppose this bill mainly because it directly violates the  Constitution of the United States.   If H.R. 3003 were to become law, it will coerce states and localities  to cooperate with immigration enforcement, it will hurt victims and  witnesses to crimes, and ultimately make communities less safe, which  directly contravenes the stated and alleged goals of this bill.   Police Chiefs across the nation are responding to less disturbances,  not because crime is magically disappearing, but because immigrant  communities are afraid to report them out of fear of being targeted.   H.R. 3003 will completely strip state and local jurisdictions of  their ability to enact common-sense policies that breed respect and  trust and turn local law enforcement into an auxiliary arm of the  federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).   To ensure compliance, this bill coerces states and localities by  imposing penalties that will deny federal funding for critical law  enforcement, national security, drug treatment, and crime victim  initiatives.   This divisive and vindictive administrative policy abridges the Tenth  Amendment to the Constitution, which states:   ``The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,  nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States  respectively, or to the people.''   H.R. 3003 also violates the Fourth Amendment's proscription against  unreasonable searches and seizures in respect to the changes it makes  to DHS's detainer authority.   It expands upon current DHS detainer practice by broadening the ways  in which DHS can determine it has probable cause to issue a detainer  and it significantly expands the time an individual may be held by law  enforcement.   The Supreme Court has stated that the Fourth Amendment requires a  judicial finding of probable cause, usually within 48 hours of arrest.   H.R. 3003, however, allows law enforcement to hold a person up to 96  hours before DHS takes custody, and there is no mention of when the  person will even see an immigration judge.   H.R. 3003 compounds these constitutional violations by eliminating  the ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent,  individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral  decision-maker.   This bill also authorizes DHS to detain individuals in removal  proceedings without time limitation and it expands the categories of  individuals who would be subject to such a detention on a mandatory  basis.   These provisions make it substantially more difficult, if not  impossible, for individuals to obtain release on bond while removal  proceedings are pending, thus increasing detention costs and separating  families while they seek to litigate their immigration cases.   H.R. 3003 is nothing but an anti-immigrant, enforcement-only proposal  that represents another step in Trump's mass deportation plan.   Mr. Speaker, rather than forcing state and local officials into a  one-size-fits-all federal enforcement scheme, Congress and the  administration should enact legislation and adopt policies that  integrate unauthorized immigrants into our communities--approaches that  the American public supports by a wide margin.   For these reasons, I join with local law enforcement chiefs and faith  community leaders in denouncing and opposing this mean-spirited, ill- considered, and un-American legislation.   I end, Mr. Speaker, by apologizing to Mika Brzezinski, to the press,  for the horrible words that were said about a bleeding face.   There is no way that we can entrust this law or any other laws to  this President of the United States. He has lost the trust, and I will  vote for nothing until he steps down.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Crowley), our Democratic Caucus chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a former justice to the Texas Supreme Court.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a dedicated civil rights leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 7\1/2\  minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Virginia has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 is not making our communities safer. If it  was, the bill's sponsors would have heeded the strong opposition of  organizations like the National Fraternal Order of Police, who stated  that, ``withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies-- which have no policymaking role--hurts public safety efforts;'' and the  U.S. Conference of Mayors, who cautioned, ``H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for  our cities and their residents and for our Nation. It would jeopardize  public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to  litigation and potential findings of damage.''   Instead, this legislation is a down payment on the President's and  the Republican majority's mass deportation plan.   This bill, and the one that we will debate later today, is a portion  of the mass deportation bill known as the ``Davis-Oliver Act,'' which  has been cited as a priority for the Trump administration, and is  supported by anti-immigrant groups, such as NumbersUSA and the Center  for Immigration Studies.   I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3004 is an anti-immigrant enforcement-only proposal  that represents yet another step in President Trump's mass deportation  plan.   This legislation significantly expands the Federal Government's  ability to prosecute individuals for illegal entry and attempted  reentry into the United States.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say this bill is about  protecting us from criminals. But don't be fooled about the ultimate  effect of this bill. It does far more than target immigrants with  criminal histories.   For the first time, this legislation would make it a felony for an  individual who has been previously removed or merely denied admission  to come to an official port of entry to ask for reentry into the  country legally. This is true even if the individual has no criminal  history whatsoever.   For instance, the expanded offense would apply to persecuted asylum  seekers voluntarily presenting themselves at a port of entry to request  asylum under our own immigration laws.   It would reach desperate victims of sex trafficking who approach the  Customs and Border Protection officer to seek protection.   It would even extend to persons asking to enter on humanitarian  parole to donate lifesaving organs to United States citizen relatives.   Under H.R. 3004, all of these individuals could face up to 2 years in  prison simply for coming to an official port of entry to request  immigration benefits provided under our immigration laws.   Finally, this bill perpetuates the fiction that immigrants are  somehow inherently criminal. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Numerous studies examining this issue conclude that immigrants actually  commit crimes at a significantly lower rate than native-born Americans.   Given this legislation's defects, it comes to us as no surprise that  organizations across the Nation join with me in opposition. They  include:   The conservative Cato Institute, which called H.R. 3004, ``a waste of  Federal resources'' that fails to safeguard ``Americans against serious  criminals.''   Cities For Action, representing over 150 mayors and municipal  leaders, warned the bill would place asylum seekers at further risk.   And the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence,  which described how this measure, H.R. 3004, will punish victims of  domestic and sexual violence merely for requesting protection.   H.R. 3004 is not what its sponsors would like us to believe. In  truth, it is a mean-spirited bill that would have far-reaching  consequences by making it a crime to ask for benefits that our  immigration laws provide.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), our senior Representative on the Judiciary  Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.

Federal Defenders                                                of New York, Inc.                                        New York, NY, June 29, 2017.      Re H.R. 3004, Kate's Law       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chair, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Ryan, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Goodlatte, and Mr. Conyers:       We write on behalf of the Federal Public and Community       Defenders in response to inquiries for our views on H.R.       3004. We oppose the bill for the following reasons.        H.R. 3004 would make it a crime to openly and directly       present oneself to immigration officials seeking asylum,       temporary protection, or for other innocent reasons. In doing       so, the bill would incentivize people with genuine claims of       fear to enter the country surreptitiously.        Even while criminalizing essentially innocent conduct and       drastically increasing potential penalties, the bill would       purport to deprive defendants of the right to challenge the       validity of fundamentally unfair or unlawful removal orders.        The bill would transform a basic element of the criminal       offense into an affirmative defense and would thereby       unfairly place the burden on the alien to produce records in       the government's control.        The bill would unjustifiably increase potential penalties,       including for those with truly petty criminal records, and       create a significant risk that defendants, in mass guilty       plea proceedings on the border as occur now, would be       pressured to admit prior convictions that they do not have.        Finally, H.R. 3004 raises serious federalism issues and       would impinge on States' sovereign interests by ordering them       to impose certain state prison sentences thereby impeding       States' ability to manage their own criminal justice systems       and prison populations.        The bill would harm individuals, families and communities       not just on the border but across the nation. Nearly 21       percent of reentry prosecutions in fiscal year 2016 were in       districts other than those on the southwest border, in every       state and district in the country. And though there may be a       perception that illegal reentry offenders are dangerous       criminals, the motive for most people returning to the United       States after being removed is to reunite with family, return       to the only place they know as home, seek work to support       their families, or flee violence or persecution in their home       countries. Further, according to a recent Sentencing       Commission study, one quarter of reentry offenders had no       prior conviction described in Sec. 1326(b), and the most       common prior offense was driving under the influence,       followed by minor non-violent misdemeanors and felonies,       illegal entry, illegal reentry, and simple possession of       drugs. Nearly half (49.5%) had children in the United States,       and over two thirds (67.1%) had relatives in this country.       Over half (53.5%) were under the age of 18 when they first       entered the United States,  [[Page H5338]]       and almost three quarters (74.5%) had worked here for more       than a year at some point before their arrest. These are not       hardened criminals.      I. The Bill Would Make It a Crime To Openly and Directly Present  Oneself to Immigration Officials, Seeking Asylum, Temporary Protection,  or for Other Innocent Reasons, and Would Thus Incentivize Surreptitious                                   Entry         The bill would add as criminal acts in violation of 8       U.S.C. Sec. 1326, ``crosses the border'' or ``attempts to       cross the border,'' and would define ``crosses the border''       as the ``physical act of crossing the border, regardless of       whether the alien is free from official restraint.'' This       would mean that people previously denied admission or removed       who present themselves at a designated port of entry seeking       asylum or for other innocent reasons, and who intend to be       and are in fact under official restraint, would for the first       time be guilty of violating Sec. 1326.        Freedom from official restraint is an essential part of the       definition of entering, attempting to enter, and being found       in the United States under the law of most circuits. Entering       has long required both ``physical presence'' in the country       and ``freedom from official restraint.'' Attempting to enter       requires proof of specific intent to commit the completed       offense of entry, and so requires intent to enter ``free of       official restraint.'' Similarly, an alien cannot be ``found       in'' the United States unless he has been free from official       restraint. An alien is under official restraint whenever he       ``lacks the freedom to go at large and mix with the       population,'' including when he directly and voluntarily       surrenders himself to immigration officials at a port of       entry to seek asylum, protection, or imprisonment.        Thus, an alien who walked directly across the border to a       marked border patrol car and asked to be taken into custody       did not attempt to re-enter the United States because he       intended to be, and was, under official restraint. Likewise,       an alien who crossed the border after being beaten by gang       members in Mexico, in a delusional belief that they were       chasing him, with the sole intent of placing himself in the       protective custody of U.S. officials, could not be guilty of       attempting to enter. In a similar case, the government       dismissed the charges after the border patrol agent's report       confirmed that the defendant had crossed the border and asked       the agent for protection from people he feared were trying to       kill him. Similarly, an alien who went directly to the border       station and presented himself for entry was not ``found in''       the United States because he was never free from official       restraint.        Thus, under current law, an alien who directly and overtly       presents herself to immigration officials at a port of entry,       as opposed to evading official restraint, has not violated       Sec. 1326; even one who crosses the border outside a port of       entry but in sight of immigration officials, and who presents       herself directly to such officials, has not done so. But       absent the ``freedom from official restraint'' requirement,       the law would ``make criminals out of persons who, for any       number of innocent reasons, approach immigration officials at       the border.'' Argueta-Rosales, 819 F.3d at 1160. ``For       example, [an alien] might approach a port of entry to seek       asylum, or he might be under the mistaken assumption that he       has been granted permission to reenter. Under those       circumstances, the alien would not have committed the       gravamen of the offense of attempted illegal entry in       violation of Sec. 1326(a).'' United States v. Valdez-Novoa,       780 F.3d 906, 923 (9th Cir. 2015) (Bybee, J.). Because ``in a       literal and physical sense a person coming from abroad enters       the United States whenever he reaches any land, water or air       space within the territorial limits of this nation,''       ``freedom from official restraint must be added to physical       presence.'' Vavilatos, 209 F.2d at 197.        Permitting arrest and prosecution regardless of whether the       person was free from official restraint is particularly       troubling because although border patrol agents are required       by law to refer an alien for a ``credible fear'' or       ``reasonable fear'' interview with an asylum officer upon       indication that she fears persecution or has suffered or may       suffer torture, people are increasingly being turned away at       the border without the required protection screening. Under       H.R. 3004, agents would now be empowered to arrest them       rather than turn them away.        By eliminating the ``freedom from official restraint''       requirement, the bill would cast aside well-settled century-      old law from the civil immigration context that for nearly as       long has functioned well in the criminal immigration context       to distinguish illicit or clandestine entries from legitimate       attempts to bring oneself to the attention of U.S.       authorities at the border.        Since it would now be a crime to openly seek help, H.R.       3004 would have the perverse effect of incentivizing people       with genuine claims of fear to ``jump the fence'' in the hope       of not being caught and returned to a country where the       danger is real. Faced with a choice between being killed or       risking being caught and removed, the logical, life-      sustaining choice is obvious.       II. The Bill Would Perversely Criminalize Repeated Unsuccessful  Attempts to Gain Asylum, Even As Border Patrol Agents Increasingly Turn                  Away Asylum Seekers in Violation of Law         The bill would create a new crime for an alien who has been       denied admission, excluded, deported or removed three or more       times who subsequently enters, attempts to enter, crosses the       border, attempts to cross the border, or is found in the       United States, subject to punishment for up to ten years.       This would criminalize, for the first time, repeated efforts       to seek asylum that are genuine but unsuccessful, as each       attempt counts as a denial of admission or removal.        As noted above, border patrol agents are increasingly       turning away asylum seekers without referring them for       appropriate screening as required by law. Human rights       organizations have documented at least 125 cases of asylum       seekers being turned away without proper safeguards to       protect their right to seek protection between November 2016       and April 2017, often repeatedly. For example, a Honduran       family whose son was murdered by a gang after he was denied       asylum, another Honduran family whose son showed the agent a       bullet hole wound in his chest, and a Mexican woman whose       father, son, grandfather and uncle were all killed within       seven days, were repeatedly turned away without referral for       protection screening or asylum adjudication. Agents informed       people seeking refuge that the United States no longer gives       asylum, threatened them with force, or threatened to call       Mexican immigration authorities to deport them to the country       they were fleeing.        A person who presents himself at a port of entry without a       valid visa is subject to denial of admission or expedited       removal. But if such a person expresses fear of return, he is       entitled by law not to be expelled but to be interviewed by       an asylum officer. When border patrol agents simply expel       people who express fear without allowing them a chance to be       interviewed and to press their claims, the agents are       breaking the law and giving these people a removal order or a       denial of admission that they should not have. Thus, bona       fide asylum-seekers--those most likely to accumulate ``three       strikes''--would face criminal prosecution rather than what       they are entitled to--a non-adversarial interview with an       asylum officer that could ultimately lead to persecution-      based relief.    III. The Bill Would Purport to Unconstitutionally Prohibit Challenges                     to the Validity of Removal Orders         The bill would state that ``an alien may not challenge the       validity of any prior removal order concerning the alien.''       This provision, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the       overreaching and unduly harsh nature of these proposed       changes to existing law. The bill seeks to visit criminal       convictions and drastic penalties on noncitizens who reenter       even when the administrative process that led to their       original deportation or removal was fundamentally unfair or       achieved an unlawful result, and even when they were deprived       of judicial review of that fundamental injustice. The Supreme       Court long ago held, in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481       U.S. 828 (1987), that a defendant cannot be convicted and       punished under Sec. 1326 when the deportation order was       issued in an agency proceeding bereft of due process that no       court ever reviewed. But this bill seeks to do precisely       that, and at the same time to criminalize attempts to enter       the country legally and in most cases to increase the       penalties that may be imposed.      IV. The Affirmative Defenses Would Be Unavailable To Most, Do Not   Address Any Existing Problem, and Would Unfairly Place the Burden on         Defendants to Produce Records In the Government's Control         The bill would purport to create two affirmative defenses:       (1) ``prior to the alleged violation,'' the alien ``sought       and received express consent of [DHS] to reapply for       admission,'' or (2) ``with respect to an alien previously       denied admission and removed,'' the alien ``was not required       to obtain such advance consent under the [INA] or any prior       Act,'' and ``had complied with all other laws and regulations       governing his or her admission into the United States.'' The       first defense would be unavailable to anyone who did not have       the wherewithal, resources and time to file the proper form       and get it approved before arriving in the United States. The       second defense is not available to anyone whose period of       inadmissibility has not expired, usually ten years. These       requirements are simply unrealistic for those with little or       no education or money or who are fleeing violence.        Moreover, this is a solution in search of a problem, and it       would undermine due process. Because the absence of most of       these conditions is currently an element, see 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326(a)(2), the government routinely provides the       defense with the relevant records, which are in the       individual's ``A file,'' maintained in government custody and       otherwise available to the individual only through a FOIA       request. Placing the burden on the defendant to prove an       affirmative defense would illogically and unfairly require       him to produce records that are in the government's control.   V. The Bill Would Unjustifiably Increase Potential Penalties, Including                for Those With Truly Petty Criminal Records         While it appears that the statutory maxima would increase       for most defendants under the bill, there is no evidence that       any increase is needed to reflect the seriousness of these       offenses, or that such increases would be effective in       deterring illegal immigration. At the same time, the cost of       additional incarceration would be steep--approximately  [[Page H5339]]       $32,000 per prisoner per year. If each of the 16,000 persons       convicted of illegal reentry in 2016 received one additional       year, it would cost the taxpayers an extra half a billion       dollars.        Increasing sentences for these offenders is also       unnecessary and unfair because noncitizens suffer much       harsher conditions of confinement than other federal       prisoners. BOP contracts with private prison companies to       detain noncitizens convicted of immigration offenses and       other federal crimes. A recent analysis shows that many       persons incarcerated in ``immigrant only contract prisons''       suffer serious medical neglect, in some cases leading to       death. An investigation done by the American Civil Liberties       Union found that ``the men held in these private prisons are       subjected to shocking abuse and mistreatment, and       discriminated against by BOP policies that impede family       contact and exclude them from rehabilitative programs.''        Two of the penalty increases are particularly unwarranted.       The bill would increase a defendant's statutory maximum from       two to 10 years if he was removed subsequent to conviction of       any three misdemeanors, whereas the 10-year maximum currently       applies only if the three misdemeanors involved drugs, crimes       against the person, or both. This would apply to a re-entrant       with a truly petty criminal record. If the defendant had       three misdemeanor convictions for driving without a license,       a common scenario for undocumented immigrants and other       impoverished people, his maximum sentence would more than       triple. And because the bill does not require that the three       misdemeanors stem from three separate occasions, a 10-year       statutory maximum would apply to a re-entrant with       convictions from a single incident for disorderly conduct,       public intoxication and public urination.        Likewise, the 25-year maximum for any three felonies would       increase the maximum sentence by 15 years for garden variety       felonies, such as felony possession of a small quantity of       drugs. Worse, if the definition of ``felony'' means any       offense ``punishable by a term of more than 1 year under the       laws of'' the convicting jurisdiction, it would punish       defendants who were never convicted of a felony by up to 25       years, because the maximum punishment is more than one year       for misdemeanors in many states, including Colorado, Iowa,       Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South       Carolina, and Vermont. We are also concerned that definition       of ``felony,'' by mistake or by design, indicates that if a       particular kind of offense is punishable by more than one       year in any jurisdiction, it is a felony; it states that       ``any offense'' is a felony if it is punishable by more than       one year ``under the laws of the United States, any State, or       a foreign government.''    VI. The Bill Would Create A Significant Risk That Defendants Would Be      Pressured Into Admitting Prior Convictions That They Do Not Have         The bill would require that prior convictions upon which       increased statutory maxima are based be alleged in an       indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt at trial or       admitted by the defendant. Records of prior convictions are       notoriously unreliable and national criminal databases that       generate ``rap sheets'' frequently contain purported       convictions that have been misrecorded, expunged, or even       belong to other individuals. In border districts where the       great majority of illegal re-entry prosecutions take place,       re-entry cases have often been rapidly ``processed'' in       batches of up to eighty defendants at once, with 99% of cases       ending in guilty pleas. Given the way these cases are handled       on the border, and the fact that many if not most of the       defendants speak little or no English and have little or no       education, this provision carries a significant risk that       defendants will be pressured to admit to convictions they do       not have and thus significantly raise their sentencing       exposure.   VII. The Bill Would Impinge on States' Sovereign Interests in Managing                        Their Own Prison Populations         The bill would mandate that any alien removed pursuant to 8       U.S.C. Sec. 1231(a)(4) who enters or attempts to enter,       crosses or attempts to cross the border, or is found in the       United States, ``shall be incarcerated for the remainder of       the sentence that was pending at the time of deportation       without any reduction for parole or supervised release''       unless the alien affirmatively demonstrates express consent.       Section 1231(a)(4)(B) provides that the Attorney General may       remove an alien convicted of a non-violent offense before he       has completed a sentence of imprisonment (i) of an alien in       in federal custody and the Attorney General determines that       removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the United       States, (ii) of an alien in State custody if the chief state       official determines that removal is appropriate and in the       best interest of the State and submits a written request for       removal. Thus, for example, an alien sentenced to 8 years who       is eligible for parole in 6 years may apply for early       conditional release and be removed after 5 years. Under H.R.       3004, if he illegally re-entered thereafter, he would be       required to serve all three years that were pending when he       was removed.        As far as we are aware, Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(i) has never       been systematically implemented for federal inmates. Some       states, however, have implemented some sort of program to       avail themselves of Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii). A handful have       entered into an MOU with ICE in which they agree that a       person removed pursuant to Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) who returns       illegally will serve the remainder of the original sentence.       Other states release prisoners to ICE under       Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) through state legislation or parole       board policy under which they do not agree to that condition.        HR 3004 would require any State that releases a prisoner to       ICE under Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) to incarcerate such a person       for the remainder of the sentence should they return       unlawfully. It would thus impinge on States' sovereign       interests in managing their own prison populations according       to their own priorities and resources. The bill would remove       the flexibility that States currently have to treat       unlawfully returned prisoners as they see fit, and would       ossify the ICE MOU into law.

Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,           and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned       local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-      based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R.       3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public       safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and       its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and       incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly       needed law enforcement funding for state and local       jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,       and unnecessarily expands the government's detention       apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal       government's ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for       immigration-based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian       protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on       the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration       violations.        Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or       ordinances that disentangle their state and local law       enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.       The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to       attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do       not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and       local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the       U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally       infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,       including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       any other federal grant related to law enforcement or       immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding       federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely       runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on       commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law       professors.        ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public       safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of       crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local       law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have       repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that       community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public       safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime       and more economic development than similarly situated non-      ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed       federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the       ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the       public safety needs of their communities.        Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the       immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for       immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation       Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with       employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under       Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes       immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical       measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,       wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished       thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the       United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.       We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry       would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison       population, and cost billions of dollars.  [[Page H5340]]         Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only       legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just       immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to       citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring       Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation       programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation       that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic       processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns       represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to       enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of       the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), a former member of the House Judiciary  Committee.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to H.R. 3004, Kate's Law. This is politically driven legislation  intended to create a fear of immigrants, even though repeated studies  have shown immigrants commit less crimes.   It enhances criminal penalties against immigrants, the vast majority  of whom have come here peacefully to rejoin loved ones. All that, and  it doesn't even do what it claims to, address the situation that led to  the tragic death of Kate Steinle.   There are those who might imply that this bill came from H.R. 15, the  comprehensive bipartisan immigration bill that could have passed the  House if allowed to vote on the floor, but this is not true. I know,  because I was one of the lead sponsors of this bill.   Our bill would have vastly improved the pathways to immigrate legally  to the U.S. This bill makes no distinction between those immigrants  trying to rejoin their families and those who may be prone to commit  crimes.   Instead, it treats all immigrants attempting to reenter the U.S. as  criminals and significantly expands sentences for persons with  misdemeanors such as driving without a license or loitering. Even  asylum seekers, who present themselves at the border to escape deadly  gang violence in their home country, could be subject to criminal  prosecution.   Turning our backs on asylum seekers and refugees doesn't make us  safer. It makes us weak, and it is just plain wrong.   We were horrified by Kate Steinle's murder, but the provisions in  this bill would not have prevented it. The man charged with killing her  was convicted for multiple illegal reentry offenses, serving more than  16 years in prison. He had been caught each time he attempted to cross  the border. His presence in San Francisco was not due to lax penalties  for reentry or weak border security.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation ripped from  the pages of Donald Trump's mass deportation and anti-immigrant  playbook.   I include in the Record five documents from organizations that are  opposed to this bill as well as the sanctuary bill, and that is the  15,000 immigration lawyers and law professors who are members of the  American Immigration Lawyers Association; the 1.6 million members of  the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or  AFSCME; the 2 million members of the Service Employees International  Union, SEIU; the Asian Americans Advancing Justice; and the Fair  Immigration Reform Movement.                                                American Immigration                                             Lawyers Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2017.      Statement of the American Immigration Lawyers Association           Opposing the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act'' (H.R.           3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004)      Contact: Gregory Chen, Director of Government Relations.        As the national bar association of over 15,000 immigration       lawyers and law professors, the American Immigration Lawyers       Association (AILA) opposes ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act''       (H.R. 3003) and ``Kate's Law'' (H.R. 3004). AILA recommends       that members of Congress reject these bills which are       scheduled to come before the House Rules Committee on June 27       and to the floor shortly thereafter. Though Judiciary       Chairman Goodlatte stated that the bills will ``enhance       public safety,'' they will do just the opposite: undermine       public safety and make it even harder for local law       enforcement to protect their residents and communities. In       addition, the bills which were made public less than a week       before the vote and completely bypassed the Judiciary       Committee, include provisions that will result in violations       of due process and the Fourth and Tenth Amendments to the       Constitution.        At a time when over 9 out of 10 Americans support       immigration reform and legalization of the undocumented,       Republican leadership is asking the House to vote on       enforcement-only bills that will lead to more apprehensions,       deportations, and prosecutions of thousands of immigrants and       their families who have strong ties to the United States.       Instead of criminalizing and scapegoating immigrants,       Congress should be offering workable reforms that will       strengthen our economy and our country.                The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003         H.R. 3003 would undermine public safety and interfere with       local policing.        H.R. 3003 would amend 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 to prevent states       or localities from establishing laws or policies that       prohibit or ``in any way'' restrict compliance with or       cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The bill       dramatically expands 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1373 which is more       narrowly written and prohibits local law enforcement from       restricting the sharing and exchange of information with       federal authorities, but only with respect to an individual's       citizenship or immigration status.        Rather than empowering localities, the extremely broad       wording of H.R. 3003 would strip localities of the ability to       enact common-sense crime prevention policies that ensure       victims of crime will seek protection and report crimes. The       bill would also undermine public safety by prohibiting DHS       from  [[Page H5345]]       honoring criminal warrants of communities deemed ``sanctuary       cities'' if the individual being sought by local law       enforcement has a final order of removal.        Under H.R. 3003, localities that fail to comply with       federal immigration efforts are penalized with the denial of       federal funding for critical law enforcement, national       security, drug treatment, and crime victim initiatives,       including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program       (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and       Byrne JAG programs that provide hundreds of millions of       dollars to localities nationwide.        In an effort to force localities to engage in civil       immigration enforcement efforts, including those against       nonviolent undocumented immigrants, the bill would make it       far more difficult for many localities, including large       cities, to arrest and prosecute potentially dangerous       criminals. The bill could even offer criminals a form of       immunity, knowing that any crimes they commit in a designated       sanctuary city would result, at most, in their removal from       the country as opposed to criminal prosecution.        H.R. 3003 would run afoul of constitutional safeguards in       the Fourth Amendment.        By prohibiting localities from restricting or limiting       their own cooperation with federal immigration enforcement,       H.R. 3003 effectively compels localities to honor ICE       detainer requests--a controversial and constitutionally       suspect practice that is nonetheless widely-used by ICE.       Federal courts have found that ICE use of detainers violates       the Fourth Amendment, and that localities may be held liable       for honoring them.        The bill also expands detainer authority by establishing       that ICE may issue detainer requests for localities to hold       undocumented immigrants for up to 96 hours--twice what is       currently allowed--even if probable cause has not been shown.       Courts have concluded that localities cannot continue       detaining someone unless ICE obtains a warrant from a neutral       magistrate who has determined there is probable cause, or in       the case of a warrantless arrest, review by a neutral       magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. The expansive       provisions in H.R. 3003 would force localities to choose       between detaining people in violation of the Constitution or       being punished as a ``sanctuary city.''        Furthermore, this bill provides government actors and       private contractors with immunity if they are sued for       violating the Constitution. Provisions in this bill transfer       the financial burden of litigation by substituting the       federal government for the local officers as the defendant.       If H.R. 3003 becomes law, American taxpayers would be stuck       paying for lawsuits brought by those who are unjustly       detained.        The bill goes even further by creating a private right of       action allowing crime victims or their family members to sue       localities if the crime was committed by someone who was       released by the locality that did not honor an ICE detainer       request.        H.R. 3003 would violate the Tenth Amendment.        H.R. 3003 would compel states and localities to utilize       their local law enforcement resources to implement federal       civil immigration enforcement in violation of the Tenth       Amendment's ``commandeering'' principle. The Tenth Amendment       does not permit the federal government to force counties and       cities to allocate local resources, including police       officers, technology, and personnel, to enforce federal       immigration law. The federal government also cannot withhold       funds from localities refusing to participate in federal       efforts if the programs affected are unrelated to the purpose       of the federal program, or if the sanctions are punitive in       nature.        H.R. 3003 would expand detention without due process.        H.R. 3003 would increase the use of detention without       ensuring those detained have access to a bond determination.       Under the bill, nearly anyone who is undocumented, including       those who have overstayed their visa would be subject to       detention without a custody hearing. The bill also       establishes that DHS has the authority to detain individuals       ``without time limitation'' during the pendency of removal       proceedings. These provisions would dramatically expand the       federal government's power to indefinitely detain       individuals, and would likely result in ever growing numbers       of undocumented immigrants held in substandard detention       facilities.                            Kate's Law, H.R. 3004         H.R. 3004 would expand the already severe penalties in       federal law for illegal reentry (INA Sec. 276; 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326). The number of people prosecuted for illegal       reentry has grown steadily to about 20,000 prosecutions each       year, and such cases comprise more than one quarter of all       federal criminal prosecutions nationwide. H.R. 3004 adds       sentencing enhancements for people who are convicted of minor       misdemeanors and people who have reentered multiple times but       have no criminal convictions. This bill will not improve       public safety and will undermine due process and protections       for asylum seekers. H.R. 3004 would waste American taxpayer       funds by imposing severe prison sentences upon thousands of       people who pose no threat to the community and who have       strong ties to the country and are trying to unite with their       loved ones.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements upon       people with minor offenses.        H.R. 3004 would add sentencing enhancements for minor       misdemeanor convictions, including driving without a license       and other traffic-related offenses. Under the current version       of INA Sec. 276, if a person is charged with reentering the       U.S. after being removed, their punishment is enhanced by up       to ten years only if they have been convicted a felony or       three or more misdemeanors involving drugs or violence. Under       H.R. 3004 someone who has been convicted of any three       misdemeanors regardless of severity would be subject to a       term of up to ten years.        This expansion would unfairly target large numbers of       people who are not a threat to public safety but instead are       trying to reunite with family members and have other strong       ties to the United States. Currently half of all people       convicted of illegal reentry have one child living in the       country. Increasing sentences for illegal reentry would also       waste taxpayer dollars, costing huge amounts of money to lock       up non-violent people.        H.R. 3004 would punish people who attempt to seek asylum at       the border.        H.R. 3004 expands the provisions of INA Sec. 276 to punish       not only people who reenter the U.S. or attempt to reenter       the U.S., but also people who cross or attempt to cross the       border. The bill goes on to define ``crosses the border'' to       mean ``the physical act of crossing the border, regardless of       whether the alien is free from official restraint.'' That       means that people who present themselves at ports of entry to       request asylum and are taken into custody by CBP to await a       fear screening would be subject to criminal charges based on       a past removal, even though they are seeking refuge in the       U.S.        H.R. 3004 would impose severe sentencing enhancements for       people with multiple entries.        The bill would also create new sentencing enhancements for       people who have reentered the U.S. multiple times, even if       they have no other criminal convictions. If someone has been       removed three or more times, and is found in the United       States or attempts to cross the border again, H.R. 3004 law       would provide for sentencing enhancements of up to ten years.       The bill makes no exception for bona fide asylum seekers,       which means that people who are seeking refuge in the U.S.       from atrocities abroad could be subject to a lengthy prison       sentence under these provisions.        H.R. 3004 would undermine due process by blocking       challenges to unfair removal orders.        The bill will prevent an individual from challenging the       validity of a removal order, even it was fundamentally unfair       in the first place. The Supreme Court held in U.S. v.       Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828 (1987) that due process requires       that a challenge be allowed if a deportation proceeding is       used as an element of a criminal offense and where the       proceeding ``effectively eliminate[d] the right of the alien       to obtain judicial review.'' This provision in H.R. 3004 is       likely unconstitutional and will cause grave injustice to       defendants, such as asylum seekers who were deported without       the opportunity to seek asylum.                                   ____                                                           AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the punitive and       unnecessary No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (H.R. 3003) and       its companion bill that increases penalties for certain       immigrants (H.R. 3004). These bills together weaken the       rights of immigrants, cut funding to vital state and local       programs, and further criminalize immigrants.        H.R. 3003 and 3004 are deeply flawed pieces of legislation       that would add chaos to an already broken immigration system       when comprehensive reform is what is needed. The bills       undermine state and local policing strategies that have       worked well for many communities. Implementing this ``one       size fits all'' approach, as proposed in these bills,       jeopardizes the trust that diverse communities have placed in       their police force and undermines federal grants that are       aimed at helping law enforcement and that support the very       programs needed to reduce crime.        H.R. 3003 forces communities to devote local resources to       enforcing federal immigration law and penalizes them if they       don't comply. H.R. 3004 mandates increased penalties on       immigrants for reentry, which could lead to a large increase       in the prison population without additional resources. This       would create new financial liability for federal, state, and       local governments, that are already cash strapped, at a time       when funding is urgently needed for investments in public       safety, infrastructure and other vital community needs.        We urge the House to reject both H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004.            Sincerely,                                                     Scott Frey,       Director of Federal Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I urge       you to vote no on H.R. 3004 and H.R. 3003, which are       currently scheduled to come to the House floor this week.       These mean-spirited and unwise bills would waste taxpayer       dollars, shackle local law enforcement efforts to  [[Page H5346]]       protect the public, and make our nation's immigration laws       even meaner and less reasonable than they already are.        H.R. 3004, ``Kate's Law,'' would increase the prison       population of nonviolent offenders who pose no public safety       risk, without evidence that its harsh provisions would have       any impact on unlawful immigration, and without any other       justification of its cost or impact on prison overcrowding.       Those affected would include immigrants who have only       committed minor misdemeanors such as driving without a       license or other traffic-related offenses, and others who       have never committed any crimes besides unauthorized entry.       H.R. 3004 would also penalize persons fleeing persecution who       voluntarily present themselves at the border to apply for       asylum, and it would short circuit the current minimal due       process protections that protect persons whose previous       deportation was unlawful.        H.R. 3003, the ``No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,'' is       intended to commandeer state and local law enforcement       resources to perform federal deportation activities. It is       one part of the ongoing effort to villainize immigrants by       unfairly--and against all available evidence--painting them       all with a criminal brush for the misdeeds of a few. Rather       than protecting the public, the provisions of H.R. 3003 would       frustrate policies by states and localities that increase       public safety by encouraging cooperation between law       enforcement and the communities they serve. There is mounting       evidence that localities with such policies experience lower       crime because they build trust between the police and those       they serve, thereby inspiring the community collaboration and       assistance that is a key ingredient to maintaining safe       neighborhoods.        It should be pointed out that the provisions of H.R. 3003       are sufficiently radical that even those who do not support       sanctuary cities should vote no. The bill would deny       important law enforcement funding to localities that are       unwilling to honor any and all federal immigration detainer       requests, including requests that courts have said are       unconstitutional. It would empower private individuals to sue       a locality if they or their family are victimized by a crime       committed by an individual who was released despite a federal       detainer request. It would render local governments powerless       to prioritize local needs over immigration enforcement, even       for local agencies funded by local taxes. And, if that       weren't enough, a separate provision would significantly       increase the categories of individuals subject to mandatory       detention and prolonged detention without bond, thereby       filling local jails and private prisons with individuals who       pose no danger to themselves and no flight risk.        For the reasons listed above, both of these bills should be       defeated. SEIU therefore asks you to vote no, and may add       votes on any of them to our scorecard. If you have any       questions, please contact Josh Bernstein.            Sincerely,                                                       Rocio Saenz,      Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                                     Asian Americans                                               Advancing Justice,                                                      June 28, 2017.   Five Civil Rights Organizations Oppose Latest Immigration Actions in                                 the House    house republicans introduce two anti-immigrant bills during immigrant                               heritage month         Washington, DC.--Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.)       introduced a set of anti-immigrant bills that are scheduled       for a vote later this week. These are the latest in a line of       bills that outline a clear anti-immigrant strategy by House       leadership and this administration.        H.R. 3003 seeks to authorize the Federal Government to       withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for       localities with limited detainer policies, sanctuary city       policies, and community trust policies aimed at complying       with the Constitution and making communities safer. H.R. 3004       would expand the Federal Government's ability to prosecute       people for illegal reentry into the U.S., excludes       humanitarian exemptions for people fleeing violence, and       heightens penalties in those cases.        Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an affiliation of five       civil rights organizations, issues the following statement in       response:        ``Asian Americans Advancing Justice strongly opposes H.R.       3003 (the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act), H.R. 3004 (known       as Kate's Law), and the passage of any immigration       enforcement legislation that would increase indiscriminate       enforcement, further the criminalization of immigrants, and       instill more fear in already terrified communities.       Approximately 40 percent of all immigrants come to the U.S.       from Asia, and 1.6 million of those immigrants are       undocumented. Anti-immigrant policies create a climate of       fear for all immigrants, regardless of status.        We are horrified and dismayed that House leadership has       chosen to line up behind the administration in its       scapegoating of immigrants. Both of these bills further the       administration's goals of criminalizing all immigrants and       expanding mass incarceration. Since the administration failed       in its attempt to strip funding from municipalities with       sanctuary and community trust policies in federal court, it       is looking for Congress to fulfill its anti-immigrant agenda.        There is abundant evidence that sanctuary and community       trust policies make communities safer. As Arizona and Texas       have shown us, forcing local law enforcement to enforce       immigration laws increases racial profiling and distrust of       law enforcement by communities of color.        Rapidly pushing these bills through the House as America       looks toward a holiday that celebrates the best of our       American ideals is clearly an effort to slide this       legislation under the radar of anyone who would oppose it,       including millions of Americans who support immigrants'       rights.        Vilifying and punishing immigrants who may be fleeing       violence or seeking a better life for their families does not       makes us safer, just inhumane. We call on Congress to reject       this latest anti-immigrant strategy. This vote will be a test       for Members of Congress to show which side of justice they       are on.''        Asian Americans Advancing Justice is a national affiliation       of five leading organizations advocating for the civil and       human rights of Asian Americans and other underserved       communities to promote a fair and equitable society for all.

House GOP Continues Cruel Crusade Against Immigrants         Washington.--Kica Matos, spokesperson for the Fair       Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), issued the statement       below after the House voted on the No Sanctuary for Criminals       Act and Kate's Law:        ``Republicans in the House are hell bent on criminalizing       the hard working immigrants who contribute so much to our       country. This week they voted on two heartless bills that do       nothing more than continue to fuel Trump's deportation       machine.        The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act punishes ``sanctuary       cities,'' local jurisdictions addressing immigration issues       without federal interference, and expands the government's       inhumane practice of indefinite detention of immigrants.        The second bill, ``Kate's Law'' is a thinly veiled attempt       to give prosecutors more power to continue the vicious mass       incarceration of black and brown people by expanding on legal       penalties for re-entry. The bill also limits the already       limited protections for people reentering the country for       humanitarian reasons.        The attacks on brown and black people by Republicans are       not going unnoticed. The people are on our side--they marched       with us on May 1st, they showed up after Trump issued the       first refugee ban and they called out elected officials at       town halls. Our message to Congress is clear: the only       solution to fix the broken immigration system is a pathway to       citizenship.        These two bills are the antithesis of our values and should       be condemned by everyone.        The Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) is the nation's       largest immigrant-rights coalition, with grassroots       organizations fighting for immigrant rights at the local,       state and federal level.
