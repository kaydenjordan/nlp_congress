 Madam Speaker, for final passage of H.R. 268, the  Supplemental Appropriations Act, I am not recorded because I was  [[Page H662]]  absent on account of attending a U.S. Army Basic Combat Training  graduation ceremony.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 39.                            ____________________
