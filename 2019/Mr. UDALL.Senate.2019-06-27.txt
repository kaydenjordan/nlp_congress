 Madam President, I very much appreciate being joined on  the floor by Senator Kaine and Senator Merkley. I appreciate Senator  Kaine's very wise words. I think all of us are here standing up to hold  the President accountable. We believe he should follow and obey the  Constitution.   I rise to call upon this body to do its duty, to assume its  constitutional responsibility, and to make it clear that the President  cannot wage war against Iran without congressional authorization.  Whether you are in favor of giving the President that authorization or  whether, like me, you are opposed, everyone in this Chamber should vote  in favor of our bipartisan amendment because a vote in favor is a vote  to fulfill our sworn oath to uphold the Constitution. I appreciate that  at long last the Senate will finally have this debate; that we will  finally take this vote because these matters of war and peace are among  the most consequential responsibilities that fall to Congress. These  are the hard votes, and we must step up to take them.   I am proud to partner with Senators Kaine, Paul, Merkley, Durbin,  Murphy, and Lee in this effort and to call  [[Page S4593]]  upon Congress to meet its constitutional responsibilities. After years  of abdicating our responsibilities on matters of war, this entire body  must stand up and show that we will not roll over for an unauthorized,  unconstitutional war. We must pass this amendment.   This dangerous course with Iran began last May when the President  unilaterally withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. This hard-fought  diplomatic achievement denied Iran the nuclear material required to  even begin work on a nuclear weapon. Since this administration turned  away from diplomacy and resorted to a maximum pressure campaign to box  in Iran, the risk of war has steadily risen.   Just last week, we were 10 minutes away from a strike on Iran, 10  minutes from a nightmare of escalation in the Gulf. This week, the  President threatened Iran. I am quoting his words here--these are  pretty strong words--he said to Iran: I threaten them with ``great and  overwhelming force,'' and he used the word ``obliteration.'' That is  not diplomacy; that is a drumbeat toward war without congressional  approval.   Tensions are the highest they have been in many years, and the risk  of a costly miscalculation grows day by day. Just days ago, the  President falsely claimed he does not need congressional approval to  launch strikes against Iran. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution  could not be clearer: It is Congress and Congress alone that has the  authority to ``declare war.'' This is not a close call; the Founders  placed this responsibility squarely on our shoulders. The consequences  of going to war are profound, so this decision rests with the people's  representatives, not one person--not even one President. It is time  that Congress confront the administration's rejection of diplomacy.   Our amendment prohibits funding for military action against Iran  without congressional authorization. It does not prohibit war  altogether; it prohibits an unconstitutional war, a war that has not  been authorized by Congress.   We must be accountable to the American people and to our men and  women in uniform whose lives would be on the line. Our soldiers are  brave enough to face the danger of war. If my friends in this Chamber  believe they should, we should be brave enough to be held accountable  for that decision.   Some have claimed that this amendment would prohibit the President  from defending the United States against attack. That is wrong. It is  completely false. This amendment and the War Powers Act incorporated as  part of it allow the United States to act in self-defense. I am going  to quote from our amendment. The amendment clearly states that it shall  not be interpreted ``to restrict the use of the United States Armed  Forces to defend against an attack upon the United States, its  territories or possessions, or its Armed Forces.'' It is explicit. The  United States may defend itself against an attack by Iran. The claim  that the military's hands would be tied in the event of an emergency  has no basis and cannot be used as an excuse to vote against the  amendment.   I am heartened, as Senator Kaine was and as I am sure Senator Merkley  will also say, that Senator McConnell and the Republican leadership  will finally allow debate and a vote on this amendment. This is what  the American people want and deserve.   Over the years, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike have  steadily encroached upon Congress's war powers, and Congress has  tacitly allowed that encroachment.   I stood up to President Obama when he threatened to attack Syria  without authorization, and so did many of my colleagues. I am standing  up again now because the administration's reckless actions have brought  us to the precipice of war.   Mr. Bolton and Secretary Pompeo's failed strategy has led directly to  these heightened tensions, to the brink of war, with no benefits to  show for their tactics.   The administration has reimposed and tightened sanctions on Iran  three times--sanctions we agreed not to impose if Iran agreed not to  develop nuclear capabilities.   Secretary Pompeo placed a dozen conditions on negotiations and then  withdrew them.   Just this week, at the same time that Advisor Bolton claims we will  talk with Iran anytime, the President sanctions the lead diplomat in  Iran and tweets out his threat of obliteration, shutting the door on  any diplomatic overtures.   This ping-pong diplomacy, manufactured crisis, and go-it-alone  posture further diminish our world's standing and credibility. None of  the signatories to the Iran nuclear agreement, including our closest  allies, backs us in what we are doing.   This reckless diplomacy is dangerously reminiscent of the run-up to  war with Iraq. But any war with Iran, with its military capability,  proxy forces, and a population of 80 million living in a geographically  perilous region, would be more disastrous and more costly than Iraq.  Yet we continue to march up to the brink.   According to the President's tweet last week, he stopped a strike  against Iran that he had already ordered because he learned at the last  minute that 150 lives were at stake. I know I am not alone in being  deeply alarmed at this decisionmaking--national security decisionmaking  process. I know Members on both sides of the aisle share my concerns.   We must assert our constitutional authority. We must tell the  President and affirm to the American people that we will assume our  constitutional responsibility. And we must do so now before, through  miscalculation, mistake, or misjudgment, our Nation finds itself in yet  another endless war.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up Udall  amendment No. 883.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on my  amendment.    Mr. President, I rise to respond to some of the criticisms  of the Udall amendment that I believe are misleading and deserve a  response.   To start, I want to point out an area of agreement. The opposition  says our amendment is simple, and it agrees on its intent--that this  amendment would prohibit a war with Iran without there being  congressional approval, and that is what the vote is about. The  arguments from those in the opposition mislead to avoid that simple  truth. They are trying to create excuses for why we should ignore the  Constitution and open the door to war with Iran without having a vote.  President  [[Page S4620]]  Trump has said he was 10 minutes away from doing just that.   Here is some of what we have heard. Critics say we only have one  Commander in Chief, not 535, and so we should not pass this amendment.   We agree. We only have one Commander in Chief, but the Commander in  Chief executes wars. Only Congress can declare them. Our Founders made  that decision for good reason. Dictators and Kings declare war  unilaterally. Democracies don't. In our democracy, the people decide  whether we go to war or whether we don't go to war through their  elected representatives. Congress is the most direct voice of the  people.   Once that decision has been made, then it is up to one Commander in  Chief to execute that war. The people of New Mexico did not send me  here to be a battalion commander or a general, and I have no intention  of acting like one. The people of New Mexico sent me here to do my  constitutional duty, and article I, section 8 vests the power of  declaring war with the Congress.   Critics also falsely say our amendment limits our forces' ability to  defend themselves or take incoming fire before they can respond. The  majority leader said our amendment defines ``self-defense'' too  narrowly.   I am confused at what he is referring to. Our amendment does not  include a separate definition of ``self-defense.'' Our amendment  expressly states that it does not restrict ``the use of the United  States Armed Forces to defend against attack.'' This language does not,  in any way, change the Department of Defense's rules of engagement that  guide how to exercise our inherent right of self-defense. The DOD does  not require a unit to absorb an attack before it can defend itself, and  neither does our amendment.   The only restriction in the amendment is that the President cannot  enter into hostilities without having congressional approval. It is a  restriction that is embedded in our Constitution. If the Republicans  are proposing to do away with that restriction, I agree with my  colleague Senator Merkley that they must come to the floor and propose  a constitutional amendment to do so.   Our forces in Iraq, Bahrain, and other locations in the Middle East  are fully capable and empowered to defend themselves, and this  amendment does not affect that. Unfortunately, the opposition is just  repeating itself, trying to generate a reason to abdicate its own  constitutional duty.   We have also heard criticism that this amendment is ``appeasing the  Ayatollahs'' and represents ``weakness'' and that we must allow the  President to launch military action to be tough.   We have heard these kinds of arguments before. They were very common  in the run up to the disastrous Iraq war. Do not question the arguments  for war. To do so is to be weak.   I could not disagree more.   Our Constitution is our strength, and this amendment simply reaffirms  our Constitution in the face of a President who is threatening to flout  it. Our Nation is strong when we are united. We do not need to give up  congressional authority over war and peace to one man, the President,  in order to be strong.   Congress has authorized military action before, and when majorities  believe that the circumstances warrant it, Congress will do so again.  If we fear Iran so much that we are willing to walk away from the  constitutional requirements to authorize military action, that would be  the real sign of weakness.   We have also heard that we cannot rely on Congress to authorize force  if we need it to. We heard that Congress can barely name a post office.  So how can we trust it with this kind of decision? What if Congress is  out of town and cannot vote?   First, it is disappointing to hear Members of the Senate speak so  cynically about this body on the floor during a debate as important as  this. The Congress does not function perfectly. That is very true. Yet  history is clear that Congress has authorized military force many times  in the past. I have supported some, and I have opposed others, but we  had debates and votes. Only recently has the 2001 authorization been so  abused to authorize military action all over the globe--far beyond the  al-Qaida and Afghanistan mission that Congress thought it was voting  on.   Congress, though, has had these debates and has voted, and those  decisions represent our national decisions. I see no reason to turn our  back on our Constitution just because Iran is a regional threat and  this administration has manufactured a crisis to exacerbate that  threat.   If there is a national security crisis that requires Congress to vote  on military force, we can all get on a plane and come to Washington and  do our jobs. Maybe we will even have a vote on Friday. Congress voted  after Pearl Harbor, and Congress voted after 9/11. Both were in the  middle of national crises. Our troops will be the ones making real  sacrifices. We can bear the cost of some inconvenient recess travel.  Our job is to debate and vote on matters of war and peace--period, end  of story.   We have also heard that the Department of Defense is opposed to our  amendment.   Yesterday, Mr. John Rood, the Under Secretary for Policy at the  Department of Defense, sent a letter to the leaders of the Armed  Services Committee in its opposition to our amendment. The letter is  short, and while it contains speculation and rhetoric, it includes no  legal analysis and fails to address the plain language of the amendment  or longstanding DOD authority or rules of engagement.   I am disappointed in the letter, but it should not be a surprise from  a political appointee from the Trump administration, not when the  President is openly declaring that he needs no authority from Congress  to launch a war against Iran. The letter reads that the amendment  ``purports to limit the President's authority in discharging his  responsibility as Commander in Chief,'' which is simply false.   The amendment straightforwardly affirms the constitutional authority  of Congress to authorize military action--authority that the President  is openly flouting in his public comments.   If Congress authorizes military action against Iran, the Commander in  Chief would be free to execute it.   The letter asserts, without evidence, that our amendment will  embolden Iran. I hope we are not so weak that we think our Constitution  emboldens Iran.   Overall, the letter cites nothing--the Constitution, no law, no DOD  policy, no legal analysis, nothing--in support of its claims.   This letter from DOD, which lacks a confirmed Secretary, is a  disappointment, but it should not be read as any authoritative take on  this amendment, its intent, or its effect.   Some have said that this amendment would block the United States from  helping Israel defend itself from an Iranian attack. I support Israel's  right to defend itself, and this argument does not hold up.   First, this amendment has no impact on our ongoing security  assistance and cooperation with Israel, including the recent MOU signed  with Israel by President Obama.   Second, if Israel is attacked, there is nothing in this amendment  that would prohibit the United States from coming to its aid with  defensive measures.   Third, if Israel is attacked and the United States wants to send our  military to engage in direct hostilities, we are going to need to  debate and authorize any response in Congress. That is simply what the  Constitution says.   Finally, the biggest risk of Iranian attacks on Israel, according to  one Israeli Cabinet Minister last month, is the escalating tension  between the United States and Iran.   The best thing we can do to protect Israel is diplomacy to stop a  broader regional war in the Middle East. If the United States does go  to war with Iran, Israel is likely to face very serious threats, and  that is something we should take seriously if we consider the use of  force.   Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in May that ``things are  heating up'' in the Persian Gulf.   He said:         If there's some sort of conflagration between Iran and the       United States, between Iran and its neighbors, I'm not ruling       out that they will activate Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad from       Gaza, or even that they will try to fire missiles from Iran       at the State of Israel.    So the threats to Israel from Iran only make it more important that  we have a full debate and vote on military action, not less important.  [[Page S4621]]    Again, the purpose of our amendment is simple: The President is  threatening to launch military action against Iran without  authorization, publicly flouting Congress. This amendment says that we  are not going to go into an unauthorized war with Iran.   If the President and Members of this body think we need to take  military action against Iran, then let's have that debate and let's  vote.   The Udall amendment ensures we follow the constitutional process. To  do otherwise is to be in dereliction of our constitutional duty.    The Senator from New Mexico yields the floor.
