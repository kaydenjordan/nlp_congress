 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 95th  birthday of David De La Cruz. He is 95 years old. His loving family and  friends will gather to celebrate this Saturday.   Mr. De La Cruz is one of our district's last surviving World War II  veterans. At the age of 17, David volunteered for the Army, leaving  behind his family in the east end of Pasadena, Texas. He fought in  World War II for 3 years, stationed in Germany. He returned to  technical school for electronics and then was stationed in Korea to  serve in the Korean war from 1950 to 1951.   David had a 57-year career in electronics, both in the Army and as a  [[Page H2927]]  local businessowner. David is an advocate for Latinos, a businessowner,  and a lifetime member of The American Legion.   As David likes to say, ``When people see a veteran, they should thank  them.'' Today we thank David and celebrate his birthday.   ``Happy birthday''; ``Feliz cumpleanos.''   ``May God bless you''; ``Que Dios te bendiga.''                            ____________________
