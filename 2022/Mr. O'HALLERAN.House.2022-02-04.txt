 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for  the America COMPETES Act, for which my amendment to this legislation  was adopted.   This legislative package will make new investments in research,  innovation, and American manufacturing. It will ensure that the United  States can outcompete any nation in the world for the coming decades.   Importantly, our bill would address issues with our supply chain and  higher prices for families at the grocery store and the gas pump. Even  small price increases make a painful dent for rural and Tribal families  in our district.   That is why I introduced the amendment to the legislation that will  ensure these rural and Tribal families, like so many of Arizona's First  District, are not overlooked.   My amendment tasks the Department of Commerce with publishing a  report every 4 years on supply chain resilience and domestic  manufacturing. Understanding how supply chain shocks impact rural,  Tribal, and underserved communities is critical for their future  growth.   I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to identify commonsense legislative solutions that continue to  address these issues.                            ____________________
