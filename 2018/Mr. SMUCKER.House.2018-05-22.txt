 Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the National Defense  Authorization Act and thank the chairman of the committee for this  bipartisan legislation which supports our troops, enhances military  readiness, and provides for the defense of our Nation.   I also encourage my colleagues to support my amendments, Nos. 43 and  48, to the NDAA. My amendments seek to improve the mental health  services provided by the Department of Defense so our troops receive  only the best treatment.   It comes as no surprise that the high levels of violence and trauma  our servicemembers experience is cause for negative impacts on their  mental health. Our soldiers suffer from major depression at a rate five  times higher than the civilian population rate. Additionally, their  diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was approximately 15 times  greater than the general population.   Congress can help. Currently, there is a serious shortage of mental  health providers at the DOD. Our troops are paying the price, but they  don't have to. One of my amendments would help identify the scope of  the workforce problem at DOD and ensure that an effective strategy is  in place so our Nation's troops have full access to qualified mental  health providers.   My other amendment would require the DOD to establish a monitoring  program carried out by each branch of the armed services to conduct  periodic reviews of the medication prescribing practices of its own  providers to treat PTSD. This monitoring program will help ensure that  every military branch is regularly monitoring the medications  prescribed to treat PTSD to ensure that our troops are getting the  proper treatment.   Some of the greatest wounds inflicted upon our brave servicemen and - women are unseen. We should be doing everything possible to ensure that  we are treating these wounds as we would any other.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendments on behalf of the  servicemembers and military families that we represent.
