 Mr. President, today I want to honor a former First Lady of  Rhode Island, Mrs. Dorothy Shirley  [[Page S6621]]  Licht, as she celebrates her 100th birthday on Monday, September 27,  2021.   Dorothy Shirley Krauss was born in Providence, RI, in 1921. She spent  much of her life dedicated to others--raising three children, working  to enrich her community, and supporting her late husband, the former  Governor of Rhode Island Frank Licht, in his political and judicial  endeavors.   In 1949, she married Frank Licht, a Rhode Islander who graduated from  Brown University and Harvard Law School and served as a State senator  in Rhode Island from 1949 until being sworn in as an associate justice  of the Rhode Island Superior Court in 1956.   After 12 steadfast years on the bench, Licht thrust himself into an  uphill gubernatorial fight against the incumbent Governor and my former  colleague, the late Senator John Chafee. Following a hard-fought  campaign, Licht secured an underdog win in 1968, and with Dorothy at  his side, he became the first Jewish Governor in Rhode Island's  history. During Governor Licht's time in office, he focused on  advancing mental healthcare, strong environmental protections, and bold  economic reforms. With strong conviction and courage, he pushed through  an unpopular tax plan that would help guide Rhode Island out of a  devastating financial crisis.   No public servant can be successful without the strong support of  their loved ones. Through tough races, long hours, and challenging  times, Dorothy gifted to the people of Rhode Island a model for strong  and eloquent leadership. During her time as First Lady and in the  decades since, Dorothy held the advancement of the arts and humanities  close to her heart. Her work to elevate art and culture across our  community is exemplified by her past service on the boards of the Rhode  Island State Council on the Arts, the New England Foundation for the  Arts, and the Rhode Island Symphony. Dorothy's compassion for helping  those in need is perhaps best shown through her role as an honorary  board member of the Rhode Island Food Bank, a role she still holds  today.   Through all of the highs of Dorothy's life, she has not been immune  to loss. She has endured the immeasurable burden of burying both her  loving husband Frank many years ago, as well as her eldest daughter  Beth, who passed unexpectedly earlier this year. Still, Dorothy is  strengthened and supported by her beloved family who join with me to  celebrate this milestone, including her two surviving daughters Carol  and Judy, her eight grandchildren, and her four great-grandchildren, as  well as her nephew, former Lieutenant Governor Richard Licht.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Dorothy for her life of service  to Rhode Island, her commitment to her family, and this momentous  occasion of her 100th birthday.                            ____________________
