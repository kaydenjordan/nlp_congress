 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my continued opposition  to Elizabeth Warren and House Democratic efforts to expand the IRS to  spy on everyday Americans' bank accounts with transactions over $600. I  know there has been talk of raising that to $10,000. I am opposed to  all of this.   Madam Speaker, the banks already have mechanisms in place to catch  suspicious activity. Those are called SARs or specific activity  reports. We don't need additional tools by the IRS to harass everyday  working Americans who are struggling to pay their bills.   If the intention by the Democrats is to go after people who are  billionaires and multimillionaires who are not paying their taxes, then  spying on average Americans' bank accounts with over $600 transactions  is not going to do it.   We have to do things in a better way. We have to focus the IRS' time  to where it is best served, and that is to focus on tax cheats, not  everyday, average working Americans. I urge opposition to this  infringement of our rights.                            ____________________
