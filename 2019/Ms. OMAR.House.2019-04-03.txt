 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this amendment.   This amendment to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act  includes language of a bill that I am proud to be an original cosponsor  of called the Abby Honold Act.   Abby is a constituent of mine, a former student at the University of  Minnesota. A survivor of sexual assault, she has been a fierce champion  of this initiative and was the driving force behind this legislation  that bears her name.   I want to make sure that my colleagues support this amendment on  behalf of the thousands of victims who experience trauma. This is a key  part of their recovery process and a crucial response to the immediate  aftermath.
