 Madam Speaker, as a Texan, this is obviously a very  important day for me, and I am going to tell you what Juneteenth  symbolizes for me.   Juneteenth symbolizes 100 years of oppression that we faced after  June 19, 1865, after General Granger made his announcement in  Galveston, Texas.   It symbolizes Barbara Jordan coming to the United States House of  Representatives, the first Black woman from the south, 100 years after  June 19, 1865.   It symbolizes three teenagers who died, handcuffed by law  enforcement, in a boat in Mexia, Texas, at a Juneteenth gathering after  they were arrested for celebrating this day with their family in 1981;  over 100 years after June 19, 1865.   It symbolizes Opal Lee, from Fort Worth, Texas, long known as the  mother of Juneteenth in Fort Worth, and now known nationally for her  endeavors to help make today possible.   Someone mentioned the George Floyd Policing Bill earlier. And I want  to tell you, Madam Speaker, things aren't perfect. That police officer  who handcuffed those teenagers and put them in that boat, he just  retired a couple of years ago from law enforcement. George Floyd fixes  that.   So while we celebrate what is about to become, with the Juneteenth  holiday today, we know that we have a long way to go. But hallelujah,  hallelujah, hallelujah, June 19, 1865, finally being enshrined in our  national heritage.
