 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  S.J. Res. 57, which will roll back a rule issued by the Bureau of  Consumer Financial Protection related to indirect auto lending.   We know that in 2013 the Bureau issued guidance to financial  institutions that would eliminate an auto dealer's ability to discount  interest rates offered to consumers who finance vehicle purchases.   As many of us know, the CFPB has a longstanding history of imposing  burdensome rules and regulations on a wide range of financial products.  The CFPB has often issued rules without understanding of the full scope  of the problem and without regard to the costs of compliance it imposes  on an industry. This rule is no exception.   As clearly stated in section 1029 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bureau  is explicitly prohibited from regulating auto dealers. This attempt by  the Bureau to provide guidance to auto lending is a clear violation of  the statute and is yet another example of how the Bureau continued to  abuse its statutory power under then-Director Richard Cordray.   I am pleased to join my colleagues here today to ensure that the  Bureau does not issue any substantially similar rules as it relates to  indirect auto lending.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and other members of the House  Financial Services Committee for bringing this important legislation to  the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure to  help rein in the CFPB's regulatory overreach.
