 Madam Speaker, I rise in solidarity with the thousands  of Federal employees in my district and across this Nation who, because  of the shutdown, haven't received a paycheck.   I want to share the story of Robert Guevara, a Federal aviation  safety inspector in my district who did not receive a paycheck this  past Friday. He is tasked with overseeing the airline's mechanics and  repairing facilities so operations run smoothly and safely at Miami  International Airport. He has one goal: aviation safety. He prides  himself on keeping our travelers safe and ensuring that all inspections  are as thorough and accurate as possible.   After 21 years of service in the Air Force, he told me he could  barely recognize our country anymore. How can the greatest country on  Earth tell its employees to work without a paycheck? How can we hold  our patriots hostage?   Madam Speaker, no one wins in a shutdown. We must demand that this  administration and the Senate leadership reopen our government.                            ____________________
