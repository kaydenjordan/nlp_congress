 Madam Speaker, the absurd proposal brought forth now to  pack the U.S. Supreme Court out of thin air with four new Justices is  the latest in a breathtaking effort to seize and seal power for  Democrats. They know their policies frequently don't win at the ballot  box or in fair elections, so they seek to stack a Court with a new set  of Justices that they hope will hand them victories outside of the  hallowed legislative process.   Justice Breyer, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and even Joe  Biden himself--who is quoted as saying packing the Court is a  ``bonehead idea''--all disagree, at least at one time, that packing the  Court to simply grab a majority is wrong-headed and un-American.   I am glad to enter into a constitutional amendment with  Representative Dusty Johnson to ``Keep the 9'' and save our Supreme  Court, to keep it above politics.   This is one of the most blatant, naked power grabs we have seen,  ever. If this effort is somehow successful and allowed to stand, then  you will not recognize the America we know, once knew, as pure power  politics will indeed have won over our process that the Founders put in  place.                            ____________________
