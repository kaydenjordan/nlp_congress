 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a partisan issue. Very frankly, the CR that  was brought to the floor the other day would have said we are going to  pay the debts of the United States because we don't welch, and we are  going to fund Iron Dome.   Unfortunately, because, to a person, our Republican colleagues would  have refused and said they would not vote for that resolution, and  because, yes, there were a very, very few who said they wouldn't vote  for it on our side, because all of you would not vote for it, and we  had just a handful who would not vote, we could not pass it. So, the  debt limit was at risk, and Iron Dome was at risk.   The chair of the Committee on Appropriations, Rosa DeLauro, said that  won't stand. And I stood on this floor and said we are going to bring  an individual bill that I hope all of us will support. Now, obviously,  all of us are not supporting it. There are some few who will not  support this. But the overwhelming majority of this Congress, not in a  partisan way, but in an American way, will support defending the  democratic State of Israel created by the United Nations of the world  to be an independent, sovereign, secure nation.  [[Page H5113]]    Very frankly, in a bipartisan way, no nation on Earth has been more  important for the survival and security and sovereignty of that nation  than the United States of America. Today continues that commitment.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, I said we will deal with Iron Dome without  delay to help defend Israel against Hamas' rocket attacks. Today, I am  proud to bring this legislation to the floor and thank not only Chair  DeLauro but I also thank many who have spoken, certainly, my friend  Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Mr. Deutch, Mr. Schneider, and others who  have talked to me about this issue.   We bring this bill to the floor with the expectation that it will be  overwhelmingly passed because we will put behind us partisanship.   Support for Israel has traditionally and must always be a bipartisan  issue. That is because we overwhelmingly recognize the fundamental  right of the Jewish people to live independently in their ancestral  homeland and to do so in peace and security.   Since its founding--a millennia ago, in some respects--more  particularly, politically, 1948 to today, Israel has been under  constant threat and attack from those who would deny its right to  exist--not about offensive actions that they took, not about this  action that they took, to deny their very right to exist.   As we continue to stand up for a two-state solution that achieves  peace, security, hope, and opportunity for both Israelis and  Palestinians, we vigorously, strongly, unshakably, stand for Israel's  right to defend itself against terrorism.   Make no mistake: Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist organizations bent  on murder and genocide and eliminating Israel from that map of which  Mr. Deutch talked. Supported by Iran, one of the most prolific  supporters of terrorism in the world, and avowing not only the  destruction of Israel but also harm to America, Hamas and Hezbollah  continue to rain terror down on innocent Israelis.                                time  1315    In May, Hamas showed the world, yet again, why these terror  organizations remain a threat to peace to the future of both Israelis  and Palestinians. The rocket attacks that launched from Gaza, a  territory it rules with a draconian iron fist, sought to kill innocent  Israeli citizens indiscriminately.   Sadly, Hamas's attacks compelled a defensive response that led to the  deaths of innocent Palestinians trapped in harm's way or used as human  shields by the terror organization's brutal rule.   Mr. Speaker, much of the reason why so many innocent Israeli lives  were saved was because of something we have done here in Congress since  2010, which is to fund and support and jointly develop the deployment  of the defensive anti-rocket system called Iron Dome.   Iron Dome has saved countless lives since 2010, including during the  conflict in May, protecting schools, hospitals, synagogues, and family  homes. The system continues to do its job, with a rocket from Gaza  being intercepted less than 2 weeks ago.   During a period of 10 days in May, Hamas fired more than 4,400  rockets; 10 days, 4,400. Over 400 rockets a day fired into Israel, and  Iron Dome extraordinarily intercepted 90 percent of those rockets. That  number, in just 10 days, was a dramatic escalation over the number of  rockets fired at Israel by Hamas and Hezbollah over the previous 10  years, which was around 10,000, or 1,000 a year. 4,400 rockets in 10  days.   Hezbollah, by the way, and we all recognize this, is estimated, by  published reports--I don't have the classified reports--to have 130,000  rockets aimed at Israel from southern Lebanon.   The number of interceptors Israel needs to deal with these escalating  attacks is going up dramatically as well.   I talked to Mr. Lapid just 2 days ago, and he said to me:  Congressman, I really don't know. We know how many rockets they have,  we just don't know how many they will send at one time. So that we need  to make sure that there is sufficient supply, and the resupply after  the rockets, confronting the 4,400 rockets, were used. Israel needed  2,400 interceptors for 10,000 rockets. In May, it needed 2,000  interceptors to take down the 4,400.   As a result of May's unprecedented barrage and the use of Iron Dome  to defend against it, the system needs to be replenished and  strengthened.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support the development and deployment of Iron Dome as  part of the broad, bipartisan support for Israel in Congress, as well  as to support the joint American-Israeli development of the David's  Sling long-range missile system.   Why do we do that? Why do we ask the taxpayers of the United States  of America to do that? We do it because we believe it is in their best  interest. Yes, it is in Israel's interest. And, yes, it is in the  interest of Israelis. But it is in the security interest of the United  States of America. And that is why we proudly stand up and support this  funding, and other funding that we give to Israel, so that it can  remain the democracy that honors human rights.   Does everybody honor human rights every day? America? We can look in  the mirror. Every country can do that. But Israel, unlike any other  country in the Middle East, has a supreme court that says to the  government: You cannot do that.   This is the right thing to do. And then Israelis do it. A nation of  laws. A nation of morals. A nation that is committed to the democratic  process.   This House will today reflect overwhelming support in a bipartisan  basis. Today, I believe that we will again evidence our broad and  bipartisan commitment to Israel's security, the safety of its people,  and its right to self-defense.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Rosa DeLaura for introducing  this legislation and our appropriators who worked on it, as I said,  including Debbie Wasserman Schultz.   Mr. Speaker, I trust that we will pass this today in just a few  minutes. I trust the Senate will take it up immediately, and that we  will send it to the President of the United States. He supports this.  He urges that we pass it. He will do the same in the Senate. This is  the right thing to do. It is what America does. It stands up for  countries who stand up for freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House on both sides of the aisle to  overwhelmingly support the passage of this legislation.
