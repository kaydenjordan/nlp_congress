 Mr. Speaker, socialist Democrats advocate  dictatorial and guaranteed-to-fail socialism over liberty and the free  enterprise economic system that has created America's prosperity.   Merriam-Webster dictionary defines ``evil'' as ``morally  reprehensible,'' ``causing harm,'' or ``pernicious.'' By that  definition, socialism is evil, and anyone in America who supports  socialism supports evil.   Enrique Padron recently published an editorial in the New York Post  entitled: ``Hey, Democrats: Here's the price I paid for your Socialist  dream.'' It is such a revealing test of the evils of socialism that  today I read it in part into the Congressional Record:   ``American Democrats are pining ever more loudly for socialism these  days, for `free' education, `free' health care and much else.   ``Let me tell you about socialism as I lived it under the Fidel  Castro regime.   ``The house where I was born in Communist Cuba had a dirt floor, a  bathroom hole in the ground, which we shared with six other families,  and a zinc roof that left us unbearably hot in the summer and shivering  in the winter.   ``We had no running water, no refrigerator and no door in the back of  the house. We cooked with charcoal. My mother raised four boys by  herself in that `house,' working 12 hours a day to earn 160 Cuban  pesos, or approximately $6, a month.   ``Why didn't we fix it?   ``In addition to the meager income, we had no access to hardware  stores to buy nails or cement to fix our humble house. In fact, the  local member of the national assembly was the only person authorized to  approve whether we could buy a bag of cement or a roll of roof paper-- if they were available.   ``We couldn't buy these simple materials without that precious piece  of paper.   ``Can you imagine going to your congressional Representative to ask  for permission to buy a box of nails? Or roof tiles? Or roof paper? It  seems unthinkable in the United States. But in Cuba, where we lacked  the necessities of life, we had to. And when we complained, the  authorities scolded us to be grateful for free education and free  healthcare.   ``In Cuba, it is illegal to speak against the government or complain  about living conditions. We were prohibited from speaking with local  media, but the journalists were state employees and wouldn't publish  our stories anyway. We couldn't express our unmet needs and were  reminded that we shouldn't complain anyway, because we were promised-- you guessed it--free education and free healthcare.   ``In Cuba, doctors make the equivalent of 25 cents an hour and  teachers 21 cents an hour. Pharmacists earn eight cents an hour.   ``In Cuba, there is no right to free speech and virtually no  independent media. There are no free, fair, multiparty elections. In  fact, there is just one political party, Communist, and only members of  the Communist Party may run as candidates for any office. But we were  told we couldn't object to this system, lest we lose our free education  and free healthcare. . . .   ``In Cuba, if you dare to yell something true, like `Fidel and Raul  are dictators,' you could spend many years in prison. Dictatorship is  another price we had to pay for free education and free healthcare.   ``I desperately needed something more than the promises of free  education and free healthcare. I knew that I needed freedom--freedom to  speak my mind and vote my conscience. It was worth the risk of being  eaten by sharks than to continue living a life with no purpose and no  freedom.   ``On August 16, 1994, I decided to get into a boat with 20 other  Cubans in search of a future.   ``One of my two brothers followed me to the United States, also in a  raft, nearly dying of thirst and hunger during the journey. My other  brother is still awaiting the visa I filed for  him. . . .   ``After arriving in the United States, I worked as an international  sales manager, owned a restaurant, hosted a radio program and authored  two books. Today, I work for a Member of Congress. None of those  opportunities would have been possible for me in socialist Cuba.   ``I wish that one day I might have a conversation with some of these  young American socialists who have no experience with actually existing  socialism. They like to think they can have democracy and a socialist  economy. But everywhere it's been implemented, public ownership of the  means of production has led to political repression.   ``Not least in my native Cuba, with its promises of `free' cradle-to- grave services.   ``I chose so much more than the promise of `free.' I chose freedom.''   Mr. Speaker, Enrique Padron has shared his firsthand experience with  the suffering, depravity, and evils of socialism in Cuba. Americans  should heed his words.   Free enterprise is about liberty and freedom. Socialism is about  poverty and slavery through the ruling class.                            ____________________
