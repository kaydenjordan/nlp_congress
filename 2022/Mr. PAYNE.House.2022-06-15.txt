 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage everyone to support adding our  bipartisan amendment, the text of the bipartisan Payment Choice Act, to  the bill.   Recently, the bill passed the Financial Services Committee on a  bipartisan vote. I thank Chairwoman Waters for her work in helping to  advance my legislation. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia)  and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for their leadership and  support of it.   The Payment Choice Act guarantees that every consumer has the choice  to pay cash for goods and services. Right now, there is an attack on  American currency. Companies are trying to ban cash in their stores,  but cash is simple, common, and anonymous. And it is the necessary form  of payment for 55 million Americans. That is right, 55 million  Americans in this country.   The bill does not prohibit digital or other payments. Instead, it  protects cash as a payment in this Nation, as it has been throughout  our history. It protects Americans from being rejected from stores  because they can only pay in cash.   Several cities and States have enacted their own laws to protect the  right to pay cash already. This bill would provide a single law to  protect cash nationwide. More important, the bill would protect the  privacy of Americans. There is no data collection with cash  transactions. Cash is a private transaction.   Customers should have the right to refuse to hand over their personal  information for a simple purchase. It is not a partisan issue because  Democrats and Republicans support this bill. Therefore, it is an  American issue to protect American currency. I encourage all Members to  support my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman's wonderful  summary of my bill up until the point where he raised the issue around  preferential businesses, such as ATMs. There is no preferential  treatment for any industry in this bill. All retail transactions are  treated the same.   As the gentleman speaks on businesses being able to charge a higher  price, I don't know about North Carolina, but in New Jersey, when I go  to the gas station, there is a higher price charged for credit, not  cash. So I think he kind of had that in reverse.   Mr. Speaker, this is an opportunity for 55 million Americans who  don't have banking accounts or are underbanked, to continue to be a  part of this economy. There is a population in this country, believe it  or not, who would rather not be in the banking system.                                time  1415    I am just trying to protect the underserved and the underbanked. I  don't know the makeup of the gentleman's district in North Carolina,  although I think his attire is splendid with the bowtie. But back in  his district, I don't know if they are affluent or not. I have some of  the poorest Americans in my district, and they are reaching out to me  saying: What do I do?   What happens to the grandmother who lives in a two-flight walkup and  the store that she uses is on the first floor? Mr. Speaker, now, this  business decides that they are not going to accept her cash anymore.  You are asking this woman to walk another three or four blocks to find  someone, like a pauper: ``Who will take my cash? Who will take my cash?  Will you take my money? Will you take my cash?''   ``No, no cash allowed here. Be gone.''   That is what we are looking at. That is what we are trying to  prevent.   Mr. Speaker, I just say that we are here to fight for the  underserved, the underbanked, and the unbanked.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, I opposed the Supreme Court  Police Parity Act.   I fully support expanded security for Supreme Court Justices and  their families. I also firmly believe that those expanded protections  must apply to all Federal judges and their families--that is right, all  Federal judges and their families--who face similar threats with less  protective resources.   The safety of our Federal judiciary is a very personal issue for New  Jersey. Two years ago, the only child of U.S. District Judge Esther  Salas was murdered by a man who had previously appeared before her  court.   This bill was an opportunity to improve protections for all Federal  judges. Sadly, the Senate abdicated its responsibility when it ignored  calls for the inclusion of the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and  Privacy Act, introduced by my colleague Mikie Sherrill and Senator  Menendez, in this bill.   Democrats are committed, as is every member of the New Jersey  delegation, to ensuring that all Federal judicial officials and their  families are safe.                            ____________________
