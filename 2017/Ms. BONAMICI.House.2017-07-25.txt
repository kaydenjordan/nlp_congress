 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 111, a  resolution that will undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  and allow financial institutions to continue taking advantage of  consumers.   The CFPB's arbitration rule protects consumers, including students,  servicemembers, and seniors, by allowing them access to justice in  court and to participate in class action lawsuits against unscrupulous  financial institutions.   I am a former consumer protection lawyer. I have no problem with  arbitration clauses when they are agreed to by parties with equal  bargaining power, but we have seen what happens when institutions  include nonnegotiable forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of  consumer contracts.   Private student loan providers, payday lenders, credit card  companies, and banks have consumers sign away their rights to access  the court system when they are cheated. The CFPB rule will address that  inequity and provide consumers with a remedy.   We must reject this effort to roll back consumer protections and  allow the CFPB to continue to do their important work. Please vote  ``no.''
