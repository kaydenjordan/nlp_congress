(a) Clause 3(g)(3)(C) of rule II is amended to read       as follows:        ``(C) Upon receipt of an appeal pursuant to subdivision       (B), the Committee on Ethics shall have a period of 30       calendar days or five legislative days, whichever is later,       to consider the appeal. The fine will be upheld unless the       appeal is agreed to by a majority of the Committee. Upon a       determination regarding the appeal or if no appeal has been       filed at the expiration of the period specified in       subdivision (B), the chair of the Committee on Ethics shall       promptly notify the Member, Delegate, or the Resident       Commissioner, the Speaker, the Sergeant-at-Arms, and the       Chief Administrative Officer, and shall make such       notification publicly available. The Speaker shall promptly       lay such notification before the House.''.

Sec. 9.  Section 5 of House Resolution 8, agreed to January       4, 2021 (as amended by House Resolution 41, agreed to January       13, 2021), is amended by striking ``February 11'' each place       that it appears and inserting ``March 12''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 85, providing for consideration of H.R. 447,  the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor.  The rule self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman Scott, makes  in order 26 amendments, provides en bloc authority to Chairman Scott,  and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H. Con. Res. 11 under a  closed rule. It self-executes a manager's amendment by Chairman  Yarmuth. It also provides 3 hours of debate with 2 hours equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Budget and 1 hour equally divided and controlled by  Representatives Beyer of Virginia and Schweikert of Arizona, or their  respective designees.  [[Page H267]]    The rule also provides that H. Res. 73 is hereby adopted. The rule  updates the process by which Members can appeal fines for refusing to  wear a mask or for taking photographs or recording audio or video on  the House floor to align with the Ethics Committee appeal procedures  established in H. Res. 73.   Finally, the rule extends standard district work period instructions,  same day, and suspension authority through March 12, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, the National Apprenticeship Act is critical workforce  development legislation that will invest $3.5 billion to create nearly  1 million new apprenticeship opportunities over the next 5 years. This  is a history investment in workforce training, and I am so pleased to  support this effort.   Skilled workers are the backbone of our economy. And apprenticeships  provide a unique opportunity to grow and expand access to this  workforce.   Not only do apprenticeship programs provide pathways to meaningful  and sustainable careers, they are critical to expanding our Nation's  skilled workforce. When I meet with local businesses in my district in  Rochester, New York, I regularly hear that their greatest challenge is  finding skilled labor to fill positions and keep their businesses  thriving.   Apprenticeships provide an invaluable pathway to engage workers,  establish connections with high-demand industries, and set workers on a  path to a rewarding and sustainable career.   I note that as the son of an individual who dropped out of high  school at the age of 16, my dad, after service in Korea in the United  States Army, came home and got involved in an apprenticeship for the  Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 13 Union and had a long, long career  where he retired at the age of 70 after having supported a family of  seven. What was directly responsible for that was the apprenticeship  program and his ability to build that sustained career.   I am particularly proud that a bill I introduced with my colleague,  Congresswoman Trahan, has been included in the text of the National  Apprenticeship Act. Our bill helps scale up participation among  populations not typically engaged in apprenticeships, particularly  small- and medium-sized businesses, and together we can create new  opportunities in high-demand industries.   Now, more than ever, these programs are critical to grapple with the  long-term economic impacts of COVID-19.   This week we will also begin the next phase of addressing the ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic through H. Con. Res. 11, a budget resolution for  fiscal year 2021. Passing this budget resolution is a necessary step to  fast-track essential COVID relief, the American Rescue Plan.   This plan will deliver the direct support the American public needs,  including a national vaccination program, direct aid to individuals and  families, housing and nutrition assistance, and expansion and extension  of unemployment insurance, small business assistance, and resources to  protect first responders and frontline workers.   Our Nation has endured an unprecedented health and economic crisis  which has now claimed the lives of nearly half a million Americans.  After 11 months, far too many Americans are still barely scraping by or  falling further behind, through no fault of their own, as they lose  jobs or see smaller paychecks. We need immediate, bold action to change  the course of the virus and stabilize our economy.    Beginning the budget reconciliation process does not preclude a  strong bipartisan agreement on a relief package that can gain wide  support in both the House and the Senate. Let me repeat that. It does  not preclude a strong, bipartisan agreement on a relief package that  can gain wide support in our House and across the building in the  Senate. But it does ensure that Congress will be able to move forward  without becoming delayed by partisan gridlock at a time when so many  lives and livelihoods are at stake.   The budget resolution before us provides a framework for  reconciliation with a target of up to $1.9 trillion, allocated across  12 congressional committees. The resolution instructs these committees  to report legislation consistent with their targets to the Budget  Committee by February 16. The Budget Committee will then combine the  legislation--without substantive revision--and prepare it for floor  consideration.   The 2021 budget resolution is not a comprehensive blueprint for the  next 10 years. It is designed solely to respond to the ongoing crisis  and to deliver critical relief as quickly as possible.   Once we have finished the work of passing a complete COVID response  package, I look forward to continuing our work on the Budget Committee  to craft a complete forward-looking budget resolution for fiscal year  2022.                                time  1715    We have already lost so much time. Passing this resolution ensures  that relief can get to Americans in need, who cannot wait another  minute for help.   Mr. Speaker, I would also take a moment to recognize that, less than  1 month ago, this Chamber was besieged by antidemocracy extremists who  intended to harm this institution and even kill some of our colleagues.   The rule provides penalties for any Member of the House who endangers  colleagues by violating the rules of this Chamber. Members are not,  under any circumstances, permitted to bring firearms on the floor of  the U.S. House of Representatives. That has been in law and regulation  since 1967.   As President Ronald Reagan said: ``Trust, but verify.''   Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, there should be no problem with  requiring Members to walk through metal detectors into the Chamber,  ensuring that everyone is following the same rules, ensuring the safety  of each and every Member of this body, and ensuring that many members  of our staff who work here day in and day out are protected.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and H.  Con. Res. 11 and the National Apprenticeship Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I first want to say to the distinguished  gentleman, my friend: These are not partisan priorities; these are  American priorities.   I doubt very much that most Americans care about the process we use  as they struggle to feed their families or as they struggle to pay  their rent each month, when they face unemployment that could be  extended. But here is an opportunity for us to work together. This is  the beginning of the process, and we will continue to encourage  bipartisan discussion on a budget resolution that provides meaningful  relief for millions of Americans affected by this virus.   As it relates to the National Apprenticeship Act, I would also  suggest that this is a bipartisan bill. I can name the Members of my  colleagues across the aisle: Mr. Fitzpatrick; Mr. McKinley; Members  Bacon and Bost; my friend, Rodney Davis, from Illinois; John Katko,  whose district abuts mine; Andy Garbarino, my friend from New York;  Representatives Stauber, Kinzinger, Stivers--all Republicans who  support and sponsor the National Apprenticeship Act. So this is a  bipartisan bill, and I will continue to advocate for its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the chairman of the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will admit that there are few people I respect more  than my distinguished colleague and friend from the Rules Committee,  the ranking member, Mr. Cole.   But I think as it relates to the budget, as I understand it, the  Budget Committee chair, Mr. Yarmuth, has continued to extend an  invitation to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work  together.   And we do want to work together. We want to forge a bipartisan  agreement. This today begins a process, however, that can move us  toward reconciliation because we understand that the American people  are in crisis. America is in crisis.   So while we need to move ahead, and we would like to move ahead with  a bipartisan agreement, we cannot sit idly by in the instance that  progress is not made.   I think it was President Kennedy in his inauguration, nearly 60 years  ago, who said, ``Sincerity is always subject to proof.'' So prove to us  your sincerity. Let's work together. And in the interim, we are going  to move ahead with this resolution with the support of the Members, and  I certainly hope that they will do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman's point, I appreciate the passion with  which the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee makes  his argument, but why are we moving ahead, he asked.   Why we are moving ahead today?   The President ran on this very relief agenda and won the popular vote  in the United States by more than 8 million votes. We are moving ahead  because elections do matter, and the argument that President Biden made  is that this country needed swift, significant, and robust relief. That  is why we are moving ahead.   Now, I will continue to say--and I am sure my colleagues will  continue to say--that the Democrat majority invites bipartisan  conversation. We would invite all the Members on the other side to come  together in a meaningful way to talk about unemployment insurance for  the millions of Americans who are out of work, through no fault of  their own--millions.   Hundreds of thousands are filing every week for the first time.  Millions of Americans don't have enough food on the table. One out of  every eight Americans are saying they don't have enough money for food  to put on the table.   This is for the millions of Americans who don't have enough money to  pay their rent or pay their mortgage, and for the millions of small  businesses--or the tens of thousands of small businesses struggling  every single week, again, through no fault of their own.   Why are we moving ahead today?   Because there is no more time left on the clock. We need to move  ahead in order to provide the substantial relief.   I would also suggest that those who will say that this is too  expensive, you only look to find economists all over this country  beginning with the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who was  appointed by the President to his position, who has consistently said  that the worst thing we can do is make too small of an investment. We  must  [[Page H271]]  make a robust investment. It is what President Bident talked about  repeatedly through this campaign.   There is no hidden agenda here. This is, in fact, the agenda that was  talked about repeatedly throughout the campaign. The American public  resoundingly responded to the package that the President has now put  forward, the package which we would like to take up. We would certainly  like to do it with our brothers and sisters on the other side of the  aisle, but we are prepared, if not, to respond to the needs of millions  of Americans who are in crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I just say that those Americans who are watching what we  do here today and over the next several days, they are going to be  asking the question: What are you doing in Washington that will help  the average man or woman and child who suffers the ravages of this  disease and the economic fallout?   When I talk to people in Rochester, New York--and I am sure when each  of us goes back to our home districts--people aren't asking about the  nuance of legislative procedures. They are asking about what the  government is going to do for them as we face the greatest pandemic in  a century and the greatest economic challenge in nearly a century both  at the same time. We have so many other challenges as well, but the  House of Representatives is going to move forward. This resolution does  that. It says that we will certainly encourage bipartisan agreements,  bipartisan conversations, and bipartisan action.   The President's conversations with members of the Senate yesterday  indicate his willingness to do that. But we cannot wait. We have waited  far too long. Too many Americans have died and too many families have  faced the crisis of their lifetimes because of the inaction here in  Washington. So we must move ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of the rule  before us today. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
