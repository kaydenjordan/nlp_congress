 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is the chair of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.                           Recognizing Marcus Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing collapse  of one of the world's most beautiful cities.   San Francisco has been deteriorating for years, but it is now in a  state of total free fall. In just the last few weeks, Nordstrom  announced it is closing its San Francisco stores, which Westfield Mall  is blaming on the ``lack of enforcement against rampant criminal  activity.''   Whole Foods Market is closing its flagship mid-market location citing  the safety of employees after 568 emergency calls in 13 months.   T-Mobile just announced it is permanently shuttering its flagship  location, and Anthropologie and Saks also announced closures this  month.   My district starts about 100 miles inland from San Francisco. I have  many memories of visiting San Francisco as a child. Tens of thousands  of my constituents used to visit every year, visiting Fisherman's  Wharf, Ghirardelli Square, riding the trolley cars, going to Giants  games, and countless other forms of art, entertainment, and culture.                                time  1945    By and large, that is not the case anymore. People have learned to  stay away, and that is because, as the San Francisco Chronicle put it,  the city is on ``the verge of collapse.''   Mr. Speaker, let's zoom out for a moment and look at the State of  California as a whole. The census recently reported new population  estimates for 2022. We lost residents again, dipping below 30 million  people. Over the last 3 years, California has lost a net 871,000 people  to other States. That is unusual in our history. In fact, prior to  2020, it was unprecedented. For every year on record, going back to  1900, our State's population grew.   Over decades, the Golden State forged an identity of historic  significance and was at the leading edge of social, political, and  technological progress. Ronald Reagan, in his inaugural address as  Governor, said California should never take second place. We were the  State where anyone could get ahead.   Now, sadly, we have become the State many can't wait to leave behind.  We do lead the Nation, but in all of the wrong ways: Poverty,  inequality, taxes, regulation, income stagnation, and, yes, departures.   The decline of California matters not just for people in our State.  It is a grave national concern. Beyond being the most populous State in  the Union, the identity of California is central to the identity of  America. A loss for one is, by definition, a loss for the other.   California's problems are becoming America's problems in a larger  sense as well. California's Governor, Gavin Newsom, has touted  California as a ``model for the Nation.'' President Biden is taking him  at his word. From crime to immigration, to education, to economic and  workforce policies, this administration's governing motto might as well  be: As California goes, so goes the Nation.   If California offers a preview of where our country is headed if we  don't change course, San Francisco offers an even starker warning.  Indeed, before he was Governor of California, Newsom was mayor of San  Francisco. Fittingly, it was during his red State tour last month,  where he left his post as Governor to lecture other States on how to  govern themselves, that Newsom's own home city reached the point of  total collapse.   Upon his return, Newsom had no choice but to recognize how dire the  situation had become, taking the extraordinary step of sending the  National Guard into San Francisco. His model for the Nation is one that  requires military intervention just to maintain order.   San Francisco is the part of our State where failed policies, radical  politics, and public corruption are in their most advanced stage, and  where residents are most rapidly fleeing.   In an article headlined ``San Francisco Falls Into the Abyss,'' UCLA  economics professor Lee Ohanian writes, ``No major . . . city has  failed at the same level as Detroit, whose population dropped from 1.85  million people in 1950 to about 630,000 today. Move over Detroit, here  comes San Francisco,'' he writes, ``which lost 6.3 percent of its  population between 2019 and 2021, a rate of decline larger than any 2- year period in Detroit's history and unprecedented among any major U.S.  city.''   The reasons for this are not a mystery. They are readily apparent,  just by visiting and walking around the city. Foremost among them are  crime, drug addiction, homelessness, waste, unaffordability, and  failing schools, all as a result of failed governance.   Starting with crime, California has essentially legalized many forms  of it, making theft of merchandise below $950 a misdemeanor as well as  the possession of even class A drugs. In practice, this means offenders  are rarely, if ever, prosecuted, and businesses have stopped even  reporting losses.   San Francisco's anti-law enforcement policies have dramatically  compounded these problems. Under former District Attorney George  Gascon, crime rose significantly across the board, including aggravated  assault, sexual assault, carjackings, retail theft, and much more.   Gascon's successor, another so-called progressive prosecutor, elected  through substantial outside funding, was so reckless in not prosecuting  crime that dozens of his own prosecutors quit, and the voters of San  Francisco overwhelmingly recalled him from office.   To make matters worse, in 2020, San Francisco defunded the police,  shifting $120 million away from law enforcement.   Last year, the Castro Merchants Association, representing 125  businessowners, wrote a scathing letter regarding the city's failure to  address the lawlessness around them. One  [[Page H2157]]  member said: We are just seeing constant vandalism, constant drug use  in public, people passed out on the sidewalk, people having psychotic  breakdowns, and it is just not something a small business owner should  have to deal with.   One facet of the crime problem, drug use, is now ubiquitous to the  sights and sounds of the city. Walking through San Francisco, you will  see open drug use and drug dealing, with an open-air drug market that  even Gavin Newsom is now sending in the National Guard to disrupt.  While California has among the highest rates of illegal drug use in the  country, San Francisco is well above the State average. Tragically, the  number of overdose deaths has skyrocketed in recent years, from 222 in  2017 to 647 last year.   This only got worse during the COVID shutdowns, as far more people in  the city died from overdoses than from COVID. Facing among the most  punishing lockdowns in the country, emergency room mental health visits  increased substantially, especially for young people.   It certainly doesn't help matters that the supply of drugs is so  abundant, thanks to the crisis at our border, and San Francisco  declared itself a sanctuary city even before California became a  sanctuary State.   Very much connected to the crises of crime, drug use, and mental  health is the explosion of homelessness in San Francisco. Once again,  while California leads the Nation in homelessness, San Francisco is  worst of all. Between 2005 and 2020, the number of homeless  increased from 5,404 to 8,124. During that same period, homelessness  declined significantly nationwide. Within the 3-year span, complaints  of homeless encampments to the city's 311 line increased from 2 to 62  per day, and the share of the homeless population that is unsheltered  has also gone up significantly in recent years.    Another feature of the San Francisco landscape that contributes and  is a sign of the continuing deterioration is the appearance of waste.  Between 2014 and 2018, calls about human feces doubled to 20,933. $100  million was spent on street cleaning in 2019 alone. In a 3-year span,  the city replaced 300 lampposts corroded by urine. The overall  condition of many areas is something no American should ever have to  experience, especially kids, while they are on their way walking to  school.   Speaking of schools, San Francisco Unified has the second widest  achievement gap of any school district in California with over 5,000  students. A CalMatters investigation from 2017 found that San Francisco  had the highest Black student achievement gap of any county in  California. Just 19 percent of Black students in San Francisco passed  the State's reading test compared to 31 percent statewide, and this was  before COVID.   While California was last in the Nation getting students back to  school, San Francisco was again worst of all, keeping schools closed  not only in 2020, but through the end of the 2020-2021 school year.  While they refused to actually operate schools, the district instead  spent time on a commission to rename them, even proposing taking  Abraham Lincoln's name off of an elementary school. The district then  came up with a scheme to scam the State by pretending to open for the  last 2 weeks of the school year in order to get millions of dollars in  extra funding. Predictably, after these school closures, test scores  have since plummeted even further. The citizens of San Francisco  responded by recalling three of the school board members from office,  each by over 70 percent of the vote.   As if these basic quality of life issues weren't enough, the city has  also become completely unaffordable. A survey from The Economist  Intelligence Unit found that San Francisco is one of the 10 most  expensive cities to live in in the entire world. Average rent for a  one-bedroom apartment is over $3,500. According to data from the  California Association of Realtors, a San Franciscan needs to make  nearly $400,000 to buy a median-income home. The cost of utilities,  groceries, and other goods is also well above the national average.   At the root of all of these problems is uniquely bad governance. The  San Francisco Chronicle put it this way: ``San Francisco's bureaucracy  isn't just incompetent and comically inefficient, it is a corrupting  force in our city life. Spiritually, yes.'' They wrote, ``But also  literally.'' They called it a ``corruption born of needlessly  complicated government bureaucracy.''   To take a few examples, it costs an estimated $100,000 to build one  tiny home for the homeless in San Francisco. That is 10 times more than  even other places in the bay area. It costs almost $1.2 million to  build a single unit of affordable housing. It can take 87 permits,  1,000 days of meetings, and $500,000 in fees to build residential  housing projects. Recently, San Francisco politicians boasted they had  ``brought home the bacon'' by securing $1.7 million in taxpayer dollars  for a single toilet.   The public transportation system is a model of mismanagement, with  Bay Area Rapid Transit facing a $1.1 billion deficit over 5 years, with  trains that are dangerous to ride and that rarely ever show up on time.  No wonder ridership has plummeted. The city itself, by the way, is  projecting a $728 million deficit over just the next 2 fiscal years.   I don't want to see California, and San Francisco in particular,  continue to decline, and I certainly don't want its problems to  continue to spread to the rest of the country. The Federal Government  provides an abundance of Federal funding to San Francisco, and it must  start treating this jurisdiction for what it is: A failed city. With  all of this Federal funding going to San Francisco, those funds are  often being used in ways that seem to do more harm than good. For  future funding, it is important to give extra scrutiny and oversight to  how these funds are being used, and the funding should be accompanied  by conditions that will stimulate reform.   I believe it is not too late to turn around this city or our State.  For proof, you can look at the communities of my district. While  California as a whole is declining in population, the vast majority of  my district is growing. Placer County and Folsom, for instance, are  growing as much as anywhere in California. Our communities are rated  among the best in California to live, raise a family, and retire. While  California as a State leads the Nation in U-Haul departures, Roseville  is the second-place city in the entire country in U-Haul arrivals.   Many of the people leaving San Francisco are coming to my district  for safer communities, a more manageable cost of living, better  schools, and an overall better quality of life. During the COVID-19  era, we kept our businesses and schools open, got them open earlier  than anywhere, avoiding much of the damage experienced across the  State, and we also had among the State's best public health outcomes.   We still face the headwinds of misguided policies enacted at the  State level, but we strive to use tools of local governance and  community partnerships to do what is best for our citizens. This is the  model that our State should strive for, and it is the model that many  other States are already following. It is the model for our country to  reverse the policies that have gotten us so off track in recent years.   In this way, the collapse of San Francisco is a wake-up call, a  warning to the Nation about the need for a course correction. I look  forward to working with people of good faith on both sides of the aisle  to save this beautiful city and to prevent the rest of our country from  going down the same path.                  Recognizing Brave Law Enforcement Officers    MR. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer congressional  recognition to the brave law enforcement officers who work tirelessly  and at great personal sacrifice to keep our communities safe. From  keeping our schools secure to apprehending violent criminals and  protecting our children and citizens from the scourge of drugs, every  single American benefits daily from the tremendous dedication and  commitment to community exhibited by the men and women who protect and  serve.    Unfortunately, in recent years, our police have come under often  baseless and sometimes callous criticism that has made an already  daunting job all the more difficult to accomplish. In fact, I have  personally heard from numerous police chiefs, sheriffs, and other law  enforcement leaders from my district in California that these  unwarranted attacks and charged rhetoric  [[Page H2158]]  are directly posing recruitment challenges in our community and  endangering public safety.   This is all the more jarring considering the extent to which our  police selflessly give up things you and I regularly take for granted.  These individuals are regularly willing to insert themselves into life- threatening situations to protect the life of others, actively pursuing  violent felons and other hardened criminals that threaten our most  fundamental rights and freedoms, spending evenings and weekends away  from their families to serve us. In fact, multiple officers have made  the ultimate sacrifice, given up their lives in the line of duty to  keep the people of California safe.                                time  2000    Although we can never truly repay the debt we owe to these  individuals, at the very least, we owe it to them to do everything in  our power to correct the record and shift the public paradigm to return  to giving law enforcement the level of respect and honor that they have  undeniably earned.   In that spirit, I would like to propose a national congressional  police honor roll. Each Member of Congress would accept nominations  from local law enforcement leaders in their community and select a  handful of outstanding officers, detectives, and sheriffs to recognize  on the House floor during National Police Week for their service,  sacrifice, and dedication to community.   My office has been receiving nominations for such an honor roll.  Today, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the time to recognize the  individuals I have chosen for the Third District of California's Police  Honor Roll.   Mr. Speaker, I offer congressional recognition to Officer Wesley  Collins of the Lincoln Police Department.   Officer Collins began his law enforcement career as an explorer in  2001 with the Placer County Sheriff's Office. In 2003, he became a  full-time correctional officer with the Placer County Sheriff's Office.  He then worked for the Grass Valley Police Department as an officer  from 2004 to 2006. In 2006, he joined the Lincoln Police Department,  where he has served since that date.   While assigned to the patrol division, Officer Collins assumed the  role of range master, providing tactical training to sworn staff and  overseeing compliance requirements for the department.   In 2020, Officer Collins applied for and was selected for the  assignment of school resource officer. His assignment required him to  be a presence at Lincoln High School, interacting with students and  assisting staff with a variety of topics. Though the basic needs of the  assignment were simple, Officer Collins observed a number of areas that  could improve student safety at the school.   Since that time, and primarily in 2022, Officer Collins accomplished  the following for Lincoln High School and other schools in the  district.   First, he worked with district administration and school staff to  assist with school site threat assessments.   Second, he assisted the district in overhauling the school safety  plans. This included painting large numbers on the roofs of all  buildings for easy identification by air ops and added and will be  adding dozens of new security cameras, fencing, and bullet-resistant 3M  window film to all sites.   Third, he created a school response binder that contains updated maps  with important contact information for all district staff and school  locations, along with master keys to all school sites.   He worked with district administration to show the need for STOP THE  BLEED kits. He assisted in obtaining over 500 STOP THE BLEED kits for  the school sites using COVID medical funds. Every classroom and high- risk area in the district was equipped with a kit, and Officer Collins  assisted in training the entire district staff on the use, philosophy,  and prepping of the kits with the district's RNs.   He worked with the Lincoln Kiwanis Club to raise $1,000 to purchase  STOP THE BLEED kits for John Adams Academy. The kits were delivered to  the staff and have been dispersed around the school site.   He created and trained the LPD staff on active-shooter response in  2022, with the assistance of city and school staff.   He worked on creating and teaching the combined active-shooter  response training for 2023 with the Lincoln Fire Department to be  conducted at LHS.   He built close working relationships with the district staff, from  the superintendent down to line staff, and helped rebuild the SRO  program. This includes adding a third SRO position for the 2023-2024  school year, which was fully funded by the school district.   He assisted district administration with establishing reunification  sites for students and families around the district and city in case of  critical incidents.   He gave a comprehensive presentation for the WPUSD board to update  them on all the school safety updates that have been accomplished and  ones that are being worked on.   He actively conducted youth development network trainings with city  and district staff and was given an award by the Lincoln Kiwanis Club  for his work with the youth of Lincoln.   He also has become an informal liaison between the LPD and the  district and has built relationships with the staff and the school  wellness centers to identify and help students with mental health  needs. The early intervention and relationship building has created an  environment where students can approach him or the staff so they can  guide students to help before a true mental health emergency occurs.   I should note that the accomplishments I mentioned are outside of the  basic requirements of Officer Collins' assignment. He has a heart for  serving the youth of the Lincoln community and has gone far beyond what  has been expected of him in this position. He has become a critical  asset between the Lincoln Police Department and the school district and  has dramatically filled the safety void our district was experiencing.   On a near-weekly basis, he attends meetings, functions, or other  school-related events outside of his regular workday. He is a model  school resource officer who other school resource officers should  strive to emulate.   For these reasons and more, I am honored to include Officer Wesley  Collins of the Lincoln Police Department in the Third District of  California's Police Honor Roll.               Congressional Recognition of Sheriff Mike Fisher     Mr. Speaker, I offer congressional recognition to Sheriff  Mike Fisher of the Sierra County Sheriff's Department.    Sierra County is the second smallest county in California, with a  population of about 3,000 individuals. Sheriff Fisher has lived in  Sierra County most of his life and has had a significant positive  impact on the community.   Sheriff Fisher began his law enforcement career as an explorer from  1986 to 1990 and served as deputy sheriff from 2001 to 2007 and as a  detective from 2007 to 2018. He was elected as sheriff in 2018 and has  served in that position since.   Sheriff Fisher has a long history of service in Sierra County, and  residents showed their appreciation and approval of his work by  electing Mike as sheriff for a second term in 2022.   He is truly a hands-on sheriff. In addition to the administrative  duties that come with running the sheriff's office, he goes on patrol  and EMS calls, bailiffs when needed, and assists with high school  senior projects, including a recent Every 15 Minutes program and a mock  trial. He recently took over as the Office of Emergency Services  supervisor for Sierra County, as well.   Sheriff Fisher has extensive training and experience in locating and  eradicating illegal marijuana grows in Sierra County and is skillful in  doing overflights to spot the illegal grows and obtain search warrants.  He has a pilot's license and is a drone operator.   Since taking office, Sheriff Fisher has made significant  improvements, including extensive training for deputies, new radios,  and new vehicles.   He is also very organized and levelheaded. Sierra County had its  first murder in 20 years in July 2020, which required assistance from  outside agencies. He was able to coordinate numerous agencies, and the  suspect was successfully apprehended.   Sheriff Fisher is familiar with all areas of our rural county and is  able to supervise our somewhat frequent search and rescue activities.   Our county is known for outdoor activities and is home to the  Downieville Downhill, a mountain bike race. We also have a few mountain  bikers who  [[Page H2159]]  go off-trail, and Sheriff Fisher seems to know where they are. In  addition, he is an avid fly fisher and knows all the great spots for  fishing.   Sierra County also has a marine patrol, off-highway vehicles,  including snowmobiles, and a new canine unit, which was implemented  during Sheriff Fisher's first term.   For his dedication to Sierra County, organizational leadership, and  selflessness in helping his neighbors, I am honored to include Sheriff  Mike Fisher of the Sierra County Sheriff's Office in the Third District  of California's Police Honor Roll.              Congressional Recognition of Sergeant Dave Scobie     Mr. Speaker, I offer congressional recognition to Sergeant  Dave Scobie of the Bishop Police Department.   Sergeant Dave Scobie was promoted to his current rank in March 2022.  Sergeant Scobie began his career in the Mammoth Lakes Police Department  in 2004 and also worked for the Mono County Sheriff's Department prior  to joining the Bishop force.   Sergeant Scobie is married with two children. When not working as a  member of the Bishop Police Department, he is active with the local Boy  Scouts.   Sergeant Scobie has also been involved with the Eastern Sierra Shop  with a Cop program since 2012 and has taken charge and spearheaded the  annual event since 2015. This event provides holiday gifts to local  children and their families from Mono and Inyo Counties. Since the  inception of the program, there have been over 500 children and their  families who have participated in the event. Despite the restrictions  of the COVID pandemic and the loss of the only department store in  Bishop, Sergeant Scobie still managed to ensure the Shop with a Cop  program was successful.   For going above and beyond to deliver results for the Eastern Sierra,  I am honored to include Sergeant Dave Scobie of the Bishop Police  Department in the Third District of California's Police Honor Roll.             Congressional Recognition of Detective Ken Nakamura     Mr. Speaker, I offer congressional recognition to  Detective Ken Nakamura of the Roseville Police Department.   Detective Nakamura began his law enforcement career in 1999 with the  San Jose Police Department. He worked for SJPD for 2 years, assigned to  their patrol division.   In 2001, Ken Nakamura began his employment with the Roseville Police  Department. Detective Nakamura began his career with RPD working in the  patrol division until 2005 and during this 4-year timeframe was awarded  numerous awards, along with the 10851 pin, which is the Stolen Vehicle  Award for apprehensions and stolen vehicle recoveries.   In 2005, Detective Nakamura was assigned to our crime suppression  unit and worked in CSU until 2010. Detective Nakamura was a driving  force of the unit and vital in the team's mission to make Roseville a  safer place for its citizens.   Detective Nakamura was a gang investigator and worked hundreds of  cases that resulted in arrests of violent felons and drug dealers. The  impact that he had while working in CSU is still unmatched to this day.   From 2010 to 2013, Detective Nakamura worked in a uniform patrol  capacity. He was assigned as a field training officer. In that  capacity, he was able to instill his experience and work ethic in our  newly hired officers.   From 2013 to 2018, Detective Nakamura was assigned to our  investigations unit. He worked both property and crimes against persons  cases, and his tenacity with his investigations led to hundreds of  arrests during his tenure in investigations.   From 2019 to the present, he has been assigned as the Roseville  Police Department's threat assessment detective. As a threat assessment  detective, he is assigned cases of high priority that usually involve  persons that are a high risk to society.   Detective Nakamura's caseload varies but includes the following:  stalking cases, domestic violence, threats to the public, and threats  to schools and places of worship.    While working as a threat assessment detective, he saw the need to  form a threat assessment committee of law enforcement agencies in  Placer County. Detective Nakamura was the leader and the driving force  to start this threat assessment committee. The TAC is a committee  formed in cooperation with the Placer County District Attorney's  Office. This allows all law enforcement agencies to meet on a regular  basis to discuss individuals that are of concern and a threat to the  community.   The TAC is a tremendous benefit to all agencies in Placer County  since we know that criminals who pose risks to the public do not commit  crimes within a geographical boundary.   Detective Nakamura developed a plan and process as to why the TAC  would be beneficial to our county and held a meeting to propose its  formation to allied agencies in the county. The stakeholders from  around Placer County agreed with him and saw the need for the TAC,  which was founded in 2021.   I commend Detective Nakamura for bringing the TAC to reality and  working with stakeholders of multiple disciplines to make this happen.  Since its inception, it has grown into something that all agencies are  now participating in, in Placer County.   Detective Nakamura has made countless arrests during his time as a  threat assessment detective. His investigations have made the public  safer by taking dangerous criminals off the streets, folks that commit  acts of violence.   Detective Nakamura was also the driving force to bring behavioral  threat assessment management to the Roseville Joint Union High School  District. This process was presented to all district employees in 2022  and will help all RJUHSD employees identify threats to individual high  school campuses, making our kids who attend these schools safer.   Detective Nakamura was an instructor and presenter of the BTAM when  it rolled out in 2022. In addition to being a BTAM instructor,  Detective Nakamura is also a certified master trainer for the  Department of Homeland Security regarding behavioral threat assessment  and management.   For these reasons and more, I am honored to include Detective Ken  Nakamura of the Roseville Police Department in the Third District of  California's Police Honor Roll.                                time  2015               Officer Chad Quirarte Congressional Recognition     Mr. Speaker, I offer congressional recognition to Officer  Chad Quirarte of the Roseville Police Department.   Officer Quirarte started his career with the Roseville Police  Department in 2019 and was assigned to the patrol division. Officer  Quirarte was a very proactive officer and made countless arrests for  property crimes, DUIs, drug arrests, and violent crimes, as well. While  working in our patrol division, Officer Quirarte received several  commendations for his efforts.   In 2021, Officer Quirarte was selected to work as a school resource  officer assigned to Adelante High School, which is now called Pathways  High School.   The student population at this school includes the kids who did not  meld well with a comprehensive campus site. Students at Pathways have  not had access to sports equipment and sports programs, so Officer  Quirarte has been a champion for this effort by raising money for the  students to compete in high school sports events. During his tenure,  Officer Quirarte has also had a significant impact at Adelante.   To take one example, Officer Quirarte saw the need for a sports  program on his high school campus. It was driven not just by the need  for physical activity for the kids, but also as a way to get the  students engaged in school and do well academically. This approach  built a great relationship between Officer Quirarte and the students at  his school with a segment of students who might have otherwise had  issues with law enforcement.   Additionally, Officer Quirarte's goal was to have flag football,  basketball, baseball, and softball on campus starting in 2021. However,  there was no funding for these sports programs. Officer Quirarte worked  with Bayside Adventure Church, and they donated $5,000 to the school,  which fully funded the sports program.   From the beginning of the sports programs through that year, Officer  Quirarte could see a change in the athletes as people, and there were  positive changes in their academics as well.  [[Page H2160]]    In 2022, Officer Quirarte received the California Continuing  Education Association PLUS School Resource Officer of the Year award.  The school staff at Adelante High School nominated him for this award  due to his unique approach to his duties as an SRO.   These duties included developing a new sports program, securing funds  and transportation for sporting teams, organizing games, and most  importantly, helping to include kids from all walks of life in the  sports program so they can feel a sense of belonging and achievement.   What is even more amazing is the associated statistical data  regarding student grades. Since the sports teams were developed,  Adelante staff noticed better student performance and a rise in student  GPAs.   In December of 2022, Officer Quirarte worked with Tilton Pacific  Construction in Rocklin on a year-end Christmas charity fund drive for  a local charity. Tilton Pacific knew of the need for additional funding  for the sports programs at Pathways High School. Due to Officer  Quirarte's efforts, they raised $22,000 for the sports programs at  Pathways High School, which will fund these programs for the next  couple of years.   Officer Quirarte has had an impact on his campus outside of  athletics, as well. He has helped several students on and off campus  that have been in mental health crisis. Due to Officer Quirarte's  efforts, these students were able to receive services for their  individual issues. In one case, Officer Quirarte worked with a local  business to get mattresses delivered to a student's house because the  student did not have a bed to sleep on at night.   Officer Quirarte has the most challenging students in the district  that attend his high school. Due to Officer Quirarte's efforts, he has  made an impact on campus and has changed lives in a positive manner.   For these reasons and more, I am honored to include Officer Chad  Quirarte of the Roseville Police Department in the Third District of  California's Police Honor Roll.   Mr. Speaker, I should note that in addition to the five law  enforcement officials recognized, there were several others that were  chosen for the Third District of California's Police Honor Roll that,  due to the sensitive nature of their work, would not be appropriate to  recognize in a highly public setting.   On behalf of the Third District of California, I extend my most  profound thanks and gratitude to the officers included in this  inaugural Police Honor Roll.   Additionally, I invite my colleagues to join me in the future to  expand the Congressional Police Honor Roll program.        Welcoming Bosch to Third Congressional District of California     Mr. Speaker, I would acknowledge some very noteworthy  individuals, organizations, and occasions in my district.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome a groundbreaking investment in our community's  economy by tech and consumer goods manufacturer, Bosch.   Bosch recently acquired the Roseville-based chipmaker, TSI  Semiconductors, and announced plans to invest $1.2 billion into the  existing Roseville facility.   This major investment will significantly expand their production of  silicon carbide chips, create good-paying jobs and opportunities  throughout the entire region, and position Roseville as a regional  leader in receiving investment from a rapidly growing business sector  producing cutting-edge technology.   I had the pleasure of meeting with Bosch's leadership prior to the  investment announcement and now wish to publicly convey a warm welcome  on behalf of California's Third Congressional District.   In choosing to invest in Placer County, Bosch has selected a  community where local government is strongly supportive of creating  jobs and opportunities for investment, where citizens enjoy a high  quality of life, and where private sector investments in the economy  have a strong track record of paying off for both businesses and the  broader region.    I will continue to encourage businesses to choose to invest in the  people of California's Third Congressional District to help grow our  economy, create more middle-class jobs, and expand opportunities for  our residents.                      National Teacher Appreciation Week     Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of National Teacher  Appreciation Week, I wish to take a moment to recognize the outstanding  educators of California's Third Congressional District.   The communities I represent offer both outstanding public and private  school education to our students due in large part to the dedication,  sacrifice, and hard work of our community's teachers.   On behalf of our community, I thank you for all you do to position  our students to succeed in the workforce and participate in our  democracy as active and informed citizens.   As a former high school teacher myself, teaching 10th grade English,  I understand the unique challenges our educators face and the level of  passion and dedication it can take to help students succeed. In fact,  from those experiences, I am committed to supporting educators in every  way I can.   Most recently, I partnered with the Library of Congress to host a  special townhall for educators in order to bring the vast resources,  collections, and curriculum materials the Library offers to local  teachers in California.   If you are an educator, I encourage you to reach out to my office or  visit Kiley.house.gov for Federal resources available to local  teachers.   Mr. Speaker, again, on behalf of the Third Congressional District of  California, I thank educators for their commitment and dedication to  positively impacting our youth.           Celebrating the 100th Annual Portuguese Holy Ghost Festa     Mr. Speaker, I wish to celebrate the 100th Annual Lincoln  Portuguese Holy Ghost Festa. The Portuguese Holy Ghost Festa is a  celebration cherished by the community and looked forward to by all who  call Lincoln home.   For 100 years, with the exception of World War II and the COVID  years, the Associacao Portuguesa do Divino Espirito Santo--APDES for  short--has hosted the festa in accordance with the rich history and  tradition of Portugal. The multifaceted, weekend-long festa kicks off  on the 5th weekend after Easter with a candlelit procession from a  designated member's home. After a weekend of festivities and ceremony,  it concludes with a parade, sopas served to all at McBean Park, and a  dinner consisting of the traditional Portuguese dish, bacalhau.   Every year, the members and volunteers of the APDES work tirelessly  to make this festa happen. Without their love and dedication, Lincoln's  festa would not have been sustained throughout the past century.   I wish to express gratitude and thanks on behalf of the Third  Congressional District of California for the hard work and dedication  of the APDES in enriching our community with this cherished event.             Celebrating the 130th Anniversary of City of Rocklin     Mr. Speaker, I wish to mark and celebrate the 130th  anniversary of the city of Rocklin.   For generations of Californians, Rocklin has offered a strong quality  of life for residents and welcomed visitors from all walks of life.   As a Rocklin resident myself, I personally know what a special,  tight-knit community this truly is. From a friendly business  environment to world-class parks and recreation, stellar schools, and  exceptional local services such as utilities, transportation, and  public safety, Rocklin is a place over 70,000 residents are proud to  call home.   It is also no accident that Rocklin has become a place that so many  people want to move to. I thank the outstanding community members who  work tirelessly to ensure Rocklin continues to maintain a high quality  of life as well as the current and past leaders of Rocklin that have  shaped the city into what it is today.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize the city of Rocklin's 130th anniversary.           Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of the Auburn Symphony     Mr. Speaker, I wish to mark and celebrate the 35th  anniversary of the Auburn Symphony.   For decades, the Auburn Symphony has served as the premier community  [[Page H2161]]  orchestra of Placer County and has engaged and enriched Auburn and the  broader region with the gift of music for over 35 years.   The symphony originally began as the dream of local musician Monroe  DeJarnette, who, despite the immense challenges of forming a community  orchestra in a small town, partnered with Bruce Cosgrove of the Auburn  Chamber of Commerce to make that dream a reality.   From there, the orchestra continued to grow and benefit the  community. In fact, its programs have reached over 100,000 students in  Placer County over the years.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize the Auburn symphony for 35 years of benefiting our  community.          Recognizing the Orangevale-Fair Oaks Community Foundation     Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize the Orangevale-Fair Oaks  Community Foundation for their Big Day of Service.   Last Saturday, I personally witnessed the foundation bring together  hundreds upon hundreds of community members to work on 50 different  service projects in the Sacramento area.   As someone who was raised in Orangevale, it was especially heartening  to see individuals who exhibit the kindness, generosity, and  selflessness that unites our community to prioritize the needs of  others and coming together to serve their neighbors.   Even in just one weekend, their work made a profound and noticeable  impact by completing many necessary regional projects. It is the active  and engaged citizens, like the volunteers I spoke with, and the leaders  of the foundation, who make the Sacramento region such a great place to  call home.    On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize the Orangevale-Fair Oaks Community Foundation for their  hard work and dedication to our community that was exhibited throughout  the Big Day of Service.       Recognizing The Alliance: Defending the Cause of Kids & Families     Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize The Alliance: Defending  the Cause of Kids & Families for their contribution and dedication to  creating a supportive network of care for youth and families.   The Alliance is a group of churches, nonprofits, professionals, and  agencies working to ensure all kids grow up in a safe, loving family.   For years, The Alliance has served countless foster youth, adoptive  families, single parents, families in crisis, children who have  experienced trauma, and refugees resettling locally in the Sacramento  area.   In fact, for their efforts, The Alliance was recently recognized by  the Sacramento District Small Business Administration as the 2023  nonprofit of the year.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize The Alliance for their hard work and dedication to our  community.                In Recognition of Don Ashton on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize retiring El Dorado County  Chief Administrative Officer Don Ashton for his years of service to El  Dorado County.   Don has served the people of El Dorado for more than a decade, most  recently as CAO, and never wavered from his goal of making the county a  better place.   Throughout Don's tenure, El Dorado County endured department head  shakeups, COVID-19, and a series of catastrophic wildfires, most  notably, the Caldor fire and recent Mosquito fire.   No matter the challenge, Don provided steady leadership to help the  county weather every challenge it faced. Don also achieved many long- term county goals over the years, including financing and constructing  the new sheriff's headquarters, improving various parks, and acquiring  facilities on the West Slope and in South Lake Tahoe that will bolster  the county's ability to serve the public.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Don Ashton for the steady, stable leadership and years of  service he has provided to the people of El Dorado County.   Recognizing Sergeant Eric Dollar on His Retirement From Rocklin Police                                 Department     Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize Sergeant Eric Dollar of  the Rocklin Police Department.   Sergeant Dollar has served the people of California for almost 30  years as a law enforcement officer, with the last 23 in Rocklin.   Throughout his career, Sergeant Dollar took care to mentor younger  officers, served many special assignments, including crime scene  investigation and narcotics, and was continually recognized by the  department for his leadership. In fact, he was among the first five  individuals promoted to corporal in Rocklin's century-long history.  After decades of service and sacrifice, Sergeant Dollar has made the  decision to retire from the Rocklin Police Department.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Sergeant Eric Dollar for his dedication to the community  and the years of service he has provided to the people of Rocklin.            Recognizing William Jessup University Nursing Program     Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a moment to celebrate and  congratulate William Jessup University for the successful launch of  their Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program.   This past weekend, over 100 community members gathered at William  Jessup's campus in Rocklin to honor this achievement. Jessup's program  is especially noteworthy considering the nursing shortage in our  community.   This new program provides state-of-the-art education and training  facilities, including an innovative simulation lab with mannequins that  talk and breathe for live simulation with their students that will  equip the next generation of nurses with the tools they need to deliver  exceptional care to individuals in need.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize William Jessup University for the service provided to our  community through their new program.         Congratulating Tina Basich Haller, Local Snowboarding Legend     Mr. Speaker, I take this moment to celebrate and  congratulate local snowboarding legend, Tina Basich Haller, for her  official induction into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame.   Along with her longtime friend Shannon Dunn, Basich Haller is the  first female snowboarder to receive this honor and serves as an  inspiration and role model to countless young women in Nevada County  and beyond.   Throughout her snowboarding year, she won the 1998 X-Games by landing  the first 720 in competition and served as a snowboarding pioneer in  that sport's infancy.   Her commitment to her community, including giving back to the Nevada  Union Snowboarding team and cofounding Boarding For Breast Cancer, is  also truly inspirational.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Tina Basich Haller for her groundbreaking accomplishments  and commitment to Nevada County.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
