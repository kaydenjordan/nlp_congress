 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2477, which includes  some legislation to improve Medicare coverage for kidney transplant  recipients.   The Trump administration has made increasing rates of kidney  transplantation a priority. It is more cost-effective than dialysis and  results in a dramatic increase in the quality of life for ESRD  patients. However, these patients must continue taking medication for  the remainder of their life so that they don't reject their organs.   Currently, Medicare will only cover the cost of these drugs for 36  months after a kidney transplant. Patients who do not have health  insurance or lose their insurance coverage have to choose between  paying thousands of dollars a month out of pocket or risk the chance of  rejection of their organs.   If organ rejection does occur, these patients must once again endure  the painful, time-consuming, and expensive dialysis treatments paid for  by the Medicare program. By simply paying for the cost of these drugs  and preventing patients from crashing back into dialysis, the Federal  Government  [[Page H6999]]  can save hundreds of millions of dollars and improve thousands of  lives.   We should not allow such unnecessary waste and suffering to occur.  These Americans should not have to worry about how they will afford the  cost of the medications that allow them to live a completely normal  life.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Kind and Burgess for their  leadership and for working together on this commonsense bipartisan  bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass H.R. 2477.
