 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to lay out that this House  has passed an Israel supplemental bill, $14.3 billion. Today, I call on  the Senate to pass this aid to Israel forthwith.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize our veterans by  honoring exceptional American heroes and their selfless commitment to  serving our Nation and their communities. It is a moment to acknowledge  those who have sacrificed much and devoted all to safeguard our  country.   This year, Texas' Third District is saluting the brave veterans who  have exhibited remarkable service, leadership, integrity, and  dedication. These veterans represent true role models within our  community, deserving our utmost respect, acknowledgment, and honor.                                time  1015    The veterans from Texas' Third Congressional District receiving the  2023 Congressional Veteran Commendation Award are as follows:   Lieutenant Colonel James Angelino, U.S. Army;   Commander Paul Chabot, U.S. Navy;   Command Sergeant Major Shane Chapman, U.S. Army;   Sergeant Dave Cornette, U.S. Army;   Colonel William George, U.S. Army;   Colonel Larry Greene, U.S. Army;   Sergeant Michael Karson, U.S. Army;   Lieutenant Colonel Shawn Keefe, U.S. Marine Corps;   Staff Sergeant Casey McEuin, U.S. Army;   Sergeant James Owsley, U.S. Army;   Lance Corporal Ramil Paredes, U.S. Marine Corps;   Petty Officer 1st Class Anthony Rulli, U.S. Navy;   Sergeant First Class Ruben Tobar, U.S. Army.   I salute these 13 veterans. God bless them, and God bless America.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise today in support of Chairman McCaul's  bill to ensure no funding for Iranian terrorism. While I am stunned by  what I heard from my colleague across the aisle, I will try to bring  clarity to this.   In August, President Biden surrendered access to $6 billion to Iran-- make no mistake about it--for five hostages. Once again, he  demonstrated weakness to our adversaries. In doing so, he signaled to  Hamas that his administration is willing to reward hostage taking.   The policy of the United States for years was no negotiations with  terrorists or with hostage takers. We knew at that time that precedent  was powerful. Now, weak precedent is dangerous.   In October, Hamas official Ali Baraka said of the $6 billion deal:  ``The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. Only recently, it did one with  Iran. Why wouldn't it conduct a prisoner swap with us?''   Now, Hamas is holding the West hostage, the entire West hostage, as  they fortify their defenses while Israeli hostages are traded for  Palestinian prisoners, including terrorists.   There is only one language that is understood by our adversaries, and  that is strength.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a  message that we will not fund the radical jihadist agenda.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this bill already contains behavior-based  termination criteria for the sanctions described. Our sanctions on Iran  should not disappear on an arbitrary date. Our sanctions need to remain  in place until Iran stops threatening the United States, as already  described in the bill.   Iran has been a state sponsor of terrorism for over 40 years under, I  might add, the same terrorist administration in Iran. If we put a 5- year sunset on this bill, Iran and its terrorist proxies will think  they can just wait us out.   After October 7, it became clear that we need to take every possible  measure available to deter Iran and its proxies. The best way to  project American strength is to make it absolutely clear that our  sanctions will remain in place until Iran no longer poses a threat to  the United States.   Therefore, I oppose this amendment to add an arbitrary sunset, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, deterrence is based on strength and the  willingness to use it.   In my time in the Middle East, I understood that our adversaries  there, including Iran and its proxies, understand only strength. If we  put an arbitrary sunset clause in this bill, it will be demonstrating  weakness and not strength.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to vote  against it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Self) having assumed the chair, Mr. Clyde, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5961) to  freeze certain Iranian funds involved in the 2023 hostage deal between  the United States and Iran, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
