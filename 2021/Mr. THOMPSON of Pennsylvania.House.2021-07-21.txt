 Madam Speaker, throughout this  Congress, the House Agriculture Committee has had countless discussions  on ways that we can empower our farm families and build a robust rural  economy.   Earlier this month, we made good on our word. I am proud to be able  to work with all members of our committee and support the Broadband  Internet Connections for Rural America Act, which provides significant  investments into the deployment and development of broadband to rural  America.   This legislation reflects many of our shared priorities and shared  work. And in many ways, it is similar to the bipartisan legislation I  introduced earlier this year.   I thank all of the members of the Agriculture Committee for their  work and enthusiasm to meet the needs of rural Americans. I know this  issue is so personal for each of us and the constituents we represent.   The House Agriculture Committee is often considered the most  bipartisan committee in the House. This markup bill is proof that we  can still reach an agreement under extraordinary times, and I hope we  can keep this bipartisan spirit as infrastructure talks continue.                            ____________________
