 Mr. Speaker, last week, I congratulated  St. Marys Area High School student Michelle Bauer on winning first  place in the 34th annual Pennsylvania Municipal League high school  essay contest.   Participants were asked to reflect on the theme ``Civics and You'' by  writing about opportunities in their community that allow for civic  engagement and encourage citizens to volunteer to help with local  challenges.   Today, I would like to share a portion of Michelle's essay:   ``When I hear the word `civic,' I think of governmental duties. I  understand my duty as an American citizen to vote, obey laws, pay  taxes, and serve on juries. These activities all involve one person:  yourself. In reality, our civic engagement as Americans expands beyond  a single individual and encompasses entire communities. The definition  of a civic engagement is an activity that includes both paid and unpaid  forms of political activism, environmentalism, and service. As I look  at my community, it is apparent that we have a lot of civic  engagements.   ``As with most towns, mine has a city council that holds meetings and  elections for positions on the council. These elections are open to  every member of the city and are an excellent way for citizens to have  a say in the politics of the town. Just as the elections are open to  all citizens so are the weekly meetings. A unique feature about my  town's council meetings is that they are televised on a local channel.  For individuals who are unable to physically be present at the meeting  or have commitments that require attention, this televised version  provides a perfect solution to keep abreast of the issues affecting our  citizens.   ``Along with a local city council, it is also a civic duty of  individuals in my community to vote and participate in elections and  meetings at the school district level. Anyone is able to run for a  position on the school board as well as attend the meetings. For me,  our school board is a great way of civic involvement because the board  is interested in new opportunities that can be incorporated into the  education of our youth. Just recently, I attended a board meeting where  the topic of robots was discussed. As a member of a small competition  group, we were able to present our success and the benefit of  curriculum that includes new technology. One month later, it was  announced that a robotics class will be offered in the upcoming school  year. This will allow even more students to enhance their education and  perhaps encourage new career choices.   ``In my community, the civic engagements do not stop on the political  level. One of the most prominent forms of civic engagement I see in my  community that is not related to politics is the placing of wreaths on  the gravestones of fallen soldiers for Memorial Day. Citizens from all  over town come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk  through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes of our  country. This event is not for publicity or money but instead is for  respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is for the betterment of our  community by presenting a beautiful scene to those passing by.''   Michelle goes on to write:   ``Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the mountainous  rural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on the side of roads and  highways is so commonplace that most individuals do not even do a  double-take when they see it. The highway through my town is an area  where individuals think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their  vehicles or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and  wrappers. For the past 7 years, I have been a part of the National  Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and fall, the society walks  the sides of the roads picking up trash and making our town look  beautiful.''   Mr. Speaker, this is just a portion of Michelle's essay, and I  include in the Record the full essay.

Citizens from all over town       come together the weekend before Memorial Day and walk       through the entire cemetery adorning and honoring the heroes       of our country. This event is not for publicity or money but       instead is for respecting our veterans. Additionally, it is       for the betterment of our community by presenting a beautiful       scene to those passing by.        Onlookers can also be mesmerized by the beauty of the       mountainous rural area. Unfortunately, garbage and litter on       the side of roads and highways is so commonplace that most       individuals do not even do a double-take when they see it.       The highway through my town is an area where individuals       think it is acceptable to throw garbage out of their vehicles       or litter the sides of the road with cigarette butts and       wrappers. For the past seven years, I have been a part of the       National Honor Society highway cleanup. Every spring and       fall, the society walks the sides of the roads picking up       trash and making our town look beautiful.        Volunteering to pick up the litter is not the only way to       carry out civic responsibility. Everybody has either       witnessed or directly experienced an accident or fire that       required the assistance of a fire department. The fire       department is a critical part of a city keeping fires at bay       and lending a hand wherever needed. In my community, these       people work tirelessly day in and day out for the good of the       community. Much of their assistance is not what would be       depicted as heroic but rather, responding to flooding issues,       weather related emergencies, traffic control, helicopter       landing zones, and searching for missing hunters in addition       to the rescue and fire calls. They are all volunteers that       give up their precious time as a civic duty to their       community without expecting recognition. We, the rest of the       community, have a duty to help support these people. One of       the best ways to do this is to attend their pancake       breakfasts that are used as a fundraiser. I am not a huge fan       of pancakes and sausage so instead of helping the       firefighters out by purchasing a meal, I volunteer to serve       the meals to customers. It is the civic duty of individuals       in my city to attend this pancake breakfast and show support       to the members of this department who tirelessly serve and       assist us.        Reporting for standby at a yearly event in July is another       aspect of service that our firefighters join their community       for. There are loud BOOMS echoing across the city and       suddenly bright orbs of colorful lights bursting in the sky.       This grand spectacle entrances onlookers for half an hour       with its bright lights and fun designs. A Fourth of July       fireworks display like this costs money. Every year, our city       struggles to come up with the funds needed to purchase       fireworks. Businesses around the town make it their civic       duty to help by setting out donation cans in their       businesses. The local Dairy Queen even has a day where 30% of       the profits from every blizzard purchased go to the city       fireworks fund. As citizens in the community, it is our duty       to go to Dairy Queen on this day and purchase a blizzard as       well as make donations in the cans set up at local       businesses. Eating ice cream is certainly an enjoyable way to       carry out a civic duty. The July show has been an important       part of our community for many years thanks to the numerous       supporters.        We have many such events traced back in our records. Local       history is like the heart of the human body. It shapes us,       powers our being, and makes us unique. Without history,       individuals would not even be alive. A great example would be       the Forty-Second Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment (Bucktails)       who were part of the Civil War. These rugged woodsmen were       skilled marksmen and ideally suited to the challenges of       battle. Stories say that this group was so influential in       fighting the war at Gettysburg that the entire outcome could       have been different without them. The grit and determination       of our local ancestors remains in current day lineage within       our community. By knowing local history, members of the       community have a sense of pride and can even feel at ease       understanding that future generations will uphold the same       virtues. My town has a Historical Society that is free to       enter and accepts donations of local artifacts and history.       As a member of the community, it is my civic engagement to       donate any pieces of history I have so that others may       benefit from it as well. It is also the duty of our community       to visit the Historical Society and learn about our heritage       and how we can use the skills of our people to better our       society just like the Bucktails did in the Civil War.        Civic engagements are abundant in our community. From the       local fireman's pancake breakfast to the city council       meetings, civic activities are occurring all around us. It is       the obligation of the citizens to engage in these activities       to assist with local challenges and create a better community       for all of its members.     Mr. Speaker, I will close with her  final paragraph:   ``Civic engagements are abundant in our community. From the local  fireman's pancake breakfast to the city council meetings, civic  activities are occurring all around us. It is the obligation of the  citizens to engage in these activities to assist with local challenges  and create a better community for all of its members.''   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, that  was introduced by Congressman Westerman.   The House will consider this bill today, which will improve forest  management and cut the bureaucratic red tape that has been preventing  sound management practices for the Forest Service.   Mr. Speaker, devastating wildfires have resulted in the loss of  property, loss of pristine landscapes, and, most importantly, the loss  of life. 2017 has been the costliest wildfire season on record, with  the Forest Service spending over $2 billion. While not the only issue,  the greatest cause for this increase in wildfire is a severe lack of  forest management.   This bill provides Federal land management agencies the immediate  tools to expedite and increase the scale and efficiency of forest  management projects without sacrificing environmental protections.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything in our power to stop these  catastrophic wildfires and encourage better land management of our  forests.   Today's bill is one step in the right direction and I encourage my  colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 2936.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bergman). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 595 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2936.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1513                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 2936) to expedite under the National Environmental Policy Act of  1969 and improve forest management activities on National Forest System  lands, on public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land  Management, and on Tribal lands to return resilience to overgrown,  fire-prone forested lands, and for other purposes, with Mr. Young of  Iowa in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   General debate shall not exceed 1 hour equally divided among and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Agriculture and the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee  on Natural Resources.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), and the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) will each control 15 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the Resilient  Federal Forests Act of 2017.   As I stated last Congress, our national forests are facing an  epidemic of declining health, which is a direct result of policies  which have led to a dramatic decrease in managed acres creating  catastrophic wildfires that have increased in size and frequency.   The past two fire seasons have been some of the most expensive on  record, and this year appears to be no exception. Secretary of  Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently announced that wildland fire  suppression costs for this fiscal year have exceeded $2 billion, making  2017 the most expensive year on record.   While the suppression costs are staggering, these fires come at a  greater cost to local communities, private property, and pristine  landscapes. Most importantly, they also result in the loss of life.   For too long, our good folks at the Forest Service have been unable  to do the work needed to manage our forest fuel loads. Over the years,  the problem has compounded with more severe fires. Furthermore, these  fires have consumed more and more of the Forest Service budget that was  intended for management. This cycle has gone on for far too long.  [[Page H8327]]    In the 2014 farm bill, we took meaningful steps to empower the Forest  Service to carry out its mission. With passage of this bill, we will  provide the Forest Service another tool to carry out their duties.   This bill builds on the success of the farm bill to allow the Forest  Service and their partners to manage our forests using sound science  and environmental protections without fear of frivolous litigation.  Further, it promotes good stewardship through restoration projects that  protect our watersheds after catastrophic fire.   As fuel loads increase in our national forests, the cost of inaction  increases every day. This legislation allows the Forest Service to  account for the environmental consequences of inaction, hopefully  expediting treatments where needed.   Finally, this issue extends beyond just fire. While they have not yet  gone up in smoke, some of our national forests continue to deteriorate  as a result of insect and disease infestations, leaving what was  pristine and productive habitat so many in this Congress seek to  protect.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, October 25, 2017.      Hon. K.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, nationwide, this year has been the most  expensive year on record, with over $2 billion spent to combat fires  that have burned almost 9 million acres of land.   As of October 29, State and Federal firefighters responded to 8,300- plus fires, covering over 1.1 million acres in California alone, nearly  doubling the amount of acres burned in 2016.   A complete lack of forest management in California has left our  forests more combustible than ever, leading to one of the worst  wildfire seasons in our State's history. That is why the bill of my  colleague, Mr. Westerman, H.R. 2936, is very important.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act includes what I believe to be  critically important reforms in forest management, such as expedited  environmental reviews and the availability of categorical exclusions  for forest management activities to help achieve these goals.   Our Federal lands are hurting. They are in desperate need to be  managed in order to not have these disasters each and every year. We  can either thin the trees and the brush out, or watch them  [[Page H8333]]  go up in smoke every year and become part of our brown skies, instead  of the blue skies that we would normally enjoy.   We can't afford this inaction anymore. We need to move this  legislation and clean up California's forests for all.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking  member of the Agriculture Committee for his support, and also Mr.  Westerman from Arkansas, the author of this bill.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 is a bipartisan solution to  address the growing economic and environmental threats from  catastrophic wildfires.   As we have heard already, 2017 has had the costliest wildfires on  record, with the Forest Service spending over $2 billion. We have had  the loss of communities and lives lost. The greatest cause of this  uptick in wildfires is the severe lack of forest management.                                time  1545    This legislation pairs a responsible budget fix with forest  management reforms, improves the health and resiliency of our Nation's  forests and rangelands, and provides Federal Land Management agency  tools to increase the pay scale and cost efficiency of forest  management projects without sacrificing environmental protections.   The bill permanently solves the wildfire borrowing problem by  allowing FEMA to transfer limited funds to the Forest Service or BLM  when the rest of their wildfire suppression funding has been exhausted.   It prevents wildfires by authorizing the tools for the Forest  Service, tools that they are looking for in the Bureau of Land  Management that they can implement immediately to mitigate insect and  disease infestation, prevent damage to municipal watersheds and  critical infrastructure quickly, harvest wildfire, kill trees to pay  for the reforestation, and the bill encourages quick reforestation that  accelerates habitat improvement.   This bill does incentivize collaboration, supports local government,  and modernizes the Secure Rural Schools Act.   Mr. Chairman, I would just ask my colleagues for their support of  H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Clerk be authorized to make technical corrections in the  engrossment of H.R. 2936, to include corrections in spelling,  punctuation, section numbering and cross-referencing, and the insertion  of appropriate headings.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
