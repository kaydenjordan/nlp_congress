 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairwoman and the  ranking member for their support of our veterans and for our servicemen  and -women. I would also like to thank the cosponsors of this amendment  with me, Debbie Dingell of Michigan,  Don Young of Alaska, Ann Wagner  of Missouri, Darren Soto of Florida, and Peter Welch of Vermont, for  their bipartisan efforts in placing something as important as Fisher  House Foundation far above politics.   Fisher House provides 100 percent free lodging for military families,  allowing families to stay together while their loved ones are being  taken care of in a VA Hospital or military facility.   On any given night, up to 1,000 families are staying in one of the 76  Fisher Houses in districts all across this country, and their need is  only growing.   This effort that is the subject of this amendment will help Fisher  House build new homes and serve more of our military families.   Fisher House has served over 335,000 families thus far and provided  $407 million in estimated out-of-pocket savings on lodging and  transportation to our military families.   Looking ahead, they have eight houses already under construction and  have identified 20 more locations in need of their support in their  pipeline.   Fisher House is a highly rated nonprofit, having received an A-plus  rating from CharityWatch and awarded the Independent Charities Seal of  Excellence.   Most importantly, it is a beloved institution throughout our military  and veteran communities.   This amendment increases Federal support for Fisher House from $5  million to $10 million. It has strong bipartisan support and is a good  example of the things we can do if we work together.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this  program.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Wagner), my friend.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I want them to have one visual in their minds when they  think about it. Prior to the Fisher House--which, again, is a public- private partnership; the government money is leveraged with third-party  donations--prior to the Fisher House, family members of our veterans  who were receiving care often camped out in tents on the grounds of VA  hospitals or other military facilities. The Fisher House has solved  that problem, which is one of the reasons we should be supporting it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
