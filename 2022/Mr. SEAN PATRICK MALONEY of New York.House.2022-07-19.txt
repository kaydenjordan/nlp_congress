 Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans want to talk about anything but marriage  equality today. It is almost like they don't have any good arguments to  make on marriage equality.   Mr. Speaker, my husband, Randy, and I have been together for 30  years. We have raised three remarkable kids from diapers to college  diplomas. During all those years, during all that time together, we  have only been legally married since 2014. We had a 22-year engagement  before an 8-year marriage.   When I was elected as a Member of Congress in 2012, my husband,  Randy, couldn't have health insurance through this body. His spouse ID  said companion on it, and we had to fight to get him one of these  security pins we all wear.   But through hard work and a historic coalition, through great allies  and partnerships, love won. On the day the Supreme Court decided we had  equality rights for marriage in this country, a bunch of us stood in  front of the Court and sang the national anthem because it is a  beautiful thing when your country catches up to you.   Today, we are going to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act to  decide and to make clear whether or not we will go back.    Mr. Speaker, whether or not  every American, despite their race or their sexuality, has the freedom  to marry the person they love; it is a simple choice, and I know where  I stand. Every Member of Congress will get to stand and be counted  today, and you can choose between equality or discrimination.
