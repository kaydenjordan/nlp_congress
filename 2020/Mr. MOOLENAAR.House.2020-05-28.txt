 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the  first responders, emergency officials, and the people of mid-Michigan  for their swift action, heroic work, and incredible compassion in  responding to the flooding in our region last week.   In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, historic rain, and the failure  of two dams, they quickly and safely evacuated more than 11,000 people  without a single death or injury and provided shelter for those who  were displaced.   I have been on the ground meeting with residents who have been  affected, especially in Sanford, which took the hardest hit from this  heartbreaking event. Residents have lost businesses, homes, and  cherished family possessions.   In the face of these challenges, our community is coming together. We  are grateful for the overwhelming support that has come from across the  State and from nonprofits and businesses. My colleagues here in  Congress have also reached out to me, and I appreciate their kind words  and offers of assistance.   Madam Speaker, today, I say thank you to everyone in mid-Michigan and  across the country for their support during this challenging time.                            ____________________
