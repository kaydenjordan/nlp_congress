 Mr. Speaker, in 1918, a group of  Pennsylvania crude oil and natural gas producers got together to form a  trade organization. The Pennsylvania Oil, Gas and Minerals Association  was formed. It is believed to be the oldest continuously operating oil  and gas trade association in the United States.   In April 2010, members of the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association  and the Independent Oil and Gas Association of Pennsylvania, IOGA,  unanimously voted to merge the two organizations into a single,  comprehensive trade association representing oil and natural gas  interests throughout Pennsylvania.   The merger reunited two organizations that had split apart nearly  some 30 years earlier to form the Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas  Association, or PIOGA.   A century later, industry leaders, supporters, and friends will  gather to celebrate PIOGA. The centennial celebration will take place  next week at the birthplace of the American oil industry, Drake well in  Titusville, Pennsylvania, in the Fifth Congressional District, to mark  100 years of the industry's growth and sustainability in Pennsylvania.   PIOGA represents nearly 550 members, including oil and natural gas  producers, drilling contractors, service companies, manufacturers,  distributors, professional firms, consultants, pipelines, end-users,  royalty owners, and others with interests in the success of  Pennsylvania's oil and gas industry.   The Commonwealth is blessed with abundant energy resources,  particularly clean-burning natural gas. PIOGA works closely with  pipelines, utilities, and end-users as well as those developing  cutting-edge products and services that revolve around natural gas use.   PIOGA staff also works with educators to increase students' knowledge  of energy issues that impact current and future generations of  Pennsylvanians. Led by President and Executive Director Dan Weaver,  PIOGA is a member-driven organization that works to realize the  benefits of Pennsylvania's crude oil and natural gas.   PIOGA is based in Wexford, just north of Pittsburgh, with satellite  offices in McKean County and Harrisburg. The association employs an  eight-person staff, and each year, PIOGA hosts several conferences,  seminars, public educational meetings, presentations, and community  events at a variety of locations across the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I wish PIOGA the best as it gathers in Titusville to  celebrate 100 years of growth and sustainability in the Pennsylvania  oil and gas industry. The industry has a rich history in the  Commonwealth, and I know that, as PIOGA looks forward to the future, it  will continue to uphold the high standards and expertise for which it  is known in order to provide access to affordable energy for all and  help to continue to fuel our economy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  Zonta Club of Warren, Pennsylvania, as it celebrates 90 years of  empowering women through service and advocacy.   Zonta International marks 100 years on the world stage this year, and  the Zonta Club of Warren was one of the first clubs to be incorporated.  The international service organization was founded in Buffalo, New  York, with the mission of advancing the status of women.   The Warren Zonta Club has worked to improve the lives of women  locally, nationally, and worldwide. Warren Zonta has worked with  various community organizations throughout its 90-year history, and at  its core, the club has worked to make Warren County a better place to  live and work. The club spearheaded the local March of Dimes campaign  for many years and worked with the Girl Scouts, the Salvation Army, and  Warren General Hospital.   The word Zonta means honest and trustworthy and is derived from the  language of the Native American Sioux.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the Warren Zonta Club the best as it marks 90  years of service, and I thank them for all of their contributions to  Warren County.                            ____________________
