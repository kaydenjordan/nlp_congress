 Mr. Speaker, soon President Trump will  announce plans to reinstitute an almost 60-year U.S. embargo on Cuba.  This embargo was lifted by President Obama in 2014, and today, over 75  percent of Americans support continued normalized relationships with  Cuba.   The new, open relationship with Cuba has helped grow the U.S.  economy, and the President's plan to close Cuba will cost the U.S.  economy over $6.5 billion.   Roswell Park Cancer Institute in my home community of Buffalo, New  York, is today partnered with the Center for Immunotherapy in Cuba to  clinically test, in the United States, CIMAvax, a lung cancer vaccine  giving advanced lung cancer patients new hope.   The Roswell Park-led clinical trial, approved by the United States  Food and Drug Administration, was only possible because of normalized  relationships with Cuba. President Trump wants to destroy that  relationship, and this Congress needs to stand up to this President and  on behalf of the millions of Americans who benefit, including millions  of cancer patients, from open relationships between the United States  and Cuba.                            ____________________
