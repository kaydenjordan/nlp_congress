 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues in  the Senate to pass the Lower Energy Costs Act, otherwise known as H.R.  1.   The House passed H.R. 1 on March 30, but like so many other of our  bills that we have sent over to the Senate, it seems like they fall  into a black hole, never to be heard of or talked about again.   What does H.R. 1 do? Well, I am glad you asked. H.R. 1 reforms the  permitting process, the permitting process not only to build out  domestic production here in the U.S. but reforms the process allowing  us to drill for oil and gas here in America.   In short, it stops the radical, anti-American energy agenda that the  Biden administration has been pushing that is making us dependent on  foreign countries. It reverses that, and it makes us energy independent  again.   Here is a fact for you. The national price for gasoline has not been  under $3 a gallon since March of 2021. Now, you contrast that with the  Trump administration when the price of gas never even reached $3 a  gallon.   It is this war on American energy that all started when the Biden  administration revoked the permits for the Keystone pipeline and then  halted all permits on new oil and gas drilling in the U.S.   It is this government overreach, these excess regulations, that are  hurting the American families out there, let alone harming our national  security. That is why the Lower Energy Costs Act reverses all of that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues over in the Senate to get off the  pickleball court, get back in the Chamber, do your job, and pass H.R.  1, the Lower Energy Costs Act.                            ____________________
