 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5036, the Financial Technology Protection Act,  would strengthen our efforts to deter terrorist and illicit uses of  financial technology. Although financial technology has potential  benefits to the economy, there are pressing concerns about the digital  currencies facilitating terrorist financing and money laundering.   For example, in August 2015, a Virginia man was sentenced to prison  for providing material to support terrorists and admitted to using  Twitter to advise others on how to use bitcoin to mask terror  financing. Also, in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted  12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking into the Democratic  National Committee during the 2016 presidential election. The hackers  used cryptocurrency to purchase the servers and other equipment  necessary for the email breaches and used bitcoin to help fund their  activities.   This bill would establish a public-private sector task force, a grant  program, and a reward program to counter such terrorist or illicit uses  of digital currencies. Also, it would require the government to  identify how state and nonstate actors and foreign terrorist  organizations evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder money  using these currencies.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Budd and Congressman Lynch for  introducing this bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts  such time as he may consume.    Mr. Speaker, I support the bill; I urge my colleagues to  support it as well; and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6332, the Improving Strategies  to Counter Weapons Proliferation Act, which aims to better inform  congressional oversight of FinCEN's counter-proliferation finance  efforts.   With proliferation threats growing from countries like North Korea  and Iran, the reports prescribed by this bill will tell Congress more  about the terrorist financing and anti-money laundering work that  FinCEN is doing to combat the financing of the manufacture and delivery  of weapons of mass destruction.   This bill will require the director to report on the intelligence  FinCEN generates from the Bank Secrecy Act filings on suspected  proliferation finance transactions; the agency's efforts to maximize  the use of collected data; and the advisory notices issued to financial  institutions related to the financing of chemical, nuclear, and  biological weapons.   Prior to the Financial Services Committee vote, the ACLU expressed  some concern, in part because the bill's report doesn't include details  on the efficacy of FinCEN's data collection or its impact on privacy  and civil liberties.                                time  1815    That said, I understand that the ACLU does not actively oppose the  bill.   Given the legislation is focused on how FinCEN uses the data it  currently collects, it does not expand the data collection. I think  that that bill is appropriately scoped, and I support it.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``yes'' vote, and I urge my  colleagues to support it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4753, the Federal  Reserve Supervision Testimony Clarification Act. I thank Mr. Lucas for  this piece of legislation, which provides for the Chair of the Board or  their designee to offer testimony in place of the Vice Chairman for  Supervision, should the Vice Chair position be vacant.   It makes good sense to codify who at the Board will testify before  Congress on the status of the Fed's supervisory efforts, regardless of  whether there is a person confirmed for the Vice Chair for Supervision  or not.   Until Randal Quarles was confirmed, the position was vacant since its  creation in 2010, so this bill is a commonsense measure.   With that, I urge all my colleagues to support passage of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, when Congress passed S. 2155, it  included a section 309, a bill sponsored by Senators Tillis and Warren,  entitled the ``Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act of  2018.'' That provision put new requirements in place to protect veteran  borrowers from aggressive and deceptive marketing tactics of lenders  pushing mortgage refinance deals.   One of the new requirements included was a loan seasoning requirement  that mandated a certain period of time before a VA borrower could  refinance their loan. This new requirement was very similar to the loan  seasoning requirement that Ginnie Mae had already implemented  administratively prior to the passage of this law.   However, slight differences between the old and new requirements, and  the immediate ban on securitization of loans that did not meet the new  requirements, resulted in an estimated 2,500 loans that were boxed out  of Ginnie Mae securitization simply because they were in the process of  being refinanced or securitized when the law became effective.   The sponsors of the legislation, Senators Warren and Tillis, have  weighed in with Ginnie Mae, stating that it was not their intention to  orphan these loans, and they have urged Ginnie Mae to address the  issue. However, Ginnie Mae believes legislation is needed.   I believe H.R. 6737 is a reasonable attempt to address what was  clearly an unintended consequence of previous legislation, and I am  pleased to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``yes'' vote. I support the bill and urge my  colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury  to report to Congress every 6 months a list of the licenses it issues  to financial institutions to provide services to countries and persons  subject to certain U.S. sanctions. It also provides Congress with  information about foreign financial firms that similarly provide  support to those same countries and persons.   I very much support the goal of this bill because I believe it is a  disclosure requirement that will serve as a useful oversight tool for  Congress. For example, today, when the Office of Foreign Assets  Control, OFAC, issues a specific license to a company or other entity  that allows them to engage in activity that otherwise would be  prohibited by the U.S. sanctions, those licenses are not currently  disclosed by OFAC.   I also support the bill's other reporting requirement related to  foreign financial firms. These lists of foreign financial institutions  can provide a useful basis around which to discuss with the  administration its overall strategy with respect to its sanctions  programs; and these lists can also provide Members the opportunity to  press the administration to impose restrictions on these institutions  to change their behavior, if warranted.   The bill allows for the classification of these disclosures to  Congress, which is important because I think it will be  counterproductive to have this information revealed publicly. For  example, OFAC licenses often contain commercially sensitive  information, so if these licenses were publicly released, potential  market competitors could gain an unfair competitive advantage; and if  companies could no longer expect licenses to remain private, they would  be less likely to apply for them, which, generally, would not be a good  thing.   With respect to the lists of foreign financial institutions, it is  important to remember that these institutions are not bound by U.S.  sanctions or other designations, and they haven't necessarily violated  any particular laws or prohibitions.   While Congress should know about how these sanctions are being  implemented, including how effective they are at stopping the financing  of activities, I don't think the public identification of these foreign  firms would serve a useful policy purpose and could otherwise move  legal activity into a shade of gray.   The bill does allow for a classified annex with the reporting  requirements, and, as I said, I think this is a good bill  [[Page H9067]]  that will increase congressional oversight of U.S. sanction activities  appropriately.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), the sponsor of this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R. 3834, the 9/11  Heroes Medal of Valor Act of 2017. This bill reestablishes the original  9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor to be given to the families of those  heroes--the firefighters, police officers, and EMTs--who have since  died as a result of their exposure to toxic chemicals on that fateful  day.   Though we have honored those who passed away on September 11 with the  original 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor, the casualty list has continued to  rise since then as a result of the debris and chemicals that so many  were exposed to. I am proud to support this piece of legislation which  honors the men and women who have made such a tremendous sacrifice in  serving our country.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Crowley, for his tireless work on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Crowley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 754, the Anwar Sadat  Centennial Celebration Act.   This legislation gives the highest civilian award bestowed by  Congress to the third President of Egypt who served from 1970 until he  was assassinated in 1981. Under his leadership, he established lasting  peace between Israel and Egypt by expunging previous hostilities  towards Israel and being the first Arab leader to recognize Israel as a  nation-state.   Additionally, President Sadat and former Israeli Prime Minister  [[Page H9070]]  Menachem Begin negotiated the peace treaty that came to be known as the  Camp David Accords in a series of meetings arranged by then-President  Jimmy Carter at Camp David. President Sadat's leadership and commitment  to peace provided a resolution of conflict that has endured nearly 40  years after its inception.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of this bill  to honor President Sadat and his commitment to peace and the national  security of this country, as well as the stability of the Middle East.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
