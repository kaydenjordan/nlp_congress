 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1616, the  Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017.   Let me start out by thanking Chairman Goodlatte for his support and  allowing this bill to come to the floor and Senator Grassley, chairman  of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ranking Member Feinstein for  their support in introducing a companion measure over in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, the bicameral, bipartisan support on this issue  underscores its critical importance and the need for this issue to  transcend political parties and partisan politics.   Mr. Speaker, this is Police Week in the United States. It is our  chance to show appreciation for some of the most important unsung  heroes in our Nation. I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunity  to use my time before this legislative body today to thank each and  every member of this country's brave dedicated men and women of law  enforcement. From patrolling our streets to pursuing criminals of every  kind, it is these men and women in blue who keep our communities safe  and uphold the pillars of law and order in society each and every day.  Every American should be grateful for those who run towards danger and  who march into harm's way to keep us safe.   Nearly a decade ago I had the privilege of being appointed the United  States Attorney under former President George W. Bush. Serving as the  President's top Federal law enforcement official gave me the chance to  work shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of great police officers and  police departments across the 33,000 square miles of the Eastern  District of Texas. It also instilled in me an incredible sense of  gratitude for those in law enforcement who wake up each and every day  simply wanting to make the world around them a safer place to live for  all of us.   I could say it 1,000 times and it wouldn't do justice to the service  that they provide: Thank you. Thank you for all you do. We are all  grateful.   And while the simple truth is that we can never really repay those in  law enforcement for the incredible sacrifices they make each and every  day, as a lawmaker, I want to do everything within my power to give  them the tools to help them keep us safe.   Today this body has a unique opportunity to stand up for those who  selflessly and dependably stand up for all of us. H.R. 1616, the  Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017, does  exactly that by authorizing into law the National Computer Forensics  Institute, or NCFI.   As the chairman said, the NCFI is a critical national training center  located in Hoover, Alabama, that is operated by the United States  Secret Service for the purpose of training our State and local law  enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges on how to investigate  cyber and electronic crimes, on how to conduct computer and mobile  device forensics examinations, to respond to network intrusions, and to  preserve the chain of custody for digital evidence.    Mr. Speaker, in today's digital world, it is rarely that drop of  blood or strand of hair that solves a crime or a case. Instead, far  more frequently, it is proof of a text message that was sent or an  online purchase that was made or geolocation data on a mobile device.   Since its creation, the NCFI has trained and equipped more than 6,000  law enforcement officials from all 50 States on how to handle digital  evidence and solve and prosecute cybercrimes. By authorizing the NCFI  into Federal law, Congress can ensure that the NCFI remains our  Nation's premier cybercrime training center for State and local law  enforcement officials for many years to come.   This isn't some theoretical program at the NCFI. The proverbial  rubber is already hitting the road. In fact, three different law  enforcement agencies in my own district have had their folks trained at  the NCFI, folks like Don Waddle, a 25-year veteran of the Greenville  Police Department in my home district. In a hearing I chaired last year  about the impact of the training that Don received at NCFI, he talked  about the value that not just he got as a law enforcement officer, but  the community that he serves.   He told me: I am not the main benefactor of this training. The  citizens of  [[Page H4208]]  Greenville and Hunt County and the entire northeast Texas area reap the  benefits of this training with better recovery rates for stolen  property, as well as more perpetrators being taken off of our streets.                                time  1630    Don is like thousands of detectives and prosecutors and judges across  the country who because of their NCFI training are better able to serve  their communities and do their law enforcement jobs in an ever- increasing digital world.   Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill could not be more clear.  Cybercrime has surpassed drug trafficking as the most profitable  criminal enterprise in the world. Today, let's vote to help fight  cybercrime by passing this commonsense legislation to support our law  enforcement and give our officers a leg up on the criminals who are  increasingly using digital means in cyberspace to evade justice.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1616. I once again thank  Chairman Goodlatte and my Senate colleagues for their support.
