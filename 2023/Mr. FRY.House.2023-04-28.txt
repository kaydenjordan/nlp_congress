 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Boulineau's IGA, a family-owned, legendary establishment in the Cherry  Grove section of North Myrtle Beach, on its 75th anniversary.   This iconic brand started with the Boulineau family in 1948. Today,  the Boulineau family has eight different businesses--everything from  gas stations to ice cream shops, to a seafood restaurant--that occupy  over four square blocks, with more than 175,000 square feet of retail  shopping. It seems like every corner has a splash of that iconic  Boulineau red.   Local businesses are the heart and soul of my district in South  Carolina and, indeed, the Nation, and I am grateful for the hard work  of families like the Boulineaus, who are dedicated to serving their  communities.   It is amazing to see the growth of a hometown business over the  course of the last 75 years, and I wish them nothing but success for  the next 75 years.                            ____________________
