 Mr. President, today, I honor the life and legacy  of Cuban-American, Arturo Cobo, who died on Sunday, October 27, 2019,  at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West, FL.   Arturo, a beloved south Florida resident, founded the Transit Home in  Key West, a sanctuary for Cuban refugees fleeing the country's  tyrannical regime by boat and raft. Arturo fled Cuba in 1960 to escape  Fidel Castro's communist revolution but returned to Cuba in 1961 to  fight in Brigade 2506 during the Bay of Pigs. After being imprisoned,  Arturo returned to the United States in 1962 and dedicated the rest of  his life to supporting Cuban refugees and fighting for a democratic  Cuba. The Transit Home not only provided a safe haven for Cuban  refugees, but also provided hope for a new life for them in a free  society. All who came to the Transit Home received food, clothing, and  assistance to help rebuild their lives in America.   I pay tribute to Arturo's life with immense gratitude for his  invaluable work during such difficult circumstances and for his  dedication to the South Florida community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to honor  small businesses that embody the entrepreneurial spirit of our American  economy. I am proud to recognize Global Freight & Commerce of  Jacksonville, FL--a veteran-owned small business--as we celebrate this  National Veterans Small Business Week.   Following his retirement from the U.S. Army in 2014, founder Jesus  Garay started Global Freight & Commerce using the precision and skill  gained from more than 20 years of military experience. During his years  of Active Duty, Jesus specialized in strategic operations and completed  six combat tours in Iraq and Bosnia. The Armed Forces of the United  States provides individuals, such as Jesus, with leadership skills that  are practically applicable to entrepreneurial pursuits. Because of  Jesus's leadership experience, Global Freight & Commerce has become a  successful, 100 percent owner-operated trucking, logistics, and  transportation company. This business not only provides quality service  but also makes a dedicated effort to extend dignified employment  opportunities to our nation's veterans.   Through its website, Global Freight & Commerce assists semi-truck  owner-operators with the buying and selling process of their vehicles,  a feature that enables owner-operators to gain independence and grow a  potential fleet of vehicles. Additionally, Global Freight & Commerce  makes the safety of its drivers and those around them a priority. It  follows national safety protocols in all operations to provide the  best, and safest, service possible for its customers.   A member of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, Global Freight &  Commerce is also involved in the community through events such as job  fairs and conferences. These community events provide leadership  training to assist and develop the local workforce. Such efforts are  valuable to the Jacksonville economy as they help to provide skilled  and reliable employees.   Even after leaving the service, our Nation's veterans continue to  serve our country. Making up nearly 10 percent of all businesses in the  United States, veteran-owned small businesses ensure that our unique  economy remains robust. Veteran-owned businesses like Global Freight &  Commerce are examples of the talent and dedication of our Nation's  veterans. This National Veterans Small Business Week, I would like to  thank Jesus Garay for his service and congratulate him on the creation  of a successful small business. I look forward to watching Global  Freight & Commerce's continued growth and success.                            ____________________
