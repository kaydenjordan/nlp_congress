 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of New York  City Police Department Detective Miosotis Familia. Unfortunately,  Miosotis was the first Dominican-American female officer killed in the  line of duty in New York City.   During National Police Week and Peace Officers Memorial Day, I want  to celebrate and commemorate Detective Familia. She, along with her law  enforcement peers in New York and across the country, was memorialized  at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.   Detective Familia, as a Dominican-American coming from a family of  immigrants to the United States, and her commitment to public service  speaks volumes of the benefits and sacrifice that she and fellow  immigrants and people of color continue to make in the United States,  despite the overwhelming anti-immigrant rhetoric that exists in today's  political climate.   Immigrant communities continue to play a vital role in every aspect  of American life. As the first Dominican-American elected to Congress,  I understand that service to country and community is not limited by  one race or ethnicity, as did Defective Familia.   I have represented the Familia family for over 22 years, both in the  State legislature and now in Congress. This is a somber moment, but one  that demands our recognition of the tremendous service that Detective  Familia gave to her community.                            ____________________
