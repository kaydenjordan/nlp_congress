 Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman  Grijalva, Congresswoman DeGette, and the committee staff for working  with me on this amendment and for the continued leadership on this  bill.   The amendment incorporates environmental justice communities like  mine into this space. It would require a report on permits by providers  serving environmental justice communities.   This measure, first introduced last Congress by the soon-to-be first  Native American Cabinet Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior,  Congresswoman Haaland, is an important step in identifying and removing  barriers to access our public lands. Communities of color, low-income  communities, indigenous communities, and those most impacted by  pollution and climate change often have the least access to our  national parks and Federal lands.   My 13th District Strong is an environmental justice community, an  area that the State calls the epicenter of the asthma burden due to  corporate polluters. Folks in my district deserve the same opportunity  to enjoy clean air and public lands as anyone else so they don't grow  up like me, thinking that sulfur dioxide and rotten eggs was just how  the air smelled.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support this amendment.
