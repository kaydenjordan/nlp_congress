 Madam Speaker, I have strongly supported the  Paycheck Fairness Act and have done so for over two decades.   When the legislation finally got a vote in the House in 2008, I voted  ``yes'' I voted ``yes'' again in 2009 and 2019. I have cosponsored the  Paycheck Fairness Act since 2015.   In January, I again enthusiastically cosponsored H.R. 7--the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   In late March, however, H.R. 7 was radically altered during markup in  the Education and Labor Committee with a new definition of ``sex'' that  according to serious legal analysis will compel employers to subsidize  abortion on demand.   Because I respect the inherent dignity and value of unborn baby girls  and boys who will be put at grave risk of death by dismemberment  abortion and chemical poisoning if H.R 7 is enacted in its current  form, I will vote ``no'' today.   In a letter dated April 14, the United States Conference of Catholic  Bishops said: ``H.R. 7 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  The FLSA, among other things, prohibits unequal wages between men and  women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 206(d)(l). Wages include  all forms of remuneration, including ``frinqe benefits'' such as  ``medical, hospital, [and] accident . . . insurance,'' ``life  insurance,'' ``retirement benefits,'' and ``leave.'' 29 C.F.R. 1620.10,  1620.11.   ``Strengthening federal law to ensure equal compensation for equal  work as between men and women is a laudable legislative goal, and we  heartily endorse that goal . . . Unfortunately, H.R. 7 has moved in a  different direction . . . We believe that if the bill were to pass, the  Fair Labor Standards Act could be construed to require employers,  including even religious organizations, to cover and pay for abortions  . . . we urge members to oppose the redefinition of sex in H.R. 7 and  instead revert to the version of the bill that passed the House in the  116th Congress.''   The National Right to Life Committee opposed the redefinition of  ``sex'' and opposes the bill. They said in a letter: ``H.R. 7 makes  definitional changes to sex to include pregnancy, childbirth, or a  related medical condition. It is well established that abortion will be  regarded as a ``related medical condition.'' See 29C.F.R.pt.1604  App.(1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, lnc., 527F.3d 358  (3dCir.2008).   ``Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination based on  sex, rules of construction have been added to prevent requiring funding  of abortion. Since there is no rule of construction that would make  this legislation abortion-neutral, it is likely that H.R. 7 could be  used to sue employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage.''   In like manner, the Susan B. Anthony List opposes the bill noting  that H.R. 7 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by adding  ``pregnancy childbirth, or a related medical condition'' to the  definition of ``sex,'' which courts have interpreted broadly to include  abortion.''   Other pro-life organizations urged a ``no'' vote including March for  Life Action.   Madam Speaker, underscoring my commitment to the legislation without  the redefinition of the term ``sex'', yesterday I introduced H.R 2490-- the Paycheck Fairness Act with the identical H.R. 7 language from  January.   H.R. 2490 is needed to ensure that the noble goals embedded in the  landmark law, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, are achieved.   Among its provisions H.R. 2490:   Prohibits employers from seeking the salary history of prospective  employees. By banning reliance on salary history in determining future  pay, the bill ensures that prior pay discrimination doesn't follow  workers from job to job.   Bans retaliation against workers who discuss their wages.   Improves research on the gender pay gap. The bill instructs DOL to  conduct studies and review available research and data to provide  information on how to identify, correct, and eliminate illegal wage  disparities.   Requires the collection of wage data from federal contractors and  directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to  [[Page H1818]]  conduct a survey of available wage information and create a system of  wage data in order to help the Department of Labor uncover wage  discrimination.   Provides a small business exception. The Equal Pay Act and the Fair  Labor Standards Act have an exemption for small businesses that  generate less than $500,000 in annual revenues a year, and the Paycheck  Fairness Act would keep that exemption intact.   Supports small businesses with technical assistance.   Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal  pay practices, recognize excellence in pay practices by businesses, and  empower workers by creating a negotiation skills training program.   I include in the Record the following letters of opposition.                                            United States Conference                                             of Catholic Bishops,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2021.        Dear Representative: We write to raise pro-life and other       concerns about the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7.        H.R. 7 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act. The FLSA,       among other things, prohibits unequal wages between men and       women performing equal work. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 206(d)(l). Wages       include all forms of remuneration, including ``fringe       benefits'' such as ``medical, hospital, [and] accident . . .       insurance,'' ``life insurance,'' ``retirement benefits,'' and       ``leave.'' 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1620.10, 1620.11.        Strengthening federal law to ensure equal compensation for       equal work as between men and women is a laudable legislative       goal, and we heartily endorse that goal. See Economic Justice       for All, no. 167 (1986), (``Particular attention is needed to       achieve pay equity between men and women''); Compendium of       the Social Doctrine of the Church, no. 295 (2004) (``An       urgent need to recognize effectively the rights of women in       the workplace is seen especially under the aspects of pay,       insurance and social security.''); Pope Francis, Audience       with Delegates from the Confederation of Trade Unions in       Italy (June 28, 2017) (``And what I am about to say may seem       obvious, but in the world of work women are still in second       class. You might say, `No, but there is that businesswoman,       that other one . . .'; yes, but if women earn less, are more       easily exploited . . . do something.''). Indeed, Congress       could do more in this area.        Unfortunately, H.R. 7 has moved in a different direction.       On March 24, the House Committee on Education and Labor       marked up the bill to redefine the term .. ``sex'' to include       such items as ``sex stereotypes,'' ``pregnancy, child birth,       or a related medical condition,'' ``sexual orientation.''       ``gender identity,'' and ``sex characteristics. including       intersex traits.''        H.R. 7's redefinition of sex in the FLSA is seriously       problematic. We believe that if the bill were to pass, the       FLSA could be construed to require employers, including even       religious organizations, to (a) cover and pay for abortions,       contraceptives, and gender transition procedures in their       health plans (b) treat same-sex civil marriages as equivalent       to traditional marriages in the provision of spousal       benefits, and (c) facilitate abortions and gender transition       procedures by providing paid leave for that purpose as part       of existing paid leave programs. In this way, the bill would       require many religious organizations to be involved in and to       approve things they sincerely believe are wrong.        Some may argue that Title VII already imposes all or some       of these requirements. That argument--in addition to       rendering the redefinition of ``sex'' in this bill seemingly       redundant in whole or in part--overlooks the fact that Title       VII has religious exemptions and abortion-neutral language       that are not found in the FLSA. The Supreme Court has put off       to another day the resolution of the question of exactly how       the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII intersect with       the religious convictions of employers. Bostock v. Clayton       County. 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1753-54 (2020). H.R. 7 would raise a       similar question but in a different statutory setting, one in       which the critical religious exemptions and abortion-neutral       language of Title VII are entirely missing.        For these reasons, we urge members to oppose the       redefinition of sex in H.R. 7 and instead revert to the       version of the bill that passed the House in the 116th       Congress.            Sincerely.      His Eminence Timothy Cardinal Dolan,        Archbishop of New York, Chairman, Committee for Religious       Liberty.      Most Reverend Paul S.

Re In Opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7).         Dear Representative: This week, the House will consider the       Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7). While the legislation is       meant to address potential discrimination regarding the       gender pay gap, the legislation was amended to contain       language that could be construed to require employers to       cover elective abortion in their healthcare benefits.        Because of this change, National Right to Life urges you to       oppose the bill and reserves the right to include a House       roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro-life       votes of the 117th Congress.        H.R. 7 states that it constitutes discrimination to provide       disparate wages based on sex, and the legislation creates       more opportunities to seek remedies for those challenging       compensation. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission       (EEOC) has defined equal pay under the Fair Labor Standards       Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to include all forms of       compensation, including healthcare benefits.        H.R. 7 makes definitional changes to ``sex'' to include       ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.'' It       is well established that abortion will be regarded as a       ``related medical condition.'' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604 App.       (1986) and Doe v. CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358       (3d Cir. 2008).        Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination       based on sex, rules of construction have been added to       prevent requiring funding of abortion. Since there is no rule       of construction that would make this legislation abortion-      neutral, it is likely that H.R. 7 could be used to sue       employers for a lack of elective abortion coverage.        Under H.R. 7, a person could make a claim that an       employer's failure to provide health coverage for abortion is       discriminatory if an employer provides health coverage for       male-specific items.        For the reasons above, National Right to Life opposes the       current version of H.R. 7 and reserves the right to include a       House roll call on this measure in our scorecard of key pro-      life votes of the 117th Congress.        Should you have any questions, please contact us.        Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's position on this       matter.        Respectfully submitted,      Carol Tobias,        President.      David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,        Executive Director.      Jennifer Popik, J.D.,        Legislative Director.                                   ____                                            Susan B. Anthony List,                                                     April 13, 2021.        Dear Representative: I write to advise you that Susan B.       Anthony List, on behalf of our more than 900,000 members,       opposes H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which was amended       at the last minute to add a definition of sex that could       force employers to cover elective abortion through employee       benefits under the guise of fairness.        H.R. 7 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by       adding ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical       condition'' to the definition of ``sex,'' which courts have       interpreted broadly to include abortion.        The abortion implications are buried in layers of court       interpretations and regulations of the Equal Employment       Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Fair Labor Standards Act       (FSLA) prohibits sex discrimination in the area of employee       wages. And while the FSLA does not explicitly include       benefits like health coverage in its definition of wages, the       EEOC has interpreted wages to include benefits. The EEOC       states that the Equal Pay Act, part of the FSLA, ``requires       that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay       for equal work.'' The Department of Labor and the EEOC       further stipulate that equal pay includes benefits, and the       EEOC allows a person to go straight to court with claims this       provision has been violated. There is nothing preventing a       person from claiming sex discrimination if an employer       provides health coverage for all of men's health services but       does not pay for coverage for abortion services for women.        When the terms ``pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical       condition'' were used in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act       four decades ago, the terms were accompanied by language       stating that employers could not be forced to cover abortion       in health insurance benefits except to save the life of the       mother. While H.R. 7 does not override that limited       safeguard, it does fail to extend equivalent safeguards to       address its much broader, more sweeping reach. Without       abortion neutral language in H.R. 7, this legislation opens       the door for employers to be sued for sex discrimination by       simply refraining from funding abortion on demand in employee       health plans.        Susan B. Anthony List opposes and will score against H.R.       7.            Sincerely,                                             Marjorie Dannenfelser,                                                         President.  [[Page H1819]]                                          ____                                         March for Life Action,                                     Washington, DC, April 14, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of March for Life Action and       the millions of pro-life Americans who march to end abortion,       I am writing to voice our opposition to H.R. 7, the Paycheck       Fairness Act. While March for Life Action has no position on       the original bill, inexplicably the bill language was changed       this Congress to include troubling language that seems to       have the singular purpose of promoting abortion.        The definition included in Section 2 includes ``pregnancy       or related medical condition,'' which amends the Equal Pay       Act portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This law states       that it constitutes discrimination to provide different wages       to individuals based on sex. The EEOC defines equal pay under       the FLSA/Equal Pay Act to mean all forms of compensation,       including benefits.        By stating that ``sex'' includes ``pregnancy or related       medical condition,'' the bill establishes the expectation       that women will be given ``equal benefits'' related to       pregnancy and abortion. The legislation gives power to the       Federal government to use its full force to attack health       care providers, including businesses, which do not include       full abortion coverage in their plans, and be subject to the       enhanced penalties laid out in the bill.        Clearly this legislation is not about fairness, however it       is pushing a radical abortion scheme that is opposed by most       Americans. For these reasons, March for Life Action will       score against H.R. 7 in our annual scorecard for the 117th       Congress.            Sincerely,                                                   Thomas McClusky,      President, March for Life Action.                                   ____
