 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  our brave and selfless law enforcement officers who have fallen in the  line of duty in south Texas this past year: Jorge Cabrera, Ismael  Chavez, Edelmiro Garza, Jr. Let us not forget those who stood guard at  our border and kept us safe: Carlos Mendoza, Juan Ollervidez,  Christopher Carney, Roel De La Fuente, and Enrique Rositas.   Madam Speaker, I would like to take a brief moment of silence to pay  my respects to those law enforcement officers who paid the ultimate  sacrifice to keep our community safe.   My community and I owe a deep amount of gratitude to these officers  who sought to keep us safe. I thank them, and may God bless and watch  over our law enforcement officers, their families, and the United  States of America.
