 Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote to repeal  ObamaCare. This is for at least two reasons. One is that ObamaCare has  been an abysmal failure when you look at the promises that were made to  sell it and actually what has been delivered in terms of higher  premiums, higher deductibles, and more challenges for ordinary  Americans. Many Americans now find that their deductible is so high  that they are effectively self-insured.   I remember like it was yesterday--actually, it was some 6 years ago-- that President Obama said: If you like what you have, you can keep it,  in terms of your health coverage. He said: If you like your doctor, you  can keep your doctor. He said: The average family of four would see  their premiums go down by $2,500.   None of that has proven to be true. ObamaCare was sold under false  claims, false promises. We know that many headlines today demonstrate  that premiums are higher than people can afford. They can't keep the  insurance plan they had and they liked, and they have to go find  another doctor, sometimes as often as each year because the insurance  coverage they have is no longer being written because insurance  companies simply can't survive in this marketplace. In many instances,  they end up having to leave rural parts of the country, particularly  rural parts of places like rural Texas.   A lot of this has to do with redtape. A lot of this has to do with  the companies that have been forced to pass along higher costs to  consumers or leave, and that is exactly the sort of thing that happens  when the government intervenes in the marketplace, unintended  consequences occur.   I mentioned increased rural access to health care. That was actually  supposed to be one of the selling points of ObamaCare, and now it is  just another example of how this law has truly failed. Even so, even  having acknowledged some of the failures of ObamaCare themselves, our  Senate Democratic colleagues are refusing to acknowledge the  catastrophe they created because this law was passed on a purely  partisan basis, without any votes on the other side of the aisle, and  signed by President Obama into law without any participation by  Republicans. Now, having created this mess--creating this crisis  really--they made clear they want no part of fixing the problem.  Apparently, they would rather ignore the harmful effects brought about  by ObamaCare and try to then assign blame to those who are trying to  rescue the American people from the failure known as ObamaCare.   We are confident the American people know the truth. They know  President Obama made promise after promise to get ObamaCare passed.  They know the reality is a lot different, and it is a lot dimmer than  the picture he painted. In my mind, such widespread public deception  amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a simple case or,  actually, I should say a colossal case of consumer fraud.   In my former job as attorney general of the State of Texas, we had a  consumer protection bureau that went after scam artists and others who  deceived the American consumer, Texas consumer, and promised them one  thing and delivered another. That is nothing more or nothing less than  what happened here where President Obama promised the American people  the Moon when it came to health care, and they found out that those  promises were hollow indeed.   That is why the American people want ObamaCare to become a thing of  the past. One recent poll showed that about 8 out of every 10 Americans  wanted to change the law in significant ways or see it replaced  altogether. The truth is, ObamaCare is a terrible law that continues to  hurt many American families trying to get by.   Americans all around the country are asking for help, asking for  relief from this terrible law, and demanding a better health care  system that actually delivers results, not just empty promises. We  can't get to that replacement until we actually repeal ObamaCare, which  will start with the budget resolution we will pass this evening or late  tonight.   This is not a rushed or hurried response; it is merely the first step  in a deliberative process that Republicans in both Chambers of Congress  have been working on for years. The only difference is now we will soon  have a President in office who understands that people are hurting,  asking for change, and are in need of promises that are actually  delivered.   It is not too late for our Democratic colleagues to work with us to  get this job done and move forward with a solid plan that helps all  Americans. I understand the temptation, after creating this  legislation, this health care debacle known as ObamaCare, to now say it  is your baby, you deal with it and then try to assign blame if things  don't work out exactly the way we hope. The fact is, we always do  better here, and the American people are always better served when we  try to work together in a bipartisan way, on a step-by-step basis, to  deliver on the promises we made.   This budget resolution that we will be voting on tonight is not about  Medicare. It is not about cutting health care for millions of people.  Rather, the opposite is true. We are actually going to try to save the  American consumer from falling through the cracks or finding out that  the promises that have been made to them are simply not true or that  they are burdened with health care policies that they simply can't  afford.   What we are about is getting rid of a failed policy that now 6 years  in is still making life harder for millions of Americans. I am eager to  make sure we keep our promise. That is the second part of this. We  promised the American people that if they gave us an opportunity by  electing a new President, by retaining the majorities in the House and  the Senate, as they have, that we would deliver by repealing and  replacing ObamaCare. That starts with tonight's vote.                         Nomination of Rex Tillerson    Mr. President, this morning I had the honor of introducing Mr. Rex  Tillerson, President-Elect Trump's nominee to be Secretary of State, at  his confirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee. I was  joined by my colleague Senator Cruz from Texas, former Senator Sam  Nunn, and former Secretary of Defense Mr. Gates. All of us said that  Mr. Tillerson is an inspired and outstanding appointment by President- Elect Trump.   I have come to learn that Mr. Tillerson is a person whom I both  respect and admire the longer I have gotten to know him. He has proven  over his decades-long career in the top echelons of a large global  company that he has what it takes to represent the United States on the  world stage. True, to this point, his responsibility has been toward  shareholders of the company he has represented, but I have every  confidence he can transfer that same sort of diligence, that same sort  of acumen, and those relationships, from which a large multinational  corporation has benefited, now to the American people, and the United  [[Page S235]]  States of America can resume its place on the world stage with him as  our top diplomat.   I said before that one of my biggest frustrations with the current  administration is it regularly ignores our allies while intentionally  propping up or strengthening our adversaries. I have every confidence  that Mr. Tillerson will flip that narrative, and he will help the  United States regain our leadership role in the world by  unapologetically supporting our allies and friends while keeping our  enemies in check. He is the right man to lead the State Department, and  I hope we confirm him soon.                         Nomination of Jeff Sessions    Mr. President, let me add, today we are engaged in the second day of  hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the nomination  of Senator Jeff Sessions, our colleague of longstanding, to be U.S.  Attorney General.   Some people who haven't had the benefit of working with Senator  Sessions know him by his record. Frankly, given some of the testimony,  I don't recognize the person who is being described by those who, for  various reasons, are opposing his nomination. We know that he has an  outstanding record of service, both to the people of Alabama, to the  United States as U.S. attorney, and then in the U.S. Senate for the  last 20 years.   It is ironic that we are having a hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee on the qualifications of Senator Sessions to serve as  Attorney General, a committee on which he has served for 20 years. Our  colleagues across the aisle don't need to have a hearing to know Jeff  Sessions because they already know him well. They know him to be a man  of honor, a man of principle, a man who is true to his word, and who  believes, above all, that the role of the Attorney General is to  enforce the law of the land--something we have not seen in the last 8  years during the Obama administration, where the Justice Department has  become a political arm of the White House.   I have every confidence that Senator Sessions, as the next Attorney  General of the United States, will restore the reputation of the  Department of Justice and the Office of Attorney General to one that  respects the rule of law and dispenses equal justice under the law.
