 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Eastern  Hancock High School football team for being one of four Indiana high  schools to win the Colts Leadership Challenge.   The Colts Leadership Challenge is a competition that encourages high  school football teams to host blood drives and encourages donations  throughout the summer.   Hundreds of donations are needed each day to meet the needs of the  Versiti Blood Center of Indiana. We are so proud of the Royals for  helping to deliver these critical, lifesaving measures.   I want to thank the Eastern Hancock High School football team for  their outstanding service to the community and to the State of Indiana.  Well done.       Recognizing Bec Wicker's Women In Agriculture Achievement Award     Madam Speaker, I want to recognize Rush County resident  Bec Wicker, who was recently awarded the Women in Agriculture  Achievement Award. The annual award recognizes Indiana women who have  contributed significantly to the success of Indiana agriculture.   Bec joined Wicker Farms in 1976 and has since built a dairy milking  operation, a calf and cow operation, and produces corn, soybeans,  wheat, alfalfa, and hay.   I thank Mrs. Bec Wicker for her outstanding contributions and support  for the agriculture community.     Farmers In Indiana's Sixth District Receive Hoosier Homestead Award     Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the outstanding  achievement of 27 family farms in Indiana's Sixth Congressional  District.   The Hoosier Homestead Award is given out by the Indiana State  Department of Agriculture to family farms that have been farming for  over 100 years, 150 years, and 200 years. I am proud that, in my  district alone, 15 family farms earned the Hoosier Homestead centennial  award, 8 earned the sesquicentennial award, and 4 earned the  bicentennial award.   Future generations of Hoosier farmers can look up to these family  farms and know that hard work and dedication pays off.   Congratulations to all of these families for earning the recognition  as a Hoosier homestead.                      Indiana's Beirut Memorial Monument     Madam Speaker, this weekend, I joined my fellow veterans  and Gold Star families in dedicating the Beirut Memorial monument to  Hoosiers killed in the terrorist attack in Beirut, Lebanon, on October  23, 1983.   As a Beirut veteran myself, I understand that our first duty is to  remember. I am proud that Indiana now has our own memorial to  commemorate the Indiana servicemen who sacrificed their lives in the  name of peace, and we will never forget:   James Baynard, USMC   Danny Estes, USMC   Michael Gorchinski, USN   Maurice Hukill, USMC   George McVicker, USN; and   Thomas Thorstad, USMC.   Madam Speaker, I will always be faithful.   Semper fi.  [[Page H7997]]                                ____________________
