 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cordell Walker for  his work caring for veterans in the Memphis area.   I first met Cordell probably more than 20 years ago through current  Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland. Mr. Walker is retiring as executive  director of Alpha Omega Veterans Services later this month after  several decades of service to our community and to our veterans.   Cordell Walker said that after seeing his friends return home from  Vietnam a shell of who they were, he decided that he wanted to dedicate  his life to serving our Nation's veterans, and he has done exactly  that.   This past Veterans Day, just a month or so ago, Cordell Walker was  honored in a ceremony to open the new Cordell Walker Veterans Center in  Memphis.   I believe--I think we probably all believe--that answering the call  to service in the United States military is about the most admirable  thing that a person can do.   Cordell Walker recognized that our veterans sacrificed so much for  all of our freedom and that they deserve the best care after they  retire from our military.    I thank Cordell Walker for his service caring for veterans in the  Memphis area and throughout west Tennessee.   I am really proud to know Cordell, and I congratulate Cordell Walker  on a job well done. Roberta and I wish him the best in his future  endeavors.                            Honoring Justin Hunter     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a good  friend, Justin Hunter, who left us way too soon on September 16 of this  year, 2023.   Originally from the bootheel of Missouri, just north of my district  in west Tennessee, Justin Hunter had a big impact in west Tennessee. He  served our community many years ago by working for former Congressman  Ed Bryant.   It was in west Tennessee that Justin met his wife, Caroline.  Together, they attended law school at the University of Memphis.   Later, while working for Encompass Health, Justin put his experience  to work to help improve access to rehabilitation hospital care.   Justin Hunter was a really strong and passionate advocate for  rehabilitation hospitals. Justin used his understanding of the laws  governing Medicare programs to help improve the quality of healthcare  available to Americans across our Nation.   I know I just used the word ``passion,'' but Justin was very  passionate about everything he did and believed in. If he was in, he  was in 100 percent on everything.   Justin Hunter will be remembered not only for his dedication to  healthcare and to the law but also as an avid hunter and barbecue  master and for his tremendous devotion to his family.   For both Roberta and me, our thoughts are with Justin's wife,  Caroline, and with their two daughters, Helena and Vivian.   Justin is truly and sorely missed by so many, and I will always have  good and fond memories of our friendship together.                            ____________________
