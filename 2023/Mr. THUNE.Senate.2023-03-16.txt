 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when it comes to the actions of government,  it is often legislation that grabs the headlines, but it is equally  important to be aware of what a Presidential administration does with  his regulatory power. With the modern expansion of the regulatory  state, Presidents have a tremendous amount of power to affect our  economy and Federal policy through regulation, and President Biden has  made aggressive use of regulatory power to push his agenda and to  burden our economy in the process.   President Biden's big spending habits are well-known: the $1.9  trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree that he signed into law;  the trillions of dollars in new government spending he has proposed and  pushed for over the course of his administration. But his carelessness  with taxpayer dollars is not limited to legislative initiatives.  President Biden has also pushed through regulations costing almost $360  billion and requiring 220 million hours of paperwork--220 million hours  of paperwork. Now, that is a big compliance burden and a good reminder  of the fact that regulations have consequences--consequences for  individual Americans, consequences for American businesses, and  consequences for our economy.   Take the Biden administration's proposed rule to require Federal  contractors to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas  emissions and, in some cases, not only their own direct and indirect  emissions but also related emissions over which the contractor has no  control. This rule is not only impractical, it is unclear how  contractors would even begin to gauge emissions over which they have no  control, but it is likely to be both costly and burdensome.   By the government's own reckoning, the rule would cost affected small  businesses more than $600 million over the first 10 years, and the  National Federation of Independent Business notes that the actual cost  is likely to be much higher. With compliance costs like these, why  would any small business want to apply for a Federal contract?   This is just one of a number of costly regulations the Biden  administration has put in place or is attempting to put in place to  advance its extreme environmental agenda.   A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency that will require  a drastic reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy-duty  vehicles is not only likely to substantially raise the price of new  trucks, it could drive some smaller trucking companies out of business  entirely, which would be problematic at any time but especially  problematic given the supply chain problems we are still experiencing.   A proposed rule to prohibit the sale of cooktops that consume more  than a  [[Page S812]]  certain amount of energy per year would likely make roughly half of the  gas stoves currently sold in the United States illegal and could  threaten manufacturers with substantial losses, to say nothing of the  way it could limit options for Americans, a substantial number of whom  opt for gas stoves.   Then there is the Obama-era waters of the United States rule that  President Biden's Environmental Protection Agency has resurrected. The  WOTUS rule would give the Federal Government sweeping jurisdiction over  most water features on private property, including things like  irrigation ditches, ephemeral streams, and even prairie potholes.   The Supreme Court is currently considering a case concerning the  Federal Government's authority over the Clean Water Act, the outcome of  which stands to nullify or make obsolete much of the Biden WOTUS rule.   But if the WOTUS rule goes into effect, farmers, ranchers, and other  private landowners could see parts of their land rendered useless for  months while the Federal Government determines what restrictions to  impose. Landowners could also be faced with huge compliance costs, and  the value of their land could plummet. There are also the Biden  administration's oil and gas regulations, which are likely to cost all  Americans money by driving up energy prices.   Despite the need to develop American energy--an economic and, I would  add, national security imperative--this week, President Biden announced  that he is closing off a substantial part of the Arctic to oil and gas  development. While I am pleased that he did approve the Willow Project  this week, he has undercut that approval with these new restrictions.   The President's decision to close off a substantial part of the  Arctic will not only restrict areas for energy exploration and  development, it is likely to discourage future energy exploration and  development even in unrestricted areas, with a correspondingly harmful  effect on energy prices.   As if that weren't enough, yesterday, the EPA piled on with another  rule that targets electricity production and industry in 23 States and  threatens to shut down essential power sources that help guarantee a  reliable supply of electricity to American homes and businesses.   The high energy prices Americans have experienced so far under the  Biden administration--up to a staggering 37 percent under his watch-- could become a permanent feature of American life if the President  continues with policies designed to discourage conventional energy  production.   So far, I have focused a lot on the economic costs of regulations and  the Biden administration's environmental agenda, but of course his  environmental agenda is not the only extreme agenda President Biden is  pushing through regulations. For example, he is also using the  regulatory power to push his extreme abortion agenda.   The comment period recently closed for a proposed new regulation that  could threaten medical professionals' right to decline to participate  in abortions. And in defiance of Federal law which prohibits the VA  from providing abortion services, the Biden administration has  implemented a rule to use taxpayer dollars to provide abortion  counseling and abortion services to individuals served by the VA.   While Presidential administrations have tremendous power to push  their agendas--and burden our economy--through regulation, there are  things Congress can do to push back against troubling exercises of  regulatory power. One way is through the Congressional Review Act,  which allows Congress to block regulations if it can gather a  sufficient number of votes.   Republicans have put forward a number of Congressional Review Act  measures--or what we call CRAs--to block some of the Biden  administration's most problematic regulations. Republicans in the House  of Representatives--joined by a handful of Democrats recently--approved  a CRA to block the waters of the United States rule, and we will soon  take up this measure here in the Senate. I also expect us to take up a  measure in the near future to prevent taxpayer dollars from going to  fund abortions at the VA.   Thanks to Senator Capito, we have already managed to block one  problematic Biden regulation so far this year. Senator Capito announced  her intention to challenge a Federal Highway Administration memo, which  the Government Accountability Office determined to be a rule,  discouraging States from pursuing highway expansion projects and  prioritizing funding for projects that reduce emissions. Rather than  waiting for a congressional vote, the Federal Highway Administration  withdrew the memo, issuing a revised version without the problematic  language--a win for infrastructure investments in rural areas of our  country.   We are likely to have an uphill battle in Congress when it comes to  blocking other problematic Biden administration regulations, but  Republicans in both Houses are committed to doing everything we can to  protect Americans.

Madam President, I am also introducing legislation today  to help prevent economically damaging regulations from going into  effect in the first place. My bill, the Regulatory Transparency Act,  would require Federal Agencies to conduct a more transparent and  objective analysis of the impact a proposed regulation would have on  the economy, especially on small businesses. It would also require  Agencies to justify the need for the regulation and consider other less  burdensome ways of meeting the same goal. And, importantly, it would  require Agencies to consider whether a sunset date for the regulation  would be appropriate, which could help reduce the long-term buildup of  irrelevant or outdated Federal regulations.   There is a lot more that I could say about the regulations the Biden  administration has implemented or is trying to put in place, but I will  stop here. Suffice it to say that President Biden has made use of the  regulatory system to advance an agenda that will negatively affect our  Nation, and I will continue to do everything I can to push back against  the Biden administration's many troubling regulations and to protect  our economy and the American people from the regulatory burden the  administration has put in place.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 839         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Regulatory impact analyses         ``(a) In General.--Before issuing any proposed rule, final       rule, or interim final rule that meets the economic threshold       of a significant rule described in section 601(9)(A), an       agency shall conduct a regulatory impact analysis to evaluate       the proposed rule, final rule, or interim final rule, as       applicable.        ``(b) Regulatory Impact Analyses.--An analysis under       subsection (a) shall--        ``(1) be based upon the best reasonably obtainable       supporting information, consistent with Executive Order 12866       (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating to regulatory planning and       review) and any other relevant guidance from the Office of       Management and Budget;        ``(2) be transparent, replicable, and objective;        ``(3) describe the need to be addressed and how the rule       would address that need;        ``(4) analyze the potential effects, including the benefits       and costs, of the rule;        ``(5) to the maximum extent practicable, consider the       cumulative regulatory burden on the regulated entity under       subsection (c);        ``(6) consider the potential effects on different types and       sizes of businesses, if applicable;        ``(7) for a proposed rule that is likely to lead to a       significant rule, or a final or interim final rule that is a       significant rule--        ``(A) describe the need to be addressed, including--        ``(i) the supporting information demonstrating the need;        ``(ii) the failures of private markets that warrant new       agency action, if applicable; and        ``(iii) whether existing law, including regulations, has       created or contributed to the need;        ``(B) define the baseline for the analysis;        ``(C) set the timeframe of the analysis;        ``(D) analyze any available regulatory alternatives,       including--        ``(i) if rulemaking is not specifically directed by       statute, the alternative of not regulating;        ``(ii) any alternatives that specify performance objectives       rather than identify or require the specific manner of       compliance that regulated entities must adopt;        ``(iii) any alternatives that involve the deployment of       innovative technology or practices; and        ``(iv) any alternatives that involve different requirements       for different types or sizes of businesses, if applicable;        ``(E) identify the effects of the available regulatory       alternatives described in subparagraph (D);        ``(F) identify the effectiveness of tort law to address the       identified need;        ``(G) to the maximum extent practicable, quantify and       monetize the benefits and costs of the selected regulatory       alternative and the available alternatives under       consideration;        ``(H) discount future benefits and costs quantified and       monetized under subparagraph (G);        ``(I) to the maximum extent practicable, evaluate non-      quantified and non-monetized benefits and costs of the       selected regulatory alternative and the available       alternatives under consideration; and        ``(J) characterize any uncertainty in benefits, costs, and       net benefits.        ``(c) Cumulative Regulatory Burden.--In considering the       cumulative regulatory burden under subsection (b)(5), an       agency shall--        ``(1) identify and assess the benefits and costs of other       regulations require compliance by the same regulated entities       to attempt to achieve similar regulatory objectives;  [[Page S829]]         ``(2) evaluate whether the rule is inconsistent with,       incompatible with, or duplicative of other regulations; and        ``(3) consider whether the estimated benefits and costs of       the rule increase or decrease as a result of other       regulations issued by the agency, including regulations that       are not yet fully implemented, compared to the benefits and       costs of that rule in the absence of such regulations.        ``(d) Less Burdensome Alternatives.--If, after conducting       an analysis under subsection (a) for a proposed rule that is       likely to lead to a significant rule, or a final rule or       interim final that is a significant rule, the agency selects       a regulatory approach that is not the least burdensome       compared to an available regulatory alternative, the agency       shall include--        ``(1) in the summary section of the preamble a statement       that the selected approach is more burdensome than an       available regulatory alternative; and        ``(2) a justification, with supporting information, for the       selected approach.        ``(e) Regulatory Determination.--        ``(1) In general.--Except as expressly provided otherwise       by law, an agency may issue a proposed rule, final rule, or       interim final rule only upon a reasoned determination that       the benefits of the rule justify the costs of the rule.        ``(2) Requirements.--        ``(A) Alternative.--Whenever an agency is expressly       required by law to issue a rule, the agency shall select a       regulatory alternative that has benefits that exceed costs       and complies with law.        ``(B) Compliance.--If it is not possible to comply with the       law by selecting a regulatory alternative that has benefits       that exceed costs, an agency shall select the regulatory       alternative that has the least costs and complies with law.       ``Sec. 614. Consideration of sunset dates         ``(a) Sunset.--Not later than July 1, 2023, an agency       shall, for each proposed rule or interim final rule of the       agency that meets the economic threshold of a significant       rule described in section 601(9)(A), include an explicit       consideration of a sunset date for the rule.        ``(b) Elements.--The consideration described in subsection       (a) for a proposed rule or interim final rule described in       that subsection shall include an assessment of whether the       rule--        ``(1) could become outmoded or outdated in light of changed       circumstances, including the availability of new       technologies; or        ``(2) could become excessively burdensome after a period of       time due to, among other things--        ``(A) disproportionate costs on small businesses;        ``(B) the net effect on employment, including jobs added or       lost in the private sector; and        ``(C) costs that exceed benefits.        ``(c) Publication.--A summary of the consideration       described in subsection (a) for a proposed rule or interim       final rule described in that subsection shall be published in       the Federal Register along with the proposed or interim final       rule, as applicable.''.
