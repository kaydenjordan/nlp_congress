 Madam President, today I honor a servant leader, liaison,  and combat warrior. After 2 years of service as Director of the Air  Force Senate Liaison Office, Brig. Gen. Neil Richardson is deservedly  moving on and assuming the responsibilities of Deputy Director of  Operations of Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base, IL. On this  occasion, I believe it is fitting to recognize General Richardson's  distinguished service and dedication to fostering the relationship  between the U.S. Air Force and this Chamber.   A C-130 weapons officer and navigator by designation, General  Richardson has led our Nation's men and women in combat, overseas, and  at home. He has led at every level with highlights as an instructor  navigator at the C-130 Weapons Instructor Course, the commander of the  447th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron, leading joint and  coalition airfield operations at Baghdad International Airport, Iraq,  and the 87th Air Base Wing commander at Joint Base McGuire-Dix- Lakehurst in New Jersey, the Defense Department's only triservice joint  base. The Air Force has consistently relied upon General Richardson's  exceptional leadership and unparalleled work ethic.  [[Page S3957]]    General Richardson has excelled in numerous other leadership  positions in the Air Force, most recently as the Director, Air Force  Senate Liaison. In the Russell Senate Office Building and around the  globe, General Richardson facilitated communications between the  Chamber and the Department of the Air Force in establishing the U.S.  Space Force. He supported the Department of the Air Force in twice  gaining confirmation of the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of  Staff of the Air Force.   General Richardson and his team twice supported successful  legislation of the National Defense Authorization Act despite  challenges resulting from the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic and  heightened security on Capitol Hill. His team facilitated 200  congressional engagements with Air Force and Space Force senior leaders  to include seven Air Force Caucus events and the establishment of our  new Space Force Caucus. Furthermore, his team escorted congressional  delegations for more than 84 Members of Congress on visits both  stateside and abroad to include our annual trip to the Ronald Reagan  National Defense Forum.   Next month, General Richardson departs Washington for Scott Air Force  Base, IL, to serve as the deputy director of the greatest airlift,  aerial refueling, and aeromedical evacuation logistical force in the  world. This Chamber will feel General Richardson's absence. I join many  past and present Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation  to General Richardson for his outstanding leadership and unwavering  support of the missions of the U.S. Air Force and especially recognize  his patient and supportive family, Mrs. Melissa Richardson, their  daughter Megan, her husband Air Force SSgt Nathan Brock, along with the  rest of his children; Katie, Garrett, and Gage. I wish this Air Force  family safe travels and endless gratitude for their dedicated service  to our Nation.                            ____________________
