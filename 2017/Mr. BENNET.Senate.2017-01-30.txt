 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, Mr. Trump's poorly drawn and implemented  Executive order blocking refugees from the United States sacrifices  fundamental American values and does not make us safer.   For the first time in memory, the order imposes a ban on all refugees  entering our country, many of whom are fleeing war or who risk  persecution for their religious or political beliefs. The order affects  many thousands of children, women, and men whom our government has  vetted for years and cleared for rescue.   President Trump's action--taken in the first days of his new  administration, for political reasons, without regard for real world  consequences and without the expertise of our national security  professionals or even some of those appointed by the President  himself--represents a rare, but shameful, departure from a  constitutional heritage that has made America strong and a beacon to  oppressed people throughout the world.  [[Page S473]]    For generations, immigrants and refugees have come to our country to  flee religious persecution and to seek a better life. Indeed, these are  the very people who founded our original colonies. Although, as now, we  have occasionally failed to live up to our ideals, over generations the  United States has accepted millions of refugees from around the world.   My own family is part of this story, as so many people's families in  this Chamber are. My mom was born in Poland in 1938 while Nazi tanks  massed at the border. She and her parents miraculously survived the  Holocaust--one of the worst human events in history.   After the war, after arriving in Sweden and then Mexico City, they  were able to come to New York City in 1950. They wanted to come to the  United States because it was the only country in the world where they  believed they could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did.   This weekend, my mom joined hundreds of thousands of Americans to  call on the President to change course, knowing that our family's  struggles in Europe require us to recognize the danger and persecution  facing families throughout the Middle East today.   Out of a population of 22 million, almost 5 million Syrians have fled  to neighboring countries--some to Europe--and have registered as  refugees. More than half of those displaced are children.   According to the United Nations, more than half of the remaining  Syrian population--6 million of them children--require assistance such  as food, water, and health care. Nearly one in four people in Lebanon  today--tonight--is a Syrian refugee, and the fourth largest city in  Jordan is now a refugee camp.   In the wake of President Trump's refugee ban, it seems useful to  ask--and I am sure the American people are asking--why are so many  millions of people fleeing their homes, their countries, and their  history?   They are doing it to save their lives--and, in many cases, their  children's lives--from ISIS's medieval barbarism and Assad's  unrelenting brutality. They seek to escape the murder, rape, detention,  and torture they suffer because of their religion or their ethnicity or  both.   Assad is their enemy. ISIS is their enemy. Today's refugees are  fleeing the violence and extremism that threatens our own national  security. Their enemies are our enemies. The same is true of the  refugees from Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan.   Does this mean we have an obligation simply to open our borders to  them? Of course not. We have a national security imperative to ensure  that no terrorist tries to sneak into the United States as part of the  refugee program.   I have long said that the burden of proof is not on the United States  to accept a refugee. Rather, the refugee has the burden to demonstrate  that they are not a threat to the United States. We have no obligation,  nor should we, to take anything on faith. It is for this reason that  refugees are more thoroughly vetted than anyone else entering the  United States. They must pass stringent screening standards to ensure  that they pose no threat, a process that can take up to 2 years.   First, the United Nations screens them and collects biometric data.  Only those who pass that test are then referred to the United States.  And, by the way, no refugee knows at that stage of the process to which  country they will be referred--to the United States or to any other  country that is accepting refugees. After that, multiple agencies-- including the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the State  Department, and our intelligence agencies--conduct rigorous screenings.  This process includes repeated biometric checks, several layers of  biographical and background screening, health checks, and interviews.  Syrian refugees, in particular, receive enhanced scrutiny through an  additional security risk review by specially trained officers.   Out of the nearly 60,000 people referred to the United States, only  about 12,000 have been accepted. Of those Syrian refugees accepted by  the United States, three-quarters are women and children and half were  under 13 in 2016.   We are the leader of the free world, a republic founded on the  premise of religious freedom and a society that for generations has  called out to the tired, the poor, and the huddled masses yearning to  be free. That is who we are. Yet, in the name of fighting terrorism in  his first week as President, Mr. Trump has sacrificed what has made us  exceptional and has banned these children and their mothers from our  shores.   These children are no different than Omran Daqneesh, whose distant  stare from the back of an ambulance in Aleppo bore witness to the  senseless violence he suffered; or Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body on a  Turkish beach condemned the worst savagery of humankind.   Once he learns the details--if he chooses to study them--if President  Trump wishes to make our vetting even more extreme than it already is,  I guess he may do so. But banning refugees and prioritizing immigration  by religion or ethnicity simultaneously abandons our principles and  weakens our counterterrorism efforts. It sends the wrong message to our  Muslim partners who fight with us in places like Iraq and Afghanistan,  including civilians in those countries who have risked their lives  alongside our troops. It also hands ISIS a recruiting tool by fueling  their narrative that the Western and Muslim worlds cannot coexist in  peace.   If the President really wants to secure our borders and ensure  extremists stay out of the country, there are far better alternatives,  and they are alternatives that are not at war with who we are as  Americans. We should work together to close security gaps in our Visa  Waiver Program and partner with European countries to better track the  flow of foreign fighters throughout Europe and the Middle East. We  should also do more to counter the ability of terrorists to radicalize  and recruit, both here at home and abroad. We should do more to equip  our agencies with tools and capabilities to degrade the ability of  terrorist organizations--in particular, ISIS--to persuade and inspire  using social media. Congress should enact ideas passed by the Senate in  2013 to strengthen border security, double the number of border agents,  and address visa overstays.   By tackling real vulnerabilities and investing in smart security  solutions, we can secure not only our borders but also our values, and  we will not repeat the darkest moments of our history when America  turned away from those fleeing persecution around the world.   A year ago, I came to the Senate floor to share a note sent to me by  my grandparents on my first birthday. It is a message that bears  repeating tonight. The year was 1965--15 years after my mother and  grandparents came to this country after surviving the horrors of the  Holocaust in Poland. This is what they wrote:         The ancient Greeks gave the world the high ideals of       democracy, in search of which your dear mother and we came to       the hospitable shores of beautiful America in 1950. We have       been happy here ever since, beyond our greatest dreams and       expectations, with democracy, freedom, and love, and       humanity's greatest treasure. We hope that when you grow up,       you will help develop in other parts of the world a greater       understanding of these American values.    Like so many immigrants, my grandparents knew how special these  American values are and how rare they are. We cannot take them for  granted or subvert them for a political moment. These values make us  who we are.   Edmund Burke once wrote: ``In history a great volume is unrolled for  our instruction, drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past  errors and infirmities of mankind.''   This is a time when we can learn from the past errors and infirmities  of humankind. We cannot turn our backs on women, children, and families  who risk persecution, starvation, or death.   The President should rescind this Executive order. If not, the Senate  should end the ban immediately and start a serious conversation on how  to make our country safe again in a manner that is consistent with our  fundamental values.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
