 Mr. Speaker, even before the fires destroyed over 2,000  homes on Maui, our entire State faced a dire housing crisis.   Three months later, over 6,500 people find themselves living  temporarily in hotels. While many have had to move multiple times,  these hotels have served as respite from an uncertain future.   Yet, hundreds of survivors will be moved again today as some hotels  opt against renewing their contracts. In the coming months, hundreds  more will be moved, too. At the same time, efforts to secure long-term  housing through existing short-term rentals on Maui have stalled. In  both cases, the underlying motivation is the same--to accommodate the  return of tourists to Maui.   This isn't ``pono,'' ``right.'' This also isn't about choosing one  over the other. Rather, it is a challenge to us to prioritize what is  the most important: taking care of our people. That includes giving  them stability and security when it comes to having roofs over their  heads.   For everyone in our Maui ``'ohana,'' ``family,'' this is a time of  shared sacrifice, but it is also a call to live aloha.   For too many, August 7 will be the day they lost their house to fire.  Let's work together to make sure they know that they still have a place  to call home.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material for the Record.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to rise today as co-chair of  the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus to commence hosting the Special  Order hour in celebration of National Rural Health Month.   Every year, National Rural Health Month is a time for us all to bring  attention to the unique healthcare needs in rural America and honor the  incredible efforts of rural healthcare providers, organizations, and  other stakeholders.   It has been more than a decade since Congress last had a bipartisan  coalition focused on promoting and advancing healthcare solutions for  our Nation's rural and remote communities.   Sadly, during that time, the prognosis and progress has only gotten  worse for those who live in rural America. The health and wellness of  our people has not improved.   Especially given the divisions in our country and in Congress today,  we need to find more ways that we can come together around common  issues and common ground and develop solutions that ensure rural  Americans do not get left behind.   That is one of the reasons why earlier this year, I re-launched the  Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus with my distinguished colleague from the  great State of Tennessee, Diana Harshbarger.   Earlier this year, we came together with a shared desire for Congress  to play a more active role in improving and promoting life and access  to healthcare in rural America.   Today, nearly 50 Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have  joined the Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus, representing rural areas  across the country from Guam to West Virginia to the Upper Peninsula of  Michigan down to central Texas.   Whether political, demographic, or geographic, the diversity of our  caucus is our strength because rural America is America.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), my  distinguished co-chair.  [[Page H5971]]         Mr. Speaker, mahalo to my co-chair, Representative  Harshbarger, for providing leadership and insight for many, many years  in this particular area and serving on the front line as a pharmacist  in her own community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa).                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I say mahalo to Representative LaMalfa, and  I will extend a great deal of gratitude for helping to guide us through  a crisis that is hitting rural America far too often, natural  disasters, as we are seeing it.   I look forward to also now working with you to make sure that when a  disaster strikes, our healthcare system will be able to support them  every step of the way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), who often says ``food is medicine.'' I appreciate his  guidance and wisdom on this particular issue.    Mr. Speaker, as you can see, we have strong leadership  across this great country that is making sure that the health and  wellness of rural America is taken care of. I am so appreciative of all  the members of our caucus that have stepped forward and stepped up, not  just now but in so many years past and will definitely be part of that  leadership going forward.   Mr. Speaker, it looks like it is a great day for the great State of  Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the sad reality is that if  you are living in rural America, you are more likely to experience  lower health expectations, lower health quality, and lower life  expectancy simply because of your ability to access healthcare that you  need.   I have sat with constituents in my community of Wainiha who have  asked me if it was fair that people that live right down the road in  urban Honolulu live 10 years longer than they do. While at times it may  seem that they may require more medical attention and care, rural  Americans often have more access to healthcare because of such things  as you have heard of today: physician shortages, lack of reliable and  affordable transportation options, insufficient health insurance  coverage, and an increased exposure to environmental and occupational  hazards.   As a Representative in Congress for one of the most rural and remote  districts in the country, I know that many of my constituents are often  just one diagnosis away from a serious illness and the difficult  financial and family decisions that often come with this.   Across the country, more than 60 million Americans, about one in five  Americans live in rural areas. While they make up just 18 percent of  the total U.S. population, they are scattered, as we have heard, across  97 percent of our country's land area.   Rural Americans face numerous health disparities as compared with  their urban counterparts. Rural Americans are more likely to die from  heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory  disease, and stroke, as compared to their urban counterparts.   Unintentional injury or death. You heard Representative Thompson talk  a little about this and the ``golden hour.'' They are more likely, by  50 percent higher rates, to die in rural areas as compared to urban  areas often because of their ability to access emergency care when  involved in a motor vehicle crash or opioid overdose.   There are so many steps that we can continue to address, but I would  have us hear from another part of our great country and a rural caucus,  that of the great State of North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Davis), another distinguished member of our Rural Health Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, as you heard, across our country, we have  strong leadership on rural health, much action to be taken, and many  opportunities that we need to make sure that we seize.   We have talked a lot about rural America, from California to  Pennsylvania to North Carolina. I would like to bring us back to Hawaii  now. It is the most isolated archipelago in the world, with the nearest  landmass over 2,300 miles away. I can tell you, it is a long distance,  given that I travel it pretty much every weekend, crossing that great,  beautiful, blue Pacific Ocean.   My district represents all the islands in Hawaii. On our neighboring  islands, patients often have to fly to Oahu, our main island with  Honolulu, to get emergency or even routine medical, dental, or mental  health care. Many Oahu-based providers often spend their weekends, if  they can even reach the availability of air transportation, traveling  back and forth between our islands just to try to make sure our  patients get the medication and services they need to survive.   I know a lot of people are thinking we have telehealth now, so that  should be no problem. Again, consider the remoteness of our islands and  the remoteness of so many of our rural communities. Broadband speed and  access are not equal everywhere across this great country and our  territories. Oftentimes, people are just asking folks  [[Page H5974]]  to pick up a phone to be able to triage and immediately start to  provide care and scrips, which, in many cases, people need because they  are living in isolated and remote parts of rural America.   As in many other parts of this country, in Hawaii, we are seeing  providers, hospitals, and clinics struggle to keep their doors open  because of high operating costs and insufficient reimbursement rates.  As was alluded to earlier in this discussion, since 2010, 155 rural  hospitals have closed their doors, making the difficult decision to  leave their patients behind.   Often these patients aren't just patients. These are family members,  neighbors, and friends. With limited healthcare options and access, we  know that for many of these individuals, those hospitals, those  providers closing their doors, it is a life sentence.   You would think, after these last 15 or so years, that we are out of  the woods. Well, think again. Over 40 percent of all rural hospitals  are operating with negative margins and are vulnerable to closure. This  is on top of the fact that rural communities often have fewer  healthcare providers. Over 50 percent of rural communities and counties  have no access to hospital-based maternal care. That means just being  able to go somewhere to be able to have your child safely. Seventy  percent are lacking even a single psychiatrist in their county.   Looking at the stats, when we think about it, just basic physicians,  general internists, and doctors in rural communities, you have 13.1  physicians per 10,000 people as compared to 31.2 in urban areas, less  than half the amount that urban America is able to enjoy.   When we are talking about specialist care, think of our own  situations and how often you would need that specialist or a loved one  has needed a specialist to provide lifesaving care for them. Rural  America has 30 specialists per 100,000 individuals as compared to 263  specialists per 100,000 people. We can see the disparity, and sadly, we  can see the great need that exists in rural America right now.   High costs have also proven to be a significant barrier. Whether it  is providing housing for recruiting and retaining healthcare workers in  our State, covering medical transport via medevac airplane or  helicopter, considering even the wages of professionals, these are all  things, as you have heard today, that we have legislative bills we are  trying to focus on, making sure that these barriers no longer exist and  reducing the challenges to accessing healthcare in rural America.   Mr. Speaker, we will soon hear from another great State in this  country, so let me at this particular time take this back to my home  State of Hawaii.   As I mentioned earlier when Mr. LaMalfa came up, we have seen such  devastation in my district with the Maui fires. The response in the  wake of this disaster has really highlighted to us the importance of  making sure we have a strong and robust healthcare system. From  critical access care personnel and medical countermeasures and  supplies, you have to have them ready and onsite because in so many  cases in our rural communities, whether you live on islands or there  are hundreds of thousands of miles that separate you from the nearest  access point, help can often be days away.   At the onset of our fires, I remember our chief of police telling us  that we have often been told--sadly, now we see it--that if we are in a  crisis, we are 72 hours away from help. We have to make sure,  especially when it comes to critical access care and healthcare, that  we have the supplies and personnel in all of our communities to be able  to help respond to disaster once she strikes.   My district also has one of the most racially and ethnically unique  populations in the country, and these communities often experience,  sadly, some of the highest healthcare costs and suffer from some of the  highest health disparities that we see across the country.   Mr. Speaker, again, one of the wonderful aspects of this caucus is  that it is both bipartisan and represents all of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, you have heard today so many tales of  tragedy and disparity across our country in rural America, but also  through the legislation, bills, and advocacy that we have seen from our  Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus members, so many opportunities for us to  do good by rural America.   As I close today, I appreciate all of our Members who have come  forward to share their stories from across this great country. Let me  highlight an article that was recently run in The Washington Post that  focused on the fact that more people in Puerto Rico are dying at higher  rates because of these healthcare disparities and lack of access to a  health system.   As we take a look at the numbers, as we know, Puerto Rico has been  devastated by natural disasters, compounded by COVID-19 already  stressing a very strained healthcare system. They are lacking  professionals in the community to be able to serve their residents. The  fact is that they only have one working ambulance for 25,000 people in  a town. Too often, by the time the call is made and the ambulance shows  up at the home, those people have already passed away.   The fact is that they had 35,400 deaths last year in 2022 for a  population of 3.3 million, thousands more than researchers could ever  have expected, historical highs that they are seeing compounded as a  result of a strained healthcare system that is unable to take care of  its people.   There are stories and examples of veterans who have served and fought  under our flag that you stand before right there not being able to  access the critical care or even the basic care that they need,  deserve, and fought for.   Too many people are dying as a result of a lack of access to  healthcare. When we take a look at the numbers, there are disparities  in terms of increases in Alzheimer's, substance abuse, mental health  conditions, and chronic health conditions like blood pressure,  diabetes, kidney failure, respiratory failure--all of these things.  [[Page H5975]]    To me, when I read this article and all the problems they cite--lack  of facilities, lack of professionals, too many of the young ones  leaving their community to go to work in the United States or take on  other professions--this was a cautionary tale to all of rural and  remote America that if we don't get our act together soon in our States  and our territories to make sure that no matter where you live in this  great country, especially in rural and remote America that makes up  over 97 percent of this great country's land mass, we will continue to  see people die.   The stakes could not be higher when it comes to making sure that the  Bipartisan Rural Health Caucus continues to stay together and fight for  those most basic things for every single one of our constituents. No  matter where you live, no matter what district, each one has a touch of  rural. We need to make sure that the healthcare access and mental  health services they need will be there for them when they need it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing us this critically important  Special Order hour to highlight rural health in our country. I look  forward to working very closely with all of my colleagues to make sure  that rural America has the healthcare that they need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
