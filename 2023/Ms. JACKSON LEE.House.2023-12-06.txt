 Mr. Chairman, our universities across America have  opened the doors to working-class Americans and impoverished Americans  to be able to access a better life and education.   I speak to this amendment that indicates that any donation, as much  as $1, has to be under this particular act.   First of all, this is a blanket representation that our universities  are taking moneys from terrorists. I am outraged to say that the  University of Houston, University of Texas, Texas Southern University,  and Prairie View A&M would be in the position of taking money from  terrorists.   If you pass this amendment, you implode the innocent persons who are  giving donations and the work of our universities attempting to provide  dollars to educate more Americans--more impoverished Americans who  simply have families that cannot afford for them to go to school. This  is an outrage.   I want everybody to know that under this particular act, $1 has to be  reported. That $1 may come from a grandmother or that $1 may come from  a hardworking parent.    Generous and kindhearted people from the faith  institutions that many of our universities come under, Mr. Chair, you  are going to ask them to vet or to determine whether terrorists are  involved.   It is not the question of whether terrorists are involved. I want  this Nation to be protected. We now realize that we are subject to a  lot of terrorist potential because of the times we are in. I take it  seriously. I am on the Homeland Security Committee.   Nevertheless, this $1 is to make a mockery of the hard work of many  folks at ``working-class'' universities and colleges, our community  colleges, and 2-year colleges that themselves receive donations from  people who are grateful that they allowed them to be a vocational nurse  or welder and, because of that opportunity, they were able to make a  living for themselves and their families.   We must have rational and reasonable thinking here. I am grateful for  America's hierarchy of education because so many people come here to be  educated.   Mr. Chair, let us vote this amendment down. Let us not do this and  undermine the educational system of this Nation and the Constitution.  [[Page H6179]]         Mr. Chair, it should be made very clear that there  is not one American, not one Member of Congress, not one Democratic  Member of Congress, as well, joined with colleagues who reasonably  understand our mutual commitment to the national security of this  Nation, who wants any interference in the important research that is  being done by universities across America.   They are the hope of the world. There are brilliant students who come  with complete innocence here to the United States to create global  research that will help not only this country but the world.   I want that to continue. I want the bad actors to be wiped out.  Clearly, as my friends have now moved from China to the Mideast, I  abhor Hamas. They are terrorists, but I am yet to find a dollar from  them to any legitimate institution here in the United States.   What I will say is that we have a system in place. It builds on the  Chips and Science Act and the Presidential memorandum on government- supported research.    Mr. Chair, we already have a process to weed out and  stop it. I can't imagine stopping research at the Yales and Harvards  and Princetons, but I also can't imagine stopping it from the ordinary  universities across America.   Let us support the present legislation and the U.S. Department of  Education and stop blaming our educational institutions and calling  them terrorists.
