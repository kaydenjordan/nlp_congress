 Mr. Speaker, I ran for Congress to solve problems, and  this legislation averts a crisis. A default would jeopardize millions  of people with unemployment, increase interest rates, and put retirees  at risk and devastate their 401(k)'s.   A default would also jeopardize numerous investments in the American  worker in the 117th Congress, including the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act. That bill not only created jobs but also, with a strong  ``buy American'' provision, strengthened our domestic steel and  manufacturing base and also allows for our veterans to be protected and  provides funds dedicated to the health benefits and resources for the  toxic exposures fund.   I appreciate the dedicated work of the administration and my  Democratic colleagues.   For my neighbor Gretchen, who had anxiety about her 401(k), this bill  supports the American worker. It supports American industry, the steel  industry, and it also protects the American Dream. I am voting ``yes.''
