 Mr. Speaker, the modern American worker wants flexibility  and choice. However, President Biden and Washington Democrats would  rather force their radical labor agenda on the American people.   That is why Senator Tim Scott and I introduced the Employee Rights  Act, which represents the Republican vision for the future of the  modern American workforce.   Our bill updates our Nation's labor laws by expanding workforce  protections for independent contractors, entrepreneurs, franchises, and  anyone else looking to earn a living on their own terms and live the  American Dream.   This bill also offers political protections to employees by  preventing heavyhanded union leaders from abusing membership dues, as  well as ensuring the union election process is conducted by secret  ballot, a right guaranteed to every American, so employees are not  intimidated or harassed for the way they vote.   Supported by dozens of national, State, and local organizations, I am  proud to introduce this commonsense legislation that ensures workers'  rights are protected from partisan union leaders and the heavy hand of  this administration.   Republicans stand with the 21st century worker, and it is time our  labor policies do, as well. Every American deserves the freedom to hold  a job and not be forced to pay union dues.                            ____________________
