 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8294, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   The original National Apprenticeship Act was passed in 1937 and is  now over 80 years old. There is no doubt that Congress should update  the Apprenticeship Act; however, the legislation being considered today  will harm apprenticeships rather than aid workforce development.   H.R. 8294 removes the Department of Labor's ability to administer  industry-recognized apprenticeship programs, making only DOL-registered  programs available. While DOL-approved programs work for many  employers, one-size-fits-all solutions don't work for many industries  and are simply not the answer.   Industry-recognized apprenticeship programs are developed by third- party groups that are recognized by the Department of Labor. They are  held to high standards to ensure apprentices are receiving the training  that they need.   IRAPs have already proven to be successful in helping to expand  access to apprenticeships. Somebody argued that IRAPs are harmful  because they think it might limit involvement in union-sponsored  apprenticeships. What these individuals do not think about are the  areas of the country like mine where union-sponsored apprenticeships do  not exist or are extremely limited. My home district has none.   Not only does this legislation try to force one-size-fits-all  programs on to apprentices and employers while favoring unions, it also  drastically increases the amount of bureaucratic red tape placed on  States and program sponsors.   Apprenticeship programs are fantastic options for individuals to gain  skills and find well-paying jobs and for businesses to grow and expand  their workforce. Especially in a year that has greatly affected our  workers, we should not pass legislation that threatens to reduce access  to workforce development or makes it more difficult to run or establish  an apprenticeship program. I urge a ``no'' vote.
