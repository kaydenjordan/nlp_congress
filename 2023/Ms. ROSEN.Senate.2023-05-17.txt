 Mr. President, I want to express how deeply concerned I am  about the senior Senator from Alabama's blockade of senior military  promotions, which threatens to leave hundreds of nonpolitical, routine  military positions unfilled, all because he wants to repeal the  Department of Defense's policy that allows servicemembers to be able to  seek and travel for reproductive care.   This is a move that risks our national security in order to rob our  servicemembers of their ability to make their own family planning  decisions, servicemembers who, frankly, are sacrificing so much to keep  our country safe.  [[Page S1690]]    So failure--failure--to fill these positions poses a risk to our  Nation's military readiness and our ability to ensure that these  critical roles are filled with the personnel that we need.   Don't just take my word for it. Seven--seven--former Secretaries of  Defense from both Democratic and Republican administrations have voiced  their concern and opposition to these holds.   Secretary Austin and General Milley have also repeatedly stated that  these delays pose a clear risk--a clear risk--to America's military  readiness.   In a moment, I will be asking the Senate to confirm by unanimous  consent Calendar No. 110. Included in this batch of 23 routine military  promotions is the current vice commander of the Air Force Warfare  Center at Nellis Air Force Base. This is the home of our Air Force  fighter pilots right in Nevada, where America's air combat tactics are  developed, where they are refined, and where they are perfected to  ensure that we keep pace with current and emerging threats.   Training and instruction take place right at the Nevada Test and  Training Range, which provides the largest air and ground military  training space in the continental United States for testing and  evaluation of weapons systems and advanced air combat training.   Because of one Senator's anti-choice blockade, the vice commander of  the Air Force Warfare Center in my great State of Nevada, which  oversees more than 13,000 military and civilian personnel, is unable to  receive the promotion and the pay increase that he deserves. He is  unable to transition to his next duty assignment, and his replacement  is unable to assume their duties and move their family to Las Vegas.   This hurts military families. This hurts Nevada. This hurts the  United States of America.   We will also experience several high-ranking vacancies that are going  to be left open because of this senseless blockade, including Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs, the top leaders of the Army, Marine Corps, and  Navy, and even the commander of U.S. Cyber Command.   We have a responsibility to keep our Nation safe, to protect our  homeland and our troops all around the world. That begins by making  sure that we have the appropriate professionals in top positions to  lead our servicemembers. Nothing--I repeat, nothing--could be more  important than that.   I strongly urge my colleagues to stop playing politics. I strongly  urge them to end this anti-choice blockade so that we can fill critical  military positions like those in my home State of Nevada and around the  world. We cannot waste any more time.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 110; that the Senate vote  on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that any statements  related to the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    I thank the Presiding Officer so much for saying  ``Nevada'' properly. I urge the rest of my colleagues to learn the  proper pronunciation for our great State of Nevada.  [[Page S1691]]    With that, I am going to respond to the objection by my esteemed  colleague Senator Tuberville.   The senior Senator from Alabama is preventing this body from  confirming dozens of key promotions. We do know who these military  promotions are. They have been serving proudly and with distinction in  our military. They are not unknown to us. They deserve their  promotions.   The Senator is threatening our military readiness and our national  security, and we can confirm these nominations right now if the Senator  ends his blockade. Every day--every day--these holds persist, every day  the Senator persists, he risks the U.S. national security and he risks  our military readiness. Because we lack officials in key posts across  the military at this critical time, we know we need to do this en bloc.  It is what we have been doing.   These men and women, serving proudly, are ready for their promotions,  ready to take their next duty step.   I just want to make one point before I go. Make no mistake, our  adversaries--they are watching this very closely. Russia, China, Iran,  and others--they understand how this hurts our military, and they will  look and find a way to take advantage of this.   So I am deeply disappointed that the Senator is continuing to object.  We hope he will reconsider.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, this week marks National Police Week, a  time to recognize and honor the courageous work of men and women who  keep our communities safe. These heroes put their lives on the line to  protect our communities.   And I want to give special thanks to law enforcement officers across  Nevada who serve every day with honor and integrity. And I want Nevada  police officers to know: I have your back. We  [[Page S1692]]  have your back. With the Presiding Officer, my senior Senator from  Nevada, we have your back.   That means working to see that our law enforcement officers have  access to resource, training, and recruitment support--the kinds of  things they need to do their job safely.   And we should also honor the men and women who have fallen in the  line of duty protecting our communities. These men and women were  heroes. They left behind family and friends and colleagues and  communities they served and helped to protect--men and women like Las  Vegas Metro Police Officer Truong Thai, who was tragically shot and  killed this past October while responding to a domestic disturbance  call.   Officer Thai, who came to this country as a child from Vietnam, was a  pillar of our community. He was deeply devoted to his family. He was an  experienced patrol officer who trained new recruits over the course of  his career.   Officer Thai has been described as a mentor to his colleagues. One  said: He ``did the job''--``did the job''--``for all the right  reasons.''   Officer Thai was also a friend to so many, a consummate family man.  And when he wasn't directly serving the community in uniform, he was  often coaching volleyball or out in the water, boating with his family  and friends.   And 7 months since he was murdered, Officer Thai continues to be  missed by his loved ones and the entire Las Vegas community, and no one  will forget him and his service and his kindness.   Unfortunately, Officer Thai is not the only one. Far too many  officers have been killed in the line of duty. So, today, I am also  thinking of these fallen officers and all of those who died in the line  of duty in Nevada.   To honor their lives and bravery, I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record a list of names of Nevada police officers who  recently passed way and whose names have been added to the Nevada Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial and the James D. Hoff Peace Officer  Memorial.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Officer Philip Carl Closi, Las Vegas Metro Police       Department. Officer Ed Contreras, Las Vegas Metro Police       Department. Officer Ray Edward East, Walker River Paiute       Tribal Police Department. Special Deputy Marshal Jose E.       Gomez, U.S. Marshals Service. Senior Federal Air Marshal       Shawn P. Hennessee, Department of Homeland Security. Sergeant       Douglas Michael King, Las Vegas Metro Police Department.       Bailiff Gerald Raymond ``Bear'' Smith, Pahrump Justice Court.       Detective Justin Terry, Las Vegas Metro Police Department.       Officer Truong Thanh Thai, Las Vegas Metro Police Department.    Madam President, these officers--these brave officers-- made the ultimate sacrifice for our communities, and they deserve our  eternal gratitude.   I will continue to work with my colleagues here in the Senate on  solutions that support our police departments, the officers who serve,  and, always, their families.   I yield.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
