 Madam Speaker, I rise today to wish the  Assyrian community in the Central Valley and across the world a Happy  New Year.   One of my fondest memories growing up in Turlock was spending  afternoons with my Assyrian neighbor, who was like a grandmother to me.  Her name was Nana Bitpera.   Every day, she would pick grape leaves in her backyard while she made  rice, so my brother and I could enjoy fresh, homemade dolmas after  school.   She would tell me stories about the incredible contributions of the  Assyrian culture to art and literature: how Assyrians built the first  human cities, were the first to domesticate crops, and how they  literally invented the wheel.   She also told me about the centuries of persecution that Assyrians  faced that caused so many to come for a new future in America.   Madam Speaker, as we celebrate the year 6769, I want to tell the  Assyrian community how grateful I am to be their neighbor, and may this  new year bring their families joy and happiness.                            ____________________
