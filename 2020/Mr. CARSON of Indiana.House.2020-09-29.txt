 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Zeta Phi  Beta sorority on a century of nurturing leaders and improving  communities.   Founded on Howard University's campus 100 years ago, Zeta has  chartered hundreds of chapters worldwide and has a membership of  150,000. Its list of esteemed alumni is a who's who of Black  excellence, including trailblazers in business, law, advocacy, public  service, and more.   I am incredibly proud that my grandmother, Julia Carson, is a part of  this amazing legacy of women.   As the sorority moves on to its next 100 years, I have no doubt that  it will maintain and strengthen its zeal for excellence.   Once again, congratulations to Zeta Phi Beta on your first century of  success.                            ____________________
