 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, as a free and open society, the United States has  always drawn in those from around the world seeking to study here, to  live here, individuals seeking to observe and participate in our way of  life. Indeed, we benefit from these visitors when they take on our  values and go home with them.   However, when an individual comes to study and work in the United  States, we must take care both that they are here for their stated  purpose and that they are allowed to fulfill their legitimate goal  without disruption.   As one FBI study has found, foreign intelligence services have been  taking advantage of higher education institutions and personnel for  many years. This problem is particularly acute with China. That is why  administrations on both sides of the aisle have considered measures to  protect academic research from foreign exploitation.   In recent years, we have seen a number of cases damaging the national  security:   In 2008, a Tennessee professor was convicted of exporting defense  articles without a license after using Chinese students to conduct Air  Force research that they exported to China;   In 2009, a researcher at Duke University sent data back to China,  which led to the creation of a multibillion-dollar Chinese company;   And in 2015, Chinese professors were among six defendants charged by  the Department of Justice with theft of trade secrets on behalf of  Chinese companies and academic institutions.   As the United States addresses China's increasingly aggressive rise,  it is critical that we consider how to effectively address these issues  as a free society. That is why my amendment requires that a whole-of- government strategy on China mandated by the NDAA incorporate two key  elements: exploitation of visa programs to enter the United States by  the Chinese Communist Party and the party's intimidation and coercion  of Chinese nationals in the United States.   This is not a blanket ban or requirement of any sort to limit the  number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.; rather, it is merely  adding an important element to the existing strategy required under the  NDAA to address a whole-of-government challenge comprehensively.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Chairman, with the few seconds that I have left, I  would just say, to extend the football metaphor, perhaps to the point  of absurdity, our defense doesn't even get on the field. We keep  drawing pick six after pick six; therefore, allowing intellectual  property theft, which is the greatest transfer of wealth in human  history, by the Chinese, which is what the Blair-Huntsman Commission  laid out.   So I look forward to working with my colleague on a more  comprehensive approach, but in the meantime, I hope he will work with  me on this.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
