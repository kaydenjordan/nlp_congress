 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today to celebrate  the 60th anniversary of the Kraft Foods Group plant in Champaign,  Illinois, and its dedicated employees, including my dad, who once  worked the third shift. These are the people who have helped produce  the foods we all have known and loved for generations.   The Kraft Heinz Champaign plant opened operations in 1963, making  margarine and salad dressings. Madam Speaker, 60 years later, it has  added production of their most famous Mac & Cheese, Velveeta, Heinz  Tomato Ketchup, and A.1. Steak Sauce and grown to fill an 88-acre site  that produces more than 1.2 billion pounds of food each year.   The strong output of this plant has made it a key driver for our  local economy and is an important part of the Champaign-Urbana  community.   Many boxes of Mac & Cheese and Velveeta later, please join me in  celebrating this exciting milestone and honoring the hardworking men  and women at Kraft Heinz Champaign. Congratulations to them on their  60th anniversary.                            ____________________
