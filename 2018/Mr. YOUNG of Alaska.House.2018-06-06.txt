 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, thank you for recognizing me to  discuss this revised Young amendment No. 49.   I appreciate Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio's help and  the help the majority and the minority staffs have given us with their  assistance to get this amendment to the floor.   This amendment requires the Secretary to conduct an assessment of  dams classified as Class III under the Dam Safety Action Classification  of the Corps of Engineers. Once the assessment is complete, this  amendment requires the Secretary to provide a report to Congress  describing two things: what will happen to local communities should the  Corps give up the control of dam versus what will happen if the Corps  continues to maintain the dam. This amendment will show the importance  of accurate design and construction.   Currently, there is a hole the size of a family sedan in a dam  mitigation outlet tunnel that serves the city of Seward, Alaska. The  Corps assumed responsibility for this dam, and the design and  construction flaw will only get worse until the Corps fixes it, which  they are committed to do. The current study for an alternative solution  will not be completed until 2019.   This amendment is critical to the Alaska community because it  prevents Seward from bearing undue hardship from frequent flooding and  continuous damage to the outfall due to the unforeseen design faults.  This amendment would continue to require the Corps to expedite the  study and place a critical importance on fixing the dam system for my  constituents in Seward.   I want to thank, again, Chairman Shuster, Ranking Member DeFazio, and  their staffs for working with me and my staff on this amendment and for  supporting my efforts here today. We will continue to work further on  this issue in conference, and I urge all my colleagues to support my  amendment No. 49.   I yield back the balance of my time.
