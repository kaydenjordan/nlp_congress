 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senate Democrats had hoped to work with  our Republican colleagues this year on a fully bipartisan process. It  got off to a great start when the four congressional leaders reached a  budget deal over the summer, but it quickly went awry.   Senate Republicans departed from the bipartisan process by  unilaterally proposing their own allocations to the various agencies.  This was not part of the agreement. This was not in the spirit or  concept of the agreement. It was always, when we agreed, that we would  work out the 302(b) allocations. Instead, the Republicans went ahead,  unilaterally, and they proposed moving $12 billion--$12 billion--from  critical health programs and military families to pay for the  President's border wall, and that was way out of bounds.   The Republican leader has accused Democrats, myself included, of  breaking our budget deal by not going along with these very partisan  bills. He knows--and every Member of this Chamber, Democrat and  Republican, knows well--that Democrats are not going to support a  unilateral move by the Republicans to take $12 billion away from  military families, education, opioids, and NIH and put it into the  President's vanity, partisan wall. So, until Republicans get serious  about negotiating a bipartisan way forward, the partisan appropriation  bills are all we have and they cannot move forward.   Now, in the last few days, after conversations that I had with Leader  McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy, we are seeing some  positive signs that we can get the process back on track. This month,  Democrats and Republicans worked through a package of bipartisan  appropriation bills on the floor with few issues. Now, as we speak,  both parties, both sides--Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate  appropriators--have started talking again about restarting the good- faith negotiations on the remaining bills.   We hope this moves forward in a bipartisan way. Each side has to  agree. I will repeat my view. If President Trump stays out of it, we  will come to an agreement. If President Trump messes in, if the  Republican leader feels so in obeisance to Donald Trump, who doesn't  have any concept of how to get things done around here, then we will  not get it done, and we may have a second Trump shutdown with the  leader going along, which will not succeed. It will not succeed in  getting them what they want.   So I hope that with a little effort and compromise, we in Congress  can find a way forward on appropriations by working together.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is now several weeks since the  President asked our troops to leave a critical sector in northern  Syria, and, subsequently, lots of things happened, including at least  100 and probably more ISIS prisoners escaping, an uncertainty as to who  is guarding the prisons where ISIS prisoners are kept, and a whole  strategy as to how to continue the fight against ISIS.   ISIS is not vanquished. ISIS is weakened but not vanquished, and we  all know ISIS can come back. We all know a small group thousands of  miles away can do untold damage in our homeland. Yet we still have no  plan, that we have heard, from the administration on how are we dealing  with ISIS; how are we dealing with the prisoners who escaped; how are  we dealing with the prisoners who are still incarcerated; and how are  we dealing with ISIS overall.   This is one of the greatest security threats America faces, and I  would hope we could pass this proposal, which simply demands that the  administration report to Congress on what their plan is to deal with  ISIS. It is that simple. That is the immediate danger.   I know my friend, the Senator from Florida, wants to talk about what  happened in the past. We can argue that all day long, but the immediate  danger is ISIS, the ISIS prisoners who have escaped, the ISIS prisoners  who are incarcerated, and the ISIS members who still are around. We  don't have a strategy, and it is one of the greatest failings of  foreign policy not only of this administration but of any  administration.   A resolution passed the House a while ago. It has laid fallow here.  All we are asking in this legislation is very simple: to require a  report on the strategy to secure the enduring defeat of the Islamic  State.   I hope we will not hear objection. I don't see how anyone could  object when the security of America is at risk and when ISIS is still a  danger. Every one of us could come up with an amendment to make it  better. We know we will not get it done if that happens.   I hope we can move this forward, and then we can debate other issues  that are not directly dispositive here because we have an immediate  crisis, and we need a report.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, as in legislative session,  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No.  281, S.  [[Page S6460]]  2755, a bill to require a report on the plan to secure the enduring  defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, this is a diversion. We can all debate  history. Maybe Bush was to blame. Maybe Obama was to blame. Who knows.  Maybe Harry Truman was to blame when they set up CENTO. That is  something we can debate at a later time.   We have an immediate crisis. We need a report, and our Republican  colleagues keep finding ways so they can object so the President  doesn't have to answer. That is wrong. It risks the security of  America, and it is not what we should be doing.   So I object, and I urge us to pass the amendment without the  modification, which is still as valid as it was a few minutes ago.    Madam President, if they are worried about an attack, it  is not on this President or a previous President. That is the political  stunt here, I would say to my friend in Florida. He knows what he is  doing. He is trying to stop this from happening. The attack we are  worried about is an attack by ISIS on the United States.   Whether you are a Democrat, Republican, liberal, or conservative, the  country needs a plan. All of the diversion, all of the games will not  prevent the American people from seeing that we need that, and it is  our job as Senators to push the administration to do it.   So I would have hoped we could have passed this amendment without the  diversionary, partisan proposal made by the Senator from Florida. I am  sorry we haven't been able to move the amendment. It is so wrong for  the safety of this country.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
