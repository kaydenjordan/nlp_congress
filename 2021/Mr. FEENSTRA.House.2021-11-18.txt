 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this reckless  social spending bill. It is simply wrong that, rather than funding  mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare--which are on the  verge of insolvency over the next 10 years--Democrats instead are  adding 150 new programs to this bill. Think about that, seniors. Your  money that is coming to you every day is on the verge of bankruptcy,  and yet the Democrats are adding another 150 programs.    Academic economists all over our country are saying that this bill is  a complete disaster for all Americans because it will dramatically  increase taxes. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the new  programs will dramatically increase the debt by $4 trillion every year.  Families and businesses can't continue to go down this path of  continuing to see increases in our gas, our groceries, and our hardware  supplies all because of this reckless spending that continues to happen  by the Democrats.
