 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Jewish American Heritage Month by sharing a story of my personal Jewish  American hero, Ben Ferencz.   Ben was recently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. He was the  last living Nuremberg prosecutor, who recently passed away at age 103.   Ben enlisted in the U.S. Army straight out of law school. He was  assigned to collect evidence of Nazi war crimes, which he later used to  prosecute the biggest murder case in the history of the world. At age  27, he convicted 22 Nazi leaders for their roles in the deaths of over  1 million people.   Ben later dedicated his life to creating a world of acceptance and  compassion, becoming a tireless advocate for the rule of law and  international justice.   Ben Ferencz is a real Jewish-American hero. His legacy is one of  peace, justice, and humility. May his memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
