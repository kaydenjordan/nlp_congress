 Mr. Speaker, I rise to repeal ObamaCare by supporting the  American Health Care Act. We are here to take health care back from the  bureaucrats and give it to the people.   The previous administration enacted ObamaCare, and we saw its  effects: higher premiums, less choice, lost coverage, and broken  promises. The deductibles are so high it is like not having insurance  at all.   The people who sent me to Congress sent me with strict orders: End  this law. And on the American Health Care Act, I can report, it does.   With this bill, the Federal Government no longer forces you to buy a  product you can't use and don't want. The individual mandate is gone,  so is the job-killing employer mandate. Gone are a host of taxes on  prescription meds, over-the-counter drugs, insurance premiums, and  lifesaving medical devices.   It ends ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, and it puts Medicaid on a  budget and focuses State efforts on those people truly in need. This is  the biggest entitlement reform in a generation.   Of course the bill is not perfect. There is more to do. But I spent  30 years as a surgeon. In medicine, as in life, you do not get to  choose the perfect option. You learn not to make perfect the enemy of  great.   With this vote we decide whether ObamaCare is our healthcare future  or not. We can live with its failures and broken promises or create a  market-based system that actually lowers the cost of health care and  serves patients, not bureaucrats.    So I support the American Health Care Act, Mr. Speaker, and I urge  that all Members do the same.
