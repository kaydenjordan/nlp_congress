 Mr. Speaker, the latest Gallup poll shows most Americans  are concerned about the cost and availability of energy now more than  at any time in the last decade, and for good reason.   Thanks to President Biden's anti-American energy agenda, we are all  paying more for the fuel necessary to fill our cars, heat our homes,  and run our businesses.   One short year ago, I warned: If the President's destructive actions  toward America's domestic energy production during his first week in  office are any indication of where our energy policy is headed over the  next 4 years, our Nation is on a dangerous path.   Today, that warning has come true. This destruction is entirely self- inflicted, and it is entirely avoidable.   To solve the energy crisis and deliver relief for the American  people, President Biden must remove the ban on new drilling, reopen the  Keystone pipeline, and unleash American energy dominance.                            ____________________
