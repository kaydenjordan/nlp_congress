 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at noon on Monday, October 30, 2023.    Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt the floor staff is overjoyed to  be returning to the floor and having business get back to normal. I  will be sure to try to make sure I use the entirety of the 60 minutes  and regale our fine staff.   I do want to take a moment to thank the staff, as the Speaker did  when he was voted into office and sworn in yesterday. We have great  staff who work hard here on the floor and keep this institution  functioning even when sometimes we are not functioning much as a body.  I am grateful for the staff. As a former staffer, I know how hard they  work, and I am deeply appreciative of it.   We have had an interesting few weeks, and a lot of people around the  country were asking questions about what we were doing in having a  debate about the Speaker of the House. My response has largely been: We  are doing our job. We are having a debate in this body about the future  of the country, and that is actually what we are supposed to do.   Choosing a Speaker of the House, following a Speaker of the House,  removing a Speaker of the House, all of those are things that are part  of our job to figure out what we need to do to make sure that we are  doing the people's work in the people's House.   All of this will be forgotten in a matter of hours, days, and  certainly in history books. The only thing that is going to matter is  what we do with our power in this institution, in the House of  Representatives, to represent the people. That is all that is really  going to matter in the end.                                time  1715    All of the noise, all of the debate, all of the reporters scurrying  around, all of the interviews and 24/7 news shows, none of that will  matter.   None of that will be remembered. None of our kids and none of our  grandkids are going to be wandering around in 10 years or 40 years or  100 years saying, well, man, what about that interview on Sean Hannity  or on MSNBC or something.   They are not going to know anything about that. The only question  that will matter is are they living in a free and strong country. That  is the only thing that is going to matter.   Are they able to carry out their God-given rights that are protected  under our Constitution and under the laws of the United States or are  they not?   One of the things that I think is really important that I have  observed throughout this process, as I sit here in a largely empty  Chamber with two Members of Congress, a lot of my colleagues are  catching their flights home after a few weeks of drama surrounding the  Speaker.   One of the things that I have observed in this debate about who  should be the Speaker and what House Republicans want to do with the  majority is that my Democrat colleagues are nowhere to be found on any  of the issues that matter to the people I represent  [[Page H5158]]  and the vast majority of the American people. That is the simple truth.   With all due respect to my Democrat colleagues, some of whom I  consider friends and I have worked to move legislation with, happy to  have debates with, they are utterly missing in action when it comes to  anything that matters to the people that I represent: $33.5 trillion in  debt, $2 trillion a year in deficit spending, and my colleagues'  objective other side of the aisle, and frankly, a decent number of my  own colleagues on this side of the aisle, are completely missing in  action when it comes to figuring out how to stop spending money we  don't have.   When it comes to open borders, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle not only won't sit down and figure out solutions, they are  actively working to thwart any possible path to doing what we need to  do to secure the border of the United States.   The American people, particularly the Texans that I represent, are  looking with abject horror on the utter and complete failure that is  this body and the Senate and the White House's response to wide open  borders and in fact, their active engagement in creating the  environment where our borders can be exploited.   Again, just to be very specific, the American people that I talk to  and my constituents that I represent, they want us to stop spending  money we don't have and to stop racking up debt. My colleagues on the  other side of the aisle refuse to do anything about it.   The constituents I represent, the American people I talk to, want us  to secure the border of the United States and stop the endless  streaming of fentanyl into our communities, the empowerment of cartels,  the empowerment of China, the destruction, the murder, the mayhem, the  deaths of migrants, the deaths of our own citizens all from wide open  borders that are directly contrary to law. The American people want us  to stop it.   My Democratic colleagues refuse, and in fact, are all too happy to  participate in the human smuggling chain that is decimating Americans  and migrants. That is the truth. It is generally, observably speaking,  an undeniable truth.   My Democratic colleagues will not respond to the constituents that I  represent or the American people I talk to who are asking for our  military to focus on its core mission rather than be turned into a  social engineering experiment in a uniform.   The American people don't want that. They don't want to destroy the  culture of the military. They don't want to undermine the ability of  the military to perform. They don't want recruiting to be in the  basement.   They want their military to be very good at killing people and  destroying things when called into action to do so. They want it to be  used sparingly.   They don't want to be involved in endless wars. They don't want us to  be engaged in foreign entanglements, to use the wording of President  Washington, endlessly. They want us to stop that.   My Democratic colleagues have no interest in ensuring that our  national defense, that our military is focused on its mission rather  than on funding transgender surgeries, funding offices of so-called  diversity, equity, and inclusion and chief diversity officers and all  the things that divide us up by race, that divide us up instead of  making us unified.   All of the things that the people that I represent, all of those  things: the weaponization of government against the people, concerns  about an FBI targeting parents, concerns about an FBI that is  politicized, an ATF that wants to undermine your ability to defend  yourself in your communities even while my Democratic colleagues refuse  to stand by law enforcement and ensure that our communities are safe.   Even as I saw San Antonio police officers again last week shot on our  streets with a Democrat district attorney, a Soros-funded district  attorney, utterly incapable and refusing to do his job to ensure those  criminals are locked up behind bars. Instead, they are out on the  streets shooting our police officers.   Everybody in this country knows the state of affairs. The communities  are not safe because we allow criminals to roam them.   They know that our border and our country is not safe because people  affiliated with terrorist organizations and gangs and cartels are  coming across our border.   They know that fentanyl is streaming into our communities. They know  that the Chinese are exploiting our border, working with cartels to do  it.   They know that we are catching people from Iran, from Lebanon, from  Indonesia, from places all over the world at our border, people  affiliated with dangerous organizations in Colombia and South America.  They also know that there are hundreds of thousands, millions who are  got-aways that get into our country.    Again, I want to say this because it is really important--that our  Democratic colleagues refuse to work with us on any of those issues,  period. Full stop.   I am happy to engage in any debate with any of my Democratic  colleagues any time on any of these issues and have them bring forward  any meaningful policies that will make a difference on any of those  things.   Now, why is that important? Why is it important to make very clear to  the American people that my Democratic colleagues have no interest in  working with us on any of the issues that deal with debt, deficit  spending, open borders, a military that is not focused on its mission,  crime on our streets, cutting spending to stop inflation so the  American people are no longer suffering, why is it important to make  that crystal clear?   The American people are wondering why Washington is broken, and I  will tell you. It has been decades of rot, decades of institutional  powers that are making decisions in this town, and they don't like it  if you change it. They don't like it if you are fighting back.   That matters in the context of the debate over the Speaker of the  House. The 221 Republicans in the House of Representatives, a thin  majority, are having a full and open debate in front of the American  people about the future of this country.   I have strong disagreements with a number of my colleagues in the  Republican Party, but the debate that is going on in the Republican  Party is the debate that is going on across this country, but it is a  debate being fully ignored by my Democratic colleagues. They are not a  part of it.   I listened to the minority leader speak from the rostrum before the  newly elected Speaker of the House spoke yesterday.   I heard Minority Leader Jeffries talking about all of the things the  Democrats have done to save this country this year: how it was  Democrats who stepped in, in his words, at the brink of a so-called  default in June. It was Democrats who stepped in at the brink of a so- called shutdown in November. It was Democrats who stepped in in the  Speaker's race, by the way.   Keep in mind that my Democratic colleagues when they say they are  saving things, they are driving the train for $4 trillion of increased  national debt in a continuing resolution to keep this government going  at a $2 trillion deficit.   That is what my Democratic colleagues are championing as saving this  country. Somebody explain that to me. Somebody explain to me how that  is what the American people sent us here to do.   For my Republican colleagues, what are we going to do to change it?  Eight of my colleagues vacated the Chair.   What that means is they called the question on the Speaker of the  House. Lots of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and many  Republicans across the country, stood in violent disagreement with  those eight.   I didn't vote alongside those eight at that moment. I thought we  should try to finish it out for another month or 2 under the structures  we had put in place in January to change this institution, to put more  conservatives on the Appropriations Committee, to put more  conservatives on the Rules Committee, to have more engagement, all of  which led to very good legislation.   The strongest border security bill we have ever passed in H.R. 2, the  strongest national defense authorization bill that we have ever passed  that would repurpose and refocus the military on its mission rather  than being woke and engaged in social engineering, a strong Limit,  Save, Grow bill that would have modestly increased the debt while  [[Page H5159]]  transforming spending in this town, we did that.   We passed four appropriations bills. In a town that never passes  appropriations bills any longer, we did that.   Those eight stood up for a reason, and they should be proud that they  stood up for that reason because those eight stood up for change.   You see, the status quo in this town is going to destroy this  country. The status quo continuing to do the same thing we have done  over and over and over again is going to change this country and  destroy it.   I have a 14-year-old son. I have a 12-year-old daughter. I know my  friend from Tennessee behind me and my friend from Arizona in the  Chair, proud fathers, family men, a veteran, we want to save this  country for our kids and our grandkids.   My question for my colleagues on this side of the aisle as we elect a  new Speaker--and we have 220 united behind that Speaker--is: Are you  going to unite behind that Speaker to change this town and change this  country; yes or no?   Now is the time. I am tired of all the empty rhetoric about unity. I  am tired of all the empty rhetoric about what we need to do and that  whatever the majority of this conference says, goes.   No. I didn't swear an allegiance to the Republican Party. I didn't  swear an allegiance to a majority of my Republican colleagues.   I took an oath to the Constitution of the United States under God in  representing the people who sent me here to represent them. Nothing  more.   I have for my entire life--I am 51 years old--been watching a  majority of this body and often a majority of this Republican  Conference destroy this country day in, day out.   A genuine question I ask of my colleagues to which I don't get much  of a response, do you believe that the majority of the Republican House  of Representatives, the Republican Conference, has done a good job over  the last half century, in my 51 years?   The majority of Republicans, have we stood up to cut spending, or  have we instead increased spending and increased debt?   Everyone knows the answer to that question. Have we increased the  size and scope of the Federal Government, or have we decreased it?  Everybody knows the answer to that question.   Have we as Republicans, the majority, making decisions and selecting  the Speaker and doing the same thing over and over and over again, have  we led to open borders and an unsecure border, or have we created a  secure and sovereign border?                                time  1730    Have we sided with the Chamber of Commerce and cheap labor and all  the lobbyists in town, or have we stood with the people to say that the  border should be secure so that we are safe and, importantly, that the  rule of law is being enforced?   Everybody knows the answer to that question.   Have we engaged constantly in putting ourselves in foreign  entanglements endlessly without clear mission and without clear ends,  or have we had a very specific and concrete mission that we use our  military discretely, powerfully, limitedly, and come home?   I think everybody who has eyes can see the answer to that question.  The number of our own Members who are missing an eye, wearing a patch,  a man without legs, a man without an arm--battle scars from generations  of endless conflict as long as I have been alive.   Are we a country that believes that we are supposed to declare war  and have a Congress that stands behind that and gets in and out, or do  we believe we should have endless conflict?   Again I ask--a majority of Republicans have put those policies  forward: more debt, open borders, a military that has lost its way, its  focus, and engaged in endless conflict, expanded the Federal Government  at exponential levels. Just today, trying to be a team player--many of  us who strongly oppose continued funding of programs and agencies that  we don't support because they are vastly out of their constitutional  role, the Department of Energy and all sorts of programs--we voted for  a bill to try to move the ball forward as a team, trying to cut  spending and get appropriations bills so we can change this town. We  were met with abject resistance from this side of the Conference  saying, no, we are not going to keep cutting spending. We are going to  oppose your amendments cutting programs and spending. We are not going  to do the work that we said we would do to balance the budget, limit  the size and scope of government. We meet resistance every day within  our own party.   So how, pray tell, can we save this country if half of the body has  no interest in being sovereign, no interest in having a secure border,  no interest in cutting spending, no interest in having a defense that  is mission-focused instead of being woke and socially engineered?   Half of the body is only slightly less. How can we do that?   I will tell you the answer. The answer is that some of us are going  to continue to force change in this town. When this Congress began  there was a debate about the Speaker. We forced change through rules.  We demanded that we get to read the bills. We demanded that we would  have more representation on the committees. We demanded that there  would be single-subject legislation. We demanded that we would get  appropriations bills done.   Only four times in my lifetime, in 50 years, have we passed all 12  appropriations bills, rather than letting deals get cut in smoke-filled  rooms. It worked for a while and we made this place better. But, as  usual, the powers that be circled, and so more change is needed.   Now we have a new Speaker, and the question before us is what we will  do with that. I believe we have to be very clear. I believe we need to  tell the administration, Senate Democrats, House Democrats, Senate  Republicans, and indeed some in our own Conference, we need to tell  them very clearly that it is a new day and that it is time for the  American people to be represented. It is time for this town to no  longer roll over the American people for their own special interests or  just sheer laziness.   Specifically, House Republicans must stand to thwart the Biden  administration and Senate Democrats with the help of Senate  Republicans' objective to force through a massive supplemental bill for  funding for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and allegedly the border, of some  hundred billion dollars or any other number.   Instead, House Republicans should send over a standalone Israel bill  fully paid for. There is a novel concept--fully paying for something.  Under no circumstances should the House Republican Conference allow  legislation to get to the floor of this House that is not paid for and  that is not focused entirely on Israel with respect to this package.   We should stand by Israel; it is in our interest. But it is not in  our interest or, frankly, Israel's, for us to continue to borrow money  we don't have to fund it. We should pay for it.   The second thing we should do is continue to move appropriations  bills, but not for the sake of it. With all due respect to some of my  colleagues who think it is an end unto itself to move appropriations  bills, it is not. We must move appropriations bills that are  responsible, that pull back on the abuses of this administration and,  importantly, reduce spending. We are not there yet. We have more to do.   Thirdly, when it comes to November 17, this House Republican  Conference must not blink. The fact that funding expires in 3 weeks  means we should get our job done to get appropriations bills passed and  any stopgap spending measure should be short and focused on forcing the  Senate and the White House to come to the table and cut spending.   It cannot be that we are going to continue to do what we have always  done, which is to kick the can down the road, spend money we don't  have, rack up debt, and do the same old thing we have always done.   Fourth, this is probably the most important thing that needs to be  said. I don't care who is in charge. I don't care who the Speaker is. I  don't care what this Republican Conference puts out or doesn't put out.  We have an obligation as Republicans, who campaign on securing the  border, who go on TV and do interviews, and go to our constituents and  do mailers and do fundraisers talking about securing the border, to  fully and completely secure the border.  [[Page H5160]]    Under no circumstances should we allow a single dollar to even be  considered for Ukraine, if at all, and certainly not without having  done our job to secure the border, which means--let me be very clear  for everyone in the Senate and all of my House colleagues, Democrat or  Republican--a secure border starts with H.R. 2 and every component in  it. I don't want to hear all of your excuses about what the Senate will  take or not take. Otherwise, take your Ukraine funding and shove it.    I am sick and tired of this place doing the same old thing. Again, it  does not matter who is in the chair. It does not matter who is in the  Senate. It does not matter who is in the White House. We have an  obligation as Members of this body to do our job.   As I said before, we are a massively divided country and a massively  divided House of Representatives representing that divided country.  There are people in this country who are suffering as a result. There  are people in Texas who are taking it on the chin with tens of  thousands of people pouring into our communities, hospital getting  overrun, schools getting overrun, police losing their lives and getting  overrun, cartels empowered, and fentanyl pouring into our communities.  I am sick and tired of it.   I am glad that some of my colleagues have finally awakened in New  York and elsewhere because, oh, you got 100,000 people suddenly. Guess  what, we have had millions pouring through Texas. My friend from  Arizona in the chair has had millions pouring through Arizona.   All we do is give lip service to it. We talk about securing the  border. All of my colleagues are running around saying: Chip, come to  me, tell me, what do you think the Democrats will actually take? That  is what is wrong with this place. It is not about what they will take,  it is about doing the right thing.   I know the people that I represent, I know the people that my friend  from Tennessee represents, I know that the people that my friend from  Arizona represents are sick and tired of words. Yet, all we really  have, as Members of Congress, are words and our vote.   We use our vote the best way we know how to shape the direction of  this country. Sometimes that is not easy. Sometimes you do have to  compromise to figure out how to make it work in a legislative body.  That is fine.   But the words we use matter. When the Speaker of the House, my friend    Mike Johnson, took the oath yesterday and then spoke to the American  people from the rostrum, he spoke very eloquently about our motto ``In  God We Trust.'' He spoke very eloquently about our constitutional  principles and about what it means to be an American, about our  founding.   We have an obligation as Members of this body to fight for the  American people who send us here. There are 330 million Americans who  rely upon the 435 of us to fight for them, to fight to defend and  uphold all of the values that are represented by the flag hanging  behind my friend from Arizona.   Whenever we come to the floor and whenever we give speeches--by the  way, I am happy to yield to my friend from Tennessee if he would like  any time--whenever we come to the floor and give speeches to an empty  Chamber, you ask: What is the point?   The point is actually to try to highlight that we are supposed to use  this Chamber to debate and be deliberative. We set out to change this  place almost a year ago and we have made some pretty good strides, but  we are far from it.   I would ask my friend from Tennessee and I would ask my friend who is  in the chair: What are the great debates we have seen on the floor of  the House? Where are the great engagements we have seen? Or is it  rather that all we see are the rote procedures of coming down and  standing at the mike and offering an amendment for 3 minutes and then 3  minutes and then back and then back and it is all set up, and the votes  are all set up, and then we are done--or are we actually debating the  future of the country?   That is what is at stake. We can talk about debt commissions, we can  talk about whatever things that we might do in the future one day, but  the country is hurting while we are sitting here in this Chamber not  getting it done.   My main hope with having a new Speaker, my friend   Mike Johnson, who  is a man of faith, a family man, a father of five who gave a moving  accounting of the loss of his father right before he became an elected  representative--my hope is that the hand of God is at play with the  current makeup of the leaders of this country in this body to have the  courage to stand up and follow where the Lord is opening the door for  us to go, if we will have the will to do it.                                time  1745    I don't pretend to have all the right answers or know every right  play or move on a spending bill or a piece of legislation. What I do  know is that we cannot continue to do what we have been doing. What I  do know is that if we have any single responsibility as Members of  Congress, it is to follow the Constitution of the United States, defend  the rule of law, and secure the blessings of liberty as we are called  upon to do in the Constitution of the United States.   We cannot do that if we continue the lie that we can print money and  spend money we don't have to create programs that cannot be funded to  drive up the cost of healthcare, to drive up the cost of housing, to  drive up the cost of energy, to utterly fail to do our actual  responsibilities to secure the Nation and to secure our communities.  Those are the things that failed states do, and we are dangerously  close to the cliff.   The question becomes whether Republicans are going to do what they  said they will do. I, for one, am ready to be here all day, every day,  until we get this right. I think I have seen my wife, son, and daughter  maybe 5 or 6 days over the last 45 days. We have an obligation to do  our job.   I have to say something to my colleagues, a couple of whom left  today. They had some medical reasons, and that is all fine. But if I  hear another one of my colleagues talk about needing to be home for  Halloween, if I hear another one of my colleagues talking about, ``I  need to fly out so I can get home to a fundraiser,'' or another one of  my colleagues talking about needing to make it home, ``Oh, I have to  see my newborn,'' all right, what do you think our men and women in  uniform want to do when they are deployed for a year?   If you run for Congress, mean it. If you run for Congress, come up  here and be willing to work. I am sick and tired of my friends and  colleagues who run around campaigning on doing the hard work of  shrinking the government, cutting spending, securing the border, making  our defense strong, and then abandoning duty, walking out.   Fly in on Monday, fly out on Thursday at noon. What in the hell is  that?   We should come in next week, after Speaker Johnson has been able to  get his office set up, and when we are in here next Wednesday, we  should not leave. We should stay here. We should pass the  appropriations bills. We should pass responsible legislation to support  our friend Israel, but pay for it. We should pass legislation, if  necessary, as a cut stopgap measure to deal with the appropriations  process, but we shouldn't leave town.   I cannot go home to the constituents I represent and look them in the  eye and say we did our job when I have to meet another mother who lost  her son or daughter to fentanyl, another spouse of a Border Patrol  agent who lost their husband or wife in the line of duty, or the spouse  of a police officer lost in the line of duty because we failed to do  our job.   The American people expect us to do ours. All of this drama about the  Speaker is utter nonsense, a footnote in history. All that matters is  what we do as a body. For the 220 Republicans who united around Speaker  Johnson and voted for him yesterday, that is only as good as uniting to  actually carry out conservative policies that the American people sent  you here to carry out. That is it. Otherwise, it is all a show.   Today, we did the opposite. We funded programs we campaign against.  We spent more money that we don't have.   My question for my Republican colleagues is, are we going to do what  we said we were going to do? It is a pretty simple question, and I hope  my colleagues will go back and look at what they campaign on and then  actually do it.   One final point I think merits observation. We have conflicts in  Israel. Around this country, we have protests  [[Page H5161]]  by a generation of Americans who don't have the first clue of what  actual sacrifice looks like, don't have the first clue of what they are  talking about with respect to what was wrought on the Israeli people by  the barbaric acts of Hamas.   In this country, we are enormously blessed, but we have foolishly  funded an education system that allows for individuals to spend their  time advancing radical, hateful, anti-Semitic, uninformed, ignorant  nonsense in the name of free speech.   Our friends in Israel were attacked violently and barbarically. The  vast majority of Americans recognize that and proudly stand alongside  Israel, but we have a problem in this country when there are people  taking to the streets in support of a violent, terroristic  organization, Hamas, in the false name of apartheid, in the false name  of the supposed need for a two-state solution.   The fact of the matter is, our friends in Israel, Israelis, our  Jewish friends, have been on that land for millennia. I will not blink  in standing alongside Israel. It is in our national security interest  to do so. It is also the right thing to do.   However, if my colleagues think that we are going to save this  country through sheer force without recognizing the cultural rot eating  away at our own children, whether it is through electronic devices or  our own education system, then they are mistaken. We cannot continue to  fund the destruction of our own country, yet that is what we do every  single time we vote to perpetuate a broken education system and to fund  the very programs that are funding the very rot that is destroying us  from within.   Some of our greatest leaders have observed that we will not be  defeated by a foreign enemy, but we will be defeated from within. Our  great calling, in my opinion, as Members of Congress today, this  generation of leaders, is to stand up in defense of our core values,  proudly in defense of our Western civilization values, of our belief in  God, our Constitution, our belief in limited government, our belief in  the rule of law, and not shudder, not walk away in fear, but to proudly  stand up in defense of that and to stop perpetuating the very cultural  rot that undermines it. It is the only way that we will save this last  great hope for mankind.   I am endlessly optimistic for the future of the country because of  the people who love to live free, the Riley Gaineses of the world who  dare to say no, the Scott Smiths of the world who dare to say no, the  Chloe Coles of the world who dare to say no, the Mark Houcks of the  world who dare to say no.   The strength of this country is with the American people. It always  has been and always will be. Our calling is to make sure that this  government, that this government that represents them, empowers them  and protects their liberties and nothing more. That is our calling.   That is what I believe that our Speaker, Speaker   Mike Johnson, will  enable us to do because I know he believes in those principles, but the  only way that   Mike Johnson can be successful as Speaker is if 221  Republicans rally around him in defense of the Constitution of the  United States and the rule of law and actually do what they campaigned  on doing rather than coming here and doing the same old thing,  advancing the status quo and everything in this town that has been  destroying our country from within for as long as I have been alive.   It is time for Republicans to stand up. It is time for Republicans to  actually defend the Constitution of the United States. It is time for  Republicans to cut spending. It is time for Republicans to secure the  border. It is time for Republicans to stand up in defense of our  military. It is time for Republicans to do their damn job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 57 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  October 30, 2023, at noon.                            ____________________
