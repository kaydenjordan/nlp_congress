 Madam Speaker, fresh water is life. I rise today to  applaud House passage of the 2022 Water Resources Development Act.   As chair of the House Subcommittee on Appropriations Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies, one of my top priorities is advancing  solutions and funding to meet the critical, new, freshwater challenges  to every State and community in America.   To grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and protect and  conserve our precious environmental resources, we must invest in  freshwater systems and in our ports, harbors, and waterways. We must  strengthen communities and ensure Federal agencies, like the Army Corps  of Engineers, are prepared for the challenges of today and tomorrow.   As a representative of the agricultural and industrial heartland of  America, our Great Lakes region is home to those who make, build, and  grow America. The water resources bill will unleash their full  potential, meeting new challenges to our ecosystem.   I look forward to working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and  our local partners to deliver progress for the American people in every  nook and cranny of our beloved homeland.                            ____________________
