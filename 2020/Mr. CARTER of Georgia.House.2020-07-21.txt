 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a champion.   Ira Katz, a registered pharmacist and owner of Little Five Points  Pharmacy, was recognized as Champion for Opioid Safety by the Georgia  Pharmacy Association. He received this title after completing a series  of educational programming aimed at reducing opioid-related overdoses.   Everything began when he was connected to a local needle exchange  operation and was made aware of the need to provide opioid education  and Naloxone, or Narcan, to whoever needed it. Naloxone is a drug that  reverses opioid overdoses.   According to the CDC, overdoses involving opioids killed nearly  47,000 people in 2018, and 32 percent of those deaths involved  prescription opioids. That number is far too high, which is why we  desperately need people like Ira Katz fighting on the front lines to  save countless lives for a more positive future.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I understand  the importance of fighting the opioid epidemic and serving one's  community with the utmost integrity.   I applaud Ira Katz for his 39 years of hard work to serve the people  of the Atlanta community, and I wish him all the best in the years to  come.                            ____________________
