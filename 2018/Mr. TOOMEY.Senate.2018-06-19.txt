 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my constituents  at the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce on their 150th anniversary  and highlight their contributions to making the greater Scranton region  a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family.   Established in 1867 as the Scranton Board of Trade, the Greater  Scranton Chamber of Commerce is the largest business network in  northeastern Pennsylvania, with more than 1,500 member companies  representing a variety of employers. The chamber is also the parent  organization to a number of affiliates that support economic  development, provide small business lending services, facilitate  leadership development programs, and guide workforce development  initiatives. From Scranton's early days as a hub for American heavy  industry, the chamber has actively served the region for more than 150  years, always with the mission of attracting, sustaining and growing  jobs in the area.   Since its inception, the chamber has been recognized as one of the  region's preeminent business and community advocates. It has worked in  partnership with numerous stakeholders to address the challenges  brought on by an ever-changing regional economy. For their part, as the  region transformed over the last century, so too has the chamber. Since  1923, the chamber has evolved and developed a number of affiliates  whose missions are to address and respond to the changing regional  dynamics through economic, industrial, workforce, and community  development. These affiliates have worked to diversify the region's  economy and utilize the tools and resources available to them to meet  the needs of the community and its business members.   Today, new industries now call northeast Pennsylvania home and have  helped the area become a regional leader in fields such as education,  medicine, and manufacturing. Most notably, what drives the region today  is building upon the greater Scranton area's rich history of industrial  and economic prosperity. These are key points the chamber and its  partners have seized on to promote the region as an ideal location for  businesses of all sizes and specialties. With a history of success and  an abundance of talent and expertise, the greater Scranton area is well  positioned to attract entrepreneurs and businesses alike.   I wish to recognize the significant contributions that the Greater  Scranton Chamber of Commerce and its members have made to the city of  Scranton and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania over the last 150 years  and wish them all the best as the chamber celebrates this  sesquicentennial anniversary.                            ____________________
