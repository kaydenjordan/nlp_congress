 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Music Modernization Act. I am  proud to partner with Chairman Goodlatte on this comprehensive bill  intended to resolve some longstanding inequities and inefficiencies in  the music marketplace. We have achieved consensus on this bill, which  passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a remarkable vote of 32-0.   The package includes the original Music Modernization Act, H.R. 4706,  introduced by Mr. Collins and Mr. Jeffries, which significantly reforms  the process for licensing mechanical reproduction royalties under  section 115 of the Copyright Act. It also includes a number of  provisions to ensure that songwriters and other music creators receive  fair market value for their work.   The package includes the CLASSICS Act, H.R. 3301, introduced by  Chairman  [[Page H3537]]  Issa and me, to resolve the dispute over payment to legacy artists for  pre-1972 works played on digital radio platforms.   For too long, many of our Nation's great cultural icons have been  unfairly denied compensation. That is why this measure is supported by  the NAACP and more than 300 major artists.   The bill includes the AMP Act, H.R. 831, introduced by Mr. Crowley  and Mr. Rooney, to simplify the payment of royalties to producers,  mixers, and engineers, recognizing in Federal copyright their important  contributions to the creation of music.   Several of these measures were included in the Fair Play Fair Pay  Act, H.R. 1836, a bipartisan bill I introduced with Representative  Marsha Blackburn, Chairman Issa, and Mr. Deutch, to create a uniform  system for sound recordings. They, along with Mr. Collins and Mr.  Jeffries, deserve a tremendous amount of credit for getting us to this  point.   We are at a unique moment in time where virtually all the industry  stakeholders have come together in support of a common music policy  agenda. The bill is supported by a broad coalition that includes  songwriters and artists, publishers and labels, and internet and  digital media companies such as Pandora, Spotify, Google, and Amazon.   I want to thank the members of my staff who worked for years to  resolve some very complex and sensitive issues to move this legislation  forward: Lisette Morton, Jason Everett, and David Greengrass. This is  an historic opportunity to accomplish a great deal that hasn't been  done in decades.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Music  Modernization Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic lead sponsor of the original Music  Modernization Act.
