 Madam President, I am pleased to begin the Senate debate  on the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill for Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Our bill has been included  in the appropriations package now before this Chamber.   Let me begin my remarks this morning by thanking Chairman Shelby and  Vice Chairman Leahy for their leadership in advancing these  appropriations bills in record time. It is great to see the Senate  getting back to regular order in moving the appropriations bills across  the Senate floor, allowing for robust debate and amendment, and then  bringing those bills to conference with our House counterparts. That is  the way the system should work, as opposed to all of these bills being  bundled together in an enormous, many thousand-page omnibus  appropriations bill. I am very pleased to see the progress that we are  making.   I also want to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of my friend  and colleague Senator Jack Reed, who serves as the ranking member of  the T-HUD Subcommittee. I have worked very closely with Senator Reed in  drafting this bill. We have also received input from more than 70  Senators, with in excess of 800 requests, each of which we very  carefully evaluated. So I can assure this Chamber that this legislation  is truly bipartisan.   The T-HUD bill provides $71.4 billion for our Nation's critical  infrastructure and housing programs. This bill continues the  significant infrastructure investments provided in fiscal year 2018 for  our Nation's highways, bridges, airports, transit, and rail networks.  As a result, communities across this country will be able to improve  their transportation infrastructure to enable more efficient and safer  movement of people and goods. Improving our infrastructure is essential  for our continued economic growth as well as for personal mobility.   The fiscal year 2019 T-HUD bill continues the increases for  infrastructure programs resulting from the 2-year budget agreement that  was reached by Congress and the administration. I would note, however,  that the budget agreement does not provide for the long-term funding  structure necessary for our Nation's transportation infrastructure. I  want to strongly encourage the administration to work with the  authorizing committees to provide that long-term, sustainable funding  for transportation before the FAST Act expires at the end of fiscal  year 2020.   Our bill provides $1 billion for BUILD grants, previously known as  the popular TIGER grants program. These grants have supported not only  much needed infrastructure projects but also jobs and economic growth  in each and every one of our home States. I want to provide my  colleagues with an indication of just how popular this program is and  how strong the demand is.   In the 2017 round of TIGER grant applications, the Department of  Transportation received 452 applications requesting more than $6  billion, well above the $500 million provided last year, which could  fund only 41 projects. You can see that the demand far exceeds the  amount of funding. So we are taking action in this bill to double the  funding for BUILD grants. That will help many more projects become a  reality. I have seen in my own State the investments in bridges, ports,  and transportation projects that have made such a difference.  [[Page S5232]]    I would now like to turn to the aviation provisions in our bill. We  provide $17.7 billion in budgetary resources for the Federal Aviation  Administration, or the FAA, which fully funds air traffic control  personnel, including more than 14,000 air traffic controllers and more  than 25,000 engineers, maintenance technicians, safety inspectors, and  operational support personnel. The bill also provides $1 billion for  the FAA Next Generation Air Transportation Systems Program, also known  as NextGen, and $168 million for the popular Contract Towers Program.  The NextGen Program is so important to the modernization of our air  traffic control system, and we have consistently funded that program,  and it is being implemented in a way that is going to make a real  difference.   Consistent with the FAST Act, $46 billion is made available for the  Federal-Aid Highway Program from the highway trust fund. In addition,  the bill provides $3.3 billion from the general fund for our Nation's  highways, of which $800 million is for bridge replacement and  rehabilitation in rural areas of our country.   The American Society of Civil Engineers conducts a comprehensive  assessment of our Nation's infrastructure every 4 years. Its most  recent report card from 2017 shows that America's infrastructure  remains poor and in desperate need of investment. In fact, the  engineers award a grade of only D-plus for our Nation's infrastructure.   To give you some statistics to emphasize why we are receiving such a  low grade, let me talk about our Nation's bridges. One in nine of our  Nation's bridges is rated as structurally deficient, and the average  age of our country's more than 600,000 bridges is 42 years old. Our  national highway system contains infrastructure that is now well past  its useful life. Some bridges are more than 100 years old, and many are  unable to accommodate today's traffic volumes.    I was recently in Piscataquis County, where a TIGER Grant Program was  allowing the replacement of some very old rural bridges. The amount of  rust on these bridges and the narrow width made them extraordinarily  dangerous. They were at risk of being posted so that traffic could go  across only in one direction. When you looked up at the trusses, you  could see where trucks loaded with lumber had dented the trusses  because they were far too low. They were built for a different era. It  is important for safety reasons--as we have seen with bridges  collapsing in this country or having to be posted--that we make this  kind of investment.   Our bill also invests in our Nation's rail infrastructure by  providing $2.8 billion for the Federal Railroad Administration. This  includes $1.9 billion to Amtrak for the Northeast Corridor and National  Network, continuing service for all current routes.   In May, our subcommittee held a hearing in response to serious rail  accidents, such as the tragic derailment last December in Washington  State. Our bill continues to fund positive train control implementation  to improve the safety of our trains. In addition, the bill provides  $255 million for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety  Improvement Grants Program and $300 million for the Federal-State  partnership for the State of Good Repair Grants Program. These  investments in rail will help ensure that both passengers and freight  move more safely and efficiently throughout our country.   The State maritime academies play a critical role in training the  next generation of U.S. mariners. Our bill provides $40 million for the  maritime academies as well as an additional $300 million for a special  purpose vessel to be used as a training school ship.   In accordance with MARAD's guidance, the new training ships will go  to replace existing training ships in the order in which these ships  are expected to reach the end of their useful life. That is the only  logical way for us to proceed.   Last year, we appropriated funds to replace the 57-year-old ship used  by the New York State maritime academy, and this year's funding will go  to replace the Massachusetts Maritime Academy's aging vessel. Again, we  are going in the order that the Maritime Administration tells us these  ships will be at the end of their useful life.   It would be great to be able to replace all of the ships at the same  time, but we simply can't afford to do that, and that is where  prioritizing the ships as the agency recommends comes in. Replacing  these ships is, however, important to providing training capacity for  all six of the State maritime academies, including the one that I am  very proud of, the Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine. It will  ensure that cadets receive the training hours they need to graduate on  time and join the workforce.   In the area of housing, our priority is to ensure that our Nation's  most vulnerable families and individuals do not lose the assistance  they are now receiving, which prevents many of them from being at risk  of homelessness. Therefore, the bill provides the necessary funding to  keep pace with the rising costs of housing these families in order to  avoid their becoming homeless. Much of the increased funding covers the  higher costs of rental assistance for the most vulnerable among us,  including our homeless veterans, our youth, our disabled citizens, and  low-income seniors.   Senator Reed and I share a strong commitment to reducing, and someday  ending, homelessness. We have therefore included $2.6 billion for  homeless assistance grants. We have also made critical investments to  reduce homelessness among our veterans, our youth, and survivors of  domestic violence. Specifically, to assist our homeless youth, we have  provided $80 million for grants targeting this underserved population.   I visited a wonderful youth shelter in Lewiston, ME, called New  Beginnings. I was so impressed with the work they were doing with  teenagers, in particular, many of whom had been exiled from their  homes--as much as I hate to say it--or abused or otherwise found  themselves homeless. Because of the safety of this shelter, they were  continuing their schooling, they were learning life skills, and they  were safe. Yet, I will tell you, this is the only shelter in the State  of Maine that is devoted solely to the needs of homeless youth.   There is such a need in this country. There are other shelters that  try to accommodate young people in the State of Maine and are doing  their best, but this is an area where we need to provide more  assistance.   To better support youth who are exiting the foster care system, the  bill includes $20 million for family unification vouchers. That is the  real gap in our system. What happens--and I know that many Members  share my concern--is young people ``age out'' of the foster care  program, and they may have nowhere safe to go.    For our Nation's senior population, many of our seniors receive  section 8 housing, but our bill also includes $678 million for housing  for older Americans. Of this amount, $10 million will provide grants to  nonprofit and State and local entities to do home modifications for  low-income seniors, enabling them to stay in their own homes and to age  in place.   I am very excited about this program because of hearings I have held  in the Senate Aging Committee, which I am privileged to chair. What we  have learned is, oftentimes, upgrading and putting grab bars in a  bathroom, widening door openings, putting sensors on the refrigerator  door--doing modifications like that can allow our seniors to stay where  they want to be, in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own  homes. Not only will these low-cost home modifications enable seniors  to remain in their homes, but they also reduce the need for more costly  nursing homes and other assisted housing options.   For our Nation's homeless veterans, the bill provides $45 million for  the highly successful HUD-VASH Program, including $5 million to serve  our Native American veterans living on Tribal lands. Despite the  administration, once again, proposing to eliminate this effective  program, the subcommittee continues to provide adequate funding.   This program is a real success story. Since we initiated it in 2010,  veterans homelessness has fallen by 46 percent. Let's continue our work  to reach the goal of ending homelessness altogether among our veterans.   Another important issue--and a passion of our ranking member, Senator  Reed, and I--that is addressed by the bill is lead paint in homes,  which is of  [[Page S5233]]  particular concern to families with children under the age of 6. Our  bill provides $260 million to combat lead hazards. These grants will  help communities protect children from the harmful effects of lead  poisoning.   Again, I have seen this in my home State. Lewiston, ME, our second  largest city, has very old housing stock, and it has a great deal of  lead paint. Grants are helping this city deal with this problem, thus  improving the health and safety of pregnant women and young children  and avoiding disability and developmental problems for those young  children.   These grants will help communities across America protect children  from the harmful effects of lead poisoning. While our bill certainly  helps vulnerable families, it also recognizes the challenges facing  local communities. Boosting local communities is critical to job  creation and helping our community neighborhoods thrive and our  families obtain financial security.   The bill supports local development efforts by providing $3.3 billion  through the Community Development Block Grant Program. That is one of  the most popular programs we provide. If you talk to any mayor or town  council, they will tell you how flexible the CDBG Program is and how,  as the mayor in Maine with whom I recently met told me, it helps them  customize the funding to meet the program needs of their communities.  It may be infrastructure. It may be affordable housing. It may be  sprucing up the downtown. It may be supporting local businesses. This  is a great program. It is not a Washington dictated program. It is one  that responds to local needs.   We also provide $1.4 billion for the HOME Program. The CDBG and the  HOME Program support the development of infrastructure projects,  community development, affordable housing, economic development, and  job creation.   I appreciate the opportunity to present this legislation to the  Chamber. As we begin debate on the Transportation-HUD bill, I urge my  colleagues to support the investments in this bill, which will pay  dividends to our communities, our veterans, our children, our low- income families, and our seniors. Our bill was unanimously reported by  the Senate Appropriations Committee. We are certainly open for business  for amendments.   I commend my friend and colleague Senator Reed for his hard work and  for that of our staffs on both sides of the aisle in crafting this  bill.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before the two Senators from Missouri  leave the floor, let me express my personal condolences to them, which  I know are shared by each and every Member of this body. The tragedy in  Missouri is absolutely heartbreaking for the families, for the  community, and for the State, and I want our two colleagues from  Missouri to know that we stand with them during this very difficult  time.             Amendments Nos. 3405 and 3422 to Amendment No. 3399     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc: Heller amendment No. 3405  and Durbin amendment No. 3422. I further ask consent that at 2:15 p.m.  today, there be 5 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form,  and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate  vote in relation to the Heller and Durbin amendments in the order  listed and that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the  amendments prior to the votes.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Durbin and  Senator Wicker's amendment. It would direct the Amtrak inspector  general to update a report from 10 years ago that examined Amtrak's on- time performance. Some Amtrak routes, particularly along Amtrak's  national network, are experiencing frequent delays, which makes train  travel a less dependable option and discourages ridership.   Ten years ago, the IG report found that the delays were the result of  host railroad dispatching practices, track maintenance, speed  restrictions, insufficient track capacity, and, often, external factors  beyond the host railroad's control.   The information that the Amtrak IG will collect in this report will  be used to identify ways to improve coordination between Amtrak and the  freight railroads.   I commend the authors for their amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3405     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on my resolution  supporting the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition  Day. I am pleased to have been joined in sponsoring this resolution by  the senior senator from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, and 22 of our  Senate colleagues.   The Purple Heart's history goes as far back as the founding of our  Nation. General George Washington established what is now known as the  Purple Heart Medal when he issued an order establishing the Military  Badge of Merit on August 7, 1782. General Washington wished for the  award to be used to recognize meritorious action performed by members  of the Continental Army, and it took the form of a purple heart.   The Military Badge of Merit was discontinued after the Revolution and  was not revived until 1932, when the Purple Heart medal was authorized  as its official successor decoration. On February 22, 1932, the 200th  Anniversary of the birth of George Washington, then-Army Chief of Staff  General Douglas MacArthur resurrected the award, and it was re- designated as the Purple Heart. Quite appropriately, this reestablished  Purple Heart Medal exhibits the bust and profile of George Washington.   It is around this time that the Purple Heart became synonymous with  those unfortunate heroes who were killed or wounded in combat. Since  1932, the U.S. Military has awarded more than 1.8 million Purple  Hearts.   Just as the Purple Heart Medal has held a special meaning to its  millions of recipients and their families, it also has special  significance to me and my family. My father, who died earlier this  year, was a proud World War II veteran who was wounded twice during the  Battle of the Bulge. He earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star,  and it was from him that I first learned to honor and respect our  veterans.   Mr. President, the Purple Heart is a reminder that freedom is a gift  purchased at the greatest possible price, and it is for that reason  that I am sponsoring this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of  National Purple Heart Recognition Day. I believe it is vitally  important for all Americans to learn the history of this important  military award, and to understand and honor the sacrifices of the many  men and women in uniform who have earned the Purple Heart. I am  grateful to all of my colleagues who have joined me in supporting this  important resolution.                            ____________________
