 Mr. Speaker, the $3.5 trillion spending plan by the  Democrats is the most expensive single piece of legislation in the  history of this country. If passed, the Democrats will have added $13  trillion in new spending since they took control of the House in 2019.   When combined with annual government funding and the $1.9 trillion  Biden bailout bill, the $3.5 trillion socialist tax and spending plan  would increase yearly government spending by over 73 percent each year  for the next 10 years. To pay for these expensive and ill-advised  policies, we would see the largest tax increase in American history,  with two-thirds of employer tax increases being borne by lower and  middle-income Americans.   This unprecedented spending spree is fueling inflation right now and  hurting low-income and middle-income families the most, the very  populations these policies purport to be helping.   Inflation is a tax on the poor, running at 7 percent on an annualized  [[Page H5165]]  basis since the Biden administration came in, the highest since the  Carter era. Gas prices are up 41 percent. Used car prices are up 41  percent. Fish prices are up 8.5 percent. Steak prices are up 10  percent.   Inflation is hurting the purchasing power of everyday Americans.                            ____________________
