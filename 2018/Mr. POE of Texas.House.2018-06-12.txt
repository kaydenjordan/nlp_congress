 Mr. Speaker, ending the nuclear threat in North  Korea  [[Page H5026]]  is within our reach. The maximum-pressure campaign has demonstrated  some clear successes in pushing North Korea to the negotiating table  and pausing its nuclear and missile tests. This is serious progress,  and if we maintain our focus on disarming Kim Jong-un, we can end this  horrific danger.   President Trump made history as the first United States President to  meet with the leader of North Korea. I applaud President Trump for  prioritizing the North Korean challenge, which has major global  implications beyond just our own security.   The Singapore Summit is the first step toward the complete  denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula. North Korea has pledged  their commitment to work toward this agreement.   President Trump also reached an agreement to complete the recovery of  United States' Korean war dead in the Korean Peninsula. This is,  without a doubt, historic progress.   I urge the White House to stand firm on ``complete, verifiable, and  irreversible'' disarmament of North Korea.   While this progress is promising, we must proceed with caution. This  is not the first time the United States has attempted negotiations with  this tyrannical state.   In the aftermath of these preliminary negotiations, many questions do  remain.   Will China and Russia hold firm on their commitments of applying  sanctions to North Korea? China and Russia have continuously undermined  our efforts against a range of global bad actors.   Will a traditional nuclear deterrence work with North Korea? If North  Korea is able to produce nuclear weapons and use them to hold the world  hostage and blackmail its neighbors, the world will become less safe.   North Korea has played the United States for decades. Those days are  over. President Trump has made this clear to Kim Jong-un.   We cannot afford the same mistakes that were made with the Iranian  nuclear deal to provide relief to a regime that would spread terror and  chaos with whatever money is earned from sanctions relief. No more  billions of American dollars secretly given to a rogue regime in the  darkness of night on an isolated airstrip, like our Government did with  Iran.   We all want to disarm this evil regime, but giving concessions for  the sake of ending the nuclear threat carries its own risk and moral  dilemmas. Ensuring that Kim is able to hold on to power and continue to  enslave his people presents massive problems.   It seems to me that Kim's goal is to remain in power. He does not  want the same fate as Muammar Qadhafi.   There are other issues that need to be resolved. The regime still  possesses a massive chemical, biological, and conventional arsenal that  is capable of mass murder and destruction. The regime still desires to  reunify the Korean Peninsula under its rule. The regime still provides  weapons technology to other bad actors like Iran and Syria. The regime  is still the number one abuser of human rights in the world.   Whatever outcome is achieved in further negotiations, we must not  forget who we are dealing with. The Kim dynasty is historically a  brutal regime that remains a state sponsor of terror. We made the  mistake of removing this label, believing North Korea negotiated in  good faith. As we learned, they lied.   Any agreements must have the most stringent verification safeguards.  We must preserve the presence of United States forces in South Korea  and the South China Sea. International inspectors should have access to  all sites in North Korea, no side deals, no holds barred.   Any indication of weakness by us or our allies will embolden the  regime. Complacency has always been our enemies' best friend.  Expectations for future talks must remain realistic and vigilance  sustained. We still face many challenges ahead.   North Korea must know they have no option but to change its ways. If  we uphold our commitment to a peaceful and free world in steadfast  alliance with our allies, we will overcome whatever challenge North  Korea throws at the world.   The ``Singapore Powwow'' is the beginning of a realization for North  Korea that they must denuclearize and move forward as a peaceful  nation.   I urge the President to be strong, be strong, of good courage, and  bold in dealing with Kim. We are on a path toward an unprecedented  agreement, and the United States must not waver in our demand of  complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization by North Korea.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, the United States made the critical  difference in the war to end all wars, World War I.   The American doughboys turned the tide to victory in favor of the  Allies in 1918, but victory was costly. More Americans gave their lives  in the hellish trench warfare than in the wars of Korea and Vietnam  combined.   Now, 100 years later, Americans will be reminded of the courage and  sacrifice of our doughboys with each letter they write. At the end of  this month, the United States Postal Service will release a new stamp  commemorating the 100th anniversary of American victory in World War I.   The stamp depicts a soldier of the American Expeditionary Force, one  of 4 million young men who answered our Nation's call to ``go over  there.'' As George Cohan wrote: ``They didn't come back till it was  over, over there.''   Mr. Speaker, this stamp serves to honor the millions of doughboys who  fought during the Great War, because the worst casualty of war is to be  forgotten.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
