 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to the rule to consider the Senate amendment to  H.R. 5376, the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. This partisan  legislation is full of new tax hikes, which will negatively impact  Oklahomans throughout my district. Sadly, the legislation will only  worsen inflation and further the Democrats' Green New Deal priorities.  The bill should instead be called the Green New Deal lite.   To make matters worse, the bill will not solve the energy crisis our  Nation is currently facing. It raises the royalty rate for onshore oil  and gas leases, imposes a new per-acre fee to nominate these parcels,  and provides billions for so-called environmental justice initiatives.  The legislation also includes a natural gas tax, which would make it  more expensive to heat homes, cook, and more.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the  rule and oppose this legislation.
