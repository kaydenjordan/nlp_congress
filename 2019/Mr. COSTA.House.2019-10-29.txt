 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H. Res. 296, which  would establish permanent United States recognition and the ongoing  remembrance of the Armenian genocide.   I thank Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, Mr. Smith, and all of  the supporters of this resolution.   In 1915, the Ottoman Empire, as we all know, embarked upon the  systematic deportation and murder of 1.5 million Armenians. These  innocent men, women, and children became the first genocide, as we  know, in the 20th century.   Many of these survivors settled in my district in the San Joaquin  Valley, where they lived and their children have enjoyed the blessings  of liberty and lived the American Dream. This incredible, diverse  valley that I have the honor to represent we sometimes refer to as the  Land of William Saroyan, a noted Armenian author. And Fresno State  University is the only university in the United States that has a  memorial dedicated to the Armenian genocide, a very moving memorial to  their ancestors.   Yet, this brutal atrocity has not received the official recognition  it deserves. So, today, it is proper and fitting that we do so.   This is a moral issue. I call upon my colleagues to join me and more  than 110 cosponsors in supporting this long overdue passage by the  United States House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, the horrors of the Armenian genocide can never, ever,  ever be undone. Yet, by acknowledging the suffering of the victims  through official recognition of the Armenian genocide, we can ensure  that at least future generations will never forget.
