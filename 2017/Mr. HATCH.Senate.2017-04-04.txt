 Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to a fine  public servant and an incredible asset to the U.S. Congress.   Rich Rimkunas has had a career filled with outstanding achievement at  the Congressional Research Service, CSR. After nearly 37 years of  service, Rich will be retiring from CRS on Friday, April 28.   When Rich joined CRS in 1980, he was an analyst working on a broad  array of social policy issues. Initially, he worked on issues like  child nutrition, poverty, Social Security, social services for the  aged, and unemployment insurance. Rich cocreated and coauthored a  widely circulated CRS report on Federal social welfare spending. He was  also a coauthor and contributor to several chapters in the House Ways  and Means Committee print ``Children in Poverty,'' which provided a  detailed look at the incidence and characteristics of child poverty in  the United States.   Rich ultimately became heavily involved in providing research and  analytical support to Congress on many health policy issues, including  analyses of aggregate national health expenditures, the Medicare  hospital prospective payment system, the Medicare Advantage program,  and Medicare catastrophic drug costs. Additionally, he has worked on  numerous issues related to Medicaid. He both directed a team of CRS  analysts as well as contributed his own analysis to the Medicaid  ``Yellow Book,'' a 1988 House Ways and Means Committee print that  provided a comprehensive analysis of the Medicaid program as it existed  at the time. Rich also managed the 1993 update of the ``Yellow Book.''   Rich's analyses have typically involved quantitative research  methodologies, modeling techniques, and the use of complex databases.  Rich has excelled at developing approaches for simulating the effects  of potential changes to Federal benefits and grant allocation formulas.   In addition to the direct impact his research and analytical work has  had on Federal policies, Rich has made equally important contributions  within CRS in managerial roles. During his tenure at CRS, he has served  as section research manager of the methodology section, the research  development section, the research development and income support  section, and the hea1th insurance and financing section. During his  tenure as an SRM, Rich helped manage CRS work on the 1996 welfare  reform law and the 2003 overhaul of Medicare in the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act. Rich helped  manage an interdisciplinary team numbering about 3 dozen CRS analysts  that provided legislative support during the passage of the Affordable  Care Act.   Throughout his career, Rich has served as a role model for the  highest level of CRS service to Congress, upholding the Service's  standards of authoritativeness, objectivity, and confidentiality. He is  known within CRS for his attention to detail, methodological strength,  and creative approaches toward conducting analyses. His input is sought  on a great many research efforts spanning virtually all of the major  domestic social policy issue areas that Congress deals with.   Rich is renowned for his tremendous work ethic and energizing  presence. Those who have worked closely with him appreciate his ability  to keep his sense of humor even during the most stressful times.   In recent years, Rich has served as the deputy assistant director of  CRS's domestic social policy division. In that role, he has mentored  and helped develop many of the division's managers, analysts, and  research assistants. He has also played a central role in reviewing  written work produced by the division, helping to ensure its accuracy,  completeness, and quality. Moreover, in his work as a division manager,  Rich has served on numerous advisory panels that have recommended  organizational practices and policies for CRS, many of which have been  adopted.   Rich's policy expertise has been broadly recognized. He is regularly  sought for his expertise at professional meetings and conferences. He  was nominated to the National Academy of Social Insurance in 2002 and  has served on the steering committee of the National Health Forum. He  has also been recognized with numerous Library of Congress special  achievement awards.   Rich has devoted nearly his entire distinguished professional career  to supporting the work of Congress and to helping build and strengthen  CRS and advance its mission.   We will miss Rich, but we wish him and his family the best of luck  moving forward.  [[Page S2211]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse  of the Executive authority. Before I do, I want to compliment the  distinguished Senator from Alaska for his cogent remarks here today on  the floor. He is one of the great new additions to this body, and he  ought to be listened to. I personally respect him and appreciate the  words he said here today.                               Antiquities Act    Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against the abuse of  Executive authority under the Antiquities Act.   Over the last two decades, past Presidents have exploited the law in  the extreme, using it as a pretext to enact some of the most egregious  land grabs in our Nation's history. My home State of Utah has been hit  especially hard by this Federal overreach. Time and again, Presidents  have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to proclaim massive  monument designations--to lock away millions of acres of public land.   My State has fallen victim to not one but two catastrophic monument  designations. These designations were made unilaterally, without any  input whatever from our congressional delegation or even the local  Utahans whose lives would be directly affected by such decisions.  Rather than advancing the important cause of conservation, these  national monuments have come to symbolize Washington at its worst.   How did we get here? How did a century-old law, which is intended to  give Presidents only limited authority to designate special landmarks,  become a blunt instrument for Executive overreach? In answering this  question, some background is necessary.   In 1906, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which granted the  President limited authority to establish national monuments to protect  areas containing ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric  structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.'' The  Antiquities Act was a well-intentioned response to a serious problem:  the looting and destruction of cultural and archaeological sites.   When applied as intended, the law has been indispensable in  preserving our Nation's rich cultural heritage. But the law has not  always been applied as intended; rather, it has been abused, exploited,  and distorted beyond all recognition. It has been hijacked by past  Presidents not to preserve archaeological features but to satisfy  special interests and to advance a radical political agenda--all at the  expense of States' rights.  [[Page S2339]]    By signing their authority under the Antiquities Act, past Presidents  have seized millions of acres of public land, violating both the spirit  and arguably the letter of the law. We need only look at the history of  the Antiquities Act and its enactment to see how far we have come and  how far we have strayed off course.   As with any law, congressional intent is key. On this point, I would  like to refer to the House Congressional Record dated June 5, 1906.  When asked how much land would be taken off the market in the Western  States by passage of the Antiquities Act, Congressman John Lacey, the  bill's lead sponsor, gave a simple response: ``Not very much.''   The bill provides that it shall be the ``smallest area necessary for  the care and maintenance of the objects to be preserved.'' ``The  smallest area necessary.'' These words are damning in light of recent  monument designations which, far from regulating the smallest area  necessary, have sought to restrict the largest area possible. I wonder  what Congressman Lacey would say today if he could see how his bill has  been manipulated for extreme partisan ends. I wonder what he would say  if he could see how his legislation has been exploited by past  Presidents to lock up entire sections of State land--all without  congressional approval. And I wonder what he would say about the two  most recent monuments designated in Utah: Bears Ears and the Grand  Staircase-Escalante monuments. Together, these two monuments encompass  3.25 million acres--an area roughly the size of the State of  Connecticut. To say that Congressman Lacey and his colleagues would be  disappointed is an understatement.   In passing the Antiquities Act more than 100 years ago, Congress did  not intend to cede undo authority to the executive branch, and they  certainly did not intend for future Presidents to proclaim the massive  land grabs of the recent past. They intended to give Presidents only  limited authority to designate special landmarks, such as the unique  national arch or the site of old cliff dwellings. Yet today, when it  comes to the Antiquities Act, there is a shocking disparity between  what Congress intended and what has actually happened.   As a case in point, look no further than my home State of Utah, where  President Obama's last-minute, lameduck monument designation at Bears  Ears is wreaking havoc on the local population. In the parting shot of  his Presidency, President Obama defied the entire Utah congressional  delegation and the will of his own constituents when he declared the  Bears Ears a national monument. With the stroke of a pen, he locked  away an astonishing 1.35 million acres--a geographic area larger than  the total acreage of all five of Utah's national parks combined.   If that is not enough, consider that Utah's second most recent  national monument, the Grand Staircase-Escalante, spans 1.9 million  acres. That is an area double the size of all of Utah's national parks  combined. When President Clinton proclaimed the Grand Staircase- Escalante a national monument more than 20 years ago, I remember  standing on this very floor and speaking out then, just as I am  speaking out now. My words back then are just as applicable today. I  said:         While the 1906 Antiquities Act may indeed give the       President the literal authority to take this action, it is       quite clear to me that in using this authority, he is       violating the spirit of U.S. environmental laws. Real damage       has been done here. The failure even to consult prior to       making this decision should be considered devastating to       representative democracy.    To this day, the Grand Staircase proclamation remains among the most  flagrant abuses of Presidential power I have ever seen. Without so much  as a ``by your leave'' from Utahans, this unilateral action cut off  access to millions of acres of land, suffocating economic development  and uprooting the lives of thousands of Utahans who relied on the  region's resources for their very survival. And just like Bears Ears,  this designation came with no input from Utah's Governor, the Utah  congressional delegation, or even local communities.   The Grand Staircase monument designation exemplified Executive  overreach of the worst kind. Even Democrats were stunned by this  shocking power grab, and many of them conceded to me privately when I  was then shouting publicly that the President was never meant to set  aside millions of acres through the Antiquities Act.   Even the San Francisco Chronicle--by no means a conservative  newspaper--panned President Clinton's Grand Staircase proclamation. In  1996, the editorial board stated:         The question is whether a decision of such magnitude should       be carried out by Executive order. We think not. This may       well be a worthy idea, but it deserves a fair hearing. It       deserves to go through public deliberations, as slow and       messy as democracy may be, to fully air the concerns.    That was more than 20 years ago. In the intervening period, nothing  has changed. Bears Ears was Grand Staircase all over again. When  President Obama declared the Bears Ears a national monument in the  twilight hours of his Presidency, he ignored the years of work Utah's  congressional delegation had spent fighting to pass legislation to  protect the region via a fair and open process. He ignored the State  legislature and the Governor. He ignored the stakeholders and even  local Utahans who were all working together to find a workable  solution. He ignored the best interest of Utah and cast aside the will  of the people, all in favor of the top-down unilateral approach meant  to satisfy the demands of far-left interest groups. This is Executive  hubris at its worst. It was never supposed to be this way.   Congress, not the President, is solely responsible under the  Constitution for the management of property and land within the Federal  domain. Only through passage of the Antiquities Act can Congress grant  authority to the President to make limited monument designations.  Congress entrusted the executive branch with narrow authority, but the  executive branch has violated that trust time and time again.   For years, I have fought to check the abuse of Executive power under  the Antiquities Act. As far as back as 1997, in the aftermath of the  Grand Staircase proclamation, I introduced legislation requiring an act  of Congress before the President could establish any national monument  of more than 5,000 acres. As early as last year, in anticipation of the  eminent Bears Ears debacle, I wrote a bill prohibiting any further  extension or establishment of national monuments in Utah without  express authorization from Congress.   Most recently, I have been working closely with the Trump  administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous  administrations. Within days of his nomination, I indicated to  Secretary Ryan Zinke that undoing the harm caused by the Bears Ears and  Grand Staircase monument designations was among my top priorities.   In a private meeting in my office, I even told Secretary Zinke that  my support for his nomination would depend largely on his commitment to  this cause. After gaining assurances from Secretary Zinke that he would  work with us in this effort, I was eager to support his confirmation. I  probably would have supported it anyway because he is a fine man. But I  am really pleased that he agreed with me on the injustices that have  occurred in Utah.   Just 2 weeks later, I found myself in the Oval Office where I engaged  President Trump for over an hour on a wide-ranging discussion that  focused specifically on the public lands issue. I have to say that I  was amazed at the President's willingness to help. He listened intently  as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our State who  have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase  monument designations.   I explained the urgency of addressing these devastating measures. I  asked for his help in doing so. I was encouraged that, unlike his  predecessor, President Trump actually took the time to listen and  understand the heavy toll of such overreaching actions. Our President  even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to fix this  disaster. More than any of his predecessors, President Trump  understands what is at stake here.   I was really buoyed up by the conversation with him in the Oval  Office. Indeed, in all my years of public service, I have never seen a  President so committed to reigning in the Federal Government and so  eager to fix the damage done by these overbearing monument  designations. We are fortunate now to have the White House at our side  in the fight for local control.  [[Page S2340]]    There are many areas in this country that merit protection. I welcome  the opportunity to work with my colleagues to further that cause. But  the process to determine how best to protect these areas is equally  important. That is why, for decades now, I have vehemently opposed  unilateral actions to restrict the use of entire landscapes without  even the charade of a public process.   Using the Antiquities Act to protect our public lands, we must set a  new precedent of collaboration and trust between the States and the  Federal Government. I look forward to working with President Trump to  establish this new precedent.   Mr President. I will turn to another matter of pressing importance,  the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court. I have been in a lot of these battles over the years. I  have to say, this one bothers me as much as any battle we have had.   In early January of this year, the Democratic leader issued a warning  to then-President-Elect Donald Trump regarding the President-elect's  anticipated selection of a Supreme Court nominee. Even before President  Trump took the oath of office, the Democratic leader was already  threatening the soon-to-be-President to either pick a ``mainstream and  independent'' nominee or the Democrats would oppose the President- elect's choice ``with everything we have.''   Well, President Trump did exactly what the Democratic leader asked  when he nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Not only is  Judge Gorsuch a mainstream and independent judge, he is easily one of  the finest and most qualified nominees to the High Court that I have  seen in all my 40 years in the Senate. His selection was also the  result of the most transparent Supreme Court nomination process in  American history.   President Trump and Hillary Clinton both made the Supreme Court a  centerpiece of their campaigns and spoke at length about the type of  judge they would appoint to replace Justice Scalia. Candidate Trump  even made the novel pledge to nominate someone from a list of judges  his campaign released to the public. This gave the American people the  opportunity to vet the list and to discuss more generally the proper  role of judges in our system of governance.   When the American people elected Donald Trump to be our next  President, they ratified his list of candidates. When President Trump  subsequently selected Neil Gorsuch from that list to be his nominee, he  kept his promise to the American people. That is who I expected him to  select at that time.   Judge Gorsuch's judicial record on the Tenth Circuit paints a clear  picture of the judge's judicial temperament and philosophy. Of the more  than 2,700 cases Judge Gorsuch has participated in on the Tenth  Circuit, 97 percent of them were decided unanimously. Judge Gorsuch  voted with the majority on that court 99 percent of the time, even  though the majority were Democrats.   In the 1 percent of the cases in which Judge Gorsuch dissented, he  did so with almost the same frequency, whether the majority opinion was  written by a judge nominated by a Republican or a Democrat President.  Additionally, Judge Gorsuch has gained bipartisan support, including  from President Obama's former Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, a man  whom I respect, said that Judge Gorsuch is committed to the rule of law  and the judiciary's independence.   Judge Gorsuch was described by six former Solicitors General  appointed under four different Presidents as, ``highly respected'' and  ``admired by his colleagues appointed by Presidents of both parties and  law clerks of all political stripes.''    The American Bar Association gave Judge Gorsuch its highest rating of  ``well qualified'' to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. I  think we can all agree that this is a far cry from the profile of an  extreme or activist judge. It is a far cry from that. That needs to be  pointed out. I want to know how anyone can, while keeping a straight  face, honestly make the case that Judge Gorsuch is anything but  mainstream.   In reality, quite the opposite is true. Judge Gorsuch is exactly the  kind of judge we need on the Supreme Court. He is an impartial,  thoughtful man with tremendous judicial experience, a person that you  can't help but respect. He has been educated at some of the best  schools in the world and has excelled at every stage of his career.   He has served with character, courage, and integrity for more than a  decade on the Federal bench. It would be hard to even imagine a better,  more suitable choice for the Supreme Court than Judge Gorsuch. After  seeing the judge sit through several grueling days of confirmation  hearings and nearly 20 hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary  Committee, my confidence in Judge Gorsuch has only been solidified.   Despite the Democrat's best efforts before and during the hearings to  distort his record, he demonstrated time and again that his judicial  philosophy is to impartially interpret and apply the law and the  Constitution wherever it might take him.   Now we are about to witness something unprecedented in the history of  our Nation. The partisan minority is going to block a vote on a Supreme  Court nominee. In all of the Senate's 228-year history, that has never  happened before. Three Supreme Court nominees have faced filibusters in  our Nation's history. The first, Abe Fortas, faced a bipartisan  filibuster by Senators of both parties concerned about Fortas's  questionable ethics background.   The second and third, William Rehnquist and Samuel Alito, endured  partisan filibusters by Democrats who disagreed with these nominee's  judicial philosophies. The filibuster against Fortas succeeded, in  part, because Fortas lacked a clear majority support, and, in part,  because he was ethically compromised. The filibusters against Rehnquist  and Alito, by contrast, failed. Rehnquist and Alito both enjoyed clear  majority support and both were confirmed. But that was a different  Senate at the time. There was a lot more open mindedness about the  qualifications of these judges and their right to sit on the bench.   I regret to say that we are likely to add a fourth filibustered  Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Like Justices Rehnquist and Alito,  Judge Gorsuch enjoys clear majority support. Like Justices Rehnquist  and Alito, Judge Gorsuch faces opposition from Senate Democrats who  don't like his judicial philosophy. Why, I will never understand. In  particular, they object that Judge Gorsuch takes the law as he finds  it, rather than trying to bend the law toward liberal social ends.   Unlike Justice Rehnquist and Alito, however, Judge Gorsuch is  apparently not going to clear the 60-vote threshold for cloture. This  is because Senate Democrats, with only a few exceptions, have concluded  that no nominee who does not subscribe to their views of hot-button  social issues should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Court. Never,  never, in the history of this body has the Senate allowed a partisan  minority to defeat a Supreme Court nomination for which there is clear  majority support.   The only successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in our  Nation's history was bipartisan, and it involved an ethically  compromised nominee, Abe Fortas, who resigned from the bench shortly  after his nomination failed rather than face impeachment for serious  conflict-of-interest violations. Those circumstances are not even  remotely comparable to the situation we face today.   The filibuster of Judge Gorsuch, should it go forward, will be  entirely partisan. It will have nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch's  ethics or character, which are above reproach, and it will occur in the  face of clear majority support for the nominee.   Senate Democrats' decision to block Judge Gorsuch should come as no  surprise to anyone who has been following the confirmation wars for  more than the last 5 seconds. My Democratic colleagues will no doubt  shout to the hilltops--some of them. There are some that are standing  up here too. But they will shout to the hilltops that Republicans are  ruining the Senate if we decide to put a stop to their unprecedented  obstruction of this nominee.   They will no doubt cry that the 60-vote threshold for cloture on  Supreme Court nominees is sacrosanct and that by putting an end to  Democrats' unprecedented obstruction, Republicans are somehow  undermining this institution's ideals.  [[Page S2341]]    When the American people hear these claims, when they hear Senate  Democrats argue that Republicans should respond to their unprecedented  obstruction by allowing a nomination with clear majority support to  fail, they should recognize these arguments for what they are:  hypocrisy. The fact is, we are only in this situation, forced to choose  between rewarding Democrat obstructionism and changing the Senate's  rules, because of Democrats and the campaign they have waged against  qualified judicial nominees for the past 30 years.   Every single escalation of the confirmation wars can be laid at the  feet of Democrats. This is a simple truth, and nothing my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle can say can change it. I speak from  experience. I have been here for through all of it. I was here in 1987  when Democrats started the confirmation wars with their disgraceful  treatment of Robert Bork, one of the greatest lawyers in the country  and a person who was supremely qualified to be on the Supreme Court.   I remember vividly the day the late Senator from Massachusetts came  to this floor and smeared Judge Bork as a man would somehow turn back  the clock to darker days in our Nation's past. I have to say, Senate  Democrats twisted Judge Bork's words, misrepresented his record, and in  sum, did their best to turn a good and decent man into some sort of a  monster.   In their scorched-earth campaign against Robert Bork, Senate  Democrats sowed seeds of destruction that are coming now to full  fruition.   Next came Clarence Thomas. My Democratic colleagues learned from  their Bork experience that fabrications and misinterpretations can  bring down even the most qualified nominee, so they set to work on  Judge Thomas. Not satisfied merely with denigrating Judge Thomas's  professional qualifications, they set out to destroy him personally as  well.   I have been in the Senate for 41 years, and never in all my time have  I seen a lower moment than the way the Senate Democrats treated  Clarence Thomas. No baseless allegation, no lurid lie was too low for  my Democratic colleagues' attention. To his great credit, Judge Thomas  endured this slander with dignity and respect and was confirmed by a  slim 52-to-48 margin.   Thankfully, after the Thomas ordeal, we stepped back from the brink.  When Bill Clinton became President and had two Supreme Court vacancies  early in his term, Senate Republicans did not play tit for tat.  Instead, we gave Justices Ginsburg and Breyer fair hearings and  confirmed them overwhelmingly. And how did Senate Democrats pay us back  for our fair treatment of President Clinton's nominees? They  filibustered President George W. Bush's nominees.   I have used the word ``unprecedented'' to describe Democrats'  expected filibuster of Judge Gorsuch. Well, what the Democrats did to  President Bush's judicial nominees was also unprecedented. For the  first time in history, Senate Democrats successfully filibustered 10  court of appeals nominees. These were nominees with majority support in  this body. These were nominees who would have been confirmed had they  gotten an up-or-down vote. I cannot overstate how dramatic a change  this was to Senate norms and procedures. For the first time in history,  Senate Democrats created an effectual 60-vote threshold for judicial  nominees. Remember that Clarence Thomas was confirmed with only 52  votes. Had Senate Democrats filibustered his nomination, it would have  been defeated. But they didn't because partisan filibusters of nominees  with majority support were simply not in the accepted playbook. What  Senate Democrats did during George W. Bush's Presidency changed the  Senate forever.   Next up was Samuel Alito. Like Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Alito  faced a partisan filibuster by Senate Democrats. Like Chief Justice  Rehnquist, he overcame that filibuster. But what is notable about  Justice Alito is he received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation. He  overcame the filibuster because 19 Senate Democrats voted to end debate  on his nomination even though only 4 ultimately voted for confirmation.  Fifteen Senate Democrats chose not to filibuster Justice Alito even  though they opposed his nomination because they recognized that  filibustering a Supreme Court nominee with clear majority support had  no precedent in this body's norms or history.   What happened when Barack Obama became President and Republicans had  an opportunity for payback? Did they filibuster Sonya Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan? Of course not. Indeed, many Republicans voted against  Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, but no Republican tried to prevent  their nominations from coming to a vote. Once again, Senate Democrats  escalated confirmation wars, and Senate Republicans chose not to  reciprocate.   How did Democrats pay us back for our restraint on Justices Sotomayor  and Kagan? They nuked the filibuster for lower court nominees. The  irony of this move is really something. It was the Democrats who, 10  years earlier, for the first time in Senate history, began the practice  of filibustering courts of appeal judges in an effort to stop President  Bush's nominees. When Senate Republicans then had the gall not to roll  over for President Obama once the shoe was on the other foot, Democrats  simply changed the rules back to what they were in practice 10 years  prior. Democrats, that is, raised the effectual confirmation threshold  to 60 votes by instigating filibusters to block Republican nominees and  then lowered it back down to 50 votes to push through Democratic  nominees. They did so after only seven failed cloture votes. The  Republicans, by contrast, endured 20 failed cloture votes during  President Bush's term and never changed the rules.   That brings us to today. Having Borked Judge Bork, smeared Justice  Thomas, instigated the filibuster for lower court nominees when it was  in their interest, filibustered Justice Alito, and then eliminated the  filibuster for lower court nominees when it was in their interest,  Senate Democrats now expect Republicans to drop our hands and allow  them to block Judge Gorsuch--an unquestionably qualified nominee with  broad support from across the legal community and the country as a  whole.   Enough, Mr. President. Enough.   We have let our Democratic colleagues get away with their games for  too long. They were for the filibuster before they were against it  before they were for it. They were the ones who created an effectual  60-vote threshold for judicial nominees. They were the ones who then  undid that threshold to assist their short-term political interests  when they were in power. They are the ones who now, for the first time  in history, are seeking to block a Supreme Court nominee with clear  majority support.    To put the matter bluntly, my Republican colleagues and I are fed up  with these Democratic Party antics. We will no longer be bound by their  games and petty partisanship. We will no longer allow them to dictate  the terms of debate in ways that always advantage their side and always  disadvantage ours.   I regret deeply the point we have arrived at. I am an  institutionalist. I love the Senate and what it represents. I love my  Democratic colleagues, and they know it. I have been very fair to them  through the years, and I continue to be. I value debate, and I honor  bipartisanship. But 30 years ago, my Democratic colleagues sent us down  this path, and they have done nothing in the years since to turn us  from this course. To the contrary, they have only hastened our descent.   If Democrats will filibuster a person like Judge Gorsuch, they will  filibuster anyone--anyone--who holds to the traditional judicial values  Republicans embrace. Neil Gorsuch is as good as they come. If he is not  good enough for Democrats, no one will be.   Democrats demand that Republicans choose a nominee they would choose  if they held the White House, when that has never been the standard for  Supreme Court nominees and defies all logic and common sense. They  demand the power to veto President Trump's choice even though the  Supreme Court was, in all likelihood, the issue that won him the  election. And I believe that. And they demand that Republicans keep the  rules sacrosanct when they have changed the rules and changed the rules  and changed the rules.   I am not happy that we are where we are, but I can say without  reservation  [[Page S2342]]  that we are here because of what Democrats have done over the past 30  years to poison the confirmation process.   I am about to change the rules if necessary to put Neil Gorsuch on  the Supreme Court. I won't be happy about that, but I will do it  because Judge Gorsuch deserves confirmation and because I refuse to  reward Democrats for 30 years of bad faith in blocking, stalling, and  smearing Republican nominees.   Enough, Mr. President. Enough.   I hope my colleagues will come to their senses and realize that we  ought to be working to support people of the quality of Judge Neil  Gorsuch. There will come a time when they are going to have nominees  before this body--I kind of hope that doesn't happen, but I think it is  bound to happen--and when they do, I hope my fellow Republicans won't  treat their nominees the way they are treating ours. It is abominable,  it is abysmal, it is wrong, and I think it is time for everybody in  this country to know that.   Mr. President, I used to try cases in Federal court, in Pittsburgh  and in Utah. I had tremendous respect for Federal court judges. Mainly  the judges in Pittsburgh were all Democrat. The judges in Utah more  often were Democrats, some Republicans. But I have got to say that they  were good judges, and I was very proud to be able to present my cases  in front of them.   All I can say is that in all my years of working on the Judiciary  Committee, trying cases before I came here, having an AB rating, the  highest rating that Martindale-Hubble grants to attorneys for ability  in both Pittsburgh and Utah, I have to say that I am very disturbed by  the arguments made against Judge Gorsuch, and I have to say that I  don't think you can find a better more qualified person to be on the  Supreme Court.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
