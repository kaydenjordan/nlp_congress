 Mr. President, I rise today to call for immediate action  on the Miners Protection Act. Today, as we sit here, 22,600 miners have  received letters. This is a copy of the letter, and I am going to read  it to you. This is a letter they received today letting them know their  healthcare benefits will be terminated at the end of April. This letter  basically says:         The UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan notified you in December 2016--    This is one of multiple letters they received. Can you imagine  getting a 4-month extension? Then by law you have to have 90 days  before they can terminate you. Every time you get an extension, within  30 days you get another letter saying you are going to be terminated.  That is the inhumane treatment our retired miners and mostly widows are  receiving--       that the U.S. Congress had passed the Continuing Health       Benefits for Miners Act, which provided for the transfer of       federal funds to the Plan to cover the health care benefits       you receive through April 30, 2017. The Plan cautioned that       further Congressional action would be necessary in order for       the Plan to provide health care coverage to you after April       30. At this time, Congress has not taken the action needed to       continue your benefits. Unless Congress acts before the end       of April, the 1993 Benefit Plan will not be able to provide       you with the health benefits that you have been receiving       from the 1993 Plan, and those benefits will terminate       effective May 1, 2017. In addition, your Funds' Health       Service Card will no longer be valid.    Can you imagine a 75- or 80-year-old woman--a lady, a widow--who has  lost her husband, probably because of black lung, and all the work he  did for our country and for himself and his family, and she has  received that three times or more now--not knowing what in the world or  why they can't do something that we promised, something that was done  in 1946, where the Krug amendment and the Krug act basically said that  we would take care of our miners so that they would have permanent  healthcare and a pension. It was not done by taxpayers' dollars. It was  done by the coal they mined. For every ton of coal, there would be so  much set aside. Then we had the bankruptcy laws happen in the 1980s,  which basically destroyed a lot of companies for paying into it. Then  we had the crash of 2008, which took it further down.   Now we stand here today, and we have a fix coming out of the AML, the  [[Page S1526]]  abandoned mine lands, coming, again, from coal that was mined to pay  for the miners' pension and benefit plan, and we can't get it done.   I will tell you, if that piece of legislation was allowed to be voted  on tonight, we would have well over 60 votes, bipartisan. My Republican  colleagues and all of our Democrat colleagues here understand the  importance of the working people.   President Trump is speaking about this every time. Last night he  shouted out to miners. I was so pleased. I have not heard that since I  have been here--anyone saying: Thank you for the job you have done. We  are not leaving you behind. You have given to this country the country  we have, the superpower of the world. You have produced the energy  through the toughest of times, and we appreciate that.   I was very, very appreciative to see that type of recognition. I  can't tell you how much more appreciative I would be right now to see  us as a bipartisan group--Democrats and Republicans--standing up for  the working people that we talk about every day and saying: Listen, as  to the pension guarantee act, which basic to the Miners Protection Act,  we are going to pass that. We are going to put this aside. We don't  have to worry about this anymore. We have done it.   That is all we are asking for. Everybody who has joined me in this  journey understands that we are all fighting for the working people,  which is what we were sent here to do, from your wonderful State of  South Carolina to my beautiful State of West Virginia. They depend on  us. The retired miners are walking our halls. Maybe you have seen them.  If not, I am sure they will come by and say hi to you. They are very  appreciative of the consideration we are all giving them. They are  hoping we finally get this done.   I am doing it for them and for their families and what they have done  for our country. The 4-month extension is not even humane. I have said  that. My reason for saying that is that these people can't comprehend  it. I can assure you that, when I go back to my office after I leave  the floor, I will get phone calls: Joe, they are going to take my  healthcare again. What am I going to do?   I keep saying: Ma'am, please, trust us; hold tight.   We could have had this fixed before. We kicked the can down the road  4 months. Now I have been told--and we all seem to accept it--that they  are going to do a permanent healthcare fix. I am appreciative of that.  The bottom line is that we have pensions out there hanging, which is  going to be a bigger albatross around us if we don't something, and we  have a chance to fix it all and put that aside.   I spoke to President Trump, and I am hopeful that he will speak out  on this, and he has spoken out. He has told me that he supports it.   I said: Please, Mr. President, speak to our friends on the other  side--our leadership--and let them know how much you support this, and  let us put this behind us because we can fix it once and for all.   We were told to get a legislative hearing, and we did that. We were  told to go through regular order. We went to the Finance Committee, and  it was passed out--bipartisan, overwhelmingly bipartisan.   I know we have the 60 votes. I was told we have to reintroduce it  again. So here we are. I reintroduced it, and we have bipartisan  support again. We are ready to go.   Why do we put these people through this type of agony? I don't know.  We have so many other challenges, and we have to come together. This is  one we have already agreed we are together on and can't move it.   I know you have always been a dear friend and supportive, and you  know the hard work our people have done, and I appreciate that.  However, it is time to act. It is time to get this done. If we wait  until April, that is exactly when our continuing resolution is coming  up, and, basically, we have no budget to work off of. So we have to do  another extension until we can get something more permanent. They could  get caught up in that CR again. We are going to say: We are sorry; we  couldn't get it done, but we will give you another 2, 3, or 4 months.   I can't go home and continue to tell these wonderful people who have  been so good and so patient that I am sorry, but we just have to wait  another few months.   When is enough enough? When are those few months going to be up and  we do the right thing? I am asking all of you; I am asking all of my  colleagues: Please, this is one time when we can do something and feel  good about it and go home over the weekend and go back to our  constituents and tell them that this one is finished, that we fixed  this.   I am asking for that vote. I would encourage all of my colleagues to  do the same, to speak to the leaderships to make sure that we can move  the miners protection and make sure the miners get the healthcare and  the pension benefits they were guaranteed and they have been promised  and which has been kept until now, and that we are not going to let  them down.   With that, Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank all of my  colleagues for the support we have been receiving. I am asking the  majority leader to please let us have this vote and put it on the  floor. Let's go from there and see what happens. I am willing to do  that.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
