 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans Choice Program  Improvement Act.   This legislation protects access to health care for our Nation's  veterans by maintaining the VA Choice Program and ensuring that funds  already allocated for veterans health care remain dedicated to that  purpose.   Veterans across my district have utilized the program to access  treatment from community healthcare providers. And while they  appreciate the flexibility this program provides, I often hear of a  need to make improvements and remove hurdles that prevent this program  from realizing its full potential.   I am pleased this legislation takes several steps to reduce red tape.  Now, what do I mean by that?   First, we are going to speed up reimbursements to community  providers. We are going to strengthen medical record sharing between  the VA and community providers and reduce out-of-pocket costs for  veterans--all very important steps to improving the VA Choice Program.  These are commonsense, bipartisan improvements.   I want to thank Chairman Roe for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
