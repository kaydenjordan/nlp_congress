 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, my good friend, for  yielding me the time and for those incredibly gracious and generous  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise to support the rule and the underlying  legislation. By the very nature of Rules debates, everything seems to  be partisan because it seems to be sort of shirts and skins as it is on  the rules. The reality is the legislation we are talking about has  actually been requested by both parties. We had both the chairman and  the ranking member in there requesting because they are working  together in a bipartisan way to produce a major piece of legislation  that will direct spending for the United States government in the range  of about $1 trillion between now and September 30.   The important thing to note is that it is a very bipartisan  negotiation between two very skillful legislators, Chairman  Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Nita Lowey. When they bring that  legislation to the floor, as they will next week, it is going to have  some pretty important and pretty major things on it.   We are not only going to adequately fund our military, we are going  to increase that. We are going to give the President some things he has  asked for in terms of supplemental money for defense to upgrade and  improve our military.                                time  0930    We are going to give him some additional things for border security  as well that, again, both parties have agreed on. I think we all want  secure borders. We know there is always some debate about exactly how  or what we should do, but, in this case, we have a bipartisan  agreement.   We will actually give a very substantial increase to the National  Institutes of Health, which, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions)  mentioned, great work is done on behalf of the American people in that  institution. Frankly, it has been Republicans that first doubled that  back in the late 1990s and early 2000s and now have reignited the  biomedical research engine by putting additional resources in there. It  is  [[Page H2949]]  something our friends support, but actually it was Republicans who took  the initiative to achieve.   We will see some really important increases in some education  programs that give some of our less advantaged citizens opportunities  to go: TRIO, GEAR UP. Both prepare individuals for higher education and  then have a chance to exploit the opportunity when it comes.   So that bill will have a lot of good things in it that will be  bipartisan. My good friend from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern)  mentioned--and I think appropriately so--that there is a certain amount  of dysfunction in the appropriations process. Where we probably  disagree is--I have got to tell you, it is not new. Since we passed the  Budget Control Act over 40 years ago in 1974, budgets and  appropriations have been completed on time exactly four times. It  didn't matter who was in charge. So maybe we ought to go back and look  at that defective process that was set in motion by our friends back  when they controlled both Chambers in overwhelming numbers and rethink  how we do this.   I do agree with the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that  it is important to focus on first things first. And while tax reform is  a very important goal that, I think, this Congress will achieve and  while health care is a very important goal, which I certainly hope this  Conference achieves and I think we are working toward, there is no  question the most important thing we do around here is fund the  government every day. We make sure that our military has what it needs  to protect us and that our border control officials have what they need  to make sure they are secure, that we do things like look for cures for  Alzheimer's and cancer at the NIH. To me, that always is the most  important thing it has to do.   So, in this bill and in the bill that will follow next week, we are  actually doing what we should do. We are putting first things first.  Let's make sure these basics are done for the American people, and then  let's get about the important business of changing their Tax Code and  making sure that they have the best health care in the world.   In my view, Congress could have--and to my friend's point--could have  and should have done this months ago. It is important to note that the  Appropriations Committee had reported out all 12 of the bills that fund  the day-to-day operation of the budget. Five of them actually moved  across the floor. We did run into problems in the United States Senate  where there was a lot of obstruction, but the Appropriations Committee  did its job. We just have to now, as a Congress, do our job and make  sure those bills get to the floor in a timely manner, and that we do  the right thing so that they pass.   The Appropriations Committee can only prepare them. They don't get to  schedule them on the floor. They don't get to move them across the  floor. That has to be done with all sides working together for the good  of the American people.   Again, it is worth noting that we can do this process. Two years in a  row, we have done all 12 bills. So I would hope in the future, as we  make these decisions--and my friend is right, a decision was made in  November or December. It is not one I agreed with--to wait and say  let's let the new administration have some input on this. Now, there is  certainly nothing wrong with that.   The new administration wants to come in, and there is a vehicle  called a supplemental, where, if they want to tweak the budget, they  can do that and they can bring it to the floor, and that is what we  should have done. But we shouldn't ask them to write the budget for the  very year in which they show up. They simply don't have their people in  place. They are not ready to do that. They have got to get their  Cabinet appointed. So I would hope, in the future, we remember that and  do first things first.   Still, it is never too late to do the right thing, as my mom used to  say. And the right thing to do today is to pass this rule, pass this  bill, give our friends, the appropriators, the time that they need to  negotiate a final bill. I am confident we will do that; I am confident  we will do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker; and I am confident we  will be back here with a bill the American people can be proud of  because that will have been negotiated in good faith, it will be  bipartisan, and it will give us the stability that we need from now  until September 30.
