 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  Clyde Owen of Moses Lake, Washington, an individual who dedicated his  life to serving the country and improving his community before passing  on July 1, at the age of 100.   Clyde was a pilot during World War II and the only member of his air  crew to escape enemy fire during the landing at Anzio in 1943.  Surviving these adversities, he continued to serve in the Air Force,  traveling the world before settling in Moses Lake in 1961. There, he  served as the last commander of the Larson Air Force Base, overseeing  crucial tanker and bomber fleets before its closure in 1966.   Far from ready to retire, he went on to work as the first executive  director for the Port of Moses Lake, working to foster economic  development and create opportunity for the people of central  Washington.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Clyde's  long life of service and his commitment to the United States and to the  people of Moses Lake.                            ____________________
