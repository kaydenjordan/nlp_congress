 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1695, the  Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act.   I am an original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. It was  introduced by Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers, making  this Register of Copyrights a position nominated by the President and  confirmed by the Senate. It was passed out of the House Judiciary  Committee by a vote of 27-1. It is completely appropriate that we bring  this provision to the floor.   As a co-chair of the Congressional Songwriters Caucus, and a  Representative of middle Tennessee, which is the Nashville area, it is  home to many content producers and creators, in particular, to  songwriters. Creators deserve to know that they will have a Register  who will do a couple of things really well: is accountable to the  people through their elected Representatives, and will provide  independent and expert advice to Congress.   According to a report prepared by the International Intellectual  Property Alliance: the total copyright industries employed nearly 11.4  million workers in 2015, accounting for 7.95 percent of all U.S.  employment, 9.39 percent of all private employment in the U.S. The  average annual compensation paid to employees of the total copyright  industries in 2015, per employee, $82,117, exceeds the average annual  wage by about 21 percent.   Intellectual property must be protected. Copyrights must be  protected. Congress has a role in making certain that these  constitutional provisions are held and, also, making certain that the  Office is responsible to Congress. I urge the House to move forward on  this commonsense measure.
