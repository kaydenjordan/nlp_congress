 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (S. 305) to amend title 4, United States Code, to encourage  the display of the flag of the United States on National Vietnam War  Veterans Day, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 209, I call  up the bill (H.R. 372) to restore the application of the Federal  antitrust laws to the business of health insurance to protect  competition and consumers, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H2268]]  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 372.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that will move us a  step closer towards restoring healthy competition in the health  insurance industry. Today, the health insurance industry is besieged by  dwindling competition and skyrocketing premiums. Insurance providers,  States, and the public have been dealing with the disastrous  repercussions of ObamaCare for the past 6 years and overregulation by  States for much longer.   Congress finally has the opportunity to pass legislation to reverse  the downward spiral of our health insurance industry. Any such  legislation must encourage a robust and competitive health insurance  market in which insurance providers actively compete for customers.  Healthy competition ensures premiums are accurately priced and that  customers are able to find a variety of policies to meet their specific  needs and demands.   H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017,  represents a step on that journey, repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act  as it applies to the business of health insurance. There is wide  support for this bill, and the Judiciary Committee has favorably  reported similar legislation in the past, including legislation that  was passed by the House, 406-19 during the 111th Congress.   The stated goal of the bill is to help restore competition in the  healthcare market. I support this goal and firmly believe this bill  must be coupled with larger changes to the existing Federal and State  healthcare regulatory schemes.   As Speaker Ryan has noted, States ``should be empowered to make the  right tradeoffs between consumer protections and individual choice, not  regulators in Washington.''   This bill does not impact the State's ability to regulate the  insurance market. Rather, this legislation levels the playing field for  all healthcare industry participants. While insurers have been exempt  from Federal antitrust laws for the past 70 years, healthcare providers  and other participants have not.                                time  1445    This bill removes this exemption, ensuring that health insurers are  better able to compete to provide quality coverage, thereby benefiting  hospitals, doctors, and, most importantly, patients.   In addition, if separate legislation is passed to allow for the more  open sale of health insurance across State lines, the Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act will allow uniform Federal antitrust laws  to be applied across the marketplace while allowing States to maintain  authority as the primary regulators of the health insurance market  outside of the antitrust sphere.   The McCarran-Ferguson Act was originally passed to leave the  regulation of the business of insurance with the States and to allow  insurers to engage in certain procompetitive collaborative activities.   This legislation limits significant uncertainty and unnecessary  litigation that would likely result from a broader McCarran-Ferguson  repeal, through the use of safe harbors for such historically  procompetitive collaborative activities, specifically the collection  and distribution of historical loss data, the determination of loss  development factors, the performance of actuarial services that do not  involve restraints of trade, and the use of common forms that are not  coercive.   Absent these safeguards, insurers will likely disengage from certain  proconsumer collaborative activities, eliminating or impeding smaller  insurers from competing and disincentivizing larger insurers from  exploring new products and markets. This will lead to further market  consolidation and fewer product choices, the impact of which will  eventually be borne by the consumer.   These narrow safe harbors create a presumption that certain  procompetitive activities can continue while maintaining regulation and  oversight to the extent any activity crosses over into a restraint of  trade. As a result, insurers can continue to engage in proconsumer  business practices and will be encouraged to provide a diverse range of  offerings at fair and reasonable prices.   I thank Mr. Gosar for introducing this legislation, and I urge all of  my colleagues to vote for the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), who is the chief sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, so I reserve the  balance of my time until the other side closes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Our health insurance industry is in a dire situation. Premiums and  deductibles are skyrocketing, hundreds of percent in some cases. In the  State of the gentleman who is the chief sponsor of this bill, the State  of Arizona, there has been a more than 100 percent increase in just the  last year.   In 2017, the national State average of insurers participating in  Federal exchanges dropped to four, down from six the previous year.  Five States will only have one insurer providing plans on their Federal  exchanges this year. It is time to reverse this trend. The Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act is an important step in restoring  competition to the health insurance industry and will help to set the  foundation for additional essential reforms that must follow.   I say to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking  member of the committee and my friend, I appreciate very much working  with him on this legislation, but I would also say to him that this  legislation, as bipartisan as it is, cannot save the Affordable Care  Act. It is drowning. It is denying people coverage. Its costs are going  up so much that somebody who likes it this year will not be able to  afford it next year.   The promise that if you like your health insurance you will be able  to keep it was never true, and it is still not true with ObamaCare. The  promise that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor was never  true. The promise that health insurance premiums would go down under  ObamaCare has been proven to be totally false. Instead, what we have  done is we have denied the American people the right to choose for  themselves what access to health care that they need and can afford.   We have denied the American people the freedom to decide whether or  not they want to purchase a product that is mandated upon them by the  Federal Government. That is wrong. It has got to change. That is why we  are taking action this week--including the Competitive Health Insurance  Reform Act, but certainly not only the Competitive Health Insurance  Reform Act--to return a patient-centered healthcare system to the  American people, one that reconnects them with their healthcare  providers, one that will make sure that they have the maximum amount of  choice and the maximum amount of access to real, affordable health  insurance and quality health care in America. I support this bipartisan  legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three letters in support of H.R.  372.                                                    Small Business &                                        Entrepreneurship Council,                                      Vienna, VA, February 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul A. Gosar,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Gosar: The Small Business &       Entrepreneurship Council (SHE Council) and our nationwide       membership of small business owners and entrepreneurs support       the ``Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017'' (H.R.       372). Perhaps more than any other group, small business       owners understand the need for increased competition in the       health insurance marketplace. Indeed, it is the actions of       entrepreneurs that bring down costs, enhance innovation, and       boost quality in a competitive marketplace. H.R. 372 is a       common sense and long-overdue step to repeal special-interest       exemptions to federal antitrust laws for health insurance       companies.        These exemptions have existed for more than 70 years, and       were initially instituted to help newly formed insurance       companies deal with data sharing. Given the dramatic changes       in the industry over these past many decades, such special-      interest treatment is no longer warranted.  [[Page H2273]]         Considering the government-imposed distortions within the       health care industry as a result of the Affordable Care Act       and other regulatory restrictions, full-blown review and       reform of health care policies focused on expanding       competition, and consumer choice are needed. That includes       foundational changes, such as, in the case of H.R. 372,       removing special-interest treatment that could reduce or       retrain competition.        In order to bring down health insurance costs and utilize       the models and technologies of our modern economy to drive       value and innovation within this sector, entrepreneurs need a       system that allows for such freedom and creativity. Your bill       is an important step in bringing down artificial barriers       that are preventing much needed innovation and competition.       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. Please       let SBE Council know how we can help you advance H.R. 372       into law.            Sincerely,                                                    Karen Kerrigan,      President & CEO.                                   ____                            American Dental Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 24, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers,       Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: The       dental professional organizations listed below, as members of       the Organized Dentistry Coalition, are writing to express our       strong support of H.R. 372, The Competitive Health Insurance       Reform Act.        H.R. 372 would authorize the Federal Trade Commission and       the Justice Department to enforce the federal antitrust laws       against health insurance companies engaged in anticompetitive       conduct. It would not interfere with the states' ability to       maintain and enforce their own insurance regulations,       antitrust statues, and consumer protection laws. Because       states vary in their enforcement efforts, the impact of       repeal on health insurance companies would differ from state       to state. This is no different from the situation faced by       other businesses.        The bill is narrowly drawn to apply only to the business of       health insurance, including dental insurance, and would not       affect the business of life insurance, property or casualty       insurance, and many similar insurance areas.        Passage of H.R. 372 would help interject more competition       into the insurance marketplace by authorizing greater federal       antitrust enforcement in instances where state regulators       fail to act. When competition is not robust, consumers are       more likely to face higher prices and less likely to and less       likely to benefit from innovation and variety in the       marketplace.        On behalf of our member dentists and their patients, we       urge you to cosponsor H.R. 372, The Competitive Health       Insurance Reform Act.        Please contact Ms. Midi Walker with any questions.            Sincerely,          American Dental Association; Academy of General             Dentistry; American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial             Pathology; American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry;             American Association of Endodontists; American             Association of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons; American             Association of Women Dentists; American Society of             Dentist Anesthesiologists.                                   ____                                                     March 21, 2017.        Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations urge       your support for H.R. 372, the ``Competitive Health Insurance       Reform Act of 2017.'' This bill takes an important step in       bringing consumers the benefits of competition under the       antitrust laws, in the way health insurance is offered,       marketed, and sold.        The rules of competition apply to every other part of the       health care system, health insurance is an aberration. The       antitrust laws are a key to making sure that the free market       works for consumers, and the insurance industry should not be       left out.        Congress created this antitrust exemption almost by       accident, in the midst of the Second World War--when       attentions were rightly directed elsewhere--in the wake of a       Supreme Court decision clarifying that the antitrust laws did       apply to insurance. It started out to be a temporary three-      year breathing spell, to allow insurers to familiarize       themselves with the antitrust laws and adjust their practices       to the accepted rules of competition. Instead, a few poorly-      understood words added in conference committee turned the       temporary delay into an unintended exemption from those       rules.        It is long since time to correct that error. Among other       experts who have called for doing so, the Antitrust       Modernization Commission, established in 2002 by legislation       authored in this Committee, singled out this exemption for       particular skepticism as to any justification for it. While       we would ultimately like to see this antitrust exemption       removed for all insurance, focusing on the health insurance       industry now is a logical and important positive step to take       at this time.        We note that the proposed manager's amendment would       preserve the antitrust exemption in ``safe harbors'' for four       described activities--(1) compilation of historical loss       data, (2) development of what is known as a ``loss       development factor'' to fill holes in the historical data,       (3) some actuarial services, and (4) some standardization of       policy forms. In our view, the most effective way to remove       this exemption is to do so cleanly, without new safe harbors.       Further, the kinds of insurance industry activities commonly       described as the justification for these particular safe       harbors do not raise antitrust issues, as they are described.       Nonetheless, we believe these safe harbors, as written, do       not significantly risk inadvertently immunizing       anticompetitive conduct that would violate the antitrust       laws, and therefore that they do not diminish the beneficial       purpose and effect of the bill.        There is also another set of ``safe harbor'' antitrust       exemptions imbedded in the definition of ``business of health       insurance (including the business of dental insurance)'' in       the new subsection 2(c)(3)(B)(ii)(I) as added by the bill.       They include a number of types of benefits referenced in the       Internal Revenue Code as ``excepted benefits.'' While the       lead-in to (3)(B)(ii) characterizes these as types of       property-casualty insurance, there are three that by their       terms in the Internal Revenue Code do not fit within what is       considered property-casualty insurance, and that consumers       would consider to be types of health insurance.        Among these are hospital indemnity insurance, 26 U.S.C.       9832(c)(3)(B); coverage for a specified disease or illness,       26 U.S.C. 9832(c)(3)(A); and an open-ended ``such other       similar, limited benefits as are specified in regulations,''       26 U.S.C. 9832(c)(2(C). This last one is found in the same       Internal Revenue Code provision that lists dental coverage as       an excepted benefit, meaning that the ``similar'' benefits       that could be potentially excluded by regulation--and thereby       get an automatic antitrust exemption--could be anything       similar to a category such as dental coverage--which might be       any kind of specified benefit.        While there may have been justification for excepting these       categories of benefits from federal regulatory requirements       such as portability under the Affordable Care Act--which is       what 26 U.S.C. 9832(c) is in reference to--that does not mean       it makes sense to exempt them from the antitrust laws. The       bill recognizes this for dental coverage, and explicitly       takes the cross-reference to it out of the safe harbor, to       ensure that it is covered by the bill. We hope that, as the       bill moves forward, the three new antitrust exemptions in the       cross references described above will also be removed, so       that these types of health-related insurance coverage will       likewise be subject to the antitrust laws.        We remain strong supporters of the Affordable Care Act,       which has significantly improved the availability and       affordability of health care for many millions of Americans,       including millions who previously had no health insurance. We       would be very concerned by any move to repeal the Affordable       care Act without having an effective new plan already figured       out and in place that maintains comparable coverages and       comparable consumer choices and protections. Such a move       would be a grave threat to the financial and health security       of American families, and to the very stability of our       nation's health care system overall.        At the same time, we also strongly support bringing the       antitrust laws into play in this important sector of the       health care marketplace. That marketplace is complex in how       it operates and how it motivates providers, insurers, and       consumers. An effective regulatory framework is needed to       shape that complex environment, to help safeguard consumers,       help keep costs under control, and help make a full range of       health care services available. Our country's long experience       shows you can't expect a health care system to run       effectively on competition alone.        But consumers will benefit from also having effective       competition, at all levels in the supply chain. Even the best       regulatory framework works better where competition, within       the bounds of that framework, gives businesses a market-      driven incentive to want to improve service while holding       down prices and providing better value. Regulation and       competition both work best when they can work hand in hand.        As the health care marketplace evolves, having the       antitrust laws apply will give health insurers competition-      based incentives to improve the way they provide coverage to       consumers, with higher quality, better choice, and more       affordability. Better competition will help bring insurer       incentives better in line with benefiting consumers.        As the Justice Department has explained, where there is       effective competition, coupled with transparency, in a       consumer-friendly regulatory framework, insurers will be       spurred to compete against each other by offering plans with       lower premiums, reducing copayments, lowering or eliminating       deductibles, lowering annual out-of-pocket maximum costs,       managing care, improving drug coverage, offering desirable       benefits, and making their provider networks more attractive       to potential members.        Competition will be beneficial to consumers in the health       insurance marketplace just as it is everywhere else in our       economy.        We urge your support for H.R. 372.            Respectfully,      George P. Slover,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.      J. Robert Hunter,  [[Page H2274]]         Director of Insurance, Consumer Federation of America.      Linda Sherry,        Director of National Priorities, Consumer Action.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion.    Mr. Speaker, the McCarran-Ferguson Act was originally  passed to leave the regulation of the business of insurance with the  States and to allow insurers to engage in certain procompetitive  collaborative activities.   This legislation limits significant uncertainty and unnecessary  litigation that would likely result from a broader McCarran-Ferguson  repeal through the use of safe harbors for such historically  procompetitive collaborative activities, specifically the collection  and distribution of historical loss data, the determination of loss  development factors, the performance of actuarial services that do not  involve restraints of trade, and the use of common forms that are not  coercive.   Absent these safeguards, insurers will likely disengage from certain  proconsumer collaborative activities, eliminating or impeding smaller  insurers from competing and disincentivizing larger insurers from  exploring new products and markets. This will lead to further market  consolidation and fewer product choices, the impact of which will  eventually be borne by the consumer.   These narrow safe harbors create a presumption that certain  procompetitive activities can continue while maintaining regulation and  oversight to the extent any activity crosses over into a restraint of  trade. As a result, insurers can continue to engage in proconsumer  business practices, and will be encouraged to provide a diverse range  of offerings at fair and reasonable prices.   There is no reason to make an exception to these safe harbors.  Therefore, I oppose the motion. I urge my colleagues to reject this  motion to recommit and to support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
