 Mr. Speaker, just to follow up on what my good friend  from Iowa (Mr. King) was saying, there is an article here from this  week--Hans A. von Spakovsky says: ``Alabama is arguing that by  including illegal immigrants in its count of the population, it  deprives the State of representation in the U.S. House of  Representatives. The key to Alabama's case is the definition of  `persons' who should be counted and thus used in apportionment. This is  not an issue the court has addressed before.''   That is interesting.   ``Alabama has filed an unprecedented but little-noticed lawsuit  against the U.S. Census Bureau. If the State wins, it could have major  political ramifications and restore fundamental fairness in political  representation in Congress.''   And I might insert parenthetically here, I heard my friend, the  delegate from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) was talking about  hoping to have a vote, whether it was making D.C. a State or whatnot.  But in the little research that I ended up doing after I got here is I  have seen the license plate, ``Taxation without representation.'' I  thought: Well, you know, of course, that was something that was said  during the Revolution, ``Taxation without representation is tyranny.''  Ben Franklin said, if we don't get to elect even one of the members of  parliament that put taxes on us, then they should not be able to put  taxes on us.    So I am familiar with that situation, but I didn't know, until after  I had been here awhile, I find out that territories, like--or any U.S.  property that is not part of a State, they do not have a U.S.  representative because the Constitution is very clear, very succinct,  it says that the representative shall come from the several States.   In the late 1970s, all of the proponents of giving Washington, D.C. a  representative, a U.S. representative, they understood there is only  one way to do that, and that is to have a constitutional amendment to  amend where it says the representative shall come from the several  States and include, and the District of Columbia, something like that.   Well, they passed it with a significant percentage in the House and  the Senate that allowed it to go forward as a constitutional amendment,  but they never got--in the late 1970s, they never got the requisite  number of States because I guess, from the State standpoint, they are  thinking: Well, if we ratify this as a constitutional amendment, it  slightly, but still does, dilute a little bit of our power in the House  of Representatives. So it didn't get the requisite number of States.   But, again, after I was here, I was talking to a friend from Puerto  Rico, and I said: I know there have been votes in the past about  whether Puerto Ricans want to be a State or not. Why has that not  passed previously? This is several years ago.   And he said: Well, there are people that kind of like the current  situation in Puerto Rico. It is the same as in Guam or the Mariana  Islands or the U.S. Virgin Islands--all the areas that are not States,  they are territories--because in those, as in Puerto Rico, because they  do not elect a full voting representative into the U.S. House or  Senate, then the Founders, up through the current time, have said it is  not fair. Just like Ben Franklin said, it is not fair to make them pay  Federal income tax, Federal tax, if they don't elect a full voting  representative.   So there is no U.S. territory, no non-State U.S. property that has to  pay Federal income tax if they are not a State that elects a  representative, except for the District of Columbia.   And once I realized that, I went: Well, it may not seem to people to  be a Republican issue, but that really is not fair for the District of  Columbia, because the people in the District of Columbia pay Federal  income tax.   So if we are really going to be consistent, we are really going to be  fair to the people of the District of Columbia, there is only one thing  to do: Either make them a State, which a form of that was tried in the  1970s and it didn't work, or the other--actually there are three  things. The other is to make the law as it is for every other non- State, that the residents of that non-State do not pay Federal income  tax.   So I filed that bill in a number of the Congresses, including this  one. It was very basic, you know--residents of Washington, District of  Columbia, will not pay Federal income tax, just like all the other  territories. And I have been intrigued that I have not gotten support  from Democrats, including the delegate from the District of Columbia.   I understand, you know, folks like my colleague want to have a full  voting U.S. representative. Fine. But why not let your constituents at  least be treated like every other resident U.S. citizen of a non-State.  Don't make them pay income tax until you get what you want. Maybe some  day you'll get it, but until you do, why don't you join forces with me  and just say: We want to pass this law; we are going to be fair to the  residents of Washington, D.C. just like we are to all the other non- States that are U.S. territories; we are going to say you don't pay  Federal income tax.   But I have been amazed that I am still not getting support from the  other side of the aisle, just to be fair, until they--I am not in favor  of making the District of Columbia a State. I like what the Founders  did, with that one exception, they should not have to pay tax since  they don't elect a full voting representative.   So, anyway, I am hoping that at some point at least one or more of my  Democratic friends will join forces with me and maybe we can push that  issue to the floor so we can treat the residents of the District of  Columbia fairly. But until the person representing the people here in  the District of Columbia disagree, then it is  [[Page H5017]]  doubtful the Speaker would ever bring my bill to the floor so we could  treat them fairly.   Now, there is one other way that that could be handled, and I did  file this bill some Congresses back, but it had even less support, so I  didn't bother to file it again. So one way to be fair to the residents  of the District of Columbia would be to say: No Federal income tax,  since you don't elect a full voting representative.   The other would be to do what was done in the late 1840s when there  were major complaints from residents of the District of Columbia. They  were part of the 10-mile-by-10-mile square District of Columbia, but  were on the western side of the Potomac River. They were protesting.  They were upset. Look, you are not using any of our land as Federal  land, so why don't you just cede the land west of the Potomac back to  Virginia and then we can participate in the election of not only  representatives, but also two Senators? We will get to participate in  that since you are not using the land.                                time  1430    Well, of course, nowadays, the Federal Government is using a lot of  that land. You have not only Reagan National Airport, you have  Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon, and so many other things  across the river.   But back in the late 1840s, that was ceded back to Virginia. That is  why when people look at a map of the District of Columbia, it is no  longer a 10-mile-by-10-mile square. It is uneven on the west side  because it follows the Potomac, going back to that ceding of land back  to Virginia.   So I have filed a bill before, and I am not planning on filing it  again because it just didn't get any real support at all. But we drew a  line with a metes and bounds description around all of the nonresident  Federal buildings in the District of Columbia. We keep those as Federal  enclaves, and then cede all of the other land east of the Potomac back  to Maryland.   I remember my friend from the District of Columbia, across the aisle,  asking me one time on this floor, when I was talking about this bill:  But what if Maryland didn't want to take this land back?   And I looked at my friend, Mr. Hoyer from Maryland, and I said--I am  sure that our friend here, Mr. Hoyer, would say--any State would be  thoroughly pleased to have you and your constituents as residents of  their State. I didn't get an ``amen'' or ``sure, of course'' from Mr.  Hoyer, but I am sure, deep in his heart, he felt that way. But, like I  said, I never got any real support for that.   So I am hoping, at some point, my friend from the District of  Columbia will join me and say: Okay, at least until--and even if it  doesn't happen--at least until it did happen, the residents of the  District of Columbia should be treated fairly, like we do those from  any other non-State, and don't pay income tax.   I appreciate bringing those issues back up again. It is an easy  solution. And I just feel like if we had a bipartisan effort to pass  that, then we could get that done on behalf of the residents of  Washington, District of Columbia.   But, anyway, back to this article from the Heritage Foundation, June  5, talking about the lawsuit about counting illegal immigrants in the  Census. It says: ``Conversely, the lawsuit argues, the practice of  counting illegal immigrants in the Census gives States that protect  them (California, for example) seats and votes they are not entitled to  have.   ``The 14th Amendment to the Constitution provides that  Representatives in the House `shall be apportioned among the several  States . . . according to their respective Numbers' ''--just like I was  talking about--``with the `Numbers' determined by `counting the whole  number of persons in each State.'   ``After every Census, House seats are reapportioned according to the  population of each State. Electoral College votes are reapportioned  according to the number of each State's congressional Representatives.   ``Alabama is right about the unfairness of the current system.  Illegal immigrants, by definition, have no right to be in this country.  It is unjust to allow States to gain a political advantage over other  States by flouting Federal immigration law.   ``The number of Representatives in the House--435--has been fixed by  the law since 1910. So as Alabama says in its complaint, apportionment  is `a zero sum proposition: Each State's gain is another State's loss.'   ``Alabama argues that by including illegal immigrants in  apportionment, congressional seats and Electoral College votes are  unfairly distributed.   ``Based on the 2010 Census, Louisiana, Missouri, and Ohio each lost a  seat in the House and a vote in the Electoral College, while Montana  failed to gain a seat and an electoral vote. By contrast, California  gained two House seats and two Electoral College votes. And Florida and  Texas each gained one seat and one vote.   ``As a result, says Alabama in its lawsuit: `four House seats and  four Electoral College votes were redistributed by the inclusion of  illegal aliens in the apportionment base in the 2000 Census.'   ``Alabama claims that including illegal immigrants in the 2020 Census  will likely cause it to lose a congressional seat and an Electoral  College vote. It says this `will rob the State of Alabama and its legal  residents of their rightful share of representation.   ``This also violates the `one person, one vote' equal representation  standard of the 14th Amendment. According to Alabama, `the gains from  including illegal aliens in the apportionment base flow to citizens who  live in State with large numbers of illegal aliens.'   ``Why? Because it means that `in a State in which a large share of  the population cannot vote, those who do vote count more than those who  live in States where a larger share of the population is made up of  American citizens.' '' Which is an interesting argument.   ``This results in `representational inequality' by devaluing the vote  of Alabama's legal residents. This redistribution of political power  `disincentivizes States with large illegal alien populations from  cooperating with Federal immigration authorities (lest they lose  political power that comes with additional Representatives and votes in  the Electoral College),' Alabama argues.   ``Moreover, including illegal immigrants in the Census `punishes  States who do cooperate with Federal immigration authorities in the  identification and removal' of illegal aliens, Alabama's lawsuit  states.   ``Alabama's final complaint is monetary. Including illegal immigrants  in the Census, it says, will likely cause it to lose its fair share of  the almost $700 billion distributed annually by the Federal Government  in grants and other funds.   ``The key to Alabama's case is the definition of `persons' who should  be counted and thus used in apportionment. Alabama argues the term  `persons' was understood at the `time of the founding and when the 14th  Amendment was ratified' to mean the `inhabitants' of a State.   ``Furthermore, `in the public law of the founding era, the term  `inhabitant' did not encompass unlawful residents because inhabitance  was a legal status that depended upon permission to settle granted by  the sovereign nation in which an alien wished to reside,' Alabama  argues.    ``In other words, `persons' does not include individuals who are in  the U.S. illegally, without the permission of the Federal Government.   ``The `Residence' rule adopted by the Census Bureau for the 2020  Census stipulates that foreign nationals will be counted and allocated  to the State where their `usual residence' is located, regardless of  whether they are legally present.''   There is some hypocrisy, I have noticed, among some of our friends  here. On the one hand, they are constantly saying: We have to bring  these illegal aliens, undocumented people, whatever they want to call  them, we have to bring them out of the shadows.   And I remember, on one occasion, we had a bunch of folks claiming to  be illegal aliens in the gallery right here. They were shouting and  proud to be illegal aliens at some point. I looked up, looked around  the gallery at all of these people making noise, have T-shirts, and I  thought: It doesn't look like they are in the shadows to me. I mean, it  looks like there is plenty of light up there.   They keep using the term that they are ``in the shadows,'' yet  Alabama has  [[Page H5018]]  this lawsuit and they are saying: We need to know who is in the country  illegally and who is not so we can get a fair count.   And people that have been saying, on the one hand: We want everybody  that is coming into the country illegally to come out of the shadows;  when it comes to apportionment, they are saying: No, no, no, no, we  want them counted, but you can't ask them whether they are here  illegally or not. So we want their status to stay in the shadows. We  want to keep their status secret.   Sanctuary cities are basically doing the same thing. They might as  well put the Statue of Liberty out in San Francisco harbor saying: Give  us your tired, your poor, your felons, your people that like to shoot  other people and rob them, because that is basically what San Francisco  has been saying: We don't care if you are a felon, we don't care if you  kill people, you rape women, or raped anybody, we want you here, and we  won't tell on you, so you come right in here.   I am going to file a bill. I have been working on it too long. I  haven't gotten the cooperation I thought I should from some folks. But,  anyway, basically, I think it ought be a civil right living in a city  in the United States that is violated when a city says: We are going to  welcome, encourage, really try to recruit people to be in our city who  are felons, who are here illegally and felons.   And when that kind of action under State law robs people of their  lives or their sexual purity or any other thing, there ought to be a  cause of action against that city or that State that is saying: We  encourage people that are here illegally and who are committing  felonies, we want you here.   That really ought to be a right of the others who are U.S. citizens  that is being violated by the sanctuary city or the sanctuary State. So  if a State or city wants to keep encouraging felons to live within  their bounds and it costs people their lives or their property, there  ought to be a civil rights lawsuit lodged against that State or city  government, or county government for that matter.   So we will get it done and we will get it filed. That way it is fair.  So, say, if San Francisco, for example, wants to keep encouraging  people, like the guy that shot Kate Steinle, to come into the city, and  that way others may be similarly situated, as was Kate Steinle, and get  shot and killed as they beg their daddy to help them, I mean, I just  can't imagine anything much worse than that as a father.   The father should not have his lawsuit thrown out of court, as  happened in the Steinle case. We ought to give the means to the  aggrieved party to say to San Francisco, or say to the city or State  when they are acting as a sanctuary city or State: Do you know what,  you can do that if you want, but you are going to monetarily pay to the  people who are harmed under your State or city color of law. It just  seems fair.   So, hopefully, we will get something done on that and let the  lawsuits commence against the sanctuary cities. As a former lawyer who  tried a lot of cases, I have seen the good that can come. Sometimes  there are places where the litigation system is abused, often a topic  on FOX News, but there are some laws we don't really have to pass if  you have a good court system that aggrieved parties can come in and  they can sue and collect.   And just the threat of that suit and collection voids the needs for  us to come in here or run in and pass a law every time there is some  illegality or impropriety or some damage done to other parties. Let the  courts mete it out.   When somebody is penalized financially in a sufficient amount, then  it will change their conduct. I think you would see sanctuary cities  change once their taxpayers realize they are going to keep paying out  multimillion dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars constantly in  court costs and damages assessed.                                time  1445    I bet you would see a whole lot of folks say: Do you know what? Maybe  it is time that we quit having a sanctuary in our city for people who  came in illegally and who also commit violent felonies or property  theft or whatever it is. Let's protect people and give them that right  through litigation.   Now, this article from Bob Price says: ``Border Patrol Agents Arrest  Sex Offenders, Gang Members in South Texas.'' It points out that:  ``Border patrol agents assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Sector stopped  sex offenders and gang members from making their way to their U.S.  destinations over the weekend. During a 4-day period, agents arrested  four child molesters and three gang members after they illegally  crossed the border. The arrests include fugitives who fled the country  to avoid prosecution and previously deported criminal aliens.   ``Rio Grande City Station agents arrested a man who illegally crossed  the border near Roma, Texas, on Sunday. During processing, agents  learned the Salvadoran national was convicted in Angleton, Texas, in  February 2015 for a 2014 charge of sexual assault of a child. The  Salvadoran national received a 5-year prison sentence and was deported  after being released early by prison officials.''   And then obviously coming back, some other child was probably saved  from another sexual assault, because I know from my experience as a  prosecutor and a felony judge, when somebody is that kind of evil that  they would commit that kind of assault on a child, it just seems to be  the kind of evil that they keep coming back to.   So it is something that needs to stop. Thank God we have Border  Patrol officers who are protecting us.   I would just encourage our own Republican leadership, what got  President Trump elected was he was promising that we would build a  wall. He was promising an end to the unconstitutional DACA that Obama  did. He was promising no amnesties. So I think in the time we have left  in this year, wouldn't it be a good idea if we as Republicans in the  House quit worrying about a discharge petition and started being  concerned about keeping our promises to the American people?   Let's get the wall built where it is needed, but for heaven's sake,  get the border secure. Secure the border so people coming in are coming  in lawfully.   We should not have to process anybody who comes in anywhere except  through an authorized entry point into our country. If you try to come  in another way, the Federal officers ought to do like the State of  Texas officers do, and that is stand in the way: You are not coming  into our country. You are not putting a foot on American soil until you  come in legally.   But the Federal officers haven't been doing that, and we need to make  that happen as well. That is what we do. Once we have secured the  borders, then we can work something out about who is here and who  stays, who goes.   But until then, the border patrolmen again reaffirmed for me this  last week, every time we mention DACA, amnesty, any kind of  legalization, any kind of stay, any kind of path to this, that, or the  other, there is another surge of people illegally coming into the  country. Let's stop the surges. Let's do whatever it takes to secure  the border. Let's forget about discharge petitions.   Concentrate on that secured border. That will keep our oath. That  will keep our promise. That defends the Constitution, and it also  actually helps people get reelected, because we kept our promises.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  June 12, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
