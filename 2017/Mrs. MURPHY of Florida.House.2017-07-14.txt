 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for  including my amendment in this en bloc package.   My amendment will authorize Procurement Technical Assistance Centers  to assist small business owners in pursuing funding opportunities  during all phases of the SBIR and STTR programs.   These Federal programs enable small businesses to perform research  and development that advances the national interests and has the  potential for commercialization.   My central Florida district is primed to benefit from these programs  since it is home to a large and growing number of small firms that  harness the power of technology, produce innovative products for  customers in the public and private sector, and, in the process, create  well-paying jobs and generate broad-based economic growth.
