 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome to the House  floor my dear friend, Father Jonathan Slavinskas, who offered today's  opening prayer.   Father Jonathan, as most of his parishioners call him, is the pastor  of St. Bernard's Church of Our Lady of Providence Parish on Lincoln  Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. A lifelong resident of Worcester,  he is also the police chaplain for Worcester, Auburn, and Southbridge.   What makes Father Jon so extraordinary is his complete devotion to  bettering the lives of his parish community, especially the young  people. He hosts an annual Halloween party for hundreds of neighborhood  kids so they have a safe place to go trick-or-treating.   Stories abound of his little acts of kindness, like buying pizza for  kids hanging out on the church steps or opening up the church gym for  youth basketball games or making it a point to walk around the  neighborhood and simply say ``hi.''   Madam Speaker, Father Jon's compassion and commitment to making  everyone feel welcome at St. Bernard's--no matter who they are--is  truly remarkable. He is an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 891 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 891         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.

Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6172) to amend       the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to prohibit       the production of certain business records, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the       chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence; and (2) one motion to recommit       with or without instructions.        Sec. 7.  On any legislative day during the period from       March 13, 2020, through March 22, 2020--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 8.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 7 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 9.  Each day during the period addressed by section 7       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XV.        Sec. 10.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of March 22, 2020, for the Speaker to entertain       motions that the House suspend the rules as though under       clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.        Sec. 11.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of March 23, 2020.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 891, providing for consideration of  Senate amendment to H.R. 2486, S.J. Res. 68, and H.R. 6172.   The rules provide for consideration of two House amendments to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 2486, which contained the text of the NO BAN  Act and the Access to Counsel Act.   It also provides for consideration of S.J. Res. 68 under a closed  rule, with 1 hour of general debate controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It also provides  the joint resolution with one motion to commit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 6172 under a closed  rule, with 1 hour of general debate equally divided among and  controlled by the chairs and ranking minority members of the Committee  on the Judiciary and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.   Lastly, this rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman  Nadler to H.R. 6172 and provides one motion to recommit with or without  instructions.   Madam Speaker, we are now 3 years into a policy that is the  antithesis of what this country stands for: the President's shameful  and un-American Muslim ban. President Trump chose Holocaust Remembrance  Day, of all days, to sign his first executive order on this. That shut  the door to thousands of refugees fleeing war--the very people who had  seen America as a beacon of hope and were trying to build a better  life.   Instead, this administration turned its back on innocent women,  children, and families desperate to escape violence. That is callous,  that is wrong, and it goes against everything America is founded on.   President Trump has claimed his Muslim ban is all about national  security. But let's be honest here, it was never about that.   It is about a President trying to fulfill offensive campaign promises  and further his harmful rhetoric about Muslims.   As a candidate for President, Donald Trump said he would certainly  look at closing mosques in the United States. He floated the idea of  creating a database for all Muslim Americans. And he even suggested  that Muslims in America were cheering as the World Trade Centers fell  on September 11. What an ugly, ugly thing to say.   Madam Speaker, I could go on and on and on. This is truly offensive  stuff--ideas that should be left somewhere in the darkest corners of  the internet.   Then, in December of 2015, he called for, ``a total and complete  shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.''   This ban is his attempt at turning that campaign rhetoric into actual  policy, however cruel and unnecessary.   My colleagues, Representatives Chu, Jayapal, and Rose, put its impact  best when they wrote in a recent op-ed piece: ``That means more  grandchildren who will never be able to kiss their grandparents, more  loved ones unable to say good-bye at a funeral, more graduations where  the proud student has no beaming parents cheering for them in the  crowd, and more families forced to make impossible decisions under the  most trying circumstances.''   I have met people impacted by the Muslim ban, Madam Speaker. It is  people like Benham Partopour, a chemical engineering student getting  his Ph.D. at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in my home district in  central Massachusetts.   He is an Iranian national who was in Iran when President Trump's  executive order went into effect. He had a visa, but no airlines were  willing to sell plane tickets that would allow him to return to the  United States. So, like many other people across the globe, he was  stranded.   My office worked with school officials and the ACLU Massachusetts  every day until he was able to return home to the United States a week  later.   This is who the President is afraid of, Madam Speaker, a bright young  man trying to study at a top American university. He is just one of the  roughly 135 million people impacted by this policy.   This isn't about crafting sound national security policy; this is  about something much more sinister. That is shown by the fact that the  President kept drafting versions of his Muslim ban until a watered-down  version was able to pass legal muster with conservatives on the Supreme  Court. But even they required the administration to grant waivers  proving the ban had a ``legitimate national security interest.''   Yet, the State Department has approved just 10 percent of all waivers  so far, just 10 percent.   Madam Speaker, does this President really believe that 90 percent of  Muslims from impacted countries are terrorists? There is absolutely no  evidence of that.   And it gets worse. According to reports, this administration is now  considering expanding its travel ban to even more countries. Enough is  enough.   Our country already had one of the strongest vetting systems anywhere  in the world. We don't need any arbitrary and offensive bans. We can  tell the difference between a real threat and the student traveling  back to college.   That is why this underlying measure will reverse the bans the  President has put in place over the last 3 years, and it will ensure  people at ports of entry can seek legal advice during the screening  process.   The principle that our diversity is our strength, and the idea that  our country is strengthened by immigration, these are core values of  this  [[Page H1601]]  Democratic majority. That is why we have made this a clear choice and  provided a clean up-or-down vote. No stalling tactics. No partisan  gimmicks. And I think it is an appropriate process because I want to  prevent cynicism and ugliness from being celebrated here on the House  floor.   The administration's rhetoric and, quite frankly, so many people here  on this floor have often demonized immigrants. It is offensive, and it  is not worthy of a debate.   Either you believe we are a nation defined by the Statue of Liberty  welcoming immigrants or one that uses religious discrimination in  immigration decisions. I think this is an easy call.   Also included in this rule, Madam Speaker, is a reauthorization of  the USA FREEDOM Act, as well as a War Powers Resolution led by Senator  Kaine that would require a vote in Congress authorizing the use of  force before the President escalates hostilities in Iran.   Madam Speaker, this Democratic majority promised to take it up if it  passed the Senate, and I am proud that it did, with broad bipartisan  support. This is not a partisan measure. Eight Republicans joined with  Senator Kaine in supporting this War Powers Resolution.   Passage here would send the Kaine resolution directly to the  President's desk.                                time  1230    Madam Speaker, I don't support the FISA reauthorization bill. I  appreciate the bipartisan work that went into trying to fashion a  compromise, but in the final analysis, I, in good conscience, can't  support it.   But on the other matters, make no mistake: This is a historic  opportunity. Congress has a chance to reassert its constitutional  authority over matters of war and peace; to live up to its Article I  responsibility; and to truly respect our troops by giving them the  debate on the future that they deserve, should tensions with Iran  escalate again.   I hope all my colleagues seize it, and I urge a strong vote for this  rule.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, for the record, I want my colleagues to know that  pandemics and instances like the coronavirus are already covered by the  legislation. Nothing in this bill prohibits the President from using  authority under section 212(f) to contain the coronavirus.   This bill allows the President to suspend the entry of a class of  individuals if it is determined that they would undermine the security  or public safety of  [[Page H1602]]  the United States or the preservation of human rights, democratic  processes or institutions, or international stability.   But out of an abundance of caution, the Judiciary Committee added a  clarification clause on page 7 of the NO BAN Act, which clearly states  that the term ``public safety'' includes efforts necessary to contain a  communicable disease of public health significance, as defined in  section 34(2)(b) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations.   So, this has nothing to do with coronavirus. We are taking action on  this bill basically to end the President's discriminatory travel bans.   Madam Speaker, I am quoting from a letter from the ACLU that I will  include in the Record.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                                     March 10, 2020.    Vote ``Yes'' on No Ban Act, Vote ``No'' on Any Amendments or Other                                  Changes         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union (ACLU), and our more than 8 million members,       supporters, and activists, we write to express our support       for the NO BAN Act, though we have concerns about language       that has been added. As the NO BAN Act is scheduled for a       floor vote this week, it is essential that no further changes       be made to the bill--so that this authority cannot be used to       ban whole communities.        We urge you to vote ``YES'' on the NO BAN Act in its       current form and vote ``NO'' on any amendments or other       changes. The ACLU will score this vote.        The ACLU continues to support the version of the NO BAN Act       scheduled for a floor vote this week. However, we have       concerns about recent language included in the bill defining       public safety to address ``communicable disease'' in response       to the current climate and fear around COVID-19       (coronavirus). These changes are unnecessary and further       stigmatize immigrant communities where many are facing       discrimination in the United States given the Trump       administration's stereotypes about communities of color and       immigrants--including in reference to coronavirus. There is a       long history in the United States of inaccurate connections       between health risks and immigrants, which has resulted in       irrational immigration policies and discrimination; we are       not interested in repeating the mistakes of our past. Any       restrictions related to coronavirus, such as those regarding       China and Iran, must be based in science and public health,       not politics or xenophobia.        The NO BAN Act continues to achieve the ultimate goals of       the legislation, which are to rescind the Muslim ban, refugee       Muslim ban, and asylum ban, and make critical changes to the       Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by putting in place a       more stringent standard for presidents invoking any similar       suspension or restriction. During the House Judiciary       Committee markup, the bill was amended to rescind the       President's recently expanded Muslim ban which was issued on       January 31st, and targets more African countries, and       requires visa reporting related to this ban.        Under current law, the executive branch claims the       authority to bar the entry of large groups of people without       effective accountability and without regard for the policies       codified in other parts of the INA. The NO BAN Act would       strengthen limitations on this authority by raising the       standard for invoking it. Rather than the current broad and       undefined standard, the proposed bill would require the       executive branch to meet a more stringent standard--based on       ``specific and credible facts'' that any suspension of or       restriction from entry must be connected to ``specific acts''       that have actually occurred. Furthermore, the bill requires       that any such suspension or restriction meet a compelling       government interest and that the government use the least       restrictive means in doing so.        The NO BAN Act would also establish a system of checks and       balances whereby Congress would be routinely notified and       briefed on the status, implementation and constitutional and       legislative authority of the executive branch's actions.       Finally, the proposed legislation would expand the non-      discrimination provision of the INA to prohibit       discrimination based on religion. While language connecting       these two critical changes to the INA has been removed, the       bill now includes a rule of construction indicating that the       President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Homeland       Security cannot use this authority to act in a manner that is       inconsistent with other policy decisions in immigration law.        This bill is a significant step forward for Muslim       communities and other communities that could be targeted       discriminatorily or without good reason. By creating       substantive standards and accountability, it greatly reduces       the possibility of future bias-based bans.        The ACLU urges you to vote ``YES'' on the NO BAN Act in its       current form and vote ``NO'' on any amendments or other       changes. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,      Ronald Newman,        National Political Director.      Manar Waheed,        Senior Legislative and Advocacy Counsel.     Madam Speaker, one of the things they point out here,  which I want to agree with, is that they say: ``There is a long history  in the United States of inaccurate connections between health risks and  immigrants, which has resulted in irrational immigration policies and  discrimination; we are not interested in repeating the mistakes of our  past. Any restrictions related to coronavirus, such as those regarding  China and Iran, must be based in science and public health, not  politics or xenophobia.''   What a radical idea, to actually base some of these decisions on  science. Yet, we know that this administration doesn't have any regard  for science.   Madam Speaker, I will also include in the Record a May 20 Washington  Post article titled `` `I think Islam hates us': A timeline of Trump's  comments about Islam and Muslims.''                  [From the Washington Post, May 20, 2017]  I Think Islam Hates Us: A Timeline of Trump's Comments About Islam and                                  Muslims                 (By Jenna Johnson and Abigail Hauslohner)         President Trump is in Saudi Arabia this weekend to meet       with Arab leaders, visit the birthplace of Islam and give a       speech about religious tolerance with the hope of resetting       his reputation with the world's 1.6 billion Muslims. But it's       unclear if a two-day visit is enough to overshadow his past       statements about Islam and its faithful, with his rhetoric       becoming more virulent as he campaigned for president.        Here's a look back at some of the comments that he has       made:        March 30, 2011: For years, Trump publicly questioned then-      President Barack Obama's religious beliefs and place of       birth. As he debated running for president in the 2012       election, Trump said in a radio interview: ``He doesn't have       a birth certificate, or if he does, there's something on that       certificate that is very bad for him. Now, somebody told me--      and I have no idea if this is bad for him or not, but perhaps       it would be--that where it says `religion,' it might have       `Muslim.' And if you're a Muslim, you don't change your       religion, by the way.'' (Obama is a Christian, and state       records show he was born in Hawaii.)        Sept. 17, 2015: At a campaign town hall in New Hampshire, a       man in the audience shouted out: ``We have a problem in this       country; it's called Muslims. We know our current president       is one.'' The man mentioned Muslim ``training camps'' and       asked: ``When can we get rid of them?'' Trump responded:       ``We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. You       know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people       are saying that bad things are happening out there. We're       going to be looking at that and plenty of other things.''        Sept. 20, 2015: On NBC News, Trump was asked if he would be       comfortable with a Muslim as president; he responded: ``I can       say that, you know, it's something that at some point could       happen. We will see. I mean, you know, it's something that       could happen. Would I be comfortable? I don't know if we have       to address it right now, but I think it is certainly       something that could happen.''        Sept. 30, 2015: At a New Hampshire rally, Trump pledged to       kick all Syrian refugees--most of whom are Muslim--out of the       country, as they might be a secret army. ``They could be       ISIS, I don't know. This could be one of the great tactical       ploys of all time. A 200,000-man army, maybe,'' he said. In       an interview that aired later, Trump said: ``This could make       the Trojan horse look like peanuts.''        Oct. 21, 2015: On Fox Business, Trump says he would       ``certainly look at'' the idea of closing mosques in the       United States.        Nov. 16, 2015: Following a series of terrorist attacks in       Paris, Trump said on MSNBC that he would ``strongly       consider'' closing mosques. ``I would hate to do it, but it's       something that you're going to have to strongly consider       because some of the ideas and some of the hatred--the       absolute hatred--is coming from these areas,'' he said.        Nov. 20, 2015: In comments to Yahoo and NBC News, Trump       seemed open to the idea of creating a database of all Muslims       in the United States. Later, he and his aides would not rule       out the idea.        Nov. 21, 2015: At a rally in Alabama, Trump said that on       Sept. 11 he ``watched when the World Trade Center came       tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where       thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that       building was coming down.''        Nov. 22, 2015: On ABC News, Trump doubled down on his       comment and added: ``It was well covered at the time. There       were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy       Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came       down. Not good.'' (While there were some reports of       celebrations overseas, extensive examination of news clips       turn up no such celebrations in New Jersey.)        Nov. 30, 2015: On MSNBC, a reporter asked Trump if he       thinks Islam is an inherently peaceful religion that's been       perverted by a small percentage of followers or if it is an       inherently violent religion. Trump responded:  [[Page H1603]]       ``Well, all I can say . . . there's something going on. You       know, there's something definitely going on. I don't know       that that question can be answered.'' He also said: ``We are       not loved by many Muslims.''        Dec. 3, 2015: The morning after Syed Rizwan Farook and       Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.,       Trump called into Fox News and said: ``The other thing with       the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when       you get these terrorists, you have to take out their       families.'' (Killing the relatives of suspected terrorists is       forbidden by international law.) Later, in a speech to the       Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump criticized Obama for not       using the phrase ``radical Islamic terrorism'' and commented:       ``There's something going on with him that we don't know       about.''        Dec. 6, 2015: On CBS News, Trump said: ``If you have people       coming out of mosques with hatred and death in their eyes and       on their minds, we're going to have to do something.'' Trump       also said he didn't believe the sister of one of the San       Bernardino shooters who said she was crestfallen for the       victims, saying: ``I would go after a lot of people, and I       would find out whether or not they knew. I would be able to       find out, because I don't believe the sister.''        Dec. 7, 2015: Trump's campaign issued a statement saying:       ``Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete       shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until       our country's representatives can figure out what is going       on.'' Trump read this statement aloud at a rally in South       Carolina.        Dec. 8, 2015: On CNN, Trump quoted a widely debunked poll       by an anti-Islam activist organization that claimed that a       quarter of the Muslims living in the United States agreed       that violence against Americans is justified as part of the       global jihad. ``We have people out there that want to do       great destruction to our country, whether it's 25 percent or       10 percent or 5 percent, it's too much,'' Trump said.        Dec. 13, 2015: On Fox News, Trump was asked if his ban       would apply to a Canadian businessman who is a Muslim. Trump       responded: ``There's a sickness. They're sick people. There's       a sickness going on. There's a group of people that is very       sick.''        Jan. 12, 2016: At a rally in Iowa, Trump shared his       suspicions about Syrian refugees and then read the lyrics to       Al Wilson's 1968 song ``The Snake,'' the story of a ``tender       woman'' who nursed a sickly snake back to health but then was       attacked by the snake. Trump often read these lyrics at       rallies.        Feb. 3, 2016: Trump criticized Obama for visiting a mosque       in Baltimore and said on Fox News: ``Maybe he feels       comfortable there . . . There are a lot of places he can go,       and he chose a mosque.'' (It was Obama's first visit to a       mosque during his presidency, and it was made in an effort to       encourage religious tolerance in light of growing antiMuslim       sentiment.)        Feb. 20, 2016: After Obama skipped the funeral of Supreme       Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Trump tweeted: ``I wonder if       President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice       Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not       go!'' (Obama did pay his respects when Scalia's body lay in       repose in the Supreme Court.) That night at a rally in South       Carolina, Trump told an apocryphal tale that he would return       to repeatedly about U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing fighting       Muslim insurgents in the Philippines in the early 1900s and       killing a large group of insurgents with bullets dipped in       pigs' blood.        March 9, 2016: On CNN, Trump said: ``I think Islam hates       us. There's something there that--there's a tremendous hatred       there. There's a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the       bottom of it. There's an unbelievable hatred of us.''        March 22, 2016: Soon after three suicide bombings in       Brussels tied to a group of French and Belgian Muslims, Trump       told Fox Business: ``We're having problems with the Muslims,       and we're having problems with Muslims coming into the       country.'' Trump called for surveillance of mosques in the       United States, saying: ``You have to deal with the mosques,       whether we like it or not, I mean, you know, these attacks       aren't coming out of--they're not done by Swedish people.''        On NBC News, Trump added: ``This all happened because,       frankly, there's no assimilation. They are not assimilating .       . . They want to go by sharia law. They want sharia law. They       don't want the laws that we have. They want sharia law.''        March 23, 2016: In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Trump       said that Muslims ``have to respect us. They do not respect       us at all. And frankly, they don't respect a lot of the       things that are happening throughout not only our country,       but they don't respect other things.''        March 29, 2016: During a town hall in Wisconsin, CNN's       Anderson Cooper asked Trump: ``Do you trust Muslims in       America?'' Trump responded: ``Do I what?'' Cooper again       asked: 'Trust Muslims in America?'' Trump responded: ``Many       of them I do. Many of them I do, and some, I guess, we don't.       Some, I guess, we don't. We have a problem, and we can try       and be very politically correct and pretend we don't have a       problem, but, Anderson, we have a major, major problem. This       is, in a sense, this is a war.''        May 20, 2016: On Fox News, Trump said this of Muslims:       ``They're going to have to turn in the people that are       bombing the planes. And they know who the people are. And       we're not going to find the people by just continuing to be       so nice and so soft.''        June 13, 2016: The day after the mass shooting at a gay       nightclub in Orlando, Trump declared in a speech in New       Hampshire that ``radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and       anti-American.'' He criticized his Democratic rival, Hillary       Clinton, for refusing to use the term ``radical Islam'' and       for speaking positively of Islam. ``Hillary Clinton's       catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical       Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only       our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to       radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It's       deadly--totally deadly,'' Trump said. Later he added: ``I       want every American to succeed, including Muslims--but the       Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They       know what's going on.''        June 14, 2016: At a rally in North Carolina, Trump noted       that the Orlando shooter's parents are Muslim Americans who       immigrated from Afghanistan. ``The children of Muslim       American parents, they're responsible for a growing number       for whatever reason a growing number of terrorist attacks,''       he said, adding that immigration from Afghanistan has       increased five-fold. `` . . . Every year we bring in more       than 100,000 lifetime immigrants from the Middle East and       many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. A       number of these immigrants have hostile attitudes.''        June 15, 2016: On Fox News, Trump said this of Muslims who       immigrate to the United States: ``Assimilation has been very       hard. It's almost--I won't say nonexistent, but it gets to be       pretty close. And I'm talking about second and third       generation. They come--they don't--for some reason, there's       no real assimilation.''        July 21, 2016: In accepting the Republican Party's       presidential nomination, Trump focused heavily on ``brutal       Islamic terrorism'' and promised: ``I will do everything in       my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and       oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.''        July 24, 2016: On NBC News, Trump defended his proposal for       a Muslim ban, despite some of his aides insisting he had       rolled it back. ``People were so upset when I used the word       Muslim. `Oh, you can't use the word Muslim,' '' Trump said.       ``. . . But just remember this: Our Constitution is great,       but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit       suicide, okay? Now, we have a religious--you know,       everybody wants to be protected. And that's great. And       that's the wonderful part of our Constitution. I view it       differently. Why are we committing suicide? Why are we       doing that?''        Aug. 11, 2016: At a meeting of evangelical leaders in       Orlando, Trump said: ``If you were a Christian in Syria, it       was virtually impossible to come into the United States. If       you were a Muslim from Syria, it was one of the easier       countries to be able to find your way into the United States.       Think of that. Just think of what that means.''        Aug. 18, 2016: During a rally in North Carolina, Trump said       that ``all applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties       to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who       doesn't share our values and love our people.''        Sept. 19, 2016: At a rally in Florida, Trump reacted to       explosions over the weekend in New York and New Jersey and       said: ``There have been Islamic terrorist attacks in       Minnesota and New York City and in New Jersey. These attacks       and many others were made possible because of our extremely       open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and       screen the individuals and families coming into our country.       Got to be careful.''        Jan. 27, 2017: Within a week of becoming president, Trump       signed an executive order blocking Syrian refugees and       banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from       entering the United States for 90 days. This order goes into       effect immediately, prompting mass chaos at airports,       protests and legal challenges. Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close       adviser to the president, later said on Fox News: ``So when       [Trump] first announced it, he said, `Muslim ban.' He called       me up. He said, `Put a commission together. Show me the right       way to do it legally.' ''        Feb. 28, 2017: Despite urging from some of his Cabinet       members, Trump continues to use the term ``radical Islamic       terrorism,'' including in a speech to a joint session of       Congress.        March 6, 2017: Trump issues a new travel ban for citizens       from six majority-Muslim countries, which is also challenged       in the courts.        April 29, 2017: At a rally celebrating his 100th day in       office, Trump once again dramatically read ``The Snake.''        May 17, 2017: At a commencement ceremony, Trump previewed       his upcoming overseas trip and said: ``I'll speak with Muslim       leaders and challenge them to fight hatred and extremism and       embrace a peaceful future for their faith. And they're       looking very much forward to hearing what we, as your       representative, we have to say. We have to stop radical       Islamic terrorism.''     Madam Speaker, the President's comments and tweets  about Muslims are truly, truly offensive, and I could list everything  he said here today, but it is a long, long list. I think repeating  those words would be a mistake because they are unworthy of this floor.   President Trump's Muslim ban continues a sad and unfortunate history  of  [[Page H1604]]  policies that used immigration law to target people based on their  backgrounds. We have had policies in our history that targeted  immigrants from China, Japan, and Asia, and laws that qualified people  of White descent for naturalization at the expense of everyone else.   Those policies are wrong. They are shameful. And they went against  everything this country stands for. President Trump's Muslim ban  belongs right beside them, in the dustbin of history, as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have high regard for my ranking member, Mr. Cole,  and I know he and I both share enormous respect for this institution,  but I am going to say for the record that this process that we are  using is not unusual. It is a process that was used by Republicans  numerous times during their majority, including 15 times during the  past two Republican-led Congresses, to send bills over to the Senate  for their expedited consideration.   And I will say, with respect to the gentleman, he mentioned that we  were consulted about these processes in the past. I was never consulted  when the Republicans used this process. In fact, I remember a time when  the Republicans basically hijacked a Democratic bill to attach  something to it, without even consulting the sponsor of the bill. So I  am not sure what the gentleman was alluding to, and I don't know what  my friend's intentions were when they utilized this process.   Madam Speaker, I can't speak to the motivations of the previous  majority when they used this process over a dozen times, but what I can  speak to is the impact. Each time this process was used by the  Republican majority, the Democratic minority was unable to offer a  motion to recommit. That is just a fact.   Republicans used this process 15 times over the past two Congresses,  and, you know, I get it. My Republican friends want to have an  opportunity to try to politicize this debate even more around  immigration. But I just want to remind everybody why we are here.   The offensive things that this President has said about immigrants  and about Muslims are unconscionable. These travel bans serve no  purpose other than to discriminate against Muslims and people from  predominantly Muslim countries.   President Trump issued these baseless travel bans under the guise of  national security. But we all know what they are really about. They  fulfill Trump's offensive campaign promise calling for a ``total and  complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.''   Those are the President's words.   These discriminatory bans have a real impact on real people's lives  and have already affected more than 135 million individuals. So that is  why we are debating whether to terminate the travel bans and to stand  up against discrimination and hate without any distractions, without  any political gimmicks.   I know my friends are not happy with that, but we are going to do the  right thing. We are going to stand up to hate and bigotry and  discrimination, and we are going to move this legislation forward, and  everybody will have an up-or-down vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just say for the record, nobody is changing the  MTR. We are using a process that my Republican friends used over a  dozen times in the past, in the last Congress.   Yes, the Rules Committee has an obligation to try to make sure that  we bring important legislation to the floor in a fair and reasonable  process, and we are doing that.   But we also have an obligation----    Madam Speaker, I would prefer not to be interrupted. I  am in the middle of--Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Georgia, because he keeps on interrupting me.    Madam Speaker, I reclaim my time.   Do you know what? The result, when my friends used this process, is  the same. We were not allowed to offer an MTR to any of the bills when  they utilized this process.                                time  1300    And so, I just state that that is just a fact. But the Rules  Committee also has an obligation, and I believe everybody in this House  has an obligation to stand up against bigotry and hate and racism and  religious discrimination, and that is what these underlying bills deal  with.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 16, 2020, The  Guardian article, titled; `` `Trump is deciding who is American': how  the new travel ban is tearing families apart.''                     [From the Guardian, Feb. 16, 2020]   Trump Is Deciding Who Is American: How the New Travel Ban Is Tearing                               Families Apart                              (By Sean Levin)         It started out as a joyous day for Olumide. On 31 January,       the 32-year-old Nigerian American learned in an email that       the US was finally processing the visa applications of his       wife and daughter in Nigeria.        Hours later, Donald Trump shattered their celebration,       announcing that he was adding six countries to the travel       ban, including Nigeria. The decision cuts off pathways to       permanent US residency for Nigerians, throwing Olumide's case       into limbo at the final stage of the process. It leaves his       wife and and 11-year-old girl stuck across an ocean with       little hope of making it to the US.        ``This is inhuman,'' said Olumide, a systems analyst and US       military veteran who  [[Page H1606]]       served in Afghanistan and lives in Washington DC. He asked to       use his middle name out of fear he might jeopardize his case.       ``As a soldier, I understand the need to protect the country.       But to completely shut the doors . . . it's just plain       wrong.''           Millions of Africans now banned: `We are not criminals'         Trump's January order builds on the 2017 travel ban that       has continued to target five Muslim-majority countries, and       significantly restricts permanent residency for nationals       from Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Myanmar. It also blocks       people from Tanzania and Sudan from obtaining green cards       through the ``diversity visa'' lottery.        Just like the 2017 restrictions, it blocks permanent       immigration from the targeted countries, making limited       exceptions if applicants prove that denials would cause       ``undue hardship'' and that granting them visas would support       ``national interest''.        The original ban already resulted in denied visas for more       than 42,000 people, the majority from Iran. The addition of       the new countries has doubled the number of Muslims targeted       across the globe to roughly 320 million, advocates estimate.       Roughly one-quarter of all Africans are now affected. The       restrictions now apply to 13 countries, including Nigeria,       home to Africa's largest population and economy. It cuts off       countries where some are fleeing violence. Some estimate the       new ban, which goes into effect on 21 February, could hinder       more than 12,000 immigrants seeking to resettle in the US and       reunite with family in the next year.        The restrictions are a signature component of Trump's       aggressive anti-immigrant agenda, which has included curbs on       legal migration, a destruction of theAmerican asylum system,       an all-time low cap on refugees, expanded detention and mass       deportations.        ``Trump started out by scapegoating Muslims in 2017,'' said       Javeria Jamil, attorney with Asian Americans Advancing       Justice's Asian Law Caucus, who has been fielding calls from       families affected by the new ban. ``Now, it's not just the       Muslim ban. It has turned into an African ban.''        The Trump administration has claimed that the ban, which       blindsided some diplomats, is a national security measure,       and that the added countries failed to meet US security and       information-sharing standards.        But immigrant rights groups said the policy is a political       maneuver amid Trump's reelection campaign--and one that will       have profound consequences.        ``People are in turmoil,'' said Audu Kadiri, a 43-year-old       community organizer who left Nigeria in 2014. He had planned       to bring his mother to the US, but the ban may make that       impossible. The activist, who now lives in the Bronx, hasn't       yet told his mother about Trump's order, because he doesn't       know how to break the news. ``There is so much collateral       damage, it's hard to quantify.''        In Nigeria, Kadiri was an LGBTQ+ rights advocate who worked       on HIV prevention and other human rights issues. He was       forced to flee due to his activism and sought asylum in the       US. It's now unsafe for him to return to Nigeria, which is       why he wants his 68- year-old mother to come to the US.        He hasn't seen her since 2014 and, if Trump is re-elected,       he fears it will be at least another five years before they       reunite. She'll probably miss the birth of his third child.        ``Nigerians have contributed to the development of this       country, like every immigrant community,'' he said. ``We are       not criminals.''                      Torn Apart, With Dwindling Options         Before the January announcement, the Trump administration       had already clamped down on travel from Africa, including       hikes in visa fees, and new obstacles and increased denials       for Nigerians seeking approval for short-term visits. The US       further suspended visitor visas from Eritrea in 2017.        That means families have been fighting for years to use the       dwindling avenues available to them to reunite, and for those       who have invested significant time and money into the       process, the sudden news of an outright ban was particularly       brutal.        ``There's nothing you can do, and it makes you feel so       helpless,'' said Olumide, the veteran. Olumide arrived in the       US from Nigeria when he was 10 years old. He met his wife in       Nigeria in 2012 after he left the military, and the two got       married last year.        US Citizenship and Immigration Services approved the       petition for his wife and daughter in January, just before       the announcement of the ban. But they don't yet have their       visas--and the ban may make it impossible to get them.        Olumide had hoped they would be starting their lives       together in the US by now, and said he was pained by feelings       of guilt: ``I made promises to her.'' The couple hasn't fully       processed the news, he added: ``We don't want to think about       not being together.''        He noted that his daughter has typhoid and his wife has       malaria, and he constantly fears for their health and safety.        Hana Mohamed, a 20-year-old student in San Diego, who grew       up in Sudan, said she was eager for her grandparents to come       to the US, especially so her grandmother could get medical       care in California: ``It's just so sad and frustrating. They       are getting older, and I want to see them before anything       happens.''        Mohamed said it was difficult to accept that the US was       banning large groups of Muslims in the name of safety while       seeming to do little about the ongoing terror threat of       American mass shootings: ``It's just so shocking that we have       come to this day where a whole nation of people are getting       discriminated against. Isn't the purpose of the United States       to stand up for everyone who is getting hurt and treat them       right?''        One Eritrean American who works as an engineer in Silicon       Valley, and requested anonymity for fear of hurting his       family's case, has petitioned for his mother to come live       with him in the US and was hoping she would soon get an       interview date at the embassy. Then the new ban was unveiled.        ``We've waited our turn. We've followed the law. I'm a tax-      paying citizen contributing to the economy,'' he said, noting       that his mother is 69 years old and lives alone in Eritrea.       ``This is just pure evil.''        He said he felt Trump was implementing the ban as a       ``soundbite for the campaign'' while disregarding that it       would leave Eritreans like his mother with no options: ``This       was our only hope to get her here.''        For Eritreans, the ban comes as as the Trump administration       has ramped up deportations of Eritrean asylum seekers,       despite the US government's own acknowledgment of the torture       and arbitrary detention Eritreans are currently facing.        Abraham Zere, an Eritrean journalist who was granted asylum       in the US and now lives in Ohio, said it seemed some       Eritreans were reluctant to speak out about the ban and live       in fear of potential repercussions from both governments:       ``People are scared to even discuss it.''        Zere's own family is affected: his mother is still in       Eritrea, separated from her children. She can't even video       chat with her family because of the poor internet in Eritrea,       which means she never gets to see her granddaughter, an       eight-year-old she hasn't yet met, he said.        Some warn the ban may have life-or-death consequences. For       queer and transgender migrants in the targeted countries, it       could lead them to embark on perilous journeys to escape to       the US as they run out of options, said Zack Mohamed, who is       Somali American and a member of the Black LGBTQIA+ Migrant       Project: ``This is a big `not welcome' sign in front of our       faces.''        In response to questions about the impact on migrants       fleeing violence, a US state department spokesperson said the       ban was not meant to ``limit the ability of an individual to       seek asylum'', adding: ``Our first priority remains national       security. We continue to work with our dedicated consular       officers in the field to identify and expedite those       individuals with urgent travel needs.''        Asked about charges that the ban is discriminatory, the       spokesperson said the restrictions are based on       ``nationality'' and ``visa category'' and that ``consular       officers do not adjudicate based on religion''. The       spokesperson said there were specific criteria to determine       which countries are restricted and noted that Chad was on the       original list but removed in 2018.                           Fighting to end the ban         With the first travel ban upheld by the US supreme court,       there are few recourses left to challenge the policy.       Advocates are hoping a Democratic president will immediately       repeal the ban and have also recently renewed the push for       Congress to pass the No Ban Act, which would end the ban and       prevent discriminatory immigration policies.        Until then, Trump will continue to use his executive power       to try to redefine what it means to be a citizen, advocates       warned.        ``The president of the United States, the US government is       explicitly trying to decide who gets to be an American,''       said Eric Naing, who is Burmese American and works with       Muslim Advocates, a group that has challenged the ban. His       family would not have been able to come to the US if the ban       on Myanmar had been in place. ``He's saying I shouldn't be       American. My parents shouldn't be American. It's deeply       upsetting.''        Olumide noted that the ban was punishing countless American       citizens like him: ``It's hurting the exact people you're       trying to protect.''     Madam Speaker, the President's travel ban isn't just  bad policy, it is cruel. And it is tearing families apart.   That includes veterans who have served our Nation, some of whom were  in the middle of the process of bringing their families to America when  this policy came down. Now they worry their loved ones may never be  able to join them here in the United States, all because of a  completely arbitrary Muslim ban.   One veteran said in this piece, ``As a soldier, I understand the need  to protect the country. But to completely shut the doors . . . it's  just plain wrong.''   These veterans aren't trying to endanger our country, Madam Speaker,  they put their lives on the line to protect it. But this is the kind of  real-life impact we are seeing. The President's ban is not just  offensive, it is actively separating loved ones, including those who  have served this country on the battlefield. I mean, it is time to say:  ``Enough.''  [[Page H1607]]    My friends like to talk about how they support our troops and our  veterans. Well, this policy is adversely impacting so many of our  veterans.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a February 2, 2020, New York  Times article, titled, ``New U.S. Travel Ban Shuts Door on Africa's  Biggest Economy, Nigeria.''                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2020]    New U.S. Travel Ban Shuts Door on Africa's Biggest Economy, Nigeria                   (By Ruth Maclean and Abdi Latif Dahir)         The newlyweds had already been apart for half their       yearlong marriage. Miriam Nwegbe was in Nigeria. Her husband       was in Baltimore, and until she could join him, everything       was on hold: finding a home together, trying for their first       baby, becoming an American family.        Then, on Friday, their lives were thrown into disarray by       the expansion of President Trump's ban on immigration to       include six new countries, including four in Africa. Nigeria,       the continent's most populous nation, was one of them.        ``America has killed me,'' Ms. Nwegbe's husband, Ikenna, an       optometrist, texted her when he heard. ``We are finished.''        A year after the Trump administration announced that a       major pillar of its new strategy for Africa was to counter       the growing influence of China and Russia by expanding       economic ties to the continent, it slammed the door shut on       Nigeria, the continent's biggest economy.        The travel restrictions also apply to three other African       countries--Sudan, Tanzania, and Eritrea--as well as to       Myanmar, which is accused of genocide against its Muslim       population, and Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet state.        The ban will prevent thousands of people from being able to       move to the United States.        The initial ban, which was put into effect in 2017,       restricted travel from some Muslim-majority countries as part       of Mr. Trump's plan to keep out ``radical Islamic       terrorists.'' It has already affected more than 135 million       people--many of them Christians--from seven countries.        With the new expansion, the ban will affect nearly a       quarter of the 1.2 billion people on the African continent,       according to W. Gyude Moore, a visiting fellow at the Center       for Global Development, a research group, potentially taking       a heavy toll on African economies--and on America's image in       the region.        ``Chinese, Turkish, Russian, and British firms, backed by       their governments, are staking positions on a continent that       will define the global economy's future,'' he said, adding,       ``One hopes that the United States would follow suit and       fully engage with the continent--but that hope fades.''        The rationale for the new restrictions varies depending on       country, but the White House announcement said that most of       the six countries added to the list did not comply with       identity-verification and information-sharing rules.        And Nigeria, it said, posed a risk of harboring terrorists       who may seek to enter the United States. The country has been       hit brutally by the Islamist group Boko Haram, though the       extremists have shown little sign that they have the       capability to export their fight overseas.        Critics, many of whom also denounced the initial ban, saw       something far more venal at play.        ``Trump's travel bans have never been rooted in national       security--they're about discriminating against people of       color,'' Senator Kamala Harris, the former Democratic       presidential candidate, declared on Sunday. ``They are,       without a doubt, rooted in anti-immigrant, white supremacist       ideologies.''        Two Democrats still in the race also weighed in. Elizabeth       Warren described the measure as a ``racist, xenophobic Muslim       ban.'' Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called it       ``a disgrace.''        And Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, said Democratic       lawmakers would push ahead with a measure to forbid religious       discrimination in immigration policy.        Beyond those people who may now never make it across       American borders, the new ban could also affect millions who       have no plans to travel to the United States themselves but       may have benefited from the billions of dollars in       remittances visa holders send home each year.        The United States may also emerge a loser, studies suggest.       Nigerians are among the most successful and highly educated       immigrants to America. (Mr. Trump, demanding to know why       immigration policies did not favor people from countries like       Norway, once disparaged those from Africa and Haiti, and said       Nigerians would never go back to their ``huts'' if they were       allowed in.)        Hadiza Aliyu lives in Borno, the Nigerian state at the       epicenter of the Boko Haram crisis that has left tens of       thousands dead. But she thought she had found a way out.        Ms. Aliyu was preparing to apply to move to the United       States, where she once studied and where her two brothers       live.        She was furious when she heard about the extended ban.        ``Trump has been looking for a way to get at us Africans       for a very long time, and finally got us,'' Ms. Aliyu said.       ``To hell with Republicans and their supremacist ideas.''        Mika Moses moved to Minnesota from Nigeria nine years ago       to join his mother and siblings, who were allowed entry after       the family was attacked in religious riots in their northern       city of Kaduna in 1991. His wife, Juliet, and their       daughter were planning to join him, but are stuck in       Kaduna, where Ms. Moses sells soda in a small store.        She said they were heartbroken by the news that the move       would now be impossible.        ``I have been struggling to raise our daughter alone,'' she       said. ``Why would Trump do this to us, after we have waited       for nine years?''        Nigerians already living in the United States have been       calling lawyers to try to figure out whether they will have       to leave. Marilyn Eshikena, a biomedical research ethicist,       has lived in the United States for the past seven years, but       her visa expires this year. Her employer sponsored her       application for a green card.        ``If it turns out that everything needs to stop, they will       feel cheated, because they spent a lot of money on this       process,'' Ms. Eshikena said. ``I will also feel cheated,       because all the time that I spent working here will       ultimately be for nothing. I can't even imagine what packing       up and leaving will mean for me.''        Her departure may also have serious consequences for her       brother, who is studying in Canada. Ms. Eshikena has been       sending part of her earnings to help pay his rent.        Some Nigerians praised Mr. Trump for his decision, arguing       it might make it more difficult for those responsible for       stealing government money back home to find cover in the       United States, and force the country's leaders to be more       honest and work harder to develop Nigeria.        In 2018, 7,922 immigrant visas were issued to Nigerians. Of       these, 4,525 went to the immediate relatives of American       citizens, and another 2,820 to other family members. An       estimated 345,000 people born in Nigeria were living in the       United States in 2017, according to the census bureau.        If the visas are coveted in Nigeria, they are just as       prized in African countries like Eritrea, where government       repression is rampant and those who try to leave face       obstacles and danger. With more than 500,000 refugees living       outside the country, Eritrea was the ninth-largest source of       refugees in the world in 2018, according to the United       Nations, but fewer than 900 Eritreans received immigrant       visas to the United States that year.        Abraham Zere, a journalist who moved to the United States       from Eritrea in 2012, had dreamed of living in the same       country as his mother since leaving home. On Saturday, he       said his plans to bring her to the United States had been       thrown into disarray. His family has been in constant       communication on the messaging platform WhatsApp trying to       understand what the ban will mean for them.        ``This decision complicates everything and creates fear,''       said Mr. Zere, 37, a doctoral candidate at the School of       Media Arts and Studies at Ohio University.        Mr. Zere and other Eritreans say they can't go back. They       fear they will be punished for criticizing the government or       leaving without approval.        ``If I can't be reunited with my mother,'' Mr. Zere said,       ``it nullifies the whole notion of protection and punishes       innocent citizens for reasons they had no slightest part       in.''        With nine siblings scattered across Europe, Africa, and the       United States, Mr. Zere said their family has never had a       full family portrait taken.        The economic consequences of the ban could be far-reaching,       experts said.        ``Being cut off from the largest economy in the world       systematically is problematic,'' said Nonso Obikili, a       Nigerian economist.        The biggest impact, he said, could be on remittances.        Nigerians abroad send home billions of dollars each year,       $24 billion in 2018 alone, according to the accounting firm       PwC. With Nigeria's economy highly dependent on oil and its       unemployment rate at 23 percent, this money provides a       lifeline for millions of its citizens.        The new restrictions come at a time when the United States       says it wants to jockey for power in Africa, particularly       through its ``Prosper Africa'' initiative announced last       summer, which aims to double two-way trade and investment.        ``If on the one hand you're trying to make a push into       Africa, and on the other hand you're barring the largest       African country by population from moving to your country,       then it does send mixed signals,'' Mr. Obikili said.        In January 2017, Mr. Trump's travel ban targeted several       other African nations, including Chad, Libya, and Somalia.       Chad was later removed from that list, but the executive       order halted the plans of thousands of Somali refugees living       in camps in Kenya who were about to travel to the United       States and start new lives.        According to the United States Department of Homeland       Security, nearly 30,000 Nigerians overstayed their       nonimmigrant visas in 2018. The number of Nigerians visiting       the United States dropped sharply after the Trump       administration made it harder for visitors to obtain visas       last summer.        The new restrictions affect those who want to move to the       United States, not visit it.        The six countries newly added to the immigration ban are       not easily categorized together by religion. Nigeria, for       example is thought to be home to more than 200 million       people, roughly half of them Muslim and half Christian. Of       the four African countries  [[Page H1608]]       newly singled out, only Sudan has a significant majority of       Muslims.        The United States has left Sudan on a list of state       sponsors of terrorism, even as the country works to reverse       decades of authoritarian rule under President Omar Hassan al-      Bashir, who was deposed in April.        ``This ban contributes to the overall impression that Sudan       remains a very fragile state,'' said Cameron Hudson, a senior       fellow with the Atlantic Council, a research group.        Many people from the countries newly targeted by the ban       said the uncertainty was the hardest thing to bear. Ms.       Nwegbe, the newlywed, who works as the chief operating       officer of a tourism company that tries to encourage people       to visit Africa, said the ban came as she and her husband       were building their future.        ``We're in limbo and our relationship is suffering,'' she       said. ``This is unnecessary hardship.''     Madam Speaker, the President's ban is not about  national security, it is about targeting immigrants from predominantly  Muslim countries.   In 2017, the President issued an executive order that banned foreign  nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United  States. Then earlier this year, he went even further, expanding the  travel ban to six more countries.   This is affecting over 300 million people on the African Continent  and refugees from Myanmar, where the Muslim minority is facing a  genocide--genocide, Madam Speaker.   This administration is closing the door on the very people who are  struggling to survive. That is not the America that I know. That is not  an American value. We need to act to defend our values.   Madam Speaker, I just want to point out to my colleagues that what is  in place right now, what this White House has done, I think by any  objective or reasonable measure, is wrong. It reflects badly on who we  are as a country. It is not just. It is not fair. It is so wrong.   And we all--I don't care what our political persuasion may be, I  don't care whether you support the President in his reelection bid or  not--I mean, we have to do what is right for our country. This is doing  great damage to who we are. It represents the kind of closed- mindedness, and the kind of bigotry that we should all be fighting  against.   Madam Speaker, I hope my friends will vote for the rule and vote for  this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to remind the distinguished minority  leader that in the last Congress my Republican friends used this exact  same process 15 times, and it ended up denying us a motion to recommit.   But I also want to say, I don't need any lectures about how this  House should be run from the distinguished gentleman from California. I  remind my friends on both sides of the aisle that in the last Congress  when the Republicans were in charge, it was the most closed Congress in  the history of the United States of America.   No other Congress in our history had more closed rules where Members  were denied the ability to offer anything on the House floor. And my  friends somehow take that as a great sign of--I don't want to go back  to those days.   Madam Speaker, I will just say one other thing. The distinguished  minority leader made the statement that somehow this bill that we are  trying to bring forward somehow would make this country less safe.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article that appeared in  the New York Times, titled ``Trump's Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists,  has Blocked Doctors.''                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 6, 2017]        Trump's Travel Ban, Aimed at Terrorists, Has Blocked Doctors                         (By Donald G. McNeil Jr.)         The Trump administration has mounted a vigorous defense of       its ban on travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, saying       it is necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the       United States. But the ban, now blocked by a federal judge,       also ensnared travelers important to the well-being of many       Americans: doctors.        Foreign-born physicians have become crucial to the delivery       of medical care in the United States. They work in small       towns where there are no other doctors, in poor urban       neighborhoods and in Veterans Affairs hospitals.        Foreign-born physicians ``are the doctors in small towns in       Maine and Iowa,'' said Dr. Patricia F. Walker, the associate       director of the University of Minnesota's Global Health       Pathway, which helps refugee doctors practice in the United       States.        ``They go to the places where graduates of Harvard Medical       School don't want to go,'' she said.        Across the United States, more than 15,000 doctors are from       the seven Muslim-majority countries covered by the travel       ban, according to The Medicus Firm, a firm that recruits       doctors for hard-to-fill jobs. That includes almost 9,000       from Iran, almost 3,500 from Syria and more than 1,500 from       Iraq.        Dr. Hooman Parsi, an oncologist so talented that he has an       O-1 visa granted to individuals with ``extraordinary ability       or achievement,'' was to start seeing patients on Wednesday       in San Bernardino, Calif.        A federal judge in Seattle lifted the administration's       travel ban on Friday, and a federal appeals court has       declined to restore it. Yet Dr. Parsi is still stuck in Iran,       waiting for a delayed visa amid the confusion while his       American employer fumes.        ``We need him desperately,'' said Dr. Richy Agajanian, the       managing partner of the Oncology Institute of Hope and       Innovation, which had just hired him. ``We had an office       completely constructed--we spent three months on it, and it       was supposed to open Feb. 1. Now we can't open it. This is       really sad and frustrating.''        The 30-doctor practice does a lot of work in the Inland       Empire, in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, Dr.       Agajanian noted. ``It's very sparse in doctors out there--      many miles between oncologists,'' he said. ``The patients he       would be seeing have to travel another 25 miles now. Our       doctors are already overworked, and now they'll have to be on       call more often.''        The United States has a persistent doctor shortage, even       though 31 new medical schools have opened since 2002 and many       existing ones have increased class sizes, according to       Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based medical recruiting firm.        It also noted that there are 22 percent more residencies       available each year than there are American graduates to take       them. Graduates of foreign medical schools now fill that gap;       the largest number come from India, followed by Pakistan,       China, the Philippines, Iran and Israel.        (Iran is on Mr. Trump's exclusion list; Pakistan, a Muslim-      majority country with a history of internal and external       terror attacks, is not.)        Many foreign graduates have J-1 visas, which give them       about three years to complete their residencies. ``They must       pass licensing exams and they must do a residency to practice       here, even if they're superstars where they come from,'' said       Phillip Miller, a Merritt Hawkins spokesman.        Foreign-born graduates have often worked at world-class       institutions and have published academic papers, so they have       higher average scores than American graduates on the medical       knowledge portions of the licensing examinations, according       to Merritt Hawkins research--though most initially score       lower on the clinical skills portions, which include English       and communication skills.        ``I had to work my butt off to get here,'' said Dr.       Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year resident at the University       of Minnesota. ``They only take the top graduates from schools       in countries like mine.''  [[Page H1610]]         Such foreign-born graduates must return home when their       visas expire, but they can get extensions if they agree to       work in an area that the Department of Health and Human       Services considers ``medically underserved,'' which is       roughly defined as having less than one primary care doctor       for every 3,000 people.        Those who practice in an underserved area for several years       can apply for green cards. ``After that, they can practice       anywhere, but at least you've had three or four years of a       physician in your town, and that's pretty significant,'' Mr.       Miller said.        Citing figures from the Iowa Board of Medicine, The Des       Moines Register reported last week that 172 doctors       practicing in Iowa were from the seven countries subject to       Mr. Trump's travel ban, and that 23 percent of the state's       13,000 practicing doctors were born outside the United       States.        Andrea Clement, a spokeswoman for Medicus, said that 76       percent of the foreign doctors it placed last year had gone       to areas with fewer than 25,000 people or to small to medium-      size cities of 25,000 to 500,000.        It placed more foreign doctors in Wisconsin than in any       other state, she said, followed by California, Texas,       Maryland, Oregon, Missouri, Tennessee, Ohio and Arizona.        Some urban areas are medically underserved, too. While       Manhattan's Upper East Side has five times the number of       doctors it needs to be adequately served under federal       guidelines, parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn have acute doctor       shortages.        More than 150,000 residents of Brooklyn's Bedford-      Stuyvesant section, for example, are rated as medically       underserved under federal guidelines. One of the doctors       stranded overseas last week, according to Pro Publica, was       Dr. Kamal Fadlalla, an internal medicine specialist from       Sudan who is a second-year resident at Interfaith Medical       Center, which serves Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.        Many foreign-born doctors, experts said, go into family       medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, general surgery and       other front-line specialties where they see thousands of       patients a year, including many on Medicare and Medicaid,       rather than pursuing lucrative urban specialties like plastic       surgery.        As an oncologist, Dr. Parsi was an exception. He moved to       the United States in 2007 for postdoctoral work in molecular       biology. Then, after passing his medical exam, he completed       his residency at the University of Cincinnati and a       fellowship in hematology and oncology at the University of       Pittsburgh Medical Center.        Because he had to leave the country to get his new visa       stamped into his passport, he had flown to Dubai, in the       United Arab Emirates. He cleared a security vetting there, he       said, but had to wait a few days for the visa, so he flew to       Tehran to see his father.        But the new court ruling affects only those who had current       visa stamps in their passport, so even though he is being       issued a new visa, he still cannot return to the United       States, he said on Saturday.        ``Everyone, including me, would like to keep the bad people       out,'' said Dr. Naeem Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is       finishing his medical residency in Minneapolis and plans to       begin a cardiology fellowship in Chicago in the fall. ``But       this is not the best way to do it. If I have to leave, it       affects my patients.''        Dr. El Rafei said that the ban, which means he cannot go       home to see his family, had depressed him.        ``I felt like I was back in Syria again,'' he said. ``You       feel hunted there, as if you did something wrong, even if you       didn't. Now I feel the same way here.''        He sees patients one day a week at the V.A. Hospital in       Minneapolis, where he is sometimes asked where he is from.        ``One of my patients, he was a veteran in his 60s, said to       me, `Why do you people hate us?' '' he said. ``I told him       about Syria. I said: `We don't hate you. The bad people you       see on TV are the same people who make us suffer, too.' ''        ``I love this country,'' he added. ``There's a time in our       residency when we can work in Africa or someplace. I want to       work in a small American town, to show people that we're not       all bad. The U.S. gives us a lot, so we want to give back       what we can.''        Correction: Feb. 6, 2017        An earlier version of this article misattributed a       quotation about the preparation necessary for a foreign       doctor to get work in the United States. It was said by Dr.       Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year resident at the University       of Minnesota, not Dr. Naeem Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is       finishing his medical residency in Minneapolis.        Correction: Feb. 25, 2017        An article on Feb. 6 about the effect of the Trump       administration's ban on travel from seven majority-Muslim       nations on foreign-born doctors in the United States       described incorrectly the physicians seeing patients in rural       settings. Forty-two percent of doctor visits in these areas       are handled by family physicians, not by foreign-born       physicians. (The figure for foreign-born physicians is not       known.)     It says: ``Foreign-born physicians have become crucial  to the delivery of medical care in the United States. They work in  small towns where there are no other doctors, in poor urban  neighborhoods and in Veterans' Affairs hospitals.''   It also says: ``Across the United States, more than 15,000 doctors  are from the seven Muslim-majority countries covered by the travel ban,  according to The Medicus Firm, a firm that recruits doctors for hard- to-fill jobs. That includes almost 9,000 from Iran, almost 3,500 from  Syria, and more than 1,500 from Iraq.''   I didn't hear a single word about that. I didn't hear a single word  about how denying doctors the ability to come here is somehow in our  national interest. Not a single word objecting to the hate-filled  rhetoric coming out of this White House denigrating Muslims.   We have a President who bragged about trying to put in place a Muslim  ban. I mean, we have a lot of talk on this floor about the need for  religious freedom and to speak out against discrimination against  individuals based on their religion, and yet, not a word about that.   So, what we are doing by bringing these bills to the floor, we are  standing up for American values, we are rejecting bigotry, we are  rejecting hate, we are rejecting intolerance.   Madam Speaker, I hope all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  will support our effort.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished minority  leader's question. I would just say to him that the letter that he  referred to, I read about it in the press. I didn't receive it until  last night.   I will also say to him, again, this consultation that he talks about  is something that none of us have any recollection of.   In fact, I remember when the Republicans hijacked the Democratic bill  to basically deny us a motion to recommit. We were never consulted  about that.   I would simply say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that  this is about whether or not we are going to stand and tolerate a  policy that I think by any measure is bigoted and, quite frankly,  undermines our values.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. In addition to the NO BAN bill, there is also a War Powers  Resolution bill that will be made in order if this rule passes.   I include in the Record a February 14 New York Times article, titled:  ``White House Memo Justifying Suleimani Strike Cites No Imminent  Threat.''                  [From The New York Times, Feb. 14, 2020]   White House Memo Justifying Suleimani Strike Cites No Imminent Threat                            (By Catie Edmondson)         Washington.--The White House told Congress on Friday that       President Trump authorized the strike last month that killed       Iran's most important general to respond to attacks that had       already taken place and deter future ones, contradicting the       president's claim that he acted in response to an imminent       threat.        In a legally mandated, two-page unclassified memo to       lawmakers, the White House asserted that the strike that       killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was ``in response to an       escalating series of attacks in preceding months'' by Iran       and Iran-backed militias.        ``The purposes of this action were to protect United States       personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting       further attacks against United States forces and interests,       to degrade Iran's and Quds Force-backed militias's ability to       conduct attacks, and to end Iran's strategic escalation of       attacks,'' said the report, which was transmitted on Friday       to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.        The document confirmed what lawmakers had privately       suspected as the Trump administration has offered a shifting       set of justifications for the strike against General       Suleimani in Baghdad--taken with no congressional       consultation--which brought the United States and Iran to the       brink of war.        ``This official report directly contradicts the president's       false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent       attack against United States personnel and embassies,''       Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of       the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement. ``The       administration's explanation in this report makes no mention       of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the       president offered to the American people was false, plain and       simple.''        In the days after the strike that killed General Suleimani,       administration officials gave a variety of rationales for the       action as they confronted questions about why the president       undertook such a provocative move that could incite an       escalation with a dangerous rival. Mr. Trump and other top       officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said the       strike was conducted in response to imminent threats to       American lives, but they declined to provide any evidence,       leaving lawmakers in both parties irate.        Pressed over several days, Mr. Pompeo conceded that the       United States did not have specific intelligence on where or       when an attack would take place. Mr. Trump claimed that four       American embassies had been targeted for attacks, but under       questioning during a television interview, Mark T. Esper, the       secretary of defense, said he had seen no evidence of that.        Mr. Trump later insisted on Twitter that General Suleimani       had, in fact, been planning an imminent attack on United       States forces, but added, ``it doesn't really matter because       of his horrible past!''        Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican       on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that       ``U.S. intelligence indicated Soleimani was plotting more       attacks on Americans and he was an authorized target in Iraq       because of the ongoing threat he posed to Americans there.''        ``The administration would have been `culpably negligent'       if they hadn't acted,'' Mr. McCaul said, quoting Gen. Mark A.       Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``It is       unfortunate that Democrats continue to criticize the       president for a successful U.S. military strike of this       brutal terrorist with American blood on his hands.''        The report on Friday came a day after the Senate passed a       resolution aimed at restraining Mr. Trump's war-making powers       with Iran. The rare bipartisan vote illustrated the depth of       the skepticism in both parties about the president's       strategy, and lawmakers' frustration with the       administration's refusal to consult Congress on military       matters. The House is expected to pass the measure soon,       sending it to the president's desk. Mr. Trump's advisers have       said he will veto it.        The White House infuriated lawmakers in early January when       it sent Congress a formal notification of the drone strikes       required under the War Powers Act. Lawmakers had expected it       to lay out a legal justification for the strike, but the       entire document was classified, and officials who read it       said it contained no information on future threats or an       imminent attack.        Lawmakers were further angered by a series of briefings       delivered by top administration officials that they described       as insulting and demeaning, complaining that they were       dismissed for questioning the administration's strategy.        Friday's report also only discussed previous acts of       aggression by Iran. It cited as a legal framework the       president's constitutional powers as commander in chief and       the authorization for the use of military force in Iraq that       Congress passed in 2002, using two justifications the       administration has previously mentioned.        ``Iran's past and recent activities, coupled with       intelligence at the time of the airstrike, indicated that       Iran's Quds force posed a threat to the United States in       Iraq,'' the report said.        Congressional Democrats have coalesced behind a new push to       repeal the 2002 law, which was passed to authorize a military       response to Saddam Hussein and his government. They said Mr.       Trump's broad reading of it illustrated how the statute has       been stretched and distorted to accommodate missions that       Congress never envisioned when it was debated.        ``To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could       justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far       beyond anything Congress ever intended,'' Mr. Engel said.        The House last month voted to repeal the 2002 law, with       lawmakers in both parties arguing that the authorization had       become outdated and been abused by presidents as a blank       check to circumvent Congress in taking military action.       During negotiations on the annual defense policy bill, the       White House, focused on creating the Space Force as the sixth       branch of military and maintaining the ability to divert       military construction funds to pay for the border wall, was       initially open to repealing the 2002 law, but the Pentagon       intervened.     Madam Speaker, Congress has been clear, we did not  authorize the President's, in my opinion, reckless actions, nor have we  provided any authorization for the use of force against Iran.   What we are hearing from the administration, on the other hand, has  been about as clear as mud. Initially, President Trump and other  administration officials claimed the January strike was in response to  an imminent threat.   Now we have confirmed through a legally mandated report to Congress  from the administration that that was not the case.   This report made no mention of imminent threat, confirming the fact  that President Trump was legally required to come to Congress for  approval before carrying out the strike.   The President may not like it, but the Constitution is clear: The  President must seek specific authorization from Congress for any use of  force against Iran, period.   And I would just simply say that this shouldn't be controversial  because, whether you support the President extending military  operations against  [[Page H1612]]  Iran or not, we should all agree that Congress has a constitutional  responsibility here.   I want to commend my friends in the Senate for passing the Kaine  resolution, and I thank the eight Republicans who stood up for the  institution and for Congress' constitutional authorities. I point that  out, as well, and I hope that my colleagues will support the rule and  support the Kaine resolution when it comes up for a vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle want us to  get lost on the process, but we can't lose sight of the policy. This is  about whether Congress should repeal President Trump's Muslim ban, and  we don't agree--I would say, respectfully, to my colleague--on the  Rules Committee.   This is about whether we should prevent this administration from  putting in place more discriminatory travel bans in the future, whether  individuals deserve access to legal advice during the screening process  at ports of entry, and whether Congress should vote before any  escalation in hostilities with Iran.   That is what is before us in the rule today. These are incredibly  important issues. They go to the heart of what America is supposed to  be about.   Now, some on the other side are upset that they can't use certain  parliamentary procedures to debate all kinds of divisive issues.  Instead, they want to make this debate about anything other than the  President's reckless foreign policy. I get that, but we are not going  to get distracted here.   This President is already looking at expanding his cruel travel ban.  His approach abroad is totally unpredictable, and either you are going  to stand up for America and stand up for our values, or you are going  to stand by the President. That is the choice before us.   For us, the choice is clear. I have constituents who have been  adversely impacted, whose lives have been ripped apart by this  President's immigration policies. It is heartbreaking. It is not who we  are. And, for whatever reason, the President continues down this road  of dividing this country along racial lines, along religious lines, I  mean, you name it--constant division.   Enough. Enough. We are better than that. We are better than that.   I hope that there is a strong bipartisan vote in support of the No  Muslim Ban Act. This is not who we are. We can't let this be who we  are.   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.    Madam Speaker, when the Committee on Rules filed its  report (H. Rept. 116-415) to accompany House Resolution 891, the  Committee was unaware that the waiver of all points of order against  consideration of the H.R. 6172 included a waiver of Clause 9 of rule  XXI, which requires a list of all earmarks, limited tax benefits, or  limited tariff benefits contained in the measure, or a certification  that the measure does not contain any of those items. However, per  Chairman Schiff's statement submitted for printing in the Congressional  Record on March 11, 2020, the provisions that warranted a referral to  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in H.R. 6172 do not  contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited  tariff benefits as defined in Clause 9 of rule XXI.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 891         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6177) to require Members of Congress to disclose delinquent       tax liabilities and wage garnishments, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       House Administration. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       When the committee rises and reports the bill back to the       House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 13. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6177.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
