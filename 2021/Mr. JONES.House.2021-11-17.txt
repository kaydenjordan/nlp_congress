 Madam Speaker, not since the Civil War has Congress  operated under the constant threat of violence from some of its own  Members, but here we are. That is the behavior that Mr. Gosar has  encouraged.  [[Page H6345]]    Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, having watched so many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle incite and then express  support for the insurrectionists who nearly killed us in this Chamber  on January 6.   We cannot let the Republican Party make Congress the only workplace  in America where violence against your coworkers is not a crime but a  credential.   If we don't hold people like Mr. Gosar accountable, we will only  embolden the worst people in our politics to bring their fever dreams  to life.   That is why, today, we are standing up for the safety of our  colleagues, for the safety of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, and for the  future of our democracy.
