 Madam President, I want to talk briefly about two  subjects. The first is sexual harassment. More specifically, I want to  talk about a bill I am going to be introducing. It is about the abuse  of nondisclosure agreements across government.   There are victims of sexual harassment who are prohibited from  talking about their experiences because of a nondisclosure agreement  that is attached to a settlement and has been paid for by taxpayers or,  in some cases, with private funds. Victims are silenced. Victims are  silenced so voters can't find out about this disgusting behavior.   I have always believed that sunlight is the best antiseptic and the  best disinfectant, and it is long past time, in my opinion, that we  stop revictimizing people who wanted nothing more than to come to work  every day and be treated with basic human dignity.   The title of my proposed law is the Stop Silencing Victims Act. It is  really very simple. It would say that if you are a State or Federal  employee or if you are a public official or a public employee and you  are accused of sexual harassment and you settle that lawsuit--whether  you settle it with taxpayer funds or private funds--then a  nondisclosure agreement is prohibited in that settlement unless the  victim wants to have a nondisclosure agreement. In other words, if you  are accused of sexual harassment and you settle the case, the taxpayers  are entitled to know about the settlement unless the victim decides  otherwise.   I am going to be careful here. We believe passionately, as we should,  in due process in America; that just because you are accused of  something doesn't mean you are guilty of it. Some of my colleagues have  suggested in the past that you are morally tainted if you don't  automatically believe all accusers. I don't agree with that. I think  you are morally tainted if you don't treat both the accuser and accused  with respect and dignity and due process. So the purpose of my bill is  not to take away anybody's due process. Just because you are accused of  something doesn't mean you are guilty of it.   Having said that, I think we have to face the facts in America. We  have had far too many instances of sexual harassment. We have seen it  in Hollywood repeatedly. I don't know how the actors in Hollywood have  time to make movies; they are too busy molesting each other.   It is not just in Hollywood. It is all across society. It is in the  Halls of Congress. It is in the halls of State government. It is in the  boardroom. It is all across America. For the first time in a long time,  women who are usually--not always but usually--the victims of sexual  harassment have started to speak up. I thank them for that.   My bill will further enhance their voice. If they make an accusation  of sexual harassment and the alleged perpetrator is a State employee or  Federal employee and the lawsuit is settled, no longer will you be able  to have an agreement that says nobody can talk about it unless the  victim wants to. Once again, I think this kind of transparency will  help us fight a very serious problem in America because this is no  country for creepy old men or for creepy young men or for creepy  middle-aged men or for anybody--man or woman--who would use his or her  power to obtain sexual favors from somebody in fear of them in power in  the workplace or otherwise.                                 Immigration    Madam President, I believe any President is entitled to surround  himself with the advisers of his choice. I firmly believe that.   As you know, our recent Secretary of Homeland Security has been  replaced. She and the President met on Sunday, and they mutually  decided there would be a change at the top in Homeland Security.  Secretary Nielsen decided to resign.   Shortly thereafter, her White House colleagues, her friends--the  people she has worked with day in and day out to try to solve this  crisis of illegal immigration into America--immediately became  anonymous sources and proceeded to cut her to pieces off the record. Of  course, our press, as it is entitled to do under the First Amendment,  feasted on it. These were Secretary Nielsen's colleagues; the people  she worked with on a daily basis.   This is America. Within reason, you can say what you want, but you  ought to put your name to it. You shouldn't hide behind the label of an  anonymous source. I believe, and I suspect the Presiding Officer does,  too, that we should treat people with dignity and respect. I felt and  still feel Secretary Nielsen's former colleagues did not show her  dignity and respect. In fact, their behavior was classless.   I think Secretary Nielsen did the very best she could under difficult  circumstances, for we do have a problem at the border. ``Problem'' is  an understatement. In March, we had 100,000 people come into our  country illegally. That is the most in 10 years. If that continues, we  are going to set a record this year of the number of people entering  our country illegally.   We are a nation of immigrants, and I am proud of that. Americans  cannot be called anti-immigrant. Every year, we welcome a million  people across the world to come into our country and become Americans.  They do it legally. They follow the law--they are properly vetted; they  get in line; they wait patiently. Then we welcome them in. We are a  nation of immigrants, and I am very proud of that.   Unfortunately, we have another 500,000 to 600,000 people who don't  follow the rules. They come into our country illegally. Illegal  immigration is illegal. Even if you think it is a good idea--and I  don't--if you care about the rule of law, which is one of the bedrock  principles in America, then you would want to stop illegal immigration.  It is just that simple.   I don't care who the President puts in charge of Homeland Security. I  don't want to leave that statement in isolation or allow it to be taken  out of context. Obviously, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland  Security is a very important post, but I don't care which man or woman  the President chooses, for we are not going to solve this problem until  we do three things. Some brandnew, shiny, magical wonder pony is not  going to gallop in and save  [[Page S2304]]  us here. We have to solve this problem ourselves.   The first thing we have to do is to build a wall. I am not talking  about a wall from sea to shining sea. We have 1,900 miles of border. I  am talking about barriers that are strategically placed. You cannot  seal a 1,900-mile piece of real estate without having a barrier. It  can't be done. If you don't believe me, ask Israel. That is why it has  a 400-plus-mile border wall with the West Bank. That is why Saudi  Arabia has a border wall with Yemen. That is why India has a border  wall as do Bulgaria and Malaysia. I could keep going. Border walls  work. All border walls say is: If you come into our country, come in  legally because we believe in the rule of law.   The second thing we need to do, as the Presiding Officer well knows,  is to pass asylum laws that look like somebody designed the things on  purpose because what we have now doesn't fit that description. If you  are coming from Central America--from El Salvador, from Nicaragua, from  Guatemala--all you have to do is make it to American soil, say the  magic words, and you will be allowed into our country. You will be  told: We are going to give you a court date. Yet we are so far behind  in our immigration court that the court date will likely come in a year  and a half or 2 years. You will be released into the country, and you  will be told to come back for the court date. Some do. Many don't.   No other country that I am aware of has an asylum law as upside down  as ours. You could drive all across Washington, DC, and pick the first  person you find who is living under the interstate and say: You draft  an asylum law for us. It would be better than the asylum law we have  right now.   The U.S. Senate ought to be debating America's asylum laws right this  second. I am not saying the other things we are doing--we are in the  personnel business--aren't important, but there is not a single issue  right now that is more important. Congress needs to do its job, and the  Senate ought to be debating this issue right now. I don't know how it  will turn out. How about we just surprise ourselves for a change and do  something intelligent by putting the issue on the floor of the Senate  and by letting us debate it and offer amendments. We might be surprised  at what we can achieve.   The third thing we are going to have to do to solve our problem is to  convince our friends in Mexico and our friends in Central America--El  Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua--to work with us in terms of solving  this problem. What I would like to see the President do is to call an  immigration summit. He has declined to do it, but I am going to keep  talking about it until I persuade him to call an immigration summit.  Invite the President of Mexico and the President of the Northern  Triangle Central American countries. Let's come together, and let's  talk about the problem.   There are some bad people coming across the border. Some of them are  from Central America. The President is right about that. We have gang  members, drug dealers, criminals, child sex traffickers, and adult sex  traffickers. Yet all of the people coming across are not bad people.  They are coming because they are scared. I read an analysis the other  day of a poll conducted by Vanderbilt University. It was the most  expensive, thorough poll that one could do. They didn't call people on  the telephones; they talked to people in person. It was a  representative sample.   This poll found that between one-third and one-half of the people  with whom they talked who lived in Central American countries--the so- called Northern Triangle countries--had been victims of crime within  the past year, usually of extortion. That is the problem in these  Central American countries--the gangs are running the countries. In  many cases, the police and elected leadership are complicit. I mean,  imagine how bad things would have to be for you to take your child and  your spouse and decide ``I am going to leave where I am and walk, with  the clothes on my back, 500 to 1,000 miles to another country because  that is how bad things are where I am right now.'' That is the case  with many of the people in Central America.   I don't know the answer. I think we should start with a Presidential  summit--not representatives of the President's but a Presidential  summit of the President of the United States, President of Mexico Lopez  Obrador, and the Presidents of the Northern Triangle countries. Let's  see what we can do to try to solve this problem.   There is precedent for this. Back in the late 1990s and well into the  next decade, we had a terrible problem with drug cartels and cocaine  coming into this country from Colombia. We didn't solve that problem  overnight. We solved it by working with Colombia to develop what we  called then Plan Colombia. We sat down with the President of Colombia  and said: We will work with you. We will even provide some of the  funding in return for specific commitments--one being to stop growing  cocoa leaves, for example. It has taken a decade, but we have not  completely solved the problem. Yet, if you visit Colombia today, it is  a different country.   Let me say again--and I will end on this note--that I am not anti- immigration, and I don't think most Americans are. We are a nation of  immigrants, but illegal immigration undermines legal immigration. Some  of my colleagues don't agree with that. They don't make the distinction  between legal and illegal immigration. Some of my colleagues, I am  convinced--and it is their right, for this is America; believe what you  want--believe that illegal immigration is a moral good. I don't. I  think illegal immigration is illegal, and I think it hurts our country.  We are not going to solve this problem until we control the flow of  people from Central America, until we revise our asylum laws, and until  we build a barrier.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
