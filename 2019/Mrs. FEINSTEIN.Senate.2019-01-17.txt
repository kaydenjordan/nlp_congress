 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce  legislation that would shield farmworkers from deportation and put them  on a path to earned legal status and eventual citizenship.   By protecting farmworkers from deportation, this bill would achieve  two goals: ensuring that hardworking immigrants don't live in fear and  that California's agriculture industry has the workforce it needs to  survive.   Under the Agricultural Worker Program Act, farmworkers who have  worked in agriculture for at least 100 days in each of the past 2 years  may earn lawful ``blue card'' status. Farmworkers who maintain blue  card status for the next 3 or 5 years, depending on the total hours  worked in agriculture, would be eligible to adjust to a green card or  legal permanent residency. This would provide them with a path to  citizenship.   Everywhere I travel in California, I hear from farmers, growers and  producers from all industries--wine, citrus, fruit and tree nuts,  dairy--that there aren't enough workers. Farm labor is performed almost  exclusively by immigrants--fact that should surprise no one. In fact,  over 90 percent of California's crop workers are immigrants, and half  are unauthorized.   Despite their significant contributions to California's economy and  communities, farmworkers are now a priority for deportation under this  administration's shameful policies. We simply must protect the families  who help put food on our tables. By providing a path to citizenship for  these workers and their families, the Agricultural Worker Program Act  will preserve our agricultural system. This bill will also protect  vulnerable workers who should not have to live in fear of becoming easy  enforcement targets.   It is time to get started on solutions for agricultural communities  across the country. Law-abiding workers should not have to fear  deportation, but should have a path to citizenship that recognizes  their enormous contribution to American prosperity and society.  Employers should not have to fear that their labor force will be unable  to return to work as a result of deportation. The Agricultural Worker  Program Act provides the security and stability for our farmworkers  that is necessary to keep the industry strong.   I would like to thank Representative Lofgren in the House for working  with me to introduce this legislation today in both chambers. I invite  my colleagues in the Senate to join me in cosponsoring the bill and  preventing the deportation of those who work so hard to put food on our  tables.

Res. 4. A joint resolution requiring the advice and consent of  the Senate or an Act of Congress to suspend, terminate, or withdraw the  United States from the North Atlantic Treaty and authorizing related  litigation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign  Relations.
