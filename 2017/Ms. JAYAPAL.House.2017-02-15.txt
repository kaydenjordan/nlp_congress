 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my hometown, the  city of Seattle, on its historic decision to terminate its $3 billion  relationship with Wells Fargo Bank over its financing and support of  the Dakota Access pipeline.   Last week, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to divest from  Wells Fargo, making it the first major city to do so.   Led by Native American and environmental activists, our city made an  important statement about the vision that we have for our community and  for our world. That vision centralizes both the rights of our native  brothers and sisters, and our environment.   Just like it did with the $15 minimum wage, Seattle continues to be a  leader and a model for the rest of the country, and activists and  cities around the United States have picked up the torch.   We stand united in prioritizing our environment, as it is deeply  connected to the health of our communities. Rather than allowing  dangerous pipeline projects to continue, putting millions of people at  risk, we should be focused on being leaders in the international fight  against climate change.   I am committed, Mr. Speaker, to taking every opportunity to protect  our resources and fight for a bold alternative energy plan that  includes a just transition that creates great union jobs and puts us on  a sustainable path forward.                            ____________________
