 Mr. Speaker, I rise because President Trump has dubbed  this week ``Made in America Week.'' But one can't pretend one's way to  creating jobs in the United States, even if you are President.   A key index that gives you a clue to the truth of job creation in the  United States is the trade deficit: How many more products and services  are country exports, rather than imports from offshore sweatshops?   Well, for every month of the Trump administration--that is what the  red line is--the jobs hole for America is growing deeper.   You see here that the May 2017 deficit on this scorecard confirms the  failing Trump trade record, with a $46 billion trade and jobs deficit  for May alone--larger than last year, larger than every other month.   The President spoke endlessly about trade during the campaign and  promised turning NAFTA into a good deal for Americans. Without a doubt,  working people of the Midwest put him in the Presidency because he  promised to renegotiate NAFTA, that bad deal. Now it is his turn to  live up to the bargain.   There is an old expression, ``Don't tell me what he says, show me  what he does.''   Well, President Trump could start by onshoring all foreign goods he  makes abroad--everything from ties, suits, bracelets, and so forth.   I haven't seen any inclination to date by this President reshoring  items so that he creates jobs again in this country. He contributes to  a growing trade surplus, not a deficit.                   [From the guardian.com, July 18, 2017]     Trump's ``Made in America'' Week: the President's Hypocrisy Is on                                  Display                             (By Adam Gabbatt)         The White House celebrates US-manufactured products this       week, even though Trump's vodka, menswear and even board       games have been made overseas.        Donald Trump has declared this week ``Made in America''       week. According to the White House, it's an opportunity for       the president to showcase ``products that are made in       America''.        Unfortunately for Trump, that description would rule out       many of the products he and members of his family have made       and sold. From Donald J Trump Collection clothing to Trump       Vodka to Trump: the Game, the president has a track record of       not making things in America.        The week was scheduled to kick off at the White House on       Monday, with Trump walking around some tables looking at       products made in all 50 states. So in honour of the       president's communist-dictator-esque photo opportunity,       here's a look at some not-made-in-America Trump gear.                                   Alcohol         Trump Vodka (``The finish is disappointingly harsh''--      InternetWines.com) was an ill-fated attempt by Trump to       branch into the spirits world. The vodka (``No discernable       flavor''--Chicagoist) was manufactured in the Netherlands by       a company called Wanders Distillery and launched in the US in       2006.        But the beverage (``My taste buds unfortunately associate       the flavor with the smell of paint''--VodkaBuzz) failed to       sell. The trademark was abandoned in 2008, according to       Rolling Stone. By 2011, Trump Vodka was ``out of       circulation''.        ``We don't need Chinese products,'' Trump told Fox News in       2010. ``The stuff that's been sent over from China is--it       falls apart after a year and a half. It's crap.''        It was an odd thing to say for a self-described master       businessman offering to the American public many menswear       products--featured in the Donald J Trump Signature       Collection--that were made in China.        Donald J Trump eyeglasses were made in China. Donald       Trump's ties were made in China. Some of the Donald J Trump       suits were made in China.        To be fair, Trump is an equal opportunity overseas       manufacturer. His dress shirts have been manufactured in       Bangladesh, Honduras and Vietnam. And China.        It turned out Trump was right about people not needing       Chinese products. In 2015, the Donald I Trump Signature       Collection was jettisoned by Macy's. His famous red hats,       meanwhile, actually are made in the US. It's the unofficial       ones that aren't.                                  Education         Trump University (``A fraud from beginning to end''--New       York attorney general Eric Schneiderman) was a US business.        But the university, which was not actually an accredited       university, encouraged students to outsource jobs overseas.        ``We hear terrible things about outsourcing jobs--how       sending work outside of our companies is contributing to the       demise of American businesses,'' Trump wrote on the Trump       University blog in 2005. ``But in this instance I have to       take the unpopular stance that it is not always a terrible       thing.''        In November 2016, Trump settled three fraud lawsuits       relating to the university for $25m.                                   Homeware         ``Several Trump Home items are listed as made in China or       imported from China the Washington Post reported in 2016.        According to the Post, foreign-made items in Trump's       furniture collection include mirrors, ceramic vases, wall       decorations, kitchen items and lighting fixtures. They were       all made in China. Some Trump Home picture frames were       manufactured in India.        Earlier this year, Peter York, who wrote a 2006 book about       the homes of autocrats, including Saddam Hussein and Nicolae       Ceausescu, wrote about the similarities between their tastes       and Trump's interior decor preferences.        ``The best aesthetic descriptor of Trump's look, I'd argue,       is dictator style,'' York said.                                 Board games         Trump: the Game (``I loathed every miserable second of       it''--Ars Technica) was launched in 1989, then pushed out       again in 2004 after Trump became host of The Apprentice.        The game (``Bizarre''--Business Insider) was manufactured       in the US by Milton Bradley Company. But the dice, according       to this photo of the Trump: the Game packaging, were made in       China.        It is difficult to tell if the dice were ``crap'' and fell       apart after a year and a half, because Trump: the Game sold       poorly. In 2011, Time magazine listed the game as one of       Trump's top 10 business failures.                            Ivanka Trump clothing         It's not just Donald Trump who has a track record of       overseas manufacturing. In December, the New York Times,       citing two trade databases, reported that ``almost all'' of       Ivanka Trump's clothing line is made overseas.        In May, New York-based activists were arrested in China       while investigating the making of Ivanka Trump shoes. In       July, the Washington Post traced Ivanka Trump products to       Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.        More than 20 stores have dropped Ivanka Trump's products       since her father started his run for president.                                   ____________________
