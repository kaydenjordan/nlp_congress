 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life,  service, and legacy of Abilene Police Department detective, Elise  Ybarra.   Detective Ybarra was tragically killed last August en route to a  conference focused on her life's work: fighting crimes against  children. She was just days shy of her 33rd birthday and left behind a  loving husband and a 10-month-old daughter. Elise Ybarra represented  the best of west Texas in her service and sacrifice for our community.   The Bible teaches us that, even in the most trying of times, the  light shines in the darkness, and the darkness shall not overcome it.  By carving Elise's name into the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, we ensure that her light will continue to shine, a beacon of  valor for our entire Nation to see.   To her husband, Adam: God's peace and comfort to you, brother. To  baby, Noelle: May your mom's strength and courage live on in you.                            ____________________
