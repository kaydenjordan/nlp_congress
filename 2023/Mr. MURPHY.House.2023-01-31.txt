 Mr. Speaker, I speak on this bill from personal  experience because I am probably the only Member in the Chamber who  actually fell under this mandate because I am still actively  practicing, and I am still on staff at an active medical center.   I have practiced at this one institution for 30 years. I don't know  how many calls I got from nurses, people on the floor taking care of  COVID patients, pleading with me to not be forced to take this vaccine.   Let me just say, if there were any individuals who knew what they  were talking about, it was these nurses. They were actually taking care  of COVID patients. I have been very pro-vaccine, very pro-vaccine, but  I have said since day one that this is not a decision that should be  made between a government and a citizen, but rather one made between a  doctor and a patient. It is a medication. There are risks and benefits  that go with this.   Sadly enough, we lost a lot of our nurses, way too  many, because  they chose not to get this. They were young, of fertility age, and they  were fearful.    I am just going to speak to my colleague's comments about exemptions.  Yes, there were exemptions, but they were minute, and I won't speak  about one institution in specific, but nationwide they were oftentimes  ignored. Thirty-year-olds who desired not to get this vaccine based  upon fears about fertility don't have preexisting medical conditions.   I think this is the right thing. I am pro-vaccine, but I do not  believe in the avenue of forced vaccination. I ask my colleagues to  support H.R. 497.
