 Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I rise in support of this excellent amendment.   The health and safety of our troops in the surrounding communities is  paramount. We need to ensure basic projects, like fire stations, are  funded properly, just as training ranges, barracks, hospitals, and  schools are. I look forward to working with the gentleman in future  budget submissions, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chairwoman, the amendments included in  the en bloc were made in order by the rule and have been agreed to by  the ranking member, Judge Carter and I, and I support the amendment and  urge its adoption.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), a sponsor of one of the  amendments included in the en bloc.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), who has been a passionate advocate  standing up for members of the Armed Forces as well as the veterans of  this country in his district.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I appreciate the gentleman from Michigan for bringing attention to  this important issue. We can all agree that we want to let veterans  choose the best prosthetics provider for his or her needs.   As you know, we included report language expressing concern on this  issue, but I do agree that more needs to be done. We want the best care  for our veterans, and we need to find a way forward to determine the  appropriate next steps.   We should work with the authorizers and the VA to thoughtfully work  on this issue to find the best solution for veterans needing artificial  limbs.   I commit to working with the gentleman on this issue. We are not  quite ready to make a decision on the best approach to this as we move  towards conference. I thank the gentleman for his willingness to  withdraw the amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time to speak on the  amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I do fully support Strengthening  Buy-American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects. That language is  already included in this legislation, and I appreciate the gentleman  underscoring the importance of our commitment to buy-American policies.   I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5017]]         Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time to speak on the  amendment, although I do not oppose it.    Mr. Chair, I rise to point out that DOD has  testified that it has excess facilities and needs a way to deal with  that excess.   Mr. Chair, the underlying bill does not include any funds to initiate  a BRAC round, and I have no objection to the amendment. I appreciate  the gentleman calling attention to the economic impact of BRAC rounds,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we have recognized that there is a  lack of available overnight bed space for mental health patients at VA  facilities, and this is a huge issue that the VA is facing. In fact, we  did provide an additional $20 million within the medical facilities  account in the base bill as an effort to begin to address this dire  need.   This amendment will add an additional, vital $5 million to expand VA  facilities and provide additional bed  [[Page H5018]]  space for veterans requiring overnight mental healthcare. We can never  do too much to provide mental healthcare for our veterans.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I congratulate the  gentleman on his leadership on this issue.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Lowey), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support this amendment. I  agree with my colleague from Utah, and I appreciate him drawing  attention to this important issue.   Veterans' credit scores should not be negatively impacted by untimely  or improper payments by VA to third-party providers. This is an  unconscionable outcome to the irresponsible actions of the VA.   I understand VA is working with the gentleman on this issue, and it  is still in the process of setting up a database that will allow  consumer reporting agencies to verify whether or not a debt furnished  to a consumer reporting agency is actually a veteran's medical debt, as  required by Public Law 115-174, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief,  and Consumer Protection Act. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of  setting up this database, it will take longer than the 1-year deadline  required by the law.   We must hold the VA accountable for timely payments, and we cannot  accept veterans suffering the financial consequences of VA's improper  or untimely payments.   I do commit to working with the gentleman on this issue as we move  through the process. We need to make sure that when our veterans come  home, they are able to seamlessly transition back to civilian life and  not have obstacles thrown in their path by the VA's own mistakes.  [[Page H5019]]    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman offering this amendment to  protect our veterans and protect their credit. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment. I know the ranking member joins me in that  effort.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The past year has been particularly devastating to military  installations in multiple States, including my own. There are bases  that experienced hurricanes, tornadoes, and massive coastal and river  flooding.   Over time, gradual sea level changes magnify the impacts of storm  surge and may eventually result in permanent inundation of facilities  and installations.   In my home State of Florida, Tyndall Air Force Base was devastated by  Hurricane Michael.   Building resilient DOD facilities that can sustain the impacts of  damaging storms and flooding is no longer an option but an essential  requirement.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I commend  the gentleman for his leadership on this issue.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The maintenance of our roads in and around our military installations  is a must for the safety of our servicemembers and their families. It  is also key for the training and readiness of our troops.  [[Page H5020]]    I look forward to working with the gentleman in future budget  submissions to make sure that we can address this important issue and  protect the safety of our troops.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
