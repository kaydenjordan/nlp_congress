 Madam President, constituents from every State who care  about our public schools and our students in public schools have broken  records calling us, their Senators, in opposition to Betsy DeVos as  Education Secretary.   In the past few weeks, I have heard from thousands of Hawaii  residents concerned about voting for an Education Secretary who clearly  does not believe in our Nation's public schools. I wish to share two of  their messages today.   One constituent wrote to me:         Dear Senator Hirono,        As a proud Hawaii educator for 30 plus years, I'm deeply       troubled by the possible appointment of Betsy DeVos to the       position of US Secretary of Education.        Although I would personally never consider applying for a       job I am not qualified to serve in, it's baffling to me that       our new Commander in Chief thinks someone who has NO       experience as a teacher or administrator could be remotely       prepared to lead our nation in this role.        I don't have to explain to you what a selfless calling       being a teacher is, nor do I believe our Hawaii delegation       takes educating Hawaii's keiki lightly, so I implore you to       work with other leaders in DC to make sure we have a suitable       nominee for this essential position.        Mahalo,        Sandy from Honolulu    Sandy and teachers like her devote more time and effort than is  mandated to ensure that our public school students have a solid  foundation in education and for life. Teaching is a calling, and I have  met with many teachers who are totally committed to doing the very best  they can for their students, and they want nothing less from the next  Secretary of Education. They deserve a better qualified, better  experienced, better prepared, and more committed Secretary of Education  than Betsy DeVos.   Next, I wish to share a message from Lorelei, a middle school  principal on Oahu. Her letter begins:         Dear Senator Hirono,        As a strong supporter of public education, I ask that you       oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the       U.S. Department of Education.        Educators and students deserve a secretary who can commit       to supporting every student in all public schools, and a       leader that will work tirelessly to promote a public       education system that provides each child with the optimum       conditions for teaching and learning.        Betsy DeVos' past work in education and her performance at       the recent confirmation hearing demonstrated neither a depth       of experience nor knowledge base in education policy and on       critical issues facing the community.    She ends her letter by saying:         As a principal, I have spoken with teachers, parents,       students, and community members across the political spectrum       and there is widespread agreement that Betsy DeVos is not the       right person for the job.    As Lorelei said, it shouldn't be asking too much to have an Education  Secretary who will stand up for public schools and the millions of our  children who attend our public schools. That person is certainly not  Betsy DeVos.   In his opening remarks at Betsy DeVos's confirmation hearing, the  chairman of the HELP Committee said that Mrs. DeVos was in the  ``mainstream'' for supporting vouchers to send students to private  schools, instead of investing in our public schools. This is not  mainstream thinking. Being told otherwise is again dealing in  ``alternative facts.''   The chairman went on to repeat a so-called argument that Betsy DeVos  and other school choice advocates make--that vouchers are simply Pell  grants for primary and secondary education. Now, this is a real head  scratcher, and I say: What? Here we go again down the rabbit hole,  where up is down and down is up.   Pell grants and vouchers are fundamentally different. Pell grants  help offset the ever-rising cost of a voluntary college education. All  colleges charge students tuition, and Pell grants provide opportunity  to low-income students to be able to go to college.   In contrast, every American child has a right to a free primary and  secondary public education. Vouchers actually take resources away from  public schools and make it that much harder to provide a good education  for all of our students.   Vouchers take money away from public schools; Pell grants don't. When  a student uses a Pell grant at a private college or university, it has  no impact on the funding a State college or university receives. But  when a student uses a voucher to attend a private school, it takes away  money from local public schools. How is taking money away from local  public schools mainstream thinking? The Secretary of  [[Page S691]]  Education should be focused on improving our public schools, not taking  money away from them.   Furthermore, saying that Pell grants are similar to vouchers reveals  a fundamental lack of understanding of the Pell grant program. Among  her many duties as Secretary, Betsy DeVos would be in charge of  managing $30 billion per year of Pell grants, which help more than 8  million students afford a college education in this country.   During the 2014-2015 school year, more than 21,000 students in Hawaii  were able to finance their college education with nearly $81 million in  Pell grants. Last Congress, I led legislation to protect and strengthen  the Pell grant program. But under Republican majorities, Pell grants  are under the constant threat of irresponsible cuts and dismantlement,  even though college today is more expensive than ever.   Can we really trust Betsy DeVos to fight to protect Pell grants?  Somebody who equates Pell grants with vouchers is not someone who  understands her responsibilities under the Pell Grant Program. So can  we really trust Betsy DeVos to support the Pell Grant Program? I don't  think so.   I have spoken out against Betsy DeVos's nomination a number of times,  but some questions need repeating. What are we telling our students if  we have an Education Secretary who is not committed to improving the  public education system so that our students can succeed in school and  in life? Nine out of every 10 students in the United States attend  public school. What are we saying to them? Is it the best we can do to  give them an Education Secretary who does not believe in the public  schools they attend? Who doesn't believe that their education is worth  fighting for?   If this is the message you want to send to our students and their  families, then vote for Betsy DeVos. On behalf of the nearly 200,000  public school students in Hawaii and their teachers and other educators  in Hawaii, my answer is a strong, strong no.   I urge my colleagues to question Betsy DeVos's commitment to our  public schools and to the millions of students who go to public schools  and vote against her nomination.   I yield the floor.    Will the Senator from Washington yield for a question?    As we have spent many hours debating whether Mrs. DeVos  is the best person to head our Department of Education, my question is,  Do you think Betsy DeVos is the best prepared, the best experienced,  and the best committed person to lead as the Secretary of the  Department of Education?   With your indulgence, I would like to put this into a little bit of a  context because we talk about how foundational public schools are and  how education is a great equalizer. I speak from experience as an  immigrant coming to this country not speaking any English, and I  learned from the public schools and the committed teachers in public  schools how to read and write English, to develop my love of reading,  to count on an education system to prepare me for success, not only in  school but in life.   That is why I want to also ask my colleague from Washington State,  for the nearly 200,000 young people in Hawaii who attend our public  schools and obviously the millions of young people in our public  schools throughout the country, Do you think Betsy DeVos is the best we  can do for these people who are attending our public schools?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have served with Jeff Sessions  throughout my time in the Senate and respect him very much as a  colleague. I come to the floor of the Senate today not to decide  whether Jeff Sessions is doing a good job as the Senator from Alabama,  for, of course, that is for his constituents to decide; I come to the  floor today to vote on whether to support Jeff Sessions for Attorney  General of all the people of America, not just the people of Alabama.  That is an awesomely different role and responsibility.   I have deep concerns about Jeff Sessions' independence from the  President and how he would use his prosecutorial discretion to address  a number of critical issues confronting our country.   The Attorney General is the American people's lawyer, not the  President's, and the job requires the Attorney General to stand up to  the President as the people's lawyer.   In his first 2 weeks in office, President Trump has demonstrated his  intolerance of dissent and independent thinking. He fired Acting  Attorney General Sally Yates because she did what an Attorney General  is supposed to do: She stood up and refused to defend President Trump's  Executive order effectively restricting Muslims from coming to or  returning to our country. Would Jeff Sessions have stood up to the  President as Sally Yates did?   During his confirmation hearing, I asked Senator Sessions if he would  honor the historical role of the Attorney General and maintain strict  independence from the White House. I did not receive a satisfactory  answer. This is deeply troubling in light of the ongoing litigation in  Federal court challenging the President's Muslim ban as overreaching  and unconstitutional.   Since the President announced the ban just over a week ago, hundreds  of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to oppose it.  Lawyers have been camping out in arrivals terminals in airports across  the country to help those who are trying to come back or come to our  country with legal visas. State attorneys general have been speaking  out and filing lawsuits to block this ban.   Last week, Hawaii attorney general Doug Chin filed a lawsuit to block  the Executive order. I wish to read a section from the State's brief  outlining the State's case.         Hawaii joins the many voices that have condemned the Order.       But this pleading is not about politics or rhetoric--it is       about the law. The simple fact is that the Order is unlawful.       By banning Muslims and creating a preference for Christian       refugees, the Order violates the Establishment Clause of the       United States Constitution. By those same acts, it violates       the equal protection guarantee of the fifth amendment. By       failing utterly to provide procedures or protections of any       kind for people detained or turned away at our airports, it       violates the Due Process Clause. And by enshrining rank       discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion, it       flies in the face of statutes enacted by Congress.    Attorney General Chin is standing up for the people of Hawaii. The  people of the United States deserve the same from our Attorney General.   To understand how an Attorney General should discharge his or her  responsibility, we need only turn to Senator Sessions' own words in an  exchange between Sally Yates and Senator Sessions during her  confirmation hearing in 2015.   I wish to read the exchange. Senator Sessions said at her  confirmation hearing:         Do you understand that in this political world, there will       be people calling, demanding, pushing, insisting on things       that they do not know what they're asking for and could       indeed be corrosive of the rule of law, could diminish the       respect the Department of Justice has, could diminish the       rule of law in the United States? Are you aware of that?       You've already learned that the time you've been there.    Nominee Yates said:         Well, you're right, Senator, I'm not from here. I've only       been here for a couple of months, but I can tell you I'm       committed to the Department of Justice.        I love our department. I care deeply about our mission, and       I would do everything in my power to protect the integrity       that is the Department of Justice.''    Senator Sessions said:         You have to watch out, because people will be asking you to       do things you just need to say no about. Do you think the       Attorney General has the responsibility to say ``no'' to  [[Page S914]]       the President if he asks for something that is improper? If       the views of the President are unlawful, should the Attorney       General or the Deputy Attorney General say no?    Yates' response:         Senator, I believe the AG or deputy AG has an obligation to       follow the law and the Constitution and to give their       independent legal advice to the President.    The people of the United States need an Attorney General who will  stand up to the President to defend the Constitution--especially, as  Senator Sessions pointed out in his questions of Nominee Yates, when  the President is wrong.   Based on Nominee Sessions' long-held restrictive views on  immigration, I do not think he would stand up to the President as Sally  Yates did. I am also deeply concerned about how Senator Sessions would  use his prosecutorial discretion to address a number of critical  issues.   During his confirmation hearing, I pressed Senator Sessions for a  commitment to vigorously protect every citizens' right to vote,  particularly with regard to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which  safeguards Americans from discriminatory voting laws.   At a time when our President is making unsubstantiated claims of  massive voter fraud, we need an Attorney General who will vigorously  protect the right to vote and not give in to these kinds of alternative  facts to justify voter suppression laws.   Senator Sessions did not provide me with a satisfactory answer that  he would affirmatively scrutinize voting laws for impermissible  discriminatory impact. If the Attorney General does not weigh in on  these kinds of situations, this means that challenging these kinds of  voting laws, these kinds of impermissible discriminatory voting laws,  will be left to individuals and groups with limited resources, such as  the NAACP.   I also asked Senator Sessions whether he would honor the Department  of Justice's consent decrees, some 20 of them, that address police  misconduct and enhance accountability. Senator Sessions did not  adequately assure me that as Attorney General, he would uphold these  amendments. In fact, he left the door open for renegotiating these  agreements. I pressed Senator Sessions for a commitment to defend Roe  v. Wade in Federal court and to enforce laws that guarantee the  constitutionally protected women's right to choose. Senator Sessions  refused to disavow his past comments that Roe v. Wade was one of the  worst Supreme Court cases ever decided and, in his view, not based on  the Constitution, when, in fact, the majority decision had a  constitutional basis.   Should the Supreme Court be presented with a case that provides them  the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, I asked Senator Sessions,  would he instruct the Solicitor General to argue for the overturning of  Roe v. Wade? He said that was a hypothetical and did not respond.  Senator Sessions' view on Roe v. Wade is clear. Would anyone be  surprised if, as Attorney General, he would support overturning Roe v.  Wade given that opportunity?   In addition, in one of his first actions, the President reinstated a  ban on foreign aid to health providers abroad who discussed abortion.  This vow would compromise the health care of millions of women in  places where the need is greatest. Taking the President's lead, I  seriously question whether his Cabinet nominees, including the Attorney  General nominee, will protect a woman's right to choose.   I want to turn again to the topics of President Trump's Executive  order, basically banning Muslim immigration, because our next Attorney  General will likely weigh in on this, as well as other immigration  cases. In fact, the Justice Department is already in Federal courts  right now defending President Trump's Muslim ban. So while there is an  argument being made that this really is not a Muslim ban, I say, you  can call a duck a chicken, but if it looks like a duck, quacks like a  duck, walks like a duck, it is a duck. That is what this Executive  order is, a Muslim ban.   Sadly, stoking fears in minorities and immigrants is a tragic but  undeniable part of our Nation's history, and this fear has been used to  justify the terrible treatment of minorities from Native peoples to  slaves, to immigrants who helped build our country. In 1882, decades of  incitement against Chinese immigrants resulted in the passage of the  Chinese Exclusion Act, an immoral law that banned all Chinese  immigration. This law, and others that followed, created a culture of  fear that culminated in the mass internment of Japanese Americans  during World War II.   This was one of the darkest periods of American history, and it took  decades for our country to acknowledge our error.   Last week, we commemorated what would have been civil rights icon  Fred Korematsu's 98th birthday. As Japanese Americans were rounded up  for incarceration, Mr. Korematsu, who was only 23 at the time, bravely  resisted internment all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld Mr.  Korematsu's conviction as being justified by the exigencies of war.  Forty years later, documents kept from the Supreme Court showed that  the Americans of Japanese ancestry were not involved in seditious  actions justifying mass incarceration. Mr. Korematsu waited more than  40 years for a court in California to overturn his conviction.   During the Judiciary Committee's markup on this nomination, I read  the full text of President Ronald Reagan's remarks in 1988, apologizing  for the internment. I would like to read some of the excerpts.   I do see the majority leader here. Would you like me to yield?    I assume I will be able to resume my comments after the  majority leader's statement?    Thank you.    I would like to resume my remarks.   Mr. President, I want to read some excerpts from President Ronald  Reagan's remarks in 1988, apologizing for the internment of Japanese  Americans.         More than 40 years ago, shortly after the bombing of Pearl       Harbor, 120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry living in the       United States were forcibly removed from their homes and       placed in makeshift internment camps. This action was taken       without trial, without jury. It was based solely on race, for       these 120,000 were Americans of Japanese descent.  [[Page S915]]         Yet we must recognize that the internment of Japanese       Americans was just that: a mistake. For throughout the war,       Japanese Americans in the tens of thousands remained utterly       loyal to the United States. Indeed, scores of Japanese       Americans volunteered for our Armed Forces, many stepping       forward in the internment camps themselves.        The 442nd Regimental Combat Team, made up entirely of       Japanese Americans, served with immense distinction to defend       this Nation, their Nation. Yet back at home, the soldiers'       families were being denied the very freedom for which so many       of the soldiers themselves were laying down their lives.        The legislation that I am about to sign provides for a       restitution payment to each of the 60,000 surviving Japanese       Americans of the 120,000 who were relocated or detained. Yet       no payment can make up for those lost years. So, what is most       important in this bill has less to do with property than with       honor. For here we admit a wrong; here, we reaffirm our       commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.    President Reagan's words powerfully demonstrated the wrongness of the  internment, but just after this Presidential election, a top Trump  surrogate said that the Japanese internment should be used as  ``precedent'' for a Muslim registry. And a Supreme Court Justice,  Justice Scalia, in 2014, warned that a civil rights atrocity similar to  the internment of Japanese Americans could happen again. Justice Scalia  explained his thinking with the Latin phrase that means: ``In times of  war, the laws fall silent.'' Justice Scalia in 2014, went on to say:         That is what was going on--the panic about the war, and the       invasion of the Pacific and whatnot. That's what happens. It       was wrong, but I would not be surprised to see it happen       again--in times of war. It's no justification, but it is the       reality.    The internment of Japanese Americans is yet another example of how,  when we do not stand up against unconstitutional actions like President  Trump's Muslim ban, we will be complicit in what follows. Time and  again, when our country targets minorities for discriminatory  treatment, history proves us to have been deeply wrong. I commend my  Republican colleagues, Senators Graham, McCain, Hatch, Flake, Sasse,  and others, for their statements questioning President Trump's  immigration Executive order.   Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain issued a joint statement,  which I would like to read in whole because I very much admire the  position they took. In their joint statement they said:         Our government has the responsibility to defend our       borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and       upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our Nation.        It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the       nation that President Trump's Executive order was not       properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports       that this order went into effect with little to no       consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice,       and Homeland Security.        We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the       country they call home. We should not stop those who have       served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from       seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to       help.        And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have       been shown, through extensive vetting, to pose no       demonstrable threat to our Nation, and who have suffered       unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.        Ultimately, we fear this Executive order will become a       self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this       very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with       our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL.        But this Executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to       military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies.        Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the       vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology       of hatred.        This Executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that       America does not want Muslims coming into our country.        That is why we fear this Executive order may do more to       help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.    That is the end of the joint statement by Senators McCain and Graham.  I read the statement and I cannot but admire our two Senators for  making the statements. I cannot overstate the fearful message that  President Trump is sending by pursuing this ban on Muslims.   Last night, our colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, was  silenced for sharing a letter from Coretta Scott King. If we cannot  make a distinction between talking about a fellow Senator from a person  who is a nominee that we must confirm, then the rule that shuts down  debate should be called a gag rule.   Over the last 2 months, I have heard from thousands of my  constituents and a number of prominent civil rights organizations,  including a number who testified at Jeff Sessions' hearing questioning  his nomination. So I will vote against the nomination of Jeff Sessions  to serve as Attorney General because I am deeply concerned about how he  would use his prosecutorial discretion to uphold voting rights, protect  civil rights, and safeguard a woman's right to choose. I am seriously  concerned about Jeff Sessions' willingness to say no to the President  when he needs to.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
