 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 57.  Voting in support of this resolution ensures that the Federal  Government will stay out of our children's classrooms and give the  power back to the local authorities to make good, solid education  decisions.   Throughout my congressional campaign, the people of the Third  District of Georgia of all backgrounds and income continued to express  their frustration that the Federal Government continued to get involved  in policies that should be the domain of local and State governments.   I have spoken with education leaders in the Third District of  Georgia, in places like Troup County and Fayette County, and they were  very pleased with the bipartisan effort of the Every Student Succeeds  Act passed last Congress. They told me that they felt hopeful with the  new flexibility written into the law granting the power to the States  and the local leaders to decide what accountability measures work best  for their students. However, as time went on, they expressed great  concern as the Department of Education began writing this new  accountability regulation.   The accountability measures that will work for my home State of  Georgia and my home district won't always work best for students  elsewhere. Trying to educate students in the Third District of Georgia  the exact same way you do students in Detroit, Michigan, or Spokane,  Washington, or Prescott, Arizona, just simply will not work.   Every child deserves access to quality education, but imposing a  nationwide standard will only hamper this goal with burdensome  regulations, and we have seen that failed policy under the No Child  Left Behind Act. This resolution pulls back the Federal overreach,  ensuring that the decisions will remain at the local level, and that is  why I support H.J. Res. 57 today.
