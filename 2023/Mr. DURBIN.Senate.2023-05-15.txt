 Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Brad Garcia to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.   Mr. Garcia is an accomplished appellate litigator and public servant  whose breadth and depth of experience will make him an outstanding  addition to the D.C. Circuit. A graduate of Johns Hopkins and Harvard  Law School, Mr. Garcia began his career with clerkships for judges  appointed by Presidents of both political parties, Judge Thomas  Griffith on the D.C. Circuit and Justice Elena Kagan on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   After his clerkships, Mr. Garcia joined the appellate practice of  O'Melveny and Myers, where he ultimately became a partner. During his  time at the firm, he drafted dozens of briefs in Federal and State  appellate courts and delivered 13 appellate oral arguments, including  one in the Supreme Court and 10 in the Federal courts of appeals.   Throughout his career, Mr. Garcia has demonstrated a strong  commitment to pro bono work, advocating for clients in cases  implicating the rights of immigrants and criminal defendants,  reproductive freedoms, and free and fair elections. In three cases, the  Fourth Circuit appointed Mr. Garcia either as amicus counsel or to  represent indigent criminal defendants, a testament to his impartiality  and effectiveness as an appellate attorney. Mr. Garcia currently serves  as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's  Office of Legal Counsel, where he has continued to demonstrate his  commitment to public service and defending the rule of law.   If confirmed, Mr. Garcia will be the first Latino judge on the D.C.  Circuit. He was rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA and has received  support from leaders across the political spectrum, which reflects his  well-established credibility in the legal community.   Mr. Garcia is an exemplary pick for the D.C. Circuit. I strongly  support his nomination and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for  his confirmation.    I announce that the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow)  is necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
