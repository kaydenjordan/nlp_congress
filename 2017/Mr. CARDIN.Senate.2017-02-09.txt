 Mr. President, first let me comment and thank my  colleague from Maryland, Senator Van Hollen. Senator Van Hollen may be  a new Member to the U.S. Senate, but he is not a new Member to the  Congress of the United States.   I think Senator Van Hollen said this very clearly: This nomination is  very much about the type of health care system we want for the people  in this country, whether we are going to have affordable, quality  health care for all Americans, whether health care is going to be a  right or a privilege. I thank Senator Van Hollen for the points he  made.   I think the people of Maryland are not going to be surprised that I  agree with my colleague from Maryland and that I take this time to  explain why I will oppose Mr. Price for Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  [[Page S1017]]    Let me begin by talking about something that happened in Maryland  during my first year in the U.S. Senate. I was elected in 2006. In  2007, in my very first year, we had a tragic situation that occurred a  few miles from where we are right here, in Prince George's County, MD.  A youngster, 12 years of age, Deamonte Driver, died from a tooth  problem. Let me give you the background on this because this is a very  tragic situation. This is in the State of Maryland, one of the  wealthiest States in one of the wealthiest nations.   Deamonte Driver's mother recognized that Deamonte Driver had pain in  his mouth. She tried to get him to a dentist, but they had no insurance  and no coverage. She couldn't get anyone to take care of her son. What  was needed was an $80 tooth extraction. If he could have seen a  dentist, that is exactly what would have happened. He couldn't get in  because he had no insurance, and he fell through the cracks of our  system. That tooth became abscessed, and it went into his brain. He  went through two operations, hundreds of thousands of dollars of cost,  and he lost his life.   That happened in my first year in the U.S. Senate. I vowed to do  everything I could to make sure there were no more tragedies anywhere  in America like Deamonte Driver's. Every child should be able to get  access to oral health care. It is who we are as a nation. It is part of  who we are, and it makes sense from the point of view of an efficient  health care system.   I introduced legislation to provide pediatric dental care in this  country. I worked with my colleague Elijah Cummings in the House of  Representatives and with others here, and we were able to make some  progress. Ultimately, we were able to get this as part of our national  health policy in the Affordable Care Act. It is now part of what is  known as essential health services.   I start this debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate by saying that  Dr. Price, the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, is  one of the leaders for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which  would repeal essential health services, which would eliminate the right  for all children in America to have pediatric dental care. So I then  look at what Mr. Price would replace it with, and I am confused because  I am not exactly sure what he would replace it with. I have looked at  what he has done as a Member of the House, I have looked at what he has  done as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I am not confident  that we would maintain that type of guaranteed coverage for our  children.   That is just one concrete example--one person--of why I am concerned  about what would happen if we repealed the Affordable Care Act, and we  don't know what is coming next.   The Affordable Care Act--30 million Americans now have affordable,  quality health care as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The repeal  of that law would jeopardize those 30 million. In Maryland, the  uninsured rate has gone down from over 12 percent to a little over 6  percent. We have cut our uninsured rate by about 50 percent. That is so  important for so many different reasons. Yes, it is important for the  400,000 Marylanders who now have third-party coverage who didn't have  third-party coverage before. They now can go see a doctor rather than  using an emergency room. They don't have to wait if they have a medical  condition; they can get care immediately. They can get access to  preventive health care that keeps them healthy so they don't enter our  health care system in a much more costly way.   Before the Affordable Care Act, these 400,000 people got their health  care, but they didn't get it in the most cost-effective way. They used  emergency rooms, which are very expensive. They didn't pay for their  bills. They entered the health care system in a more acute way, using  more health care services than they need, and they didn't pay their  bills. As a result, we saw that those who had health insurance were  paying more than they should because of those who did not have health  insurance. That added to the cost, not just of those who didn't have  the insurance but to all Maryland insured.   Mr. President, I see that the distinguished majority leader is on the  floor. I will be glad to yield to him. I believe he has an announcement  he wants to make.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the point I was starting with is that in  Maryland, yes, there are 400,000 people who now have coverage who  didn't have coverage before, and they are benefiting by being able to  get preventive health care and get affordable care, but it is all  Marylanders who are benefiting because there is less use of emergency  rooms and fewer people who use our health care system who don't pay for  it, the uncompensated care.   Many of my colleagues have read letters that they have received from  constituents, or phone calls, and I am going to do that during the  course of my discussion. I am going to tell you a story that I heard  from a 52-year-old who lives in Harford County who frequently used the  emergency department prior to the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.  This is what this Harford County resident told me: After the passage of  the Affordable Care Act, I began working with Healthy Harford Watch  Program and shortly after was insured. I have been successfully linked  to community health services and no longer depend upon the emergency  room as my only source of health care.   I can give many more accounts of people who had to use the emergency  rooms and are now getting preventive health care and are getting their  health care needs met.   We also now have been able to eliminate the abusive practices of  insurance companies. As I said, over 2 million people have private  health insurance in Maryland. They are all benefiting from the  Affordable Care Act.   If Mr. Price has his way and we repeal the Affordable Care Act, every  Marylander will be at risk. They will be at risk because of the  protections that we put in the Affordable Care Act against abusive  practices of insurance companies.   To me, probably the most difficult thing to understand by my  constituents was the cruel preexisting condition restrictions that were  placed in the law prior to the Affordable Care Act. Simply put, if you  had a preexisting condition, the insurance company would restrict  coverage for that preexisting condition. So exactly what you needed the  health care system to pay for, your insurance company didn't  [[Page S1018]]  pay for it. They said: Look, you had this heart condition before you  were insured; we are not going to pay for your heart needs. You had  cancer; we are not going to pay for your cancer treatment in the  future. You have diabetes, and that leads to a lot of different health  care needs. We are going to restrict your insurance coverage and not  pay for diabetes care. That is a thing of the past with the Affordable  Care Act.   Once again, we are now talking about repealing the Affordable Care  Act. We don't know what it will be replaced with, if at all. Mr. Price,  in the House, has not given us a satisfactory explanation during the  confirmation process of how we are going to be able to guarantee that  everyone who has insurance and everyone who has a need for coverage  with preexisting conditions will be able to get insurance that won't  discriminate against that person because of preexisting conditions.   Another aspect that was an abusive practice before the Affordable  Care Act is that our insurance policies had caps on how many claims you  could make in a year over the lifetime of your policy, and that would  kick in exactly when people who have chronic needs need insurance the  most.   Let me give an example. Juanita, who lives in Hyattsville, MD, told  me about her son. She said her son seemingly was in perfect health, had  graduated from Harvard with a master's degree and was working at a  nonprofit. Then he was diagnosed with a rare cardiovascular disorder.  He didn't know he was going to have that. Well, that required him to  have multiple operations, and it would have fully exceeded his lifetime  cap in hospital stays, and he would not have been able to afford the  care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Juanita's son has full  coverage. That is another example of a person who is at risk if Mr.  Price is able to carry out what he said--repeal the Affordable Care  Act--and we don't have a way to guarantee that insurance companies must  take all comers and must eliminate the caps that we have seen in the  policies before.   Another area which I think has been a pretty popular part of the  Affordable Care Act and which I heard many of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle say they want to keep is allowing 26-year-olds to  stay on their parents' policies--under 26 years of age. That is a very  popular provision. I heard many of my colleagues speak in favor of it.  Remember, when you repeal the Affordable Care Act, that will be  repealed. Unless we have adequate replacements, unless we have an  improvement, that is at risk as well.   I want to talk about another provision that was in the Affordable  Care Act. I authored the provision. It is called a prudent layperson  standard for emergency care. Let me take you back before the Affordable  Care Act. This is why it is important for Congress to be careful as to  how we pass laws. And if we repeal laws, we can go back to these types  of practices. Before the Affordable Care Act, if you had chest pains  and shortness of breath, you would do what I would think any reasonable  person would do: You would be taken to the emergency room as soon as  possible to see whether you are having a heart attack. Those are  classic signs of a heart attack. Yet there were insurance policies that  said that if you went to a hospital that was out of network, they  weren't going to pay the full amount even though you went to the  closest hospital because you had an emergency situation. That makes no  sense at all, but that was the case.   You went to the hospital. You did the right thing, and you found out  you didn't have a heart attack. You went home. You were happy until you  got the bill, and your insurance company said you didn't need to go to  the emergency room because you didn't have a heart attack. Then you do  have a heart attack because you can't pay the bill.    That was the circumstance that existed before the Affordable Care  Act, and we put into the Affordable Care Act, for all insurance  companies, the prudent layperson standard. If it was prudent for you to  go to the nearest emergency room, your insurance plan must cover that  cost. That is the standard today, and I wonder whether, if we repeal  the Affordable Care Act, we will be going back to those types of  abusive practices.   Before the Affordable Care Act, women in some circumstances were in  and of themselves a preexisting condition. Are we going to go back to  those days?   Let me go on to another point that worries me about Mr. Price's  position if we were to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that is  affordability. It is one thing to say people can buy insurance--you  know, there is insurance out there; just buy it. It's another thing  whether you can afford the insurance coverage.   One of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act that I don't think has  been fully explained to the American people is that since the passage  of the Affordable Care Act, we have been able to keep the growth rate  of health care costs below what we had seen before the passage of the  Affordable Care Act. We have reduced costs for all individuals and  companies that have health policies. The rate of growth has been at a  slower rate because of the Affordable Care Act. And I have already  alluded to one of the reasons--we reduced uncompensated care because  more people are paying their bills. We kept the growth rate down.   But there are other aspects to the Affordable Care Act that have  helped bring down the costs, and that is, we have premium tax credits.  In 2015, 70 percent of those who were enrolled in the Maryland Health  Connection--that is our exchange in the State of Maryland--received  some form of a credit. That was provided in the Affordable Care Act. We  recognize that not everyone can afford the premiums, so we provided  credits. If you repeal the Affordable Care Act, we may very well not  have affordable policies for those individuals who have been able to  get credits under the Affordable Care Act.   I want to talk about a situation that was brought to my attention at  several of the roundtable discussions I have held in Maryland with  interest groups on health care, and that has to do with small  businesses.   Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, if I had a forum on small  businesses--and I did. I have been a member of small businesses and  entrepreneurship committees since I first came to the Senate. I believe  in the importance of small businesses. That is where job growth and  innovation takes place. It is critically important that we help small  businesses.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the No. 1 issue that  would come up at roundtable discussions I had with small business  leaders of Maryland was the affordability of health coverage for their  employees. It is no longer an issue that they talk about because the  Affordable Care Act has allowed small companies to have competitive  premium costs with larger companies.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, if you were a small  business owner and you had maybe 10 people in your employ on your  health policy and one of those individuals unfortunately had a major  health episode during that year, you knew that the next year you were  going to get a major premium increase because you were rated on your  own experiences as a small group. That is a thing of the past under the  Affordable Care Act. Now, under the Affordable Care Act, you are in  this big pool, and you are not discriminated against because you happen  to have someone in your employ who needs health care.   It also enables small business owners to hire people who have  particular health needs. They are not going to be discriminated against  because they hire somebody who happens to have the need for health  insurance. Before that, small companies were very reluctant to hire  individuals who had health needs because they knew it would affect  their health policy.   I want to mention one other factor that is pretty telling. Let me  read from a letter I received from Nancy of Silver Spring. This is  something that really gets to me, something I think we have to be very  careful about, because the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is going  to hurt our economy.   Nancy of Silver Spring is a 60-year-old freelance writer/editor and  depends upon the Maryland Health Connection exchange for her health  insurance and the tax credit that helps reduce her premium. She is a  healthy 60-year-old, but no insurance company will write her an  individual policy, she knows--she tried. One of the big factors that  helped Nancy get the courage to leave  [[Page S1019]]  her salaried, full-benefits job and go out on her own was the fact that  the ACA was right on the horizon when she made the leap in 2012.    Nancy writes:         You want a world-class work force? How about giving       everyone access to affordable health care so we can keep       ourselves functioning? You want job creation? How about       keeping the ACA so freelancers, gig workers, and startup       entrepreneurs don't have to split their energy between the       jobs they are creating and some soul-sucking ``day job'' just       for the sake of keeping our health insurance?    This is a real problem. You repeal the Affordable Care Act, people  become what is known as job-locked. They don't like where they work,  they know they can do better, but they can't afford to leave and lose  their health coverage. It may be their spouse, it may be their child,  may be their self, but they are job-locked because they don't have the  protection of knowing they can get affordable coverage if they give up  the insurance they currently have. That hurts our economy. That hurts  the entrepreneur spirit. That hurts innovation. And it is something  that is critically important that we solved in the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Price talks about the repeal and we will have something to  replace it with. That is not an easy one to fix. That is not one that  you can just say we will take care of because you have to have pools  for individuals in small companies that are competitive. If we don't  have the type of comprehensive coverage we have under the Affordable  Care Act, it is very difficult to understand how that can, in fact, be  done. So that gives me great heartburn with someone who espouses the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   We have many stories, many letters here from people who literally  would have had to go through bankruptcy.   In Laurel, MD, Mark tells me about his son Timmy, who developed a  rare genetics syndrome called Opitz G/BBB. Timmy's medical expenses  would have reached his family's lifetime maximum of $1 million when he  turned 3 months old. When Timmy finally made it home, the ACA covered  and continues to cover his cost of medical equipment. The law covers  all of Timmy's specialist appointments, surgeries, and hospital stays.   Recently, Timmy was sick and coughing up blood. Mark and his wife  took him to the emergency room without fear that he would incur debt he  would never be able to pay. Without the Affordable Care Act, Mark's  family would likely be in bankruptcy.   Go back before the Affordable Care Act. Look under bankruptcies. Look  up what the major reason was for bankruptcy. It was people's inability  to pay their medical bills in the United States of America. That is  something we don't want to go back to.   I started my comments by talking about pediatric dental. The  Affordable Care Act provides essential health benefits so that every  person who is insured, every person who is in our system, is guaranteed  certain benefits. That affects nearly 3 million Marylanders who are  protected by the essential health benefits in the current law. They  include such things as maternal benefits and newborn health care,  mental health and addiction.   Mr. President, you have been the leader of this body on dealing with  mental health services and addiction services, and I applaud you for  your efforts, but quite frankly, if we lose the essential health  benefits, private insurance companies aren't going to cover these  costs.   We have an epidemic nationwide on drug addiction. We have seen opioid  misuse lead to heroin, lead to fentanyl. The death rate in Maryland is  up about 20 percent every year. We have doubled and quadrupled the  number of ODs the last 5 or 6 years, and the numbers are still going  up. We need coverage so that we can, first and foremost, stop people  from using it in the beginning--an education program, a prevention  program; we have to do more of that. We also have to keep people alive  and get them into treatment and save their lives, and the Affordable  Care Act helps us get that done.   You repeal these essential health benefits, I really worry as to  whether--mental health and drug addiction have never been a priority  for private insurance companies or, for that matter, the Medicaid  system. So we have to make sure that we maintain that type of coverage,  and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act puts all of that at risk.   One of the areas I worked on very carefully when I was in the House,  and now in the Senate, was preventive health care services.  Immunization, cancer screenings, contraception--those types of services  are critically important. We had a meeting at lunch today. I found out  that unwanted pregnancies are at a historically low level. Are we going  to go back to the day where women cannot afford contraceptive services?  That makes no sense at all. It is counterproductive to what we all  agree we need to do.   I want to talk about one or two other issues which I think are  important which are also in jeopardy with the repeal the Affordable  Care Act or policies that have been espoused by Mr. Price. One is the  Medicaid expansion.   The Medicaid expansion covers our most vulnerable. These are people  who don't really have a strong voice in our political system. They are  people who really depend upon us, every one of us in the Senate, to  protect their health care needs. These are people who are desperate,  who can't afford health care other than through our medical assistance  program, the Medicaid Program. Yet there has been talk about block- granting that program to the States. Have you looked at State budgets  recently? Do you really believe our States have the financial capacity  to deal with the Medicaid population without a partnership with the  Federal government?   Maryland has been a pretty strong State with Medicaid expansion. My  Governor is doing the right thing. I am proud of what Maryland has  done, but if you withdraw the Federal partnership, the Governor doesn't  have that type of flexibility in the budget to make up the difference.  It is going to hurt. It is going to hurt our health care system, hurt  our most vulnerable.   It has been estimated that a block grant--that by 2019, Maryland will  lose close to $2 billion. We can't make that up. Would we still cover  substance abuse under Medicaid? We didn't before. If we don't cover  that, are we going to now be denying those centers that are located for  substance abuse? All this is put at great risk.   We know that Mr. Price, in his fiscal year 2017 budget proposal,  looked at this proposal, and I believe it was at $1 trillion at that  time.   There is a provision in the Affordable Care Act that I authored that  sets up Offices of Minority Health and Health Disparities within all  our health departments and sets up the National Institute for Minority  Health and Health Disparities. We elevated it in the Affordable Care  Act. I would certainly hope that we would not be repealing that,  although it is in the Affordable Care Act. But I can tell you that the  mission of Minority Health and Health Disparities will be severely  restricted if we repeal the Affordable Care Act or we block-grant the  Medicaid Program because it is the minority population who had been  discriminated against historically in our health care system who are  most at risk.   I can give you one example of that: our qualified health centers. We  significantly increase the resources in the qualified health centers as  part of the Affordable Care Act. I have been to our qualified health  centers in Maryland, and I have seen that they now have dental services  that they didn't have before the Affordable Care Act. They now have  mental health facilities. It is one thing to have third-party coverage  but another thing to have access to a facility. We know that in rural  areas, it is very challenging. In poor neighborhoods, it is also  challenging. Qualified health centers help fill that void.   I was talking to our qualified health centers in Maryland. I said:  What happens now if we repeal the Affordable Care Act? They literally  told me that they can't stay in business because they would lose so  much of their reimbursement because it is now being reimbursed under  the Medicaid system because these people enrolled; that it would  jeopardize their ability to provide the types of services they are  providing today. So you are not only denying people third-party  reimbursement, you are denying them access to care by the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act.   Lastly, let me talk about our Medicare population. Medicare was part  of the Affordable Care Act. We don't hear too much talk about that  today. We extended the solvency of Medicare as a  [[Page S1020]]  result of the Affordable Care Act. We brought down the cost of Part B  premiums as a result of the Affordable Care Act. And we are closing the  doughnut hole coverage gap for prescription medicines within the  Medicare system. Before the Affordable Care Act, how many times would  we go to a senior center and someone would tell us they didn't pick up  their prescriptions from the counter because they didn't have the money  to pay for the cost because they were in the doughnut hole? Well, that  is coming to an end. It has already closed enough so people are not in  that vulnerable situation. But it is now coming to an end as a result  of the passage of the Affordable Care Act.    So I take this time today because of Mr. Price's nomination. I care  deeply about the principle Senator Van Hollen talked about and others  have talked about; that is, health care in America should be a right  not a privilege. The Affordable Care Act has helped us in achieving  that.   Somehow I believe that if we ask the American people, some would say:  Well, we don't like this ObamaCare, but we like this Affordable Care  Act. Let us be honest with the American people. Let us recognize that  this bill has changed the landscape of health care in America for the  better: reduced costs, extended coverage, more quality coverage,  insurance companies now have to spend at least 80 percent of their  premiums on benefits.   So much of that has been done as a result of the Affordable Care Act.  Can we do it better? Absolutely. Let's work together, Democrats and  Republicans, to improve the health care system in this country without  scaring Americans that they are going to lose the benefits they already  have.   For those reasons, I believe Mr. Price does not represent what we  need, and I will, unfortunately, be voting against his confirmation.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.
