 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of this  resolution and thank the gentlewoman from Nevada for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution conveys the congressional disapproval of  the Department of Education's refusal to protect students and taxpayers  from predatory institutions. Those students are victims of widespread,  proven fraud about graduation rates, job placement rates, and  transferability of credits.   Fortunately, the law provides relief, but instead of maintaining the  Obama-era borrower defense rule, which provides a fair and streamlined  process to provide debt relief to defrauded students, the Department of  Education has finalized a new borrower defense rule that prevents an  overwhelming majority of defrauded students from getting relief.   We should reject this new rule and provide meaningful relief to  defrauded students. Making defrauded students whole is the right thing  to do, but it is not the only thing we should do.   We must ensure that students and taxpayers are not defrauded in the  first place. That is why we should pass the College Affordability Act,  a comprehensive overhaul of our higher education system that cracks  down on low-quality, predatory schools. The College Affordability Act  holds schools accountable for students' success and cuts the cost of  college for students and families across the country.   Mr. Speaker, to address the present problem, those students need  relief today. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution of congressional disapproval.
