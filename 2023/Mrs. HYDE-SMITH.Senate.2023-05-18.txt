 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Mr.  Wade Litton of Greenwood, MS, for his service and contributions to the  State of Mississippi while serving as the 87th president of Delta  Council.   Organized in 1935, Delta Council plays an important role in uniting  agricultural, business, and economic development leadership to solve  problems and promote greater opportunities in the Mississippi Delta  region, which encompasses 19 counties in northwest Mississippi. Mr.  Litton has worked tirelessly this year to advance the priorities of  Delta Council, including healthcare, farm policy, economic development,  flood control, and education. He is also the third generation of his  family to serve as president of Delta Council.   Mr. Litton is the chief executive officer of Wade, Inc., a fourth- generation company that operates 14 John Deere dealerships in the  Mississippi Delta. As a businessman, Mr. Litton and his company are at  the forefront of evolving farm technology tools that enable producers  to become more efficient and productive. Mr. Litton's priorities in  leading Delta Council have been to continue the work of the  organization and to build stronger relationships with the people of the  Delta to help improve the economy and quality of life for all citizens.  He is deeply involved in industrial and community development,  including the Delta Strong regional economic development association.  Mr. Litton assumed the role of Delta Council president during  unprecedented times characterized by rising inflation, rural healthcare  disruptions, the after effects of the global coronavirus pandemic, and  a multitude of other challenges. Wade Litton has been a steady and calm  leader over this past year and has contributed his vast knowledge and  service to many critical issues during his tenure as president.   Outside of his time spent running his business and serving Delta  Council, Mr. Litton contributes his time to many other important  organizations. He serves as a commissioner for Greenwood Utilities, a  member of the Young Presidents' Organization, and is involved with the  Greenwood-Leflore Chamber of Commerce, the Greenwood United Way, the  Boys and Girls Club of Leflore County, the Agribusiness Industry  Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and the Greenwood  Rotary Club. He is also a youth soccer and baseball coach. Mr. Litton,  his wife Meagan, and his three children Kennan, Robert, and Elizabeth  are members of the First Presbyterian Church, where he serves as an  elder.   It is my pleasure to join the citizens of the great State of  Mississippi in expressing our appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Wade  Litton and in sharing these good wishes with his family. His  [[Page S1740]]  years of service and leadership have undoubtedly contributed to the  overall success of this highly respected 88-year-old organization,  Delta Council.                            ____________________
