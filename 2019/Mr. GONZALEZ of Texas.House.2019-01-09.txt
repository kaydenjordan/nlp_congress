 Madam Speaker, during one of the most divisive  times in American history, I rise today in a moment of American  optimism.   In this freshly minted 116th Congress, the most diverse in our  history, I welcome all new Members, young and old; Democrats and  Republicans; from the North, South, East, or West; male or female; gay  or straight; Jew or gentile. And I ask you to join me in this journey  of optimism.   Today is the beginning of the rest of our history, the history of the  opportunity we have before us to solve the Nation's critical issues  that are happening today, the everyday problems that our people live  with, in our diverse land.   Let us never forget who we are and the greatness we have shown the  world. Let us never forget that this is the America that freed slaves,  granted religious freedoms, fed the hungry, and welcomed the stranger;  the America that spread democracy and freedom around the globe; the  America that freed Europe and defended others from bullies and foes;  the America that gave the world electricity and light. We put the first  man on the Moon, flew the first woman across the pond, and created the  internet and the iPhone and, yes, Facebook and Twitter, too.   We gave the world baseball and proudly root for our Olympians who  lead the world in medals. We entertain the world with Hollywood, MTV,  and American pop, hip-hop, Tejano, country, rock `n' roll, and jazz  music. We bring smiles and joy to children around the world through  Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.   We are also the country of the Mayo, Johns Hopkins, MD Anderson, and  Cleveland clinics.   And all of this is while enjoying the largest economy in the world.   This is the America the world longs to be, and this is the America we  have the responsibility to be, the America the world is still patiently  and optimistically waiting and watching to see the next great thing we  do. We are the America that came together in solidarity after 9/11. We  are still that America.   To the young in this country, I promise you, you are going to be  okay. There is a lot of reason to be optimistic, because I still  believe that everyone serving in this body sincerely loves this country  and, at the end of the day, rises to the occasion to do what is right  for it.   There is nothing greater than staying united, conserving our  creativity and work ethic while respecting our differences. The world  is counting on us.   To you, America, I toast. I toast with a freshly brewed double  espresso from Starbucks--yes, another American gem. That, my friends,  is what makes America great. God bless the USA.                            ____________________
