 Mr. President, our amendment achieves a simple goal  desired by all of us: equal treatment for all the 9/11 families, the  Beirut Marine barracks bombing families, and all victims of terrorism.   To those families, we know that nothing we do here can assuage your  grief or replace your loss, but we pray that this action by your  Congress, on behalf of your fellow citizens, will serve as a reminder  that we hold you close in our hearts and we pray for your comfort.   As a show of our support and love for these families, I suggest the  Senate accept the amendment by voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.
