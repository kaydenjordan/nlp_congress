 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Waters so much for  yielding to me, and I want to than Chairwoman Waters and my former  colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee for getting this  important legislation, the Consumers First Act, to the floor.    The CFPB, as Members have heard, has been a great equalizer in our  financial markets for regular Americans. It makes sure that financial  institutions follow the law and that regular people are treated fairly.   Every business claims that they put their customers first, but what  happens when they don't? For far too long, the answer was nothing.  [[Page H4080]]    We have seen the car loans at higher interest rates for people of  color and mortgage products that almost brought our economy down and  created and pushed us into the Great Recession.   Then along came Dodd-Frank and the CFPB, which set the table for the  economic expansion that we have seen since 2010. The dedicated men and  women of the CFPB have literally put $12 billion back into the pockets  of victims of fraud, harmful financial schemes, and other abuses.   Let me say to my colleagues on the other side: Speaker after speaker  has gotten up and talked about subjecting the CFPB to the  appropriations process. They have claimed that they are against the  independence of the agencies, calling them independent bureaucrats.  That is exactly what their comments lean toward is taking away the  independence of this agency to determine fraud and abuse and subjecting  it to the whims of whoever is the President or whoever is the  administration.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation  because it is good for consumers, good for businesses, good for our  financial markets, and good for the American people.
