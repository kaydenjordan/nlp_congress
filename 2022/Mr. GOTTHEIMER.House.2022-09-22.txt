 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my  bipartisan, bicameral legislation, the Invest to Protect Act, to invest  in good policing, to fight crime, and to protect our families and  officers.   We must ensure that local police departments across our country have  what they need to recruit and retain the finest officers, provide  necessary training, and invest in providing mental health resources for  our officers.   Across our country, we have seen a rise in crime, and this is at a  time when it is harder than ever to hire, recruit, and retain officers.  In fact, last year, public reports found a 44 percent increase in  retirements and an 18 percent increase in resignations of law  enforcement.   It is clear: If you want to make something better, you don't get  there by cutting or defunding. You need to make smart, targeted  investments. We must fund, not defund, law enforcement.   That is why I introduced the bipartisan Invest to Protect Act to make  critical investments in local police departments and protect our  communities.   Work on Invest to Protect started more than a year ago through  bipartisan police reform talks with Democrats and Republicans in the  House, the Senate, and the States, including with members of the  bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, who have overwhelmingly endorsed  this legislation.   I helped craft the bipartisan Invest to Protect Act with Republican  Congressman, former sheriff, and my friend,   John Rutherford, and it  was developed through conversations with both sides in both Chambers,  and with a broad spectrum of stakeholders. I, again, thank the sheriff  for his work and leadership.   I am appreciative of the support and input from the National  Association of Police Organizations; the Fraternal Order of Police; our  New Jersey law enforcement organizations and departments, including the  New Jersey State PBA and the New Jersey State Fraternal Order of  Police; and my Senate colleagues.   This bill would not be where it is today without the support of  Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty, whose leadership  and friendship have been critical. I also thank the Congressional  Progressive Caucus for their constructive engagement in this process. I  thank Caucus Chairman Jeffries and Speaker Pelosi for their work, as  well.   The Invest to Protect Act will invest in small and midsized police  departments with fewer than 125 sworn officers, which make up more than  96 percent of local departments.   First, it will invest in officer safety, de-escalation, and domestic  violence response training, and it will offset overtime pay for  officers who are training.   Second, it will provide grants for departments to recruit new  officers. It will also provide retention bonuses to help them keep  their best officers on the job.    Finally, it will help departments provide mental  health resources for their officers and include strong accountability  measures.   These are critical steps we must take.   Going forward, I will continue to fight for additional equipment and  training our officers need to protect our communities.   The bottom line: You can't cut or defund your way to safer  communities and better police departments. It is about investing to  protect. We must always get the backs of those who risk their lives  every day to protect us.   Again, I thank Sheriff Rutherford for his leadership, law enforcement  unions for working so hard on this legislation, and all of our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for putting country first and  getting this legislation to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letter of support of H.R. 6448, Invest to Protect Act, from the  Fraternal Order of Police.                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                 Washington, DC, September 22, 2022.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Stephen J. Scalise,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Hoyer and       Scalise: I am writing on behalf of the members of the       Fraternal Order of Police to urge the Members of the U.S.       House of Representatives to support the passage of H.R. 5768,       the ``Violent Incident Clearance and Technological       Investigative Methods (VICTIM) Act,'' and H.R. 6448, the       ``Invest to Protect Act,'' which could be considered on the       floor of the House as early as today.        Homicide cases can be very difficult to clear--especially       those committed via firearm--and non-fatal shootings even       more so. Closing these types of crimes requires diligence,       manpower, and a sustained investigative effort. Given the       limited resources of law enforcement agencies, it's important       to provide the significant, dedicated resources that clearing       these crimes requires, especially given their oftentimes       heinous nature, and the need to get justice for the victims       and their families.        The ``VICTIM Act'' would establish a grant program to help       State, Tribal, and local law enforcement agencies improve       their clearance rates for homicides, non-fatal shootings and       other violent crimes. Agencies can use these grant funds to       train, hire, or retain additional detectives, investigators,       or other police personnel to investigate, solve, and respond       to these crimes. The grants can also be used to improve       training for agency personnel to address the needs of victims       and family members impacted by these crimes. By providing       those important resources to law enforcement agencies across       the country, we can improve the chances that murders, sexual       assaults, kidnappings, and non-fatal shootings get cleared.       This means ensuring punishment for the perpetrators, securing       justice for the victims and their families, and providing       peace of mind for the communities our members work so hard to       protect.        The FOP also urges Members of the House to support H.R.       6448, the ``Invest to Protect Act.'' Over the last few years,       law enforcement officers have faced many challenges and       threats to their well-being that have created a dangerous       environment for those sworn to protect the public. These       challenges have ranged from violence against officers, an       increase in violent rhetoric against them, lagging       technology, recruitment and retention issues, and mental       health concerns. Smaller municipalities are experiencing       increased strain on the men and women in blue. We believe       that the ``Invest to Protect Act'' can help our nation's       smaller agencies and departments combat these issues that       plague law enforcement officers in smaller municipalities.        This legislation would establish a grant program that would       be used for training of officers from police departments and       municipalities that employ less than 125 law enforcement       officers. The funding appropriated would be $60 million over       a five-year period. These trainings would include de-      escalation, domestic violence response, and response calls to       vulnerable populations like those involving persons with       disabilities, mental health issues, or substance abuse       disorders.        This legislation is also designed to help these smaller       agencies recruit new officers and to help address the       retention issue of current officers. The funding could also       be used by officers from eligible departments who are       pursuing further education in mental health, public health,       or social work. These officers could receive up to $10,000 in       aid towards their tuition. Lastly, the funding could also be       used for mental health services, treatments, and therapies       for active police officers.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I urge the Members of the House to pass       these two bills to support our nation's small departments and       the communities they serve. If I can provide any additional       information about this bill, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in our Washington,       D.C. office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,                                                National President.
