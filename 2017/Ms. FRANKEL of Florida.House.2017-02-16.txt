 Mr. Speaker, Russia is an alarming force in  the world, a nuclear power with an authoritarian President, menacing  our European allies with invasion into Ukraine and threats of incursion  into other Baltic states, lifting mass murderer Assad in Syria,  interfering in democratic elections around the world and here in our  country, and now evidence is mounting that the White House-Putin  connections run deep.   Michael Flynn's shady dealings and lies to the Vice President and the  public--what did the President know? When did he know it?   Answers to these and other questions are critical to our national  security. We must have an independent investigation. The American  people deserve nothing less.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for women to thrive in the  economic and social opportunities of our Nation, we must have the  ability to control our own reproductive lives with full access to  healthcare choices.   Now, here we go again: another Republican bill aimed at taking us  back to the dark, dangerous days when women were prisoners of their own  bodies; back to 50 years ago when Katy, a nurse in Florida, had no  access to legal contraception or abortion. She was a mother of two,  recently divorced.   Pregnant and unable to responsibly raise another child, she made an  appointment on the phone with a nameless person who met her on a lonely  street corner in Miami. She blindfolded her, hid her under a rug in a  car, and took her to a garage where she had an abortion.   But Katy was one of the lucky ones. She survived. Not so fortunate  were the women who threw themselves down stairs or inserted chemicals  or coat hangers into their uteruses in order to terminate their  pregnancy.   Madam Speaker, we will not go back to those dark, dangerous days.
