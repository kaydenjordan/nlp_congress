 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize St.  Patrick's Day in Savannah, Georgia.   The first St. Patrick's Day parade in Savannah began in 1824, and it  is now a parade that gathers hundreds of thousands of visitors from all  over the world.   The second-largest St. Patrick's Day in the United States is  important for everyone in Savannah, but it is especially important for  the Savannah  [[Page H1419]]  Irish community. Savannah has a historically large Irish community that  is integral to the fabric of the city, and the St. Patrick's Day parade  is the direct result of this impact.   Unfortunately, the parade and election of the grand marshal was  canceled this year due to the pandemic. However, it is important that  we continue to celebrate and honor the heritage and culture of the  Irish. I look forward to continuing this special tradition and  celebrating St. Patrick's Day in Savannah with everyone once the  pandemic ends.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 86.
