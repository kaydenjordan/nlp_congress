 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the end of Black History Month and the beginning of Women's  History Month by honoring an individual who represents both so well.   She is an icon, she is a legend, and she is now--and forever--the  moment.   I want to celebrate none other than who I believe is the undisputed  queen of pop and R&B, Beyonce Knowles Carter.   A few weeks ago, this Brown skin girl out of H-Town won her 32nd  Grammy, giving her the most Grammy wins of all time.   But Beyonce is so much more than a performer and a singer. She is a  creator and an artist. When the radio said to speed it up, she went  slower.   I will never forget the time I saw Destiny's Child perform for the  very first time. It was life changing for me and for the way I  experience music. I became an instant fan then and have been a huge fan  ever since.   Beyonce is also a role model for millions across the country. She  stood up for voting rights, for feminism, for women and girls, and for  my community--the LGBTQ+ community. For my generation and so many  others, she simply is the greatest of all time.   Her story is history.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mrs. Carter on her achievements and for  winning the most Grammys ever in the history of our country. You are  irreplaceable.                            ____________________
