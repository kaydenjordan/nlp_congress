 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the memory of an amazing Johnstown, Cambria County native, Carlton  Haselrig.   An incredibly accomplished athlete, Carlton excelled in both  wrestling and football. In high school, he was an undefeated wrestler  and State champion.   At the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown, Haselrig became the most  decorated wrestler in NCAA history, with a total of six NCAA national  championships.   In 1989, Haselrig was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers, despite  never having played in a college football game.   Haselrig returned home to coach football and wrestling at Greater  Johnstown, his high school. He dedicated his time to the youth in his  community, openly talking about his past struggles with addiction and  mentoring hundreds.   His wife said: ``He never wanted to be the star that he became. He  just wanted to be Carlton Haselrig from Johnstown--a family man, a  husband, and a dad.''   Sadly, Haselrig passed away this summer. Even in death, Haselrig  continues to give back, having donated his brain for chronic traumatic  encephalopathy research.   May God bless Carlton and his family.                            ____________________
