 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed  the fragility and disparities of the American healthcare system,  particularly in underserved communities.   Through the American Rescue Plan, Congress is seeking to close these  disparities to make healthcare more accessible, with greater quality,  through Federally Qualified Health Centers.   The American Rescue Plan funding released this week builds on this  model, supporting improvements to facilities across the Nation,  including $2.2 million in new funding for western New York.   Health centers serve as trusted messengers and providers to connect  with hard-to-reach patients. Investing in these health clinics'  infrastructure will deliver healthcare savings, better health outcomes,  and overall healthier communities throughout America.                            ____________________
