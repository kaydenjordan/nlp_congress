 Mr. Speaker, words hold power. They are intentional  representations of our values and our beliefs. Our democracy is at its  strongest when we protect the right to dissent, to resist, and to speak  truth to power.   However, over the past few weeks, this body has wrongfully and  dangerously conflated dissent with hate speech and has willfully  characterized acts of resistance as acts of bigotry. Bigotry and  hateful speech are real, tangible threats to our shared humanity and  our multiracial democracy, and we must address them.   As someone who has heard Members of this body who are not being  brought up for censure casually use their platforms to carelessly  promote violent, racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, and  anti-immigrant language and ideals, I am clear that this resolution is  another ill-intentioned attempt to persecute dissenting voices who  refuse to stay silent and whose perspective challenges this body and  the dominant narrative.   We must resist the urge to scapegoat and vilify those who disagree  with us, and I unequivocally stand with my friend, Rashida Tlaib. I  will be voting against the resolution, and I encourage my friends to do  your job.
