 Madam Speaker, I am here to speak about a wonderful  cause, Dream Like Drew, that promotes awareness of a rare genetic  disorder, cri du chat.   Dream Like Drew is a weeklong event starting on May 3 where students  can show their support by wearing unique socks, one high and one low.   Cri du chat is caused by the deletion of genetic material on the  fifth chromosome that can cause delays in motor functions. Dream Like  Drew was started by Kasey Eykyn, a teacher in south Jersey, in honor of  her son, Drew Eykyn. Drew is an 8-year-old little boy who was diagnosed  with cri du chat shortly after he was born.   He lives life with a positive outlook and mindset that will allow him  to achieve his dreams always. Drew is an inspiration to all, and Dream  Like Drew is an amazing cause that encourages a discussion on how  important acceptance and inclusion is for those with disabilities.   God bless him forever.                            ____________________
