 Madam Speaker, throughout American history, generations  of American frontline workers have answered the call of duty to support  our Nation, States, and local communities.   From those in the factories who fueled the Allied advance in World  War II to the men and women who cleared the rubble after the attacks on  September 11, there is a strong, storied reference that comes with  being a frontline worker.   Today, across Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District and America,  our nurses, doctors, and healthcare providers are answering that call  of duty.   In the face of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and global uncertainty,  our healthcare professionals have not wavered in their mission,  exemplifying compassion, determination, and resilience. Most  importantly, our healthcare workers have given our Nation reassurance  that we can defeat this virus.   To PA-12's frontline healthcare workers at Evangelical Community  Hospital, UPMC, Geisinger, Endless Mountains, Bucktail Medical, Robert  Packer, Guthrie Towanda Memorial, Troy Community, Divine Providence,  Mount Nittany, Barnes-Kasson, and Tyler Memorial, I know your job is  not easy, but your impact is felt throughout our community and across  our Nation. Please know that we are forever grateful for your service.                            ____________________
