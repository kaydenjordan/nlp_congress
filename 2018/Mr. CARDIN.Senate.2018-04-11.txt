 Mr. President, this week the Senate is considering two  important labor-related nominations: the nominations of John Ring to  serve as a Member of the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, and  Patrick Pizzella to serve as Deputy Secretary of Labor, DOL.  Unfortunately, given the nominees' well-documented hostility to the  collective bargaining rights of working men and women, I will not vote  to confirm either of them.   If Mr. Ring is confirmed, he will restore the Board to the 3-2 anti- labor majority, with no assurances that President Trump will fill the  Democratic seat of former chairman Mark Gaston Pearce expiring this  summer. It is important to note here that nominations to the NLRB have  traditionally been confirmed in bipartisan pairs.   Mr. Ring authored blog posts calling the NLRB an ``activist''  organization during the Obama administration. In other blog posts, he  characterized the NLRB's union election procedures as ``some of the  biggest assaults on employer rights in recent history.'' In fact, the  election rule simply modernized union election procedures and has  actually resulted in slightly fewer union elections.   During the brief 3-2 Republican majority late last year before then- Board Chairman Phillip Miscimarra completed his term on December 16,  2017, the NLRB rushed to overturn landmark decisions, weakening  workers' rights under the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, and  undermining the statute's core purpose of promoting collective  bargaining, including the Browning-Ferris Industries joint employer  standard decision. The Board's inspector general has faulted those  efforts, and the Board has been forced to vacate the joint employer  decision. A new Republican majority may reorganize the NLRB in ways  that are unfavorable to workers and their collective bargaining rights.   Mr. Pizzella is a vocal advocate of so-called right-to-work laws.  They really ought to be called right-to-be-exploited laws. As Ross  Eisenbray of the Economic Policy Institute reported last year, ``Wages  are 3.1 percent lower in so-called `right to work' (RTW) states, for  union and nonunion workers alike--after correctly accounting for  differences in cost of living, demographics, and labor market  characteristics. The negative impact of RTW laws translates to $1,558  less a year in earnings for a typical full-time worker.''   There is a clear correlation between the decline in union membership  and stagnant wages. If the Senate confirms Mr. Pizzella and Mr. Ring,  the Republican assault on unions and collective bargaining rights  enshrined in the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, will gain  momentum, and working people and their families will suffer as a  result.   Mr. Pizzella previously served at the Department of Labor, as  Assistant Secretary of Labor for Administration and Management under  President George W. Bush. During Mr. Pizzella's previous tenure at DOL,  the Government Accountability Office, GAO, determined that the  Department left workers vulnerable to unscrupulous employers while  investigating complaints of minimum wage, overtime, and child labor  violations. GAO found that the Wage and Hour Division's complaint  intake, complaint resolution, and investigation processes were  ineffective and discouraged workers from lodging wage-theft complaints.   Mr. Pizzella also has expressed his antipathy to Federal workers and  their unions. I am proud to represent many of these public servants.  The Federal workforce is one of our Nation's finest assets, and public  sector unions make it more productive.   It is ironic that the Senate is considering two nominees this week  who are  [[Page S2055]]  openly hostile to the collective bargaining rights of working people.  Yesterday was Equal Pay Day, which symbolizes the number of extra days  a typical woman who works full-time, year-round must work into 2018 to  be paid what a typical man was paid in 2017. Women are still only paid  80 cents for every dollar paid to a man, a yearly pay difference of  $10,086, and the disparity is even worse for many women of color.    Based on an analysis of Census Bureau data, the National Partnership  for Women and Families is releasing a study which concludes that, in  sum, women employed full time in the U.S. will lose nearly $900 billion  to the wage gap this year. If the wage gap were closed, on average, a  working woman in this country would be able to afford more than 1  additional year of tuition and fees for a 4-year public university, 74  more weeks of food for her family, nearly 7 more months of mortgage and  utility payments, or 14 more months of childcare.   If Mr. Ring and Mr. Pizzella and President Trump are unwilling to  protect female workers and try to close that pay gap, which seems  likely, then let us let us arm women with the most powerful tool in our  legal system: the U.S. Constitution. Let us finally pass the Equal  Rights Amendment, ERA.   The ERA is barely longer than a tweet, but it would finally give  women full and equal protection under the Constitution. Section 1 of  the ERA states, quite simply, that ``Equality of rights under the law  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on  account of sex.''   When Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure  had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States--38 States--within 7  years. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint  resolution, but ultimately only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the  ERA when the deadline expired in 1982. Note that the deadline wasn't  contained in the amendment itself; the deadline was in the text of the  joint resolution.   Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the  ratification of amendments, so the ERA deadline is arbitrary. To put  the matter in context, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which  prohibits congressional pay raises without an intervening election, was  ratified in 1992, 203 years after it was first proposed.   The Senate should vote on a Senate Joint Resolution I have  introduced--S.J. Res. 5--to remove the ERA deadline, and every State in  our Union that has not yet taken up its consideration should do so  without any further delay.   Nevada became the 36th State to ratify the amendment last March,  leaving the ERA just two States short of the required three-fourths of  the States threshold under the Constitution if the deadline were to be  abolished.   The ERA would incorporate a ban on gender-based discrimination,  explicitly written or otherwise, into the Constitution. It could change  outcomes in discrimination cases by requiring the Supreme Court to use  the higher standard of ``strict scrutiny'' when assessing those cases,  the same standard used in racial and religious discrimination cases.   I think many--perhaps most--Americans would be shocked to learn that  our Constitution has no provision expressly prohibiting gender  discrimination.   In a 2011 interview, the late Justice Antonin Scalia summed up the  need for an Equal Rights Amendment best. He said, ``Certainly the  Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The  only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''   So I ask my Senate colleagues this question most sincerely: Are we  willing to do what must be done to prohibit gender discrimination in  the Constitution? The people being affected by systemic gender  inequality are our constituents. They are our mothers, sisters, wives,  daughters, and our granddaughters. They are American citizens who  deserve basic respect and equality.   It is time to end the assault on working families in this country.  Let's end discrimination by making it possible to ratify the ERA. Let's  close the pay gap. Let's stop denigrating Federal workers. Let's  support, not attack, the collective bargaining rights that are the  cornerstone of a strong middle class. I regret that the Senate is  poised to confirm two individuals who are unlikely to assist these  efforts. We can and must do better.    Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  contributions of Renee Sprow, who dedicated over 30 years of service to  the Small Business Development Center, SBDC, network. Ms. Sprow spent  her career promoting economic development and the growth of small  businesses, which means that she spent her career helping countless  people and their families achieve the American dream.   One of many highlights of Ms. Sprow's service to the Federal  Government and private industry was her critical role in helping to  establish the National Minority Purchasing Council, now known as the  National Minority Supplier Development Council, which reports private  contracts exceeding $1 billion to minority suppliers. She designed and  directed small, minority and women-owned subcontracting programs for  major Federal and private-sector construction and revitalization  projects, resulting in the award of multimillion dollar subcontracts.   Under Ms. Sprow's leadership as director of the Maryland SBDC, the  value of contracts awarded to minority firms who met the U.S.  Department of Defense's Socially and Economically Disadvantaged  Business Utilization qualifications increased by more than 200 percent.   Ms. Sprow also participated in the drafting of Public Law 95-507,  which established the legal authority to reshape Federal procurement  policy for contracting with minority and women-owned firms. As an  entrepreneur herself, Mr. Sprow owned and operated two businesses that  generated annual revenues exceeding $1 million.   Ms. Sprow's objective while serving as director of the Maryland SBDC  was to contribute to economic development within the State by making  the network responsive to the needs of Maryland's small business  community. She deftly managed a $4.3 million annual budget and 50 staff  members in 22 offices located throughout Maryland. During her tenure,  she realigned the SBDC network to target assistance to businesses more  effectively and efficiently. In 2009, one of her regions ranked first  in region III and second nationwide for the annual SBDC of the Year  award presented by the Small Business Administration, SBA. In addition,  the Washington, DC, and Baltimore district SBA offices each selected a  Maryland SBDC region as the winner of the 2009 SBDC Excellence and  Innovation Center Award.   Ms. Sprow transformed the SBDC network's operational methods to favor  economic outcomes over mere output. To do so, she instituted a  management performance system to ensure accountability for network  performance. This management tool for evaluating, measuring, analyzing,  and improving SBDC operations also helped objectively determine  economic impact and customer satisfaction.   Ms. Sprow established a subsidiary program to assist firms in  obtaining government contracts. In 2008, the program's clients obtained  more than $37 million in government contracts. In conjunction, she  developed industry assistance programs for high technology, retail,  construction, and green business opportunities in response to client  needs. Under Ms. Sprow's leadership, the Maryland SBDC attained  national accreditation in 2000, 2005, and 2009. It is no surprise that,  thanks in part to Ms. Sprow's significant contributions, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce has named Maryland the No. 1 State in the Nation  for entrepreneurship and innovation.   Ms. Sprow received a B.A. in business administration from Howard  University and a master's degree in business administration,  specializing in marketing, from The George Washington University. She  was the guest of honor at a luncheon last week, while the Senate was in  recess, to celebrate her career and her retirement, so I wanted to take  this opportunity to urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Ms. Sprow  for her exemplary service to her community, to Maryland, and the Nation  and to send our best wishes for a happy and fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
