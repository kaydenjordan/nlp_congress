 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 676, the Coastal  Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2023, alongside my colleague  from the State of Ohio.   In bipartisan fashion, we gather here today in Congress encouraging  our colleagues to support this incredibly important piece of  legislation introduced by my colleague from Maine (Ms. Pingree) and my  colleague from Florida (Mr. Waltz), two Members who certainly  understand the importance of ocean acidification and my colleague from  Ohio (Mr. Miller) is spot on.   As Members from the Great Lakes region, we do applaud NOAA's efforts  to understand the Great Lakes and to observe their inner workings. At  long last, we are finally now requiring the collaboration of our Tribal  communities into the Ocean Acidification Board of NOAA. Tribes with  their incredible expertise and their knowledge of the inner workings of  our oceans will be important contributors to this board, the history of  this board, and the way in which we move forward to advance the science  of ocean acidification and mitigating the negative impacts of  acidification on the livelihoods, traditions, and well-being of coastal  communities.   Acidification has resulted from the oceans absorbing about 30 percent  of the world's atmospheric carbon emissions. This change in water  chemistry has certainly had detrimental impacts on the health of  aquatic organisms by inhibiting their ability to grow and develop. The  impacts can be felt across all levels of the ocean ecosystem, and it  seriously impacts coastal economic activities, such as fisheries,  aquaculture, and ecotourism.   Indeed, ocean acidification--and we know this most prominently  through discussion about our reefs--has already had considerable impact  on the socioeconomic parts of our oceans. It is also true that the  impacts are felt well beyond coastal communities and supporting their  fight against ocean and coastal acidification should be a national  endeavor, which is, again, why we are bringing today's legislation  before you.   H.R. 676 would improve the ability of coastal communities to respond  to the challenges of acidification by including two representatives  from Indian Tribes, Tribal organizations, and Tribal consortia from  affected communities, thereby integrating traditional  ecological knowledge into science and addressing societal inequities-- inclusion at its best.    Additionally, the bill supports the continued dissemination of  research, data, and modern efforts among Federal agencies, non-Federal  resource managers, and affected stakeholders by maintaining the Ocean  Acidification Information Exchange--knowledge.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  important bipartisan legislation that rises to the challenge of ocean  and coastal acidification, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Maine an  additional 30 seconds.  [[Page H2147]]         Madam Speaker, in closing, we are also delighted to have  new members of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee join us in  passing bipartisan legislation. We are so grateful for the expertise  from our colleague from Maine and the phenomenal leadership of our  ranking member, Ms. Lofgren, and certainly our chair, Mr. Lucas.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lofgren and my  phenomenal colleague, Ms. Deborah Ross, for their leadership in putting  forth this piece of legislation in a bipartisan way alongside the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Miller). Ms. Ross hails from Research Triangle  Park, and there is no one better in this institution to understand and  put forth the systems of our supercomputer technology, matching the  Department of Energy alongside NOAA to get in front of these storms  that are hitting us more ferociously and faster than ever before.   Every single Member of this body can talk about their experience with  a storm in their State or in their district. This is very real, and we  know that supercomputer technology puts forth the best and the fastest  applications. The DOE technology along with NOAA and their capabilities  to match these datasets will help us get in front of these storms.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Ross, a second-term member on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee, the ranking member, and the chair for  their work on this bill. I urge all Members to join us in passing this  bipartisan legislation, getting in front of storms, getting in front of  climate change, and making people's lives better.    Madam Speaker, for everyone watching back at home, H.R.  [[Page H2151]]  1734 is bipartisan lawmaking at its best.   A new Member of Congress, Mr. Collins of Georgia, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Research and Technology of the House Science Committee,  a subcommittee I was privileged to serve as the chair of for two terms,  and the brilliant Ms. Caraveo, another new Member of Congress from  Colorado, came together to tackle an opioid epidemic plaguing the  American people, plaguing youth, to get in front of tranq.   This is why the Science Committee, for everyone watching back at  home, is so very important. We are utilizing NIST, the standards agency  of the United States of America, to make sure that we can track and  tackle these insidious drugs that are in our streets, that are in our  neighborhoods, and that are in our homes.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ms. Caraveo, Mr. Collins, and the leadership  of this committee.
