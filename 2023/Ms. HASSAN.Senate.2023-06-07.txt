 Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to  recognize the 100th anniversary of Laconia, New Hampshire's Motorcycle  Week. Over the last century, riders from New Hampshire and across the  country have gathered in Laconia--the heart of New Hampshire's  beautiful Lakes Region--to gather with friends, celebrate their shared  passion for motorcycles, and ride together.   Many consider Laconia's Bike Week to be the oldest national  motorcycle rally in the country. For decades, it was the largest  motorcycle rally in the United States, and it still draws more than  300,000 people a year, which helps support the economy of the Lakes  Region and the rest of New Hampshire as Bike Week participants  patronize our small businesses. Laconia Bike Week is a well-known and  beloved tradition for countless Granite Staters and bikers near and  far. For many, just the name Bike Week evokes fond memories of Laconia  rallies from past years, from cruising New Hampshire's highways and  scenic byways, to spending time with friends, old and new.   Bike Week, of course, does not happen without effort; it takes time  and dedication from the event organizers, who each summer come together  to make this week possible. Nor is it by chance that this event takes  place in New Hampshire; Bike Week is a part of the very fabric of the  Granite State. Bike Week shows off our State's natural beauty; a ride  through Laconia, with an open road ahead and a breeze from Lake  Winnipesaukee blowing by, reminds us of why Granite Staters are always  proud to call New Hampshire home. For bikers and nonbikers alike, the  roar and thunder of engines, the thrill of zooming down a highway, the  dazzling tricks and stunts performed at rallies--summon up our State's  spirit.   One of the many pieces that makes Bike Week special is that riders  have also regularly used the event as a means to raise awareness and  support for critical issues facing New Hampshire and our country. In  1957, riders raised money to help fund polio research and support  families who were grappling with that disease. This year also marks the  35th anniversary of the Meredith POW/MIA Awareness Vigil and the 30th  anniversary of the Freedom Ride to honor American POW/MIA  servicemembers, spearheaded by the Northeast POW/MIA Network. Over the  past few years, more than 2,000 motorcyclists have joined the Freedom  Ride to commemorate the sacrifice of POW/MIA servicemembers and raise  awareness for the missing servicemembers who have not been found. The  Freedom Ride reminds servicemembers, their families, and all Americans  that POW/MIA servicemembers--both those who have returned and those who  remain missing--will never be forgotten.   These acts of recognition and service have helped make Bike Week into  a New Hampshire and American institution. For 100 years in Laconia,  Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life have come together-- united by their shared enthusiasm and their deep love for our beautiful  country--and worked to make our community and our country a better  place. One does not have to be a biker to appreciate that this spirit  of enthusiasm, service, and love of country embodies New Hampshire--and  America--at our best.   On behalf of Congress and all Granite Staters, I offer my  congratulations to the event organizers for 100 years of Laconia  Motorcycle Week. I have no doubt that Granite Staters and Americans  across the country can look forward to it for generations to  come.                            ____________________
