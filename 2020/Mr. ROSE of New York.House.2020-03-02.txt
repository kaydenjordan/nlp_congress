 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Sally Kabel, a young girl from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who, despite  battling leukemia for most of her life, did so bravely and with a love  of life that earned her the nickname ``Sweet Sally Sunshine.''   Sally was adored, not just by her family, but by the entire Bay Ridge  community, which rallied behind her. Everyone came together to support  her family, whether it was bringing meals, raising money, or just  giving them hugs on the street.   With that support, Sally was able to beat cancer, but the treatments  so weakened her body that she passed away in September 2018, just a  week after her sixth birthday.   Although her time with us was far too short, she filled those 6 years  with a lifetime of joy.   Now, her parents, Matthew and Nicole, are helping other families  undergoing the same struggle. They are advocating for childhood cancer  awareness, with the hope that more research will lead to more humane  and effective treatments for children.   Sally was truly the peacemaker of Bay Ridge, bringing out the best in  all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring her  memory.                            ____________________
