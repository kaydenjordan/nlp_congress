 Mr. President, since the Republicans jammed through a  massive corporate tax cut in December, hardly a day goes by that we  don't read about a corporation using the savings to purchase its own  stock. The average citizen may ask: What is that all about?   Well, when a company purchases its own stock, it is sort of  artificially making less stock, buying it back, and raising the price  of the shares. Why do they do that? There are two reasons, both to  benefit the corporate CEOs but not the workers. First, corporate CEOs  have a lot of the stock themselves, so they make money; second, they  look better when the stock price goes up. But the stock price isn't  going up because the company has sold more goods, been more productive,  bought new machinery, or found a new product. The stock simply goes up  because they have decreased the number of shares. It is a scam in a  certain sense, helping corporate CEOs, helping shareholders--80 percent  of the shares are held by the top 10 percent, so it doesn't really help  average Americans, and that is including 401(k)s--but it doesn't help  the worker.   We have heard many claims from our Republican friends: Pass this tax  bill, and the workers will benefit. Well, unfortunately, now we see who  is really benefiting. Just as we predicted, it is the corporate CEOs  and the wealthiest of Americans.   Just recently, the total amount of share buybacks surpassed $220  billion this year. According to the market data firm, TrimTabs, share  buybacks in 2018 averaged $4.8 billion a day--a day--double the pace  for the same period last year.   For a few weeks, right after the President passed his tax bill, what  happened? They had these companies announce bonuses for average  workers. Very few Americans saw those bonuses--a lot of hoopla, but not  much else. The bonuses--not wage increases, not new hires, but one-time  annual bonuses--anyone who gets them, God bless them; there have just  been so few. Those bonuses are being overwhelmed by a deluge of  corporate share buybacks, which do not benefit the average worker, but  benefit the CEOs and the heads of the companies.   According to an analysis by JUST Capital, only 6 percent of the  capital allocated by companies from the tax bill has gone to employees,  while nearly 60 percent has gone to shareholders--again, to the  corporate CEOs who own those shares, the wealthiest of Americans who  own the vast majority of shares. Ten times more capital is going to  shareholders than to workers.   So this bill, which is poorly structured and aimed at the wealthy,  ain't working. The more Americans see it--you know, there was an  initial thrust: Oh, we like the tax bill. At first, it was unpopular as  we talked about it here on the floor. Then, with these bonuses and the  stock market going up, popularity went up a little. Now it is  flattening out and even heading down. In the last three polls, fewer  people liked this tax plan, and that is going to keep happening, my  Republican friends, because they know what it was aimed at and you know  what it was aimed at--the corporate CEOs who came to lobby you and the  wealthy individuals who came to lobby you. It is no wonder the American  people are starting to turn on the Republican tax bill. Polls have  shown its popularity is underwater and trending downward, not up.   This idea that tax cuts would be a political panacea for Republicans  come November is losing altitude fast. Remember, that is what our  Republican friends said: Well, maybe people are upset with the  President's tweets, and maybe this and that are not going so well;  maybe they are not accomplishing that much, but now, with the tax bill,  we will win the election.   Well, look at the Pennsylvania election where a Democrat won the  district  [[Page S1743]]  that Trump carried by 20 points. This is the kind of district that our  Republican friends need to carry. These are Republican suburbs in blue- collar Southwest Pennsylvania.   Early in the race, what did Republicans do? They tried running ads  about the tax bill to help their candidate, Rick Saccone, during the  first few weeks of February. These were the super PACs, the Koch  brothers, and all the others who will benefit hugely from the tax bill.  Somehow they believe that because they will benefit, everyone is going  to think they have benefited.   They ran these ads, often paid for by the Kochs. Two-thirds of the  ads mentioned taxes--two-thirds of all Saccone's ads, both by the Koch- like super PACs and by Saccone himself. The next week, 36 percent  mentioned taxes. Guess what. After 2 weeks of these tax ads, our  Republican friends tested it out, and they got rid of taxes as an  issue. It wasn't working. It wasn't working with fairly well-off  middle-class Pittsburgh suburbanites or blue-collar workers in Greene  County and Westmoreland County and Washington County in Southwest PA,  which are areas where people had voted for Trump.   It is eerily similar, folks, to the Governor's race in Virginia--the  same thing. That was before the bill passed, but still, Republican  candidate Ed Gillespie started his campaign on a tax plan similar to  the Republican tax plan. He had to give it up because it wasn't getting  traction.   The American people are smart about this. They know what is going on.  They know the vast majority of this goes to the wealthy. They know the  amount that is going to them is small. They know their tax break is  temporary and the corporate tax break is permanent. Most of all, they  know we have created a huge deficit. And how are some of our  Republicans friends saying we pay for the deficit? Cut Medicare. Cut  Social Security. Cut healthcare. That is not what the American people  want.    Poll after poll shows healthcare is far more important to the  American people than tax cuts. Do you know why? If you get a break on  your taxes of $20 a week and your premiums go up several thousand  dollars in a month or even several hundred dollars in a month, that  little increase is wiped away. Our Republican colleagues, even in their  tax bill, caused premiums to go up by monkeying around with healthcare.   The Republican Party needs to wake up and realize that by giving  massive benefits to corporations and the wealthy, it is never going to  be a popular issue for them in the election because it is a terrible  policy for the average middle-class and working Americans. It gets to  the contradiction at the core of the Presidency. The President talks  like a populous but governs like a plutocrat. Let me repeat that. The  President talks like a populous but governs like a plutocrat. He just  got rid of a Wall Street executive--Gary Cohn--and now he is putting in  as his economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who has favored the wealthy, Club  for Growth policies--help the wealthy and all of America will benefit-- throughout his whole career. That is not how Trump ran. That is not  what he tells working people when he goes to a big tent in  Pennsylvania. But that is what he is doing. Sooner or later, it catches  up with you. The Pennsylvania election showed it is catching up faster  than our Republican friends would like. The President talks like a  populous but governs like a plutocrat.   President Trump said that his tax bill would be a middle-class  miracle, but the actual legislation is a miracle for the wealthy  corporations and the richest 1 percent. As I said, part of the problem  is that the President surrounds himself with the wealthy elite. Those  are his advisers. These wealthy elites push for tax cuts for the rich  and rhapsodize failed economic orthodoxies like trickle-down. That  applies to Larry Kudlow. Here is a man who is a cheerleader for Bush- era economics. He ignored the housing bubble and actually recommended-- Larry Kudlow, the man who is now going to give the President economic  advice--that Americans buy stock in the fall of 2008 when everyone else  saw that the economy was about to collapse. Does anyone think Larry  Kudlow is going to bring a renewed focus on improving the middle class?  Forget it. He believes in the plutocracy. He has his whole career. That  is who President Trump picked. He is getting rid of one and putting in  another, like going from the frying pan into the fire.   By the way, I think the President loves having the big crowds of  working-class people in those tents, but who are his real friends? They  are the very wealthy. That is who he hung out with in New York. He  cares what they think, and that is why his policies are so aimed at  them.   My Republican friends, in a nutshell, this is the problem you face.  Your rhetoric is all about helping working people, but your policies  and the people developing them are all about helping corporations and  the rich.   I am not against the rich or corporations. God bless them. Let's hope  they do well. But average Americans need far more help than the top 1  percent and wealthy corporations. Give it to average folks. They need  it. They are still struggling with paying for college, affording a  vacation, helping their elderly mom and dad through a healthcare  problem. They are who need the help, not the top 1 percent. But our  Republican colleagues aim everything at that top 1 percent.   If we would only get rid of Citizens United, that awful decision that  allows the wealthy to have such huge influence on the Republican Party,  the super PACs--individual Members have super PACs funded by the  wealthy. I wish we could get rid of it on both sides, Democratic and  Republican. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Supreme Court is  doing it.   The rhetoric of Republicans: Help working people. The policies of  Republicans: Help the wealthy corporations and the rich. As we have  seen in poll after poll and in recent elections, the American people  are waking up to that reality.   It is hard to make a tax cut unpopular, but Republicans have managed  to do it by designing a bill that will direct 83 percent of the  benefits to the top 1 percent and $1.5 trillion to the deficit and then  threaten to cut Medicare and Social Security to make up the difference.  My colleagues, that is a toxic combination, and Republicans will not be  able to run on it because only a very few wealthy Americans support  that agenda.                                    Russia    Mr. President, now on a different matter--Russia. A little more than  a week ago, our friends in the United Kingdom--England, Great Britain-- suffered an attack on two individuals by a nerve agent. In a joint  statement today, the leadership of the United States, the UK, France,  and Germany agreed that Putin was behind it. To her great credit, Prime  Minister May demanded an immediate response from Putin and promised  appropriate countermeasures. She has already expelled 23 Russian  diplomats, and I hope she takes additional action. Expelling 23  diplomats is strong action, but we need more.   Mr. Putin--he is a bully. I grew up in Brooklyn. There are a lot of  bullies around Brooklyn. You have to stand up to them, or they will  keep taking advantage of you. That is how a bully works.   Let's compare Prime Minister May's action to President Trump's. It is  a study in contrast when it comes to Russia. Prime Minister May was  quick and decisive about countering Russia's aggression. President  Trump can hardly seem to utter a peep in criticism of President Putin-- a man who is trying to undermine the power of the United States, a man  who is trying to undermine the very democracy of the United States, the  beauty of America. It was on full display this week when, instead of  personally defending our ally Britain, President Trump didn't say a  word about the attack, directing everything through aides or  statements.   President Trump warns all the time that ``we need to get smart''  about other countries taking advantage of the United States. I agree. I  tend to agree with the President on China. China is taking advantage of  us, and President Trump, to his credit, is doing more than the Bush or  Obama administrations did. But guess who is taking advantage of us even  more than China. Russia. They meddle in our elections, continue to sow  division on social media through Russia-linked bots or building an  intelligence machine to meddle in our elections again later this year.  Putin constantly attacks our allies, our friends.  [[Page S1744]]    President Trump, when are you going to get smart about the threat  Russia poses to the United States and our allies?   We in Congress, 98 to 2, the Democrats and Republicans together-- Leader McConnell and I worked this out. We voted to implement mandatory  sanctions against Russia. Guess what, America. President Trump hasn't  even implemented them. What is he afraid of? What is he hiding?   Hopefully, we will get an announcement today that maybe he is  implementing sanctions after what Russia did, but that is not enough.  As my friend from New Jersey has suggested, the President should  further sanction Putin and anyone else involved under the Biological  Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act for this heinous attack in  the UK.   We are still waiting for President Trump to direct our intelligence  agencies and the State Department to use the resources we have provided  them to combat Russian cyber attacks. We have heard from officials who  are in charge of cyber security. They have gotten no direction from the  White House, no orders to do anything. We are still waiting for actions  to harden our election security, and we are still waiting for President  Trump to utter one word of public criticism for what Putin is doing to  the United States and democracies around the world.   I say to President Trump: Your silence speaks on this issue. Your  silence speaks volumes to the Russian Government and America's other  adversaries, as well as our friends and allies. Finally, it speaks  volumes to the American people. More and more Americans are asking: Why  is President Trump so afraid to take on probably our No. 1 menace,  Russia? What is he hiding? What is going on? Why?   It is ringing in America's ear. The President is not going to escape  it.   I yield the floor.
