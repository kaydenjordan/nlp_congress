 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I had two  special visitors, Seth and Bronson.   Seth and Bronson participated in the career shadow day with Tuesday's  Children.   Tuesday's Children formed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks  on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. They meet individuals and families of  servicemembers where they are on their grief journey following a loss  due to military service, mass violence, or acts of terrorism.   This is the fifth year Seth has joined me and the first year Bronson  has joined me. Tuesday's Children uses its experience and expertise to  help our military families work through their own losses.   Mr. Speaker, I hope Seth and Bronson enjoyed being my shadow. I sure  enjoyed their visit. I can't wait to see all that they accomplish.                            ____________________
