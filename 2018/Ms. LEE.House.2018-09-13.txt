 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 17th year since Congress  passed the 2001 AUMF, which has become a blank check for endless war. I  would like to read part of the speech I delivered on September 14,  2001, because these words remain true and relevant today.   I said: ``Mr. Speaker, I rise really with a very heavy heart, one  that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were  killed and injured this week.   ``September 11 changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet  I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of  international terrorism against the United States.   ``This resolution will pass, although we all know that the President  can wage a war, even without it. However difficult this vote may be,  some of us must urge the use of restraint. Some of us must say, let us  step back for a moment. Let us just pause for a minute and think  through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not  spiral out of control.   ``I have agonized over this vote, but I came to grips with it today.  I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful,  yet very beautiful memorial service. As a member of the clergy so  eloquently said, as we act, let us not become the evil that we  deplore.''   Now, 17 years later, I am asking my colleagues to join me in  repealing this overly-broad resolution by cosponsoring H.R. 1229.                            ____________________
