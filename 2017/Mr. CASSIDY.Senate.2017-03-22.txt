 Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to support H.J.  Res. 83 and companion S.J. Res. 27, a resolution I introduced with 25  of my colleagues, under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to stop  the Obama administration Department of Labor's regulation, known as the  Volks rule, from expanding the statute of limitations for record- keeping violations. This regulatory scheme represents a backwards  approach to workplace safety, and it is a blatant overreach by the  Federal Government.   Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers are required  to record injuries and illnesses that occur in the work place and  maintain those records for 5 years. The law provides for a 6-month  period for which OSHA can issue citations to employers who fail to  maintain the records properly. However, it was the practice of OSHA,  based on their interpretation of the law, that they were able to issue  citations regarding keeping those records properly for the entire 5- year period employers must keep those records.    Under this practice, OSHA took action against Volks Constructors, a  firm in Prairieville, LA, in 2006 for recordkeeping violations that  occurred nearly 5 years earlier--again, recordkeeping violations. This  was well beyond the 6-month statute of limitations. Volks Constructors,  located in Prairieville, is a heavy industrial contractor that provides  manufacturing  [[Page S1901]]  services and industrial specialties to the petrochemical and related  industries. It has been in business for more than 40 years. Volks  challenged OSHA in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals for those citations  and won. The Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous, three-judge  opinion rebuking OSHA's attempt to file citations past the statute of  limitations. One of the three judges was President Obama's Supreme  Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.   The Volks ruling has since been upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals. Let me read a few of the comments from the court's opinion:  ``We do not believe Congress expressly established a statute of  limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.''   Another comment: ``The Act clearly renders the citations untimely,  and the Secretary's argument to the contrary relies on an  interpretation that is neither natural nor consistent with our  precedents.''   From Judge Garland's concurring opinion: ``[B]ecause none of the  challenged citations were issued within 6 months, `flowing the  occurrence of any violation,' I agree with my colleagues that the  petition for review should be granted and the citation vacated.''   After the court was clear in its ruling, OSHA, in order to negate  such ruling and continue issuing citations beyond the 6-month statute  of limitations, promulgated this regulation, the Volks rule.   This joint resolution must invalidate the Volks rule. The Volks rule  is a clear violation of the court's ruling and is in direct  contradiction of the 6-month statute of limitations. Only Congress can  amend a Federal statute. Article I of the U.S. Constitution is clear.  Members of the legislative branch write the law, not the Federal  departments and agencies.   Overturning the Volks rule will not--will not--decrease workplace  safety. The rule only changes the window during which OSHA can issue  citations for recordkeeping violations. This rule is about paperwork  violations and not workers' health or safety.   The Volks rule also creates regulatory confusion for small  businesses. By finalizing this unlawful regulation, the Obama  administration created uncertainty for employers facing a confusing  maze of recordkeeping standards and unwarranted litigation.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Association of General Contractors,  the National Home Builders Association, the National Restaurant  Association, the National Retail Association, along with more than 70  State and national organizations, all support this joint resolution.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Coalition  for Workplace Safety's letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 Coalition For Workplace Safety,                                                     March 10, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Cornyn,      Majority Whip, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Lamar Alexander,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and           Pensions, Washington, DC.      Hon. Johnny Isakson,      Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace           Safety, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and           Pensions, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn,       Chairmen Alexander and Isakson: The undersigned groups       strongly urge you to pass H.J. Res. 83/S.J. Res. 27, a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) joint resolution of       disapproval to invalidate the Obama Administration's OSHA       regulation overturning the decision in Volks regarding the       statute of limitations for recordkeeping violations.        At its core, the Volks Rule is an extreme abuse of       authority by a federal agency that will subject millions of       American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,       while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety.       Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend       to five years the explicit six month statute of limitations       on recordkeeping violations in the Occupational Safety and       Health (OSH) Act of 1970. This regulation simultaneously       represents one of the most egregious end runs around       Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to       the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from       exceeding its authority to interpret the law.        In 2012, citing the unambiguous language in the OSH Act,       the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held       that OSHA could not sustain citations against an employer for       alleged recordkeeping violations that occurred more than six       months before the issuance of the citation because, as the       employer asserted, they were outside the six month statute of       limitations set forth in the OSH Act. The court was       unequivocal in its rebuke of OSHA. Judge Janice Rogers Brown       expressed particular concern on the issue of the agency's       overstepping its authority: ``we were rightly troubled by the       notion of being asked by an agency to expand that agency's       enforcement authority when Congress had evidently not seen       fit to do so.'' Judge Merrick Garland, in his concurrence,       plainly rejected OSHA's rationale for issuing the fines,       ``the Secretary's contention--that the regulations that Volks       was cited for violating support a 'continuing violation'       theory--is not reasonable.'' The Volks decision has since       been endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision,       issued in December 2016, where the court found ``its       reasoning persuasive.''        In response to the Court of Appeals ruling, OSHA       promulgated this regulation specifically to negate the Volks       case ruling and extend liability for paperwork violations       beyond the six month window permitted under the Act. OSHA       issued the final rule in the waning days of President Obama's       Administration with an effective date of January 19, 2017.       The Senate has until April 7 to pass H.J. Res. 83/S.J. Res.       27.        We urge you to help put a stop to OSHA's abuse of its       authority and support swift passage of a joint resolution of       disapproval for this burdensome, unlawful rule. Because the       final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language       and two U.S. Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be       allowed to stand.        Thank you for your consideration of this request and for       your continued efforts to rein in agency overreach and reduce       the regulatory burden on America's job creators.

I ask unanimous consent that quorum calls during the consideration of  H.J. Res. 83 be equally divided in the usual form.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:50 p.m.  the remaining time on H.J. Res. 83 be yielded back and the joint  resolution be read a third time and the Senate vote on the resolution  with no interviewing action or debate.
