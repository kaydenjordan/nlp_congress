 Madam Speaker, John Lewis was many things. He was a  father. He was a Congressman. As you know, he was a civil rights  pioneer who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. He was a husband. He  was a son of the South, one who walked in the wind to bring equality to  America and is now walking in the heavens with his Creator. He was a  colleague.   John was all these extraordinary things, and he was also my friend.  We are a better Nation and a better people because of him. This  institution, of all of our country, will miss him dearly.   I always struggle to explain back home just what an extraordinary  person he was. To know John was a blessing. To get to work with him on  so many important issues on the Ways and Means Committee, including the  first reform to the IRS in over two decades, making important  improvements to Medicare for our seniors and those who need our help  the most, that was an honor of a lifetime.   I served with him on the Ways and Means Committee for many years. He  was a warm, needed, inspirational presence in that storied committee  room. When I look down the dais, I will be sad to miss my friend. But I  will always be proud to have had the privilege of working with such a  remarkable spirit.   Each day he walked in these halls, we all witnessed firsthand his  remarkable integrity, his intelligence toward the complex policy issues  we debate, and his willingness to work across the aisle if it means  Americans will have greater dignity, opportunity, and equal rights.   God loved this remarkable servant, and I know John is walking hand- in-hand with God and his beloved Lillian today.   I miss you, John. Cathy and I will continue to pray for you and all  those who call you family. May you rest in peace and rise in glory. God  bless you.
