 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 635, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1699) to amend the Truth in Lending Act to modify the  definitions of a mortgage originator and a high-cost mortgage, to amend  the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 to  modify the definition of a loan originator, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Financial Services.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1699, the  Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. It is an important bill  that is cosponsored by a bipartisan--I repeat, bipartisan--group of  members, and it was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a  strong bipartisan vote of 42-18.   In fact, this proposal has a long track record of bipartisan support  with a similar bill having passed the last Congress with votes from  both Republicans and Democrats.   I want to thank my colleague, Representative Barr, the chairman of  our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee for his leadership in  introducing this legislation and for leading congressional efforts to  help Americans, particularly those of lower and moderate incomes, to  help them achieve a greater level of financial independence and being  able to achieve their American Dream of homeownership.   Here is the problem, Mr. Speaker. Under the CFPB's regulations, many  small-balance manufactured home loans are now being considered ``high  cost.'' This means that many people, particularly those with lower and  moderate incomes who want to buy a manufactured home, aren't able to  buy that home.   Their access to credit is being unfairly restricted through no fault  of their own. Lenders are leaving the market. Five County Credit Union  in  [[Page H9574]]  Maine, Zia Credit Union in New Mexico, Manhattan Bank in Montana, and  the list goes on and on and on. Lenders are leaving the market.   As we know, many consumers who live in rural areas, including those  in the Fifth District of Texas who I have the pleasure and honor of  representing, they just don't have access to rental options or other  affordable housing. So the CFPB rules are unfairly penalizing rural  residents and working families, many of whom happen to be retirees,  single moms, working families, veterans, and they simply want to buy a  manufactured home that they can live in. They are being denied that  opportunity.   So here in Washington, inside the very elite beltway bubble, there is  simply not an appreciation for manufactured housing and the role that  plays in our vital affordable housing component.   But let's listen to what the American people tell us outside of the  beltway. A 75-year-old retiree from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said  he purchased a manufactured home because ``it was affordable, and it  was in a desirable location.''   A 57-year-old single mom from Albuquerque, New Mexico, purchased a  manufactured home. She said: ``It provided the best value for the  money. There were no other housing options available. I searched for  over a year to find affordable housing. All of the site-built homes in  the area were over $100,000, which was out of my price range.''  Manufactured housing is within the price range of many working  Americans.   A 28-year-old single mom of two from Jenera, Ohio, she had been  renting. She wanted her own home. And when she purchased it, she said,  she ``found this, allowed us to own a home for less than we would have  to pay to rent another.''   Stories like this are commonplace all over America, Mr. Speaker. And  it is why it is so important that we recognize the rights of our fellow  citizens to give them the opportunity of affordable housing. You can't  protect consumers by protecting them out of their homes. Manufactured  housing is affordable housing.   So we have a regulation from an agency that is supposed to be  protecting consumers, but, instead, it is preventing families from  purchasing affordable housing. We must change that.   We have to pass this bipartisan bill, H.R. 1699. With just a few  minor clarifications to the definition of mortgage originator, loan  originator, and high-cost mortgage, this bill will ensure that  consumers of small-balance mortgage loans have access to the mortgage  credit they need. These minor technical clarifications will help  preserve consumer choice and financing options for those seeking to buy  a manufactured home.   Now, some on the other side of the aisle will say: Well, this  eviscerates important consumer protections. Well, number one, loans  under this bill will still be covered by the Truth in Lending Act, the  Fair Housing Act, the ability to repay rules, Equal Credit Opportunity  Act, and all of the consumer protection laws passed by the various  States.   So let's support working Americans. Let's support affordable housing.  Let's support Mr. Barr's H.R. 1699.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1699 which would undermine  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and  eliminate consumer protections for some of the country's most  vulnerable borrowers.   Mr. Speaker, the title of this bill paints it as a measure that  purports to preserve access to manufactured housing. So I want to be  very clear about what this bill is and what it is not about, and who  will win and who will be harmed if this bill is signed into law.   This isn't about regulatory burdens, reducing access to credit. The  lending volume in the manufactured housing industry has gotten back to  where it was before the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put new  regulations in place.    This isn't about credit unions and community banks not being able to  enter the manufactured housing market. Many credit unions already  underwrite mortgage loans and chattel loans for manufactured housing.  But what H.R. 1699 is about is one-stop-shop megainstitutions like  Clayton Homes, owned by billionaire Warren Buffett, which has almost  half of the market share for manufactured housing lending.   His manufactured housing empire profits in every imaginable way in  this sector from producing housing, to selling housing, to originating  the loans that take advantage of vulnerable customers and leave them  with virtually no way to refinance.   This bill makes it easier for financial titans like billionaire  Warren Buffett to earn even more profits at the expense of some of the  most vulnerable consumers in this country.   I show this ad because they would have you believe that Clayton Homes  is separate from all of the other entities that they have under Clayton  Homes. One would think that, simply, Clayton Homes is the seller of  these mortgages. But they are under different names. They are under  Vanderbilt. They are under HomeFirst. They are under Benjamin Moore,  and they are under Oakwood Homes.   So sometimes people think perhaps, if they are not getting the kind  of service that they want when they are looking for a mortgage, that  they will go to some other place other than Clayton. But they end up  literally going to other entities owned by Clayton Homes.   This is a Warren Buffett bill. This is a Clayton bill. And to tell  you the truth, this institution is not in the business of originating  legislation for one particular business. This is what this is all  about. And I will show you how they do it.   They have different names on their operations, but the ads all look  the same. ``We will beat the match. We will beat the match.'' Same ads  for Tru Value and the other entities owned by them, but they all belong  to Warren Buffett and Clayton.   This bill, again, would harm manufactured housing consumers who are  typically more vulnerable than the average homeowner. They are low- income buyers, rural buyers, minority buyers. And reports from the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Manufactured Housing  Institute, and the Center for Public Integrity have all shown us that  this measure would not create access to affordable housing; but it  would, instead, allow an incredibly profitable industry to make even  more money at the expense of low-income and rural homeowners, even if  the industry itself asserts that it has been growing and highly  profitable, even in the years after Dodd-Frank, and the Consumer  Bureau's mortgage protections have been in place.   So just take a look at this. If you take a look back what was  happening in 2003, where they had 18 percent share in the market, now  they have 39 percent. This is all Clayton, 39 percent. And their  portfolio includes about $12.5 billion in customers.   So I would like to just reiterate again that this is about Warren  Buffett and this is about Clayton. Let me just share with you that  Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett has also been touting its  post-Dodd-Frank Act profitability of manufactured housing.   Clayton Homes is Berkshire's highly profitable manufactured housing  subsidy, and it earned a total of $744 million in 2016, a 33 percent  increase over 2014. Yes, that is a 33 percent increase after the Dodd- Frank Act rules were in place. Unfortunately, this is the same Clayton  Homes that was the subject of a multipart Seattle Times and Center for  Public Integrity joint investigation.   Mr. Speaker, The Seattle Times did a scathing series on Clayton. I  include in the Record these articles that were done by The Seattle  Times. Everyone should avail themselves of this damaging information.                          [From the Seattle Times]    The Mobile-Home Trap: How a Warren Buffett Empire Preys on the Poor                     (By Mike Baker and Daniel Wagner)                              First of a series         Ephrata, Grant County.--After years of living in a 1963       travel trailer, Kirk and Patricia Ackley found a permanent       house with enough space to host grandkids and care for her       aging father suffering from dementia.  [[Page H9575]]         So, as the pilot cars prepared to guide the factory-built       home up from Oregon in May 2006, the Ackleys were elated to       finalize paperwork waiting for them at their loan broker's       kitchen table.        But the closing documents he set before them held a       surprise: The promised 7 percent interest rate was now 12.5       percent, with monthly payments of $1,100, up from $700.        The terms were too extreme for the Ackleys. But they'd       already spent $11,000, at the dealer's urging, for a concrete       foundation to accommodate this specific home. They could look       for other financing but desperately needed a space to care       for her father.        Kirk's construction job and Patricia's Wal-Mart job       together weren't enough to afford the new monthly payment.       But, they said, the broker was willing to inflate their       income in order to qualify them for the loan.        ``You just need to remember,'' they recalled him saying,       ``you can refinance as soon as you can.''        To their regret, the Ackleys signed.        The disastrous deal ruined their finances and nearly their       marriage. But until informed recently by a reporter, they       didn't realize that the homebuilder (Golden West), the dealer       (Oakwood Homes) and the lender (21st Mortgage) were all part       of a single company: Clayton Homes, the nation's biggest       homebuilder, which is controlled by its second-richest man--      Warren Buffett.        Buffett's mobile-home empire promises low-income Americans       the dream of homeownership. But Clayton relies on predatory       sales practices, exorbitant fees, and interest rates that can       exceed 15 percent, trapping many buyers in loans they can't       afford and in homes that are almost impossible to sell or       refinance, an investigation by The Seattle Times and Center       for Public Integrity has found.        Berkshire Hathaway, the investment conglomerate Buffett       leads, bought Clayton in 2003 and spent billions building it       into the mobile-home industry's biggest manufacturer and       lender. Today, Clayton is a many-headed hydra with companies       operating under at least 18 names, constructing nearly half       of the industry's new homes and selling them through its own       retailers. It finances more mobile-home purchases than any       other lender by a factor of six. It also sells property       insurance on them and repossesses them when borrowers fail to       pay.        Berkshire extracts value at every stage of the process.       Clayton even builds the homes with materials--such as paint       and carpeting--supplied by other Berkshire subsidiaries.                            Clayton always profits         More than a dozen Clayton customers described a consistent       array of deceptive practices that locked them into ruinous       deals: loan terms that changed abruptly after they paid       deposits or prepared land for their new homes; surprise fees       tacked on to loans; and pressure to take on excessive       payments based on false promises that they could later       refinance.        Former dealers said the company encouraged them to steer       buyers to finance with Clayton's own high-interest lenders.        Under federal guidelines, most Clayton mobile-home loans       are considered ``higher-priced.'' Those loans averaged 7       percentage points higher than the typical home loan in 2013,       according to a Times/CPI analysis of federal data, compared       to just 3.8 percentage points for other lenders.        Buyers told of Clayton collection agents urging them to cut       back on food and medical care or seek handouts in order to       make house payments. And when homes got hauled off to be       resold, some consumers already had paid so much in fees and       interest that the company still came out ahead. Even through       the Great Recession and housing crisis, Clayton was       profitable every year, generating $558 million in pre-tax       earnings in 2014.        The company's tactics contrast with Buffett's public       profile as a financial sage who values responsible lending       and helping poor Americans keep their homes.        Berkshire Hathaway spokeswoman Carrie Sova and Clayton       spokeswoman Audrey Saunders ignored more than a dozen       requests by phone, email and in person to discuss Clayton's       policies and treatment of consumers. In an emailed statement,       Saunders said Clayton helps customers find homes within their       budgets and has a ``purpose of opening doors to a better       life, one home at a time.''        (Update: After publication, Berkshire Hathaway's Omaha       headquarters sent a statement on behalf of Clayton Homes to       the Omaha World-Herald, which is also owned by Berkshire.)                                First, a dream         As Buffett tells it, his purchase of Clayton Homes came       from an ``unlikely source'': Visiting students from the       University of Tennessee gave him a copy of founder Jim       Clayton's self-published memoir, ``First a Dream,'' in early       2003. Buffett enjoyed reading the book and admired Jim       Clayton's record, he has said, and soon called CEO Kevin       Clayton, offering to buy the company.        ``A few phone calls later, we had a deal,'' Buffett said at       his 2003 shareholders meeting, according to notes taken at       the meeting by hedge-fund manager Whitney Tilson.        The tale of serendipitous dealmaking paints Buffett and the       Claytons as sharing down-to-earth values, antipathy for Wall       Street and an old-fashioned belief in treating people fairly.       But, in fact, the man who brought the students to Omaha said       Clayton's book wasn't the genesis of the deal.        ``The Claytons really initiated this contact,'' said Al       Auxier, the Tennessee professor, since retired, who       chaperoned the student trip after fostering a relationship       with the billionaire.        CEO Kevin Clayton, the founder's son, reached out to       Buffett through Auxier, the professor said in a recent       interview, and asked whether Buffett might explore ``a       business relationship'' with Clayton Homes.        At the time, mobile-home loans had been defaulting at       alarming rates, and investors had grown wary of them. Kevin       Clayton was seeking a new source of cash to relend to       homebuyers. He knew that Berkshire Hathaway, with its perfect       bond rating, could provide it as cheaply as anyone. Later       that year, Berkshire Hathaway paid $1.7 billion in cash to       buy Clayton Homes.        Berkshire Hathaway quickly bought up failed competitors'       stores, factories and billions in troubled loans, building       Clayton Homes into the industry's dominant force. In 2013,       Clayton provided 39 percent of new mobile-home loans,       according to a Times/CPI analysis of federal data that 7,000       home lenders are required to submit. The next biggest lender       was Wells Fargo, with just 6 percent of the loans.        Clayton provided more than half of new mobile-home loans in       eight states. In Texas, the number exceeds 70 percent.       Clayton has more than 90 percent of the market in Odessa, one       of the most expensive places in the country to finance a       mobile home.        To maintain its down-to-earth image, Clayton has hired the       stars of the reality-TV show ``Duck Dynasty'' to appear in       ads.        The company's headquarters is a hulking structure of metal       sheeting surrounded by acres of parking lots and a beach       volleyball court for employees, located a few miles south of       Knoxville, Tenn. Next to the front door, there is a slot for       borrowers to deposit payments.        Near the headquarters, two Clayton sales lots sit three       miles from each other. Clayton Homes' banners promise ``$0       CASH DOWN.'' TruValue Homes, also owned by Clayton,       advertises ``REPOS FOR SALE.'' Other nearby Clayton lots       operate as Luv Homes and Oakwood Homes. With all the       different names, many customers believe that they're shopping       around.        House-sized banners at dealerships reinforce that       impression, proclaiming they will ``BEAT ANY DEAL.'' In some       parts of the country, buyers would have to drive many miles       past several Clayton-owned lots, to reach a true competitor.                           Guided into costly loans         Soon after Buffett bought Clayton Homes, he declared a new       dawn for the moribund mobile-home industry, which provides       housing for some 20 million Americans. Lenders should require       ``significant down payments and shorter-term loans,'' Buffett       wrote.        He called 30-year loans on mobile homes ``a mistake,''       according to notes Tilson took during Berkshire Hathaway's       2003 shareholders meeting.        ``Home purchases should involve an honest-to-God down       payment of at least 10% and monthly payments that can be       comfortably handled by the borrower's income,'' Buffett later       wrote. ``That income should be carefully verified.''        But in examining more than 100 Clayton home sales through       interviews and reviews of loan documents from 41 states,       reporters found that the company's loans routinely violated       the lending standards laid out by Buffett.        Clayton dealers often sold homes with no cash down payment.       Numerous borrowers said they were persuaded to take on       outsized payments by dealers promising that they could later       refinance. And the average loan term actually increased from       21 years in 2007 to more than 23 years in 2009, the last time       Berkshire disclosed that detail.        Clayton's loan to Dorothy Mansfield, a disabled Army       veteran who lost her previous North Carolina home to a       tornado in 2011, includes key features that Buffett       condemned.        Mansfield had a lousy credit score of 474, court records       show. Although she had seasonal and part-time jobs, her       monthly income often consisted of less than $700 in       disability benefits. She had no money for a down payment when       she visited Clayton Homes in Fayetteville, N.C.        Vanderbilt, one of Clayton's lenders, approved her for a       $60,000, 20-year loan to buy a Clayton home at 10.13 percent       annual interest. She secured the loan with two parcels of       land that her family already owned free and clear.        The dealer didn't request any documents to verify       Mansfield's income or employment, records show.        Mansfield's monthly payment of $673 consumed almost all of       her guaranteed income. Within 18 months, she was behind on       payments and Clayton was trying to foreclose on the home and       land.        Many borrowers interviewed for this investigation described       being steered by Clayton dealers into Clayton financing       without realizing the companies were one and the same.       Sometimes, buyers said, the dealer described the financing as       the best deal available. Other times, the Clayton dealer said       it was the only financing option.        Kevin Carroll, former owner of a Clayton-affiliated       dealership in Indiana, said in an interview that he used       business loans from a Clayton lender to finance inventory for       his lot. If he also guided homebuyers to work  [[Page H9576]]       with the same lender, 21st Mortgage, the company would give       him a discount on his business loans--a ``kickback,'' in his       words.        Doug Farley, who was a general manager at several Clayton-      owned dealerships, also used the term ``kickback'' to       describe the profit-share he received on Clayton loans until       around 2008. After that, the company changed its incentives       to instead provide ``kickbacks'' on sales of Clayton's       insurance to borrowers, he said.        Ed Atherton, a former lot manager in Arkansas, said his       regional supervisor was pressuring lot managers to put at       least 80 percent of buyers into Clayton financing. Atherton       left the company in 2013.        During the most recent four-year period, 93 percent of       Clayton's mobile-home loans had such costly terms that they       required extra disclosure under federal rules. Among all       other mobile-home lenders, fewer than half of their loans met       that threshold.        Customers said in interviews that dealers misled them to       take on unaffordable loans, with tactics including last-      minute changes to loan terms and unexplained fees that       inflate loan balances. Such loans are, by definition,       predatory.        ``They're going to assume the client is unsophisticated,       and they're right,'' said Felix Harris, a housing counselor       with the nonprofit Knoxville Area Urban League.        Some borrowers felt trapped because they put up a deposit       before the dealer explained the loan terms or, like the       Ackleys, felt compelled to swallow bait-and-switch deals       because they had spent thousands to prepare their land.                                Promise denied         A couple of years after moving into their new mobile home,       Kirk Ackley was injured in a backhoe rollover. Unable to       work, he and his wife urgently needed to refinance the costly       21st Mortgage loan they regretted signing.        They pleaded with the lender several times for the better       terms that they originally were promised, but were denied,       they said. The Ackleys tried to explain the options to a 21st       supervisor: If they refinanced to lower payments, they could       stay in the home and 21st would get years of steady returns.       Otherwise, the company would have to come out to their rural       property, pull the house from its foundation and haul it       away, possibly damaging it during the repossession.        They both recall being baffled by his reply: ``We don't       care. We'll come take a chainsaw to it--cut it up and haul it       out in boxes.''        Nine Clayton consumers interviewed for this story said they       were promised a chance to refinance. In reality, Clayton       almost never refinances loans and accounts for well under 1       percent of mobile-home refinancings reported in government       data from 2010 to 2013. It made more than one-third of the       purchase loans during that period.        Of Washington's 25 largest mobile-home lenders, Clayton's       subsidiaries ranked No. 1 and No. 2 for the highest interest       rates in 2013. Together, they ranked eighth in loans       originated.        ``If you have a decrease in income and can't afford the       mortgage, at least a lot of the big companies will do       modifications,'' said Harris, the Knoxville housing       counselor. ``Vanderbilt won't even entertain that.''        In general, owners have difficulty refinancing or selling       their mobile homes because few lenders offer such loans. One       big reason: Homes are overpriced or depreciate so quickly       that they generally are worth less than what the borrower       owes, even after years of monthly payments.        Ellie Carosa, of Napavine, Lewis County, found this out the       hard way in 2010 after she put down some $40,000 from an       inheritance to buy a used home from Clayton priced at about       $65,000.        Clayton sales reps steered Carosa, who is 67 years old and       disabled, to finance the unpaid amount through Vanderbilt at       9 percent interest over 20 years.        One year later, Carosa was already having problems--peeling       paint and failing carpets--so she decided to have a market       expert assess the value of her home. She hoped to eventually       sell the house so the money could help her granddaughter,       whom she adopted as her daughter at age 8, attend a local       college to study music.        Carosa was stunned to learn that the home was worth only       $35,000, far less than her original down payment.        "I've lost everything," Carosa said.                     `Rudest, most condescending' agents         Berkshire's borrowers who fall behind on their payments       face harassing, potentially illegal phone calls from a       company rarely willing to offer relief.        Carol Carroll, a nurse living near Bug Tussle, Ala., began       looking for a new home in 2003 after her husband had died,       leaving her with a 6-year-old daughter. Instead of a down       payment, she said, the salesman assured her she could simply       put up two acres of her family land as collateral.        In December 2005, Carroll was permanently disabled in a       catastrophic car accident in which two people were killed.       Knowing it would take a few months for her disability       benefits to be approved, Carroll said, she called Vanderbilt       and asked for a temporary reprieve. The company's answer: "We       don't do that."        However, Clayton ratcheted up her property-insurance       premiums, eventually costing her $803 more per year than when       she started, she said. Carroll was one of several Clayton       borrowers who felt trapped in the company's insurance, often       because they were told they had no other options. Some had as       many as five years' worth of expensive premiums included       in their loans, inflating the total balance to be repaid       with interest. Others said they were misled into signing       up even though they already had other insurance.        Carroll has since sold belongings, borrowed money from       relatives and cut back on groceries to make payments. When       she was late, she spoke frequently to Clayton's phone agents,       whom she described as ``the rudest, most condescending people       I have ever dealt with.'' It's a characterization echoed by       almost every borrower interviewed for this story.        Consumers say the company's response to pleas for help is       an invasive interrogation about their family budgets,       including how much they spend on food, toiletries and       utilities.        Denise Pitts, of Knoxville, Tenn., said Vanderbilt       collectors have called her multiple times a day, with one       suggesting that she cancel her Internet service, even though       she home-schools her son. They have called her relatives and       neighbors, a tactic other borrowers reported.        After Pitts' husband, Kirk, was diagnosed with aggressive       cancer, she said, a Vanderbilt agent told her she should make       the house payment her ``first priority'' and let medical       bills go unpaid. She said the company has threatened to seize       her property immediately, even though the legal process to do       so would take at least several months.        Practices like contacting neighbors, calling repeatedly and       making false threats can violate consumer-protection laws in       Washington, Tennessee and other states.        Last year, frequent complaints about Clayton's aggressive       collection practices led Tennessee state officials to contact       local housing counselors seeking information about their       experiences with the company, according to two people with       knowledge of the conversations.                           treated like car owners         Mobile-home buyers who own their land sites may be able to       finance their home purchases with real-estate mortgages,       which give them more federal and state consumer protections       than the other major financing option, a personal-property       loan. With conventional home mortgages, companies must wait       120 days before starting foreclosure. In some states, the       foreclosure process can take more than a year, giving       consumers a chance to save their homes.        Despite these protections, two-thirds of mobile-home buyers       who own their land end up in personal-property loans,       according to a federal study. These loans may close more       quickly and have fewer upfront costs, but their rates are       generally much higher. And if borrowers fall behind on       payments, their homes can be seized with little or no       warning.        Those buyers are more vulnerable because they end up being       treated like car owners instead of homeowners, said Bruce       Neas, an attorney who has worked for years on foreclosure and       manufactured-housing issues in Washington state.        Tiffany Galler was a single mother living in Crestview,       Fla., in 2005 when she bought a mobile home for $37,195 with       a loan from 21st Mortgage. She later rented out the home.        After making payments over eight years totaling more than       the sticker price of the home, Galler lost her tenant in       November 2013 and fell behind on her payments. She arranged       to show the home to a prospective renter two months later.       But when she arrived at her homesite, Galler found barren       dirt with PVC pipe sticking up from the ground.        She called 911, thinking someone had stolen her home.        Hours later, Galler tracked her repossessed house to a       sales lot 30 miles away that was affiliated with 21st. It was       listed for $25,900.                           Clayton wins concessions         The government has known for years about concerns that       mobile-home buyers are treated unfairly. Little has been       done.        Fifteen years ago, Congress directed the Department of       Housing and Urban Development to examine issues such as loan       terms and regulations in order to find ways to make mobile       homes affordable. That's still on HUD's to-do list.        The industry, however, has protected its interests       vigorously. Clayton Homes is represented in Washington, D.C.,       by the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI), a trade group       that has a Clayton executive as its vice chairman and another       as its secretary. CEO Kevin Clayton has represented MHI       before Congress.        MHI spent $4.5 million since 2003 lobbying the federal       government. Those efforts have helped the company escape much       scrutiny, as has Buffett's persona as a man of the people,       analysts say.        ``There is a Teflon aspect to Warren Buffett,'' said James       McRitchie, who runs a widely read blog, Corporate Governance.        Still, after the housing crisis, lawmakers tightened       protections for mortgage borrowers with a sweeping overhaul       known as the Dodd-Frank Act, creating regulatory headaches       for the mobile-home industry. Kevin Clayton complained to       lawmakers in 2011 that the new rules would lump in some of       his company's loans with ``subprime, predatory'' mortgages,       making it harder for mobile-home buyers ``to obtain       affordable financing.''        Although the rules had yet to take effect that year, 99       percent of Clayton's mobile-  [[Page H9577]]       home loans were so expensive that they met the federal       government's ``higher-priced'' threshold.        Dodd-Frank also tasked federal financial regulators with       creating appraisal requirements for risky loans. Appraisals       are common for conventional home sales, protecting both the       lender and the consumer from a bad deal.        Clayton's own data suggest that its mobile homes may be       overpriced from the start, according to comments it filed       with federal regulators. When Vanderbilt was required to       obtain appraisals before finalizing a loan, company officials       wrote, the home was determined to be worth less than the       sales price about 3o percent of the time.        But when federal agencies jointly proposed appraisal rules       in September 2012, industry objections led them to exempt       loans secured solely by a manufactured home.        Then Clayton pushed for more concessions, arguing that       manufactured-home loans tied to land should also be exempt.       Paul Nichols, then-president of Clayton's Vanderbilt       Mortgage, told regulators that the appraisal requirement       would be costly and onerous, significantly reducing ``the       availability of affordable housing in the United States.''        In 2013, regulators conceded. They will not require a       complete appraisal for new manufactured homes.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the investigation found  that Clayton locked one disabled veteran in Tennessee, Ms. Dorothy  Mansfield, into an expensive loan even though the required monthly  payment would leave her with only $27 a month to cover the rest of her  living costs.   Worst, it was a no-documentation loan, meaning that no one even  bothered to verify Dorothy's income. The investigation also found that  Clayton Homes' in-house lender, Vanderbilt Mortgage, charged minority  borrowers substantially higher rates, on average, than their White  counterparts.   Unfortunately, this appears not to have been an isolated incident as  Federal data reveals that Vanderbilt Mortgage typically has charged  African-American borrowers who make more than $75,000 a year more than  White people who make only $35,000 a year.   Other Clayton Homes borrowers were quoted inexpensive loan terms only  to see interest and fees rocket once they had put down a nonrefundable  deposit or paid out large amounts of money to prepare their land for  installation of the manufactured home.                                time  0930    Just like subprime mortgage loan borrowers who were preyed on before  the financial crisis, many consumers who purchased manufactured housing  were convinced to take out high-cost loans based on false promises that  they would be able to refinance to lower rates in the future.   Former Clayton Homes salespeople have confirmed that they have  pressured customers to use Clayton-affiliated financing even if it  wasn't the best deal, and some even received kickbacks for putting  customers into more expensive loans.   Under this bill, some of our most important consumer protection laws  that prevent this kind of steering, like the Truth in Lending Act, the  Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, and the Home  Ownership and Equity Protection Act, would no longer apply to  manufactured housing retailers and salespeople that offer credit to  borrowers, even if those salespeople do the same things traditional  loan originators do, like referring customers to a creditor or  assisting them in applying for credit.   So, if enacted, H.R. 1699 would allow abusive lenders to charge over  14 percent interest before consumer protections are triggered--more  than four times what the average borrower is paying on a home loan.   In the coming years, this number could very well grow to 16, 17, and  likely 18 percent as interest rates rise back to normal. Even worse,  the bill also makes it legal for Clayton Homes sales personnel to steer  borrowers toward high-cost loans, loans from other parts of the Clayton  conglomerate that are not in their best interests, a practice that  Congress banned for all loan originators after the financial crisis.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to manufactured housing, consumers are  already exposed to significant risks, high interest rates, the  inability to refinance and, in many cases, depreciation that starts as  soon as the manufactured home is sold. Nevertheless, the House is  considering a bill that rolls back key protections for these already  financially vulnerable consumers.   It would do away with a number of protections current law attaches to  many high-cost loans, such as stiffer penalties for bad-acting lenders,  additional disclosures for investors and consumers who purchase high- cost mortgages, mandatory counseling so that borrowers know what they  are getting into, and even the ability for borrowers to have their loan  rescinded if lenders don't follow the law. It would do away with all of  this.   As the Consumer Bureau noted in its study of the manufactured housing  industry, individuals who apply for manufactured housing loans  ``include customers that may be considered more financially vulnerable  and thus may particularly stand to benefit from strong consumer  protections.''   Now, in addition to the Consumer Bureau's report, investigative  reporting has provided names and stories of individuals who have fallen  victim to the market practices and policies described by the Consumer  Bureau.   Finally, when a nearly identical measure was considered by the House  last term as H.R. 650, the Obama administration issued a veto threat  and said they ``strongly oppose'' the bill because it would ``put low- income and economically vulnerable consumers at significant risk of  being subjected to predatory lending and being steered into more  expensive loans even when they qualify for lower cost alternatives.''   This bill rolls back consumer protections amidst evidence that the  manufactured housing industry needs more oversight and is, at its  heart, a dangerous giveaway to a sector that already profits handsomely  at the expense of vulnerable borrowers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rip-off bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before the morning is over, I hope to  have some additional time to yield to the ranking member so she can  continue her diatribe against President Obama's favorite billionaire  and Democrat financier, Warren Buffett.   Until then, Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the sponsor of the legislation and the  chairman of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee.  [[Page H9582]]         Mr. Speaker, regrettably, I don't have enough time  for the ranking member. On this side of the aisle, we are fully  subscribed. I have lots of Members who wish to speak in favor of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), yet another distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a member of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 2\1/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, what we have heard this morning, unfortunately, is an  assault on affordable housing from too many people on the other side of  the aisle. We have Washington elites who are deciding that low-income  people are too stupid to make decisions for themselves. We have too  many people on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, who want to  take them out of their affordable homes--manufactured homes--and are  saying: No, go rent, go find someplace on the street.   Here is the reality: when Washington elites at the Orwellian named  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided to make these manufactured  housing loans ``high cost,'' we saw a 22 percent drop in these type of  loans being made. But what we know is that this is vital for so many  working Americans.   I heard from one consumer in Windsor, New York:         I was falling behind on my own site-built mortgage       payments. I was drowning in debt. I needed a cheaper housing       alternative that would meet the needs of my family. The       manufactured home payment cut my overall housing expense by       57 percent.    Mr. Speaker, that is just one example. I have story after story from  consumers who this is their only option for affordable housing. But too  many of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: No, no, we can't  allow you to do that. You might pay a little higher interest rate.   Well, here is a news flash, Mr. Speaker: their monthly payment is  lower and they get to own their own home.   Washington elites have tried price controls before. They have been  tried since the dawn of man, and it always leads to shortages.   We don't want to shortchange working Americans for affordable  housing. We want to protect the vulnerable in society and we want to  allow them to have affordable housing. That is why it is so important  that today we pass H.R. 1699. Protect affordable housing, protect  freedom, and let's vote this in today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is a vaguely worded and unneeded  MTR.   We continue to hear from our friends from the other side of the aisle  that we don't have sufficient consumer protections in place, but I  wonder how denying a low-income family access to credit to buy an  affordable home is somehow construed as consumer protection. I wonder  how denying a low-income family the ability to own a home at a lower  cost with a lower monthly payment somehow can be construed as consumer  protection. I wonder how a policy that has led to a 22 percent drop in  the availability of manufactured housing credit can somehow be  construed as consumer protection.   Only in Washington could you have such an absurd result, but I have  good news for all Members of the House. After the passage of H.R. 1699,  guess what. Manufactured housing loans will still be subject to the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act. They will still be subject to the Fair  Housing Act. They will still be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting  Act. They will still be subject to the Truth in Lending Act. They will  still be subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. They will still  be subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. And the list,  Mr. Speaker, goes on and on and on.   What we have heard is an attempt again by Washington elites to take  away affordable housing. No one who votes against H.R. 1699 ought to be  able to look themselves in the mirror and claim they are an advocate  for affordable housing, not when they take it away, not when we have  seen a 22 percent decrease after the actions of the elites at the so- called Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It shouldn't be done.   It is time to reject this motion to recommit. It is time to stand for  low- and moderate-income Americans. It is time to stand for affordable  housing. It is time for us to vote for H.R. 1699.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on:   Passage of the bill, if ordered; and   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
