 Mr. Speaker, I raise bison. I know bull  when I see it, and I know manure when I see it. Less than 10 percent of  this so-called stimulus package actually focuses on the pandemic.   In this bill, House Democrats said no to my proposal to target aid to  States with high child poverty rates to lift our children up. Instead,  they said yes to $1,400 checks that could go to people who entered our  country illegally. They said yes to hundreds of millions for absurd pet  projects, like Silicon Valley subway systems, the Seaway International  Bridge, and $350 billion in blue State bailouts.   Let's cut the bull. The $1.9 trillion payout doesn't crush COVID, nor  does it create jobs. Our grandchildren should not be saddled with the  cost of this bag of bailouts.
