 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support S. 96, the Improving Rural Call  Quality and Reliability Act. It is a bipartisan bill championed by  Representative David Young and cosponsored by a number of other  Members, including Representatives Welch and Loebsack from the Energy  and Commerce Committee.   We deal with a lot of technologically complicated issues on the  Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, but this bill aims to  address the most essential function of our telephone system: making  sure that all Americans' calls go through.   Many people take for granted our modern communications tools. But in  rural America, even the basic function of connecting a call is  sometimes next to impossible.   Consumers tell us often when they call rural areas, they are met with  false busy signals or calls not even arriving, just silence.   This isn't just an important problem for rural Americans, but also  for people in all of our districts who want to reach loved ones across  the country and can't.   This status quo is unacceptable. We need reliable telephone service  to keep us connected. It is too important for everyday life,  particularly in the wake of the terrible natural disasters that swept  through our country earlier this year.   It is clearer than ever that basic phone service is critical when  responding to emergencies and critical for everything from finding a  job to managing your health.   We know that problems with call completion are often related to  intermediate providers--the middlemen hired to route calls. This bill  requires intermediate providers to register with the FCC and comply  with service quality standards. These commonsense steps should make it  easier to figure out when providers are cutting corners or not doing  their jobs.   Ultimately, the bill puts consumers first by helping them make sure  that we can stay connected to one another.   S. 96 is a bipartisan bill that passed on suspension earlier this  Congress and last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support it  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is a good  piece of legislation, and I hope all Members will vote for it when it  comes to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1230     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.  [[Page H993]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 582, a  bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote.   I agree that we must do all we can to make sure that consumers using  multiline telephone systems can directly dial 911 without having to  dial additional digits first. These are the large enterprise phone  systems that we use in big office buildings and hotels. Many of these  phones require consumers to dial an extra 9 to get an outside line.  Most of us know that, but too many people do not realize that you also  have to dial 9 before dialing 911 on these phones, and if you don't  dial the 9 first, you can't reach emergency services.   As you can imagine, in desperate situations, being able to quickly  reach first responders can mean the difference between life and death.   This very issue led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari  Dunn was killed while her 9-year-old daughter tried to call for help.  Kari's daughter did what she thought she was supposed to do in an  emergency, dial 911. But because the system she was using required her  to dial that additional 9 first, she only heard silence on the other  end.   Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn's family, we are one  step closer to fixing this problem once and for all.   H.R. 582 is an important step toward making our systems work better  in an emergency. But for all the good this bill does, it still leaves  work to be done. Specifically, these multiline systems still often fail  to deliver accurate location information to first responders. That  means that if someone calls 911 from this very building that we are  sitting in, for instance, precious minutes could tick by as emergency  personnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in this  enormous complex.   That delay could be the difference between life and death. We must  act to correct this problem, too, because making sure the call goes  through is only helpful if public safety officials can find the caller.   Democrats tried to include such a provision in the version of this  bill from last Congress, and at that time we received a commitment from  Chairman Walden to work together on a separate bill to address this  concern. We were not able to solve this problem last Congress, and we  expect the commitment will carry over to this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it  gives me great pleasure to yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from the California (Ms. Eshoo), a valuable member of our  Energy and Commerce Committee.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. I will close for our side now,  Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first congratulate Representative Gohmert and  Senator Klobuchar for this piece of legislation.   I hope that our friends on the Republican side will work with us to  improve the location accuracy for these multiline systems. I think that  is an important piece of unfinished business that we need to do to make  this bill even better. We support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
