 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my  remarks, I was listening to our Republican leader talking about  compromise--not that he ever engaged in very much of it when he was  leader last year--but compromise requires something to compromise over.  We have nothing from the administration, nothing on infrastructure,  nothing on trade, nothing even on ACA.   You want to sit down and talk? Let's see what your plans are. See if  you can get your own act together before you are pointing the finger at  Democrats.   The President's speech--let me say this: This President's speech was  detached from this President's reality. The President, in this speech  and in so many others, talks like a populist. He talks to the working  people of America and promises them things. When he governs, it is  nothing like that at all. He is favoring the very powerful special  interests, making their lives easier, and putting more burdens on the  backs of the middle class and people trying to get to the middle class.   A metaphor for this was his speech at the inauguration. He gave a  speech--also aimed at the working people--and within an hour after  that, he signed an Executive order that helped the banks and added  about $500 to the mortgage of every new homeowner.   You can't just talk the talk, Mr. President. You have to walk the  walk. On issue after issue, we haven't seen anything--or negative  things for the working class.   We heard about infrastructure. A month ago, the Democrats put  together an infrastructure plan of $1 trillion. It was a strong plan.  It has a lot of support throughout the country.   Where is the President's infrastructure plan? We haven't heard a peep  about it. Some of his White House folks leaked that we will not get to  infrastructure until next year. Mentioning it in a speech-- infrastructure--is not going to employ a single new worker.   What about trade? The President talked about trade, putting America  first. My views tend to be closer to President Trump's than they were  to President Bush's or President Obama's on trade. Again, what we hear  in the speech and what the President actually does are contradictory.   Throughout his campaign, the President took an issue near and dear to  my heart and to the heart of Senator Graham of South Carolina--China  manipulating its currency. He had said over and over again in the  campaign: On the first day I am President, I will sign an Executive  order that labels China a currency manipulator.   They are. We know they manipulate their currency, and it has cost  America hundreds of thousands, if not millions of good-paying jobs and  caused a load of wealth to flow from our country to theirs.   This one didn't require congressional approval. This one didn't  require a single Democrat to join in. All the President had to do was  sign the order. We are now 40 days into this administration. Not only  has he still not signed the order, but he is saying he may back off.   Last night, the President talked about research, wiping out rare  diseases. Yet with the budget they proposed, given that they want to  slash domestic discretionary spending by tens of billions of dollars  and exempt veterans and Homeland Security, there is no alternative to  the fact that the President in his budget, at the same time he is  talking about medical research, is going to slash it.   Education. He talked about the great issue of education. The same  thing: His budget is going to slash education to smithereens, hurting  our students, hurting our teachers, hurting our schools.   Perhaps the most hypocritical of all was draining the swamp. That was  one of the President's main themes when he was President-elect: Drain  the swamp. Look who is in his Cabinet. His Secretary of Treasury, his  Secretary of Commerce, and his NEC adviser are from Wall Street.   Is this the same man who said that we are going to go after Wall  Street if we get elected? Wall Street is running the economic show. The  Cabinet is filled with bankers. The Cabinet is filled with  billionaires, not people who feel for the average American. In fact, if  you add up the net wealth of his Cabinet, it has more wealth than one- third of the American people total--close to 100 million people. That  is cleaning the swamp? Give me a break.   The problem with the President's speech is very simple: His actions  don't match his words. His words in the campaign are not matched by his  actions. His words in his inaugural speech are not matched by his  actions, nor are his words in his speech last night.   It was so funny that he spoke to a bunch of cosmopolitan news  anchors, and he mentioned that maybe he will change his views on  immigration. The media got into a buzz about that. Then, the speech he  gave was one of the most virulently anti-immigrant speeches that we  have heard any President ever give. He is saying one thing, doing  another.   It is not the hypocrisy that bugs us, although it is there. It is the  fact that he is not helping middle-class America. It is the fact that  he is not making it easier for more people to travel and get into the  middle class because he seems to have governed from the hard, hard  right. The hard right is very far away from where the average American  is.   Mr. Mulvaney's idea of a budget--maybe 10 percent of America, mostly  ideologues, would support it. It is even far away from where the  average Republican is. Yesterday, when the President proposed his  budget, we had one of my colleagues on the Republican side saying it is  dead on arrival. We had the majority leader saying that you can't cut  the State Department foreign aid in half. He is far over, and that is  hurting him and hurting us, hurting the American people.   The first 40 days have been a pretty rough 40 days for President  Trump. It hasn't worked out very well. Why? It is not because he hasn't  given a few good speeches. It is because he is governing from the hard  right. He is governing far away from what the American people want. He  is governing way off to the extreme.   A speech isn't going to change that. A speech isn't going to create  one job or one infrastructure plan or one trade law that makes our  trade laws, which need to be changed, fairer. No, no, it takes action.  Unfortunately, when the President takes action, it is quite the  opposite of what he says in the speech on the issues that affect the  middle-class and working-class people.   If President Trump does not change how he governs--how he governs,  not what speeches he gives--in the near future, then these 40 days,  which have been of tumult, of contradiction, of turning one's back on  the working class, will be 6 months and then will be a year and then  will be 2 years.   The problem with the Presidency does not lie in the speeches the  President gives, even though I might object  [[Page S1511]]  to a lot of the things he puts in them. It lies in how he governs, and  he is not governing well. He is not governing down the middle. He is  not governing in a way that lends itself to compromise. We Democrats  will continue to hold the President accountable. That is our job. That  is what the Constitution says we should do, and we will continue until  we see the President change his course in governing. No speech is going  to change that or affect that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one other issue is our nominee today, Mr.  Zinke. I want to spend a minute on him. He is the nominee for Secretary  of Interior. One of the most important issues handled by the Interior  Department is the stewardship of our national parks. These are some of  the great national resources of our country.   When my children were younger, my wife and I would take them to  national parks, and we would go hiking. We loved it. We so looked  forward to going out West. I remember the reward at the end of a big  hike was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I probably wanted it even  more than my kids did. I loved peanut butter and jelly.   From Niagara Falls to the Erie Canalway, to places like Seneca Falls,  Stonewall, and Ellis Island, my dear State of New York is home to some  of our country's most famous national parks and monuments. They are  places I have visited and treasured my whole life. I have been  concerned in recent years about the reluctance on the other side of the  aisle to properly care for these great national beauties, these great  national resources. Currently, there is a $12 billion maintenance  backlog for our national parks. Our Republican majority has not seen  fit to address them.   Now, adding insult to injury, the new administration's hiring freeze  across Federal agencies has already affected parks like the Women's  Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, which I have visited  many times. It has had to cancel tours due to insufficient funding.   Most troubling, our Republican colleagues want to make it easier to  sell off or give away public lands and expand the footprint of the oil  and gas industries on public lands--as usual, helping those narrow  special interests, hurting the average American. That seems to be the  trademark of this administration, which our friends on the other side  of the aisle are happily going along with.   That is the context in which I approach Congressman Zinke's  nomination. He claims to be a conservationist in the spirit of Teddy  Roosevelt, a great New Yorker. He has demonstrated support for rules,  however, that would make it easier to sell off public lands. It is the  opposite of what Teddy Roosevelt wanted.   Congressman Zinke claims to be a conservationist, but he said he  would revisit actions taken by the last administration to use the  Antiquities Act to permanently protect endangered places of cultural,  tribal significance. He claims to be a Roosevelt conservationist but  pledged his support for the Trump administration's energy agenda--once  again, centered on efforts to expand drilling and mining on Federal  lands and waters. A few big oil companies would be made happy, but  America would lose a great resource that is an economic resource as  well as a beautiful natural resource.   I would say to Mr. Zinke: You can't be a Roosevelt conservationist  when you vote to make it easier to sell off public lands. You can't be  a Roosevelt conservationist when you support opening up public lands to  increased extraction and drilling. You are not much of a  conservationist when you downplay the authority of the legislation that  allows the President to create national monuments.   In sum, Congressman Zinke says he is a dyed-in-the-wool  conservationist but doesn't have the record to back it up. That should  concern every outdoor enthusiast, every lover of our great and grand  national parks.   Unfortunately, because of his record, I will vote no on Mr. Zinke's  nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
