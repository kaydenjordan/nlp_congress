 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  budget resolution and its intent to compromise the health insurance of  all Americans.   Republicans continue to pursue the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,  root and branch, despite the fact that there is no credible plan to  deal with the chaos that this repeal will create.   Thirty million Americans will lose their insurance, the vast majority  being working families. There is no plan to protect the other Americans  who have enjoyed improved consumer protections and benefits.   Although the rates have gone up, they have gone up at half the rate  that they had been going up before ObamaCare, and most of those in the  marketplace don't even have to pay those increased prices because of  increased tax credits.                                time  1245    When Republicans talk about repeal and replace, the only thing  guaranteed is the repeal part. Republicans have shown little interest  in producing an alternative. We have heard lots of complaints, but we  have not seen a plan that will make things any better.   Remember, when Medicare was created, most of the Republicans in  Congress voted ``no.'' Republicans in the House have voted numerous  times, over 60 times, to repeal some or all of the Affordable Care Act  without proposing a credible alternative, and now we have some vague  ideas but no plan to deal with the total chaos that will be created if  ObamaCare is repealed.   I urge my colleagues to save the health and economic security of all  Americans by defeating this resolution.
