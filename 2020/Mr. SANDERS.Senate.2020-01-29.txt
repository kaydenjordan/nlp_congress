 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Sanders asks the House managers:         Republican lawyers have stated--on several occasions--that       two people, Senator Johnson and Ambassador Sondland, were       told directly by President Trump that there was no quid pro       quo in terms of holding back Ukraine aid in exchange for an       investigation into the Bidens. Given the media has documented       President Trump's thousands of lies while in office--more       than 16,200 as of January 20--why should we be expected to       believe that anything President Trump says has credibility?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Well, I am not quite sure where to begin with  that question except to say that if every defendant in a trial could be  exonerated just by denying the crime, there would be no trial. It  doesn't work that way.   I think it is telling that when Ambassador Sondland spoke with  President Trump, the first words out of his mouth, according to  Sondland, were ``no quid pro quo.'' That is the kind of thing you blurt  out when you have been caught in the act and say: It was not me. I  didn't do it.   Even then, the President couldn't help himself because the other half  of that conversation was ``no quid pro  [[Page S678]]  quo'' but that Zelensky needs to go to the mic, and what is more, he  should want to--no quid pro quo but quid pro quo.   This reminds me of something that came up earlier. Why would the  President--when he is on the call of July 25 and knows that there are  other people listening, why on Earth would the President engage in this  kind of shakedown with others being within earshot? You know, I think  this question comes up in almost every criminal trial. Why would the  defendant do that?   Sometimes it is very hard to fathom, and sometimes it is just that  people make mistakes. In this case, I think the President truly  believes that he is above the law. He truly believes that he is above  the law. It doesn't matter who is listening. It doesn't matter who is  listening. If it is good for him--I guess this is a version of  Dershowitz' argument--if it is good for him, it is good for the state  because he is the state. If it helps his reelection, it is good for  America, and whatever means he needs to effectuate his election,  whether it is withholding military aid or what have you, as long as it  helps him get elected, well, it is good for America because he is the  state. This is why I think he is so irate when people come forward and  blow the whistle, not just the whistleblower but people like John  Bolton or General Kelly.   You might ask the question: Why do so many people who leave this  administration walk away from this President with such conviction that  he is undermining our security that you cannot believe what he says?  Think about this: The President's now former Chief of Staff, General  Kelly, doesn't believe the President of the United States; he believes  John Bolton.   I mean, can everybody be disgruntled? Can it all be a matter of bias?  I think we know the answer. I think we know the answer. I mean, how do  you believe a President to whom the Washington Post has documented so  many false statements? The short answer is, you can't.   I remember, early in his Presidency, many of us talked about how once  as President, you lose your credibility, and once as President, your  country or your friends or allies around the world cannot rely on your  word and just how disruptive and dangerous it is to the country. So we  can't accept the denial. It is a false denial.   Indeed, if you look at the Wall Street Journal article that Senator  Johnson was interviewed in, when he had that conversation with Sondland  and had that sinking feeling because he didn't want those two things  tied together, everyone understood they were tied together. It was as  simple as two plus two equals four.   So can you rely on a false exculpatory? You can't with this President  any more than you can with any other accused and probably, given the  President's track record, a lot less than other accused. But at the end  of the day, we have people with firsthand knowledge who don't have to  rely on his false exculpatory. You don't have to rely on Mick  Mulvaney's recanting what you all saw so graphically on TV. How does  somebody say, without a doubt, this was a factor, that this is why he  did it?   By the way, Alan Dershowitz lost a criminal case in which he argued  that if a corrupt motive is only part of the motive, you can't convict.  And the court said: Oh, yes, you can. If a corrupt motive is any part  of it, you can convict. So he has lost that argument before, and he  makes this argument again before this court. It shouldn't be any more  availing here than it was there.   At the end of the day, though, there is no more interested party here  than the President of the United States, and I think we have seen he  will say whatever he believes suits his interest. Let's instead rely on  the evidence and rely on others, and one is just a subpoena away.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Colorado.
