 Mr. Speaker, for 46 days, the Government of Azerbaijan  [[Page H347]]  has forcibly cut off 120,000 ethnic Armenians in the Republic of  Artsakh. They are cut off from the outside world. Food has become  scarce. They have to ration even basic items. Diapers and medicine  supplies have become so low that Facebook pages are opening where  residents are trying to find these items from their neighbors.  Residents are separated from their families on the other side of the  border in Armenia, including children who have been attending school or  visiting families.   Azerbaijan has even gone so far as to cut off natural gas during the  depth of winter. A humanitarian crisis is brewing, and we should act to  prevent it.   Let's be clear about what this attempt is. It is an attempt by  Azerbaijan to force Artsakh's ethnic Armenian population out of their  homes by making life in Artsakh impossible. The tactic is blockade. The  effect is civilian deprivation. The object is ethnic cleansing.   But don't take my word for it. Listen to Azerbaijani dictator Aliyev  who made his intentions clear when this blockade unfolded by saying,  ``Whoever does not want to become our citizen . . . can leave.'' What  does he mean? The ethnic Armenians are citizens. They are citizens of  the Republic of Artsakh, but Aliyev doesn't recognize that citizenship  and instead uses it as an excuse to say that he wants to ethnically  cleanse these 120,000 people.   I am glad that Secretary Blinken earlier this week called on  President Aliyev to end this blockade, but we know that dictators don't  often respond to calls for justice. I urge the administration to put  real weight behind these calls by making clear that there will be  consequences to Azerbaijan by plunging the people of Artsakh into this  humanitarian disaster, including sanctions if necessary.   The administration should enforce section 907 to stop all military  assistance to Azerbaijan and to provide critical humanitarian aid to  the people of Artsakh, actions that are long overdue.   Ever since I came to Congress almost 27 years ago, I have introduced  and fought for a resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide, the  first genocide of the 20th century. Back then it was not uncommon for  Members of this body to minimize or even deny the systematic  ethnic cleansing and murder of 1\1/2\ million Armenians, Greeks, or  Syrians and others by the Ottoman Empire, but Armenian Americans and  their allies did not give up. For decades, they spoke truth to power  and turned the political tide until the Armenian genocide was  recognized by this House and then by President Biden. It may have taken  longer, but we got there.    This is a painful moment for the Armenian community. I am confident  that the Armenian people will rise in strength. Armenians have outlived  those who said there was no Armenian genocide, and they will outlive  those who say there is no Artsakh.   I urge the Biden administration and all Members of this body to take  a forceful stance against Azerbaijan's shameful attempts at ethnic  cleansing of the Armenian population of Artsakh through this deadly  blockade.                              Debt Limit Crisis     Mr. Speaker, we have already hit the debt limit.  Republicans say they want to negotiate. We negotiate about spending all  the time. What they really mean is that they want additional leverage  by threatening this country with a default on our debt, which would  cost us, according to Moody's Analytics, 6 million jobs, a 9 percent  unemployment rate, $15 trillion lost in our investment markets.   Already they are dillydallying with this debt limit. Their playing  Russian roulette with our economy has already hurt our economy. As the  chief Democrat on the Capital Markets Subcommittee, I am here to tell  you that the cost of capital is higher and projects are not going  forward because of the actions they have taken so far.   They want to negotiate? They want to negotiate going backward. They  want to negotiate reducing Social Security benefits. They want spending  cuts, but they won't specify what they want. If we are going to  negotiate, let's negotiate going forward. Let's talk about increases in  Social Security benefits, let's negotiate getting rid of the $2  trillion of unjustified Trump tax cuts that went chiefly to  corporations and the wealthy.   You want to negotiate? Fine, we will negotiate going forward, but  ultimately we will end up with a clean debt limit. You can't just love  your country when your guy is in the White House. You can't play  Russian roulette just because you don't like the President and you  think that President will take the political hit. We need to show the  world that our governance in America is sound and that our economy is  worthy of investment.                            ____________________
