 Mr. Speaker, my heart continues to go out to the loved  ones of those who lost their lives, as Congresswoman Miller mentioned,  in the tragic pile-up on I-55 last week.   I am also so appreciative of the first responders from across our  region who were on the scene quickly for rescue efforts. They  demonstrated incredible bravery in this response, and so I admire the  important work that they do, as I do each and every day.   Thank you for your service to our communities and thank you to my  colleagues joining with us today to remember the victims.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
