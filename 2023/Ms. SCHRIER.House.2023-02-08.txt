 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chair, our healthcare workforce is stretched to capacity after  having spent now 3 years on the front lines of the pandemic, and add to  that recent spikes in RSV and flu.   Our hospitals have been overpacked, with a shortage of available beds  and a real worry and sometimes a reality that there won't be room in a  hospital if we get sick or injured.   Due to stress and burnout, hospitals across the country are  experiencing staff shortages. What healthcare workers and hospital  workers really don't need right now is more stress on an already  stressed system, and that is exactly what this bill will do.   As we all know, and as I can tell you, as a pediatrician, people who  are not vaccinated have a significantly higher risk of being  hospitalized if they contract COVID. Why in the world would we invite  people from around the world to come to visit the United States without  that protection and then put our hospital systems at further risk of  overcrowding and collapse? Not to mention the higher risk of getting  and spreading the disease around our country or even potentially  bringing new variants to our shores.   Vaccination is safe. I speak as a doctor. It is effective in keeping  people out of hospitals and curbing transmission. We should rightly  expect that those traveling to the United States get immunized because  we should not risk further stressing an already strained healthcare  system.   It was only a few months ago when hospitals in my State, in  Washington State, were full. Patients with life-threatening illnesses,  bleeds, life-threatening injuries had to be flown to distant cities to  get care. Whatever we can do to prevent that from happening again, we  should do. Making sure we get vaccinated and insisting that those  visiting our country get vaccinated help do just that.   Public health decisions should be made by doctors and public health  professionals based on data, not by Members of Congress for political  expediency.   This bill is a political stunt. It has no basis in science. It fails  to recognize the reality that our hospitals are facing right now and  that any one of us might face if a loved one needs a hospital bed and  that bed is not available. Please leave public health decisions to  public health professionals.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.         Ms. Schrier moves to recommit the bill H.R. 185 to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith, with the following       amendment:        Add at the end the following new section:       SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The provisions of this Act shall not take effect until the       date on which the Secretary of Health and Human Services       submits to Congress a certification that such provisions will       not result in--        (1) a decrease in hospital bed capacity in the United       States;        (2) a reduction in health care resources available in the       United States; or        (3) any staffing shortage for health care providers in the       United States.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
