 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of Hanover High School in Washington County, KS. I want to  offer my congratulations to the students, staff, and coaches of the  Wildcats football, volleyball, boys basketball, and boys track team for  winning the Kansas 1A DII High School State Championships during the  2020-2021 academic school year.   After the challenges of the pandemic, the ability of these student  athletes to succeed in the classroom and on the field is admirable.  Continuing education and supporting student athletes is a top priority  in Kansas, and these students exemplify how resilient our children are  and the importance of being a part of a team. Achievements such as  these do not happen overnight; they take the support of families,  friends, teachers, coaches, faculty, staff, and volunteers. It takes a  community, and Hanover should be proud.   The Hanover Wildcats started the year coming out strong when the  volleyball team won the State title for the first time since 1979 in  straight sets against Attica High. The eight-man football team  championship game against St. Francis, leading 46-24, ended a perfect  11-0 season. The boys basketball team went on to win Hanover's seventh  State championship with a 24-1 record, while the boys' track team  rounded out the year coming back against the odds to clinch the first  place spot in the final relay at the State track meet, leaving with a  lead of eight points.   These young men and women have set an example for all of us,  demonstrating that success in life comes to  [[Page S7416]]  those who are willing to set goals and work hard to achieve them. Not  only did they perform with exceptional mental and physical fortitude,  but they also displayed remarkable sportsmanship while prioritizing  work in the classroom and studying hard. This impressive display of  prudence after a challenging school year demonstrates the grit of  Hanover students in the face of difficulties.   I once again extend my congratulations to these student athletes, as  well as Principal Matthew Mattos, Athletic Director Scott Hutchison,  and trainer Paige Radomski.   I wish each of these young men and women continued success in the  classroom and in their athletic pursuits.                            ____________________
