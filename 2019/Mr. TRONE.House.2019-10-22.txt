 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember my great friend  and hero, Elijah Cummings.   The enormity of the loss felt with the passing of Elijah has  reverberated throughout Maryland and this entire country. He was the  voice of the powerless in the Halls of power. He had a giant heart and  acted as the conscience of America when we needed it most.   Baltimore had no greater champion. Elijah and I shared a special  concern for those impacted by the opioid epidemic and the criminal  justice system. I will continue to work on those issues while drawing  on Elijah's legacy for inspiration.   My wife, June, and I extend our condolences to Maya and his three  children, and we take comfort in knowing that our friend and hero is  dancing with the angels.                            ____________________
