 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Shinglehouse American Legion Post 530 in Potter County  on its 100th anniversary.   This Friday, January 13, will be 100 years since its charter was  enacted.   In celebration of this monumental anniversary, Shinglehouse is  hosting a weeklong open house for the public. Events include special  meals, activities for all ages, and lots of prizes.   In the early years of the Shinglehouse American Legion, members  gathered at the drycleaning shop of ``Shorty'' Klinger. As time went on  and membership grew, the post reached its top membership in 1999 when  it had 284 members and 271 social members.   Today, it remains a traditional-style legion, with community  engagement and a focus on projects that support the legions four  pillars: Veterans affairs and rehabilitation, national security,  Americanism, and children and youth.   The post continues to support community projects like Adopt-a- Highway, local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, and the Wounded  Warriors.   Mr. Speaker, the Shinglehouse American Legion Post 530 continues to  serve as a community pillar. From supporting local charities, to  providing a meeting house for veterans of all ages, they remain an  important part of the community.   Congratulations to all Shinglehouse American Legion members on their  centennial anniversary.                            ____________________
