 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 3312.   This bill is really important to Hoosiers back home. Hoosiers back  home aren't checking the financial statements of banks around the  country. What they are checking are their own financial statements.    According to the FDIC, the total balance of commercial and industrial  loans smaller than $1 million has increased by only 0.18 percent since  2018, when the U.S. GDP has grown by 26 percent.   The total balance of nonfarm residential loans has declined by almost  25 percent during the same time period. This is adversely impacting  Hoosiers back home and their ability to get capital and loans to be  able to start businesses.   Frequently, I get the opportunity to stand up here and talk about  one-size-fits-all regulation. But in this particular instance, we are  truly talking about one-size-restricting-all regulation.   Chairman Luetkemeyer uses a very strong approach. Instead of, as the  architects of section 165 in Dodd-Frank, using size as a proxy for  risk, he simply said: Let's use their underlying risk as an indicator  of their actual risk. He does this by using a system already put in  place by the Federal Reserve in actually tracking the variables that  indicate risk of an institution.   I strongly support the measure. I continue to strongly support the  removal of arbitrary lines in regulation.
