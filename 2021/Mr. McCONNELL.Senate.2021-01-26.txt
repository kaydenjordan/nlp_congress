 Mr. President, yesterday, two Democratic Senators  confirmed they will not provide the votes to eliminate the legislative  filibuster. The senior Senator from West Virginia issued a public  ``guarantee'': ``I do not support doing away with the filibuster under  any condition.''   Any chance of changing his mind? ``None whatsoever.''   The senior Senator from Arizona made the same commitment. She opposes  ending the legislative filibuster and ``is not open''--not open--``to  changing her mind.'' Our colleague informed me directly last night that  under no circumstances would she reverse course.   Now, it should not be news that a few Members of the majority pledge  they won't tear up a central rule, but the Democratic leader was  reluctant to repeat the step I took as majority leader in unified  government when I ruled out that step on principle.   Rather than relying on the Democratic leader, I took the discussion  directly to his Members. Basic arithmetic now ensures that there are  not enough votes to break the rule. This victory will let us move  forward with the 50-50 power-sharing agreement containing all the  elements of the 2001 model because it will sit on the very same  foundation.   I want to discuss the precipice from which the Senate has stepped  back. In 2013, Senator Harry Reid began the ``nuclear'' exchange over  nominations. I said Democrats would regret it. A few years later, we  have many Federal judges, including three Supreme Court Justices, who  were confirmed with fewer than 60 votes.   The back-and-forth exchange over nominations had one institutional  silver lining, because, routinely, filibustering nominations was itself  a modern invention pioneered by Senate Democrats in the 2000s. So, on  nominations, for all the fighting, the Senate just simply circled back  to the simple majority threshold that had been our longstanding norm on  nominations; that is, on the Executive Calendar.   Legislation is very different. When it comes to lawmaking, the  Framers' vision and our history are abundantly clear. The Senate exists  to require deliberation and cooperation. James Madison said the  Senate's job was to provide a ``complicated check''--a ``complicated  check,'' he said--against ``improper acts of legislation.'' We ensure  that laws earn enough buy-in to receive the lasting consent of the  governed. We stop bad ideas, improve good ideas, and keep laws from  swinging wildly with every election.   Our friend, Lamar Alexander, put it this way in his farewell speech.  He said: ``The Senate exists to produce broad agreements on  controversial issues that become laws most of us have voted for and  that a diverse country will accept.''   More than any other feature, it is the Senate's 60-vote threshold to  end debate on legislation that achieves this. It ensures narrow  interests cannot ignore the rest of the country. It embodies  Jefferson's maxim that ``great innovations should not be forced on  slender majorities.''   The bar for lawmaking is high. It should be high, even if both bodies  take turns at being slightly frustrated by it. If your legislation  can't pass the Senate, you don't scrap the rules or lower the  standards. You improve your idea, take your case to the people, or  both.   Four years ago, Republicans had just won unified control. President  Trump and others pressured us heavily--me, in particular--to scrap this  rule when it was protecting the Democratic minority. But we stood firm.  I stood firm and endured many tweets on the subject. I said we would  not do that to our colleagues in the minority.   No short-term policy win justifies destroying the Senate as we know  it, especially since laws would become so brittle and reversible. So  Democratic Senators used the 60-vote threshold to shape and block  legislation. They stalled COVID relief, they blocked police reform, and  they stopped even modest measures to protect innocent life because I  chose not to destroy the tool that allowed them to do that.   That same tool that some Democrats now want to destroy, they used  freely and liberally throughout their years in the minority, and I  protected their ability to do that. Republicans understand you don't  destroy the Senate for a fleeting advantage. Our friends across the  aisle must see the same.  [[Page S135]]    I have talked a lot about principle. We should also make this a  little more tangible. So let's take a look at what would happen if in  fact the legislative filibuster were gone. If the Democratic majority  were to attack the filibuster, they would guarantee themselves  immediate chaos, especially in this 50-50 Senate. This body operates  every day and every hour by consent, and destroying the filibuster  would drain comity and consent from this body to a degree that would be  unparalleled in living memory.   So let's look at some examples.   The Constitution requires the Senate to have a quorum to do any  business. Right now, a quorum is 51, and the Vice President does not  count to establish a quorum. The majority cannot even produce a quorum  on their own, and one could be demanded by any Senator at almost any  time.   Our committees need quorums to function as well. They will also be  evenly split. If this majority went scorched-earth, this body would  grind to a halt like we have never seen. Technically, it takes  collegiality and consent for the majority to keep acting as the  majority at any time they do not physically--physically--have the  majority.   In a scorched-earth, post-nuclear Senate that is 50-50 like we have  today, every Senate Democrat and the Vice President could essentially  just block out the next 2 years on their calendar. They would have to  be here all the time.   It takes unanimous consent to schedule most votes, to schedule  speeches, to convene before noon, to schedule many hearings and  markups. As Democrats just spent 4 years reminding us, it takes consent  to confirm even the lowest level nominees at anything beyond a snail's  pace.   None of us has ever seen a Senate where every single thing either  happens in the hardest possible way or not at all. Heck, once or twice  every day the majority leader reads through an entire paragraph of  routine requests. Objections could turn each one into multiple, lengthy  rollcall votes.   None of us on either side wants to live in a scorched-earth Senate.  The institution and the American people deserve a lot better. But there  is no doubt--none--that is what we would see if Democrats tear up this  pivotal rule. It would become immediately and painfully clear to the  Democratic majority that they had indeed just broken the Senate.   This gambit would not speed the Democrats' ambitions. It would delay  them terribly, and it would hamstring the Biden Presidency over a power  grab which the President has spent decades warning against and still  opposes.   Finally, at some point, the shoe would find its way to the other  foot. When Republicans next control the government, we would be able to  repeal every bill that had just been rammed through, and we would set  about defending the unborn, exploring domestic energy, unleashing free  enterprise, defunding sanctuary cities, securing the border, protecting  workers' paychecks from union bosses--you get the picture.   But a few years later, the Democrats would try to flip it all back.  So instead of building stable consensus, we would be chaotically  swapping party platforms, swinging wildly between opposite visions that  would guarantee half the country is miserable and resentful at any  given time. We would have inherited resilient institutions but left  behind a chaotic mess.   We are in a politically charged period, but when factional fever runs  hot, when slender majorities are most tempted to ram through  radicalism, these are the times for which the guardrails exist in the  first place.   Republicans said no--emphatically no--to pushing the Senate over this  precipice. When I could have tried to grab the power, I turned it down.  I said: ``President Trump, no,'' repeatedly, because the Nation needs  us to respect the Framers' design and the Senate's structure, and  because, as I said in a different context on January 6, we have a  higher calling than endless partisan escalation.   We have placed our trust in the institution itself, in a common  desire to do the right thing. I am grateful that has been reciprocated  by at least a pair of our colleagues across the aisle. I am glad that  we have stepped back from this cliff. Taking that plunge would not be  some progressive dream; it would be a nightmare. I guarantee it.                            ____________________
