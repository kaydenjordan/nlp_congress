 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I can't believe what I am hearing from my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle.   Against higher ethics in Congress, they are, what, accepting any kind  of corruption in this institution and what corrupts our democracy? You  are for gerrymandering? You want dark money to continue?   This is absurd. This is about strengthening our democracy. This  should have 435 votes. I am so proud that two of my bills have been  incorporated into H.R. 1; one is that we have a national holiday for  our national elections. People shouldn't have to choose between their  job or their families. They should be able to go and vote.                                time  1315    Presidents and all Presidential candidates should be mandated to put  out 10 years of their tax returns so that the American people can vet  them in their own minds to see if they are worthy of the highest office  in the land.
