 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5110, the Protecting  Hunting Heritage and Education Act, which would correct the Biden  Department of Education's misguided interpretation of Federal law to  now prohibit the use of funding for school-based hunting and archery  programs. The Department's effort is not only facing bipartisan  backlash but also blatantly skirts congressional intent.  [[Page H4474]]    H.R. 5110 is an important step toward ensuring American schools have  the resources and funding necessary to continue teaching students  important safety skills as they engage in these outdoor activities.   Many of my constituents in rural Georgia, including me and many of my  family, are passionate about hunting, and we should be encouraging our  Nation's youth to get outside more, not cutting off funds for programs  that help achieve that goal.   One of my greatest memories is my son going to hunter safety school  and spending time in the woods together. That is the greatest bond, I  believe, between a father and son.   Members on both sides of the aisle believe students should be able to  receive safe, responsible hunting and archery education.   I am proud to stand with the next generation of sportsmen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Protecting Hunting Heritage  and Education Act.    Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 404.   Mr. LaMalfa. Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 404.
