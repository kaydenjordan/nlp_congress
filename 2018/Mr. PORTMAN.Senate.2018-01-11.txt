 Mr. President, I want to assure the Senator from Utah,  who just spoke, who is also the President pro tempore of this entire  body, that he is well regarded on both sides of the aisle. I don't  think any Senator has had a more distinguished or consequential  career--four decades of legislating.   I want to assure the Senator that nobody thinks he is going to slow  down. In fact, as he just said, he has plenty on his agenda for the  next year, and we look forward to working with him during that time  period.   We also wish him well on his retirement. I have talked to him a  little about this. He has a wonderful family, and he has big plans for  the future with some important work he wants to do in public policy  through his foundation.   I have so much respect for Senator Hatch. I thank him so much for  what he did most recently to help guide us through this latest tax  reform and tax cut bill that actually is making a difference for the  people I represent and he represents.

I thank the Senator. I have to get the last word,  though, because this is about the Senator.   Senator Hatch said he loves this place and he loves its Members.  There is a lot of love for him in this place on both sides of the  aisle, and it is well deserved and earned.                                    Russia    Mr. President, I heard Senator Cardin earlier speaking about the  threat that Russia poses not just to us--and the meddling that has been  occurring here in our elections over the years--but also the threat  that they pose to other democracies around the world, particularly in  Eastern Europe. I appreciate his report. I appreciate the fact that he  has worked with a number of us, including Senator Murphy, on the other  side of the aisle, to put forward legislation to try to push back  against this disinformation.   In fact, we have required that the State Department increase their  efforts through what is called the Global Engagement Center. I am  meeting with the Deputy Secretary of State here after this speech, and  I am going to speak more about that with him, but we really want to be  sure that the United States is taking more aggressive action against  the kind of disinformation that can destabilize democracies.   We heard some of the examples of what his report was able to uncover  in terms of some of the Russian activity, particularly, again, in  Europe and in Eastern Europe. This is an issue. It is a foreign policy  issue that we have been, in my view, slow to respond to. It didn't  start with the last Presidential election, and it will not end with  this last Presidential election unless we take a more aggressive stance  and step up.   So I appreciate that it has been a bipartisan effort that we should  acknowledge as Americans that it is in our interests to push back  against the disinformation and the propaganda and the destabilization  of democracies.                                  Tax Reform    Today, Mr. President, I wish to speak about some good news; that is,  that here in Congress we actually did something with the tax relief and  tax reform legislation that is actually creating a better economy and  more hope for people.   There was news announced today, just a few minutes ago, that is in  addition to the news we have heard over the last few weeks. This  historic tax reform was created, we will remember, with two goals in  mind. One was to cut taxes for middle-class families--so individual tax  cuts. The second part of it was to make America a better place to do  business. Let's ensure that there will be more jobs created here rather  than elsewhere. Let's level the playing field so our workers aren't  competing with one hand tied behind their back.   As I have said through the process and as we developed this bill, we  had a bipartisan agreement that our Tax Code was broken, but we  couldn't seem to come up with an agreement of how to fix it. Some  Democrats said: Well, that is great that you guys have done this bill,  but it is not going to help. I said at the time: The proof will be what  happens, what happens to jobs, what happens to wages, what happens to  the economy in general, and what happens to your paycheck.   I am here to announce today that the results have been pretty darn  impressive, and they have been across the board--all of those things I  talked about. We have already seen as a result of this tax legislation  that America has become a better place to do business. All over the  country there are companies and businesses, small and large,  [[Page S158]]  that have stepped forward to talk about that. I now have a list of 150  businesses--and I am sure there are many, many more--that have decided  to do something. Either they announced a pay increase, a bonus, an  increased 401(k) contribution, an increased pension contribution, or  maybe a new investment in equipment and in technology to make workers  more competitive. All of this is specifically because of the tax relief  and reform bill. That is what is happening.   For those who haven't followed it, even today another company,  Walmart--the largest employer in my State--announced that they are  indeed going to increase pay and provide bonuses to over 1 million  workers. Some companies have actually announced a combination of  things, not just a pay increase but maybe a pay increase as well as an  increased contribution to a 401(K) or an increased contribution to a  charity.   So I think we are already seeing the direct effects--the direct and  very positive beneficial effects--of this tax reform legislation, as  many have hoped that we would see, given the fact that we wrote it to  create these incentives for more jobs and better jobs.   But today we are going to begin to see the direct effects of the  other part of the bill; that is, the tax relief directly to  individuals. The IRS just announced about an hour ago that they are  publishing updates to the tax withholding tables for employers. Now,  what does this mean? This means that Uncle Sam is going to take a  little less of your paycheck, and you are going to see it on your  paycheck. So the withholding--the amount that is withheld from your  paycheck with taxes--is going to be changed. The Treasury Department  says that for 90 percent of Americans--90 percent--there will be a  change in withholding that will be positive for them. In other words,  they will have less money coming out of their paycheck.    Most people whom I represent in my home State of Ohio live paycheck  to paycheck. This is really important. We talked earlier about how much  this is going to be: $2,000 a family on average. That is the median  income for a family in Ohio. Whatever the amount is, this is  significant, and it is something that people are going to be pretty  surprised about because so many people have misrepresented what this  legislation is about. They are now seeing that it is about jobs, it is  about wages, it is about bonuses, and so on. But they are also going to  see in their own paycheck that it is about more take-home pay. It is  about having a little healthier family budget.   So, again, as we went through this process, when we would have these  debates I would say: I encourage people to look online, to look at the  professionals, to look at a tax calculator. I said: The proof is in  your paycheck. I think the proof will be in their paychecks--more hard- earned money staying in their pocket rather than going to Washington is  something that my constituents will like, particularly if we see this  economy start to pick up because of this tax reform bill, which, by the  way, will result in a stronger economy.   Therefore, there will be more revenue through growth. So the Federal  Government will have more revenue coming in. Every 1-percent increase  in GDP--a 1-percent increase in growth in this country--means about  $2.7 trillion in increased revenue coming into the Federal coffers. So  that is more revenue coming in, not from a tax increase but from  growth. That is the kind of revenue we want to have to be able to deal  with many issues we face on the fiscal side, including our large  deficits and debt, and that we will also begin to see as we see a  better economy grow and develop because of this tax reform legislation.  That is my strong belief and, again, I think the evidence is pretty  clear that we are headed that way.   I want to commend the IRS for moving so quickly because this is  pretty quick for us to turn it around. We just passed the legislation  at the end of the year. It became effective on January 1. Here we are  on January 11, and we are already seeing them changing the withholding  that is going to go to the employers so that employers will withhold  less from people's paychecks.   I also want to personally commend the Treasury Secretary, Steven  Mnuchin, because I know he has a passion to make sure that our hard- working taxpayers get this tax relief as soon as possible. My sense is  that he is the one who has promoted our moving quickly on this, in a  professional and careful way so that the withholding tables are  accurate but ensuring that we do allow people to begin to have a little  more in their paychecks to be able to help make ends meet. Again, with  most people I represent living paycheck to paycheck this is a big deal.  Steve Mnuchin has been, I think, essential to getting this done as  quickly as it has been done, as he was essential in the tax reform  legislation, along with Gary Cohn of the White House, and others.   So this law is going to help middle-class families in three main  ways.   First, it cuts taxes across the board. As I noted, the IRS  announcement means that about 90 percent of taxpayers will see more  money in their paychecks. They do this in a number of ways in the tax  reform legislation, and I am talking about the reform notice here. It  is Notice 1036. For those who want to go online and look at it, just go  on the IRS website, irs.gov, and you can see it, the new withholding  tables. They lay all of this out. Depending on how much your paycheck  is, whether you are paid weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly, you  see what your benefits are going to be. But it happens because there is  a doubling of the standard deduction, and most people already take the  standard deduction in my State of Ohio. Now more people will take it  because there is a doubling and essentially a zero tax bracket. So it  goes from about $12,000 a family to about $24,000 a family.   It also has a lowering of the rate of tax. So your tax rate is going  to be lower relative to what it was before this.   Also, if you have kids, you get a doubling of the child tax credit,  including part of that being an increase in the refundability of that  if you don't have income tax liability. But if you still have expenses,  if you still have payroll taxes, you get your benefit there.   So these are the kinds of things that, combined, end up with this  notice going out saying: You are going to have a little more in your  paycheck.   Second, the result of these tax cuts is going to take about 3 million  Americans off the tax rolls altogether. I say ``about'' because the  Joint Committee on Taxation doesn't have the final number yet but they  have told me that it is at least 3 million Americans who now pay income  taxes who will no longer have income tax liability. Now, they may have  payroll tax liabilities, and they may have State and local taxes, but  the point is that this was about Federal income reform and relief, and  they are going to be out from under the IRS and again be able to help  make ends meet. That is as a result of this legislation. I said earlier  that about $2,000 per family is the average tax savings for a median  family income in Ohio, $2,000 a year in tax relief is about the  average.   This is important because as expenses have gone up over the last  couple of decades--particularly, healthcare expenses in the last  decade--wages have not. So wages have been relatively flat. In fact, on  average, if you take inflation into account, they have been flat over  the last couple of decades. We are beginning to see some increase in  wages now. This is terrific, but with wages being flat and expenses up,  people have had a real squeeze, and that middle-class squeeze is real  in my home State. So this is extra money that families--many people  living paycheck to paycheck--can use for expenses like healthcare,  maybe make a car payment, save for retirement, or maybe help their  kids.   The second goal of this tax reform, boosting the American economy, is  also beginning to happen, as I said earlier. When the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act became law, immediately we saw a number of companies and  businesses, small and large, around the country say: We are going to do  something about this. I remember being home over the holidays and,  actually, the day after Christmas, December 26, I was talking with  friends, and a guy who owns a small manufacturing business, the brother  of a friend of mine, said: Would you be willing to come out to our  little company to talk about the tax bill?   I said: Sure, if we can figure it out schedulewise.  [[Page S159]]    He said: Because I want to give my employees a bonus. I am looking at  this tax bill, how it is going to affect our little business, and what  it is going to do for us to be able to invest more in the company, and  I want to give my employees a $1,000 bonus--everybody, 137 employees-- and I also want to do something in terms of investing in my equipment  because I want to make my people more competitive.   This is a small manufacturer in Cincinnati, OH, that makes a high- quality product, a precision product, and he wants to make sure that  his people have the best equipment to be competitive. In his case, he  has competition from overseas, as do a lot of American businesses,  either directly or indirectly these days in an increasingly global  economy, and he wants to be sure he is competitive. So I went there.   I went to the company, Sheffer Corporation, and I had the opportunity  to talk about the tax reform bill and what it does across the board. He  made the announcement, and I can tell you that people were very happy  because these are folks who work hard and play by the rules. They  aren't looking for any kind of a handout, but what they do want is to  be able to know that if they work hard and do the right thing, they  will be able to see a little better future for themselves and their  kids and their grandkids and not have that middle-class squeeze we  talked about, where wages are flat and expenses are up.   When the economy is not growing at a fast rate, which we have seen  over the last decade, it is really a challenge. When we have an economy  growing at 2 percent or less, it is tough to see that kind of open  opportunity. Now, with this tax reform bill, I think we have a much  better chance of seeing that. In fact, looking at some of the  projections for next year, it looks like most people think the economy  is going to grow at better than 2 percent--maybe 3 percent or maybe a  little higher. We don't know. The point is that people are going to  have more hope and opportunity.   It is not just Sheffer, though. In my hometown of Cincinnati, the  Fifth Third Bank announced a companywide wage increase. So wages are  going to go up for entry-level jobs and push all wages, as well as  bonuses, for 13,000 employees in Cincinnati.   Across the country we have seen this. Tomorrow I will be at a plant  in Cleveland, OH, that is putting more money into their pension plan. I  think it is going to be about $15 million into a pension plan, which  isn't in terrible shape, but it could be a lot healthier. That is going  to help those employees directly.   Last Friday I was at a plant in Columbus, OH, a small manufacturer,  Wolf Metals. They do an awesome job there competing with people all  around the globe, and they are going to make more investments in  equipment. In fact, I like this comparison to the tax bill because one  of the pieces of equipment--a $1 million piece of equipment they are  going to replace with the tax bill savings--is 32 years old. The Tax  Code that we reformed was 31 years old. So it is time, don't you think,  every few decades to actually reform our Tax Code, to bring it up to  speed and make it more competitive to give our workers the edge, just  as it is time to replace that machine to give his employees, what they  need to compete globally.   Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, OH, is going to reinvest in their  workers. Western & Southern Financial Group, Boeing, Comcast, and AT&T  are some of the big companies we have heard about. They have all  announced increased investments in their workers and new investments in  their operations as a result of this law.   With regard to Walmart, they employ about 1.5 million Americans now.  As I said, it is the largest employer in Ohio, with over 50,000  employees. They are going to raise wages, provide bonuses, and expand  benefits for the workers as a result of this tax reform legislation.   So these are the results. This isn't a hypothetical. This is not  something we are just saying might happen; it is something that is  actually happening.   I think every single American is going to see a benefit from this  because a stronger economy helps everyone. The 90 percent of people who  see their withholdings change so that they have more tax relief are  obviously going to see it. The people who work in the businesses we  have talked are going to see it. But all of us benefit.   President John F. Kennedy once said something I think makes a lot of  sense. He talked about a rising tide. He said, ``A rising tide lifts  all . . . [ships].'' In other words, it helps to have a growing  economy.   These results are going to help with regard to our competitiveness  too. Right now, we have a situation where, because of our Tax Code,  jobs and investments are going overseas. Now, we may not hear as much  about this, but what we are going to see is fewer foreign companies  buying U.S. companies and, therefore, less investment in jobs going  overseas.   In 2016, the last year for which we have numbers, three times as many  American companies were bought by foreign companies as the other way  around. Ernst & Young has done a study saying that over the past 13  years, 4,700 American companies were purchased by a foreign company  that otherwise would still be American if we had in place this tax bill  that we have now.   Part of the result of this tax reform and tax cut legislation we are  talking about today is obvious. We will see better jobs, higher wages,  more investment in companies, more investment in retirement--all the  things we all want to see, Republican and Democrat alike. Part of it is  the tax cuts. Today, with the IRS announcement, people will see this in  their paychecks. If not this next pay period, they will see it before  February 15 because that is what the Treasury Department is requiring  companies to do. So it is coming soon.   The other part we may not see, but is very real, is that the decline  we have seen in American competitiveness--the result being that jobs  and investment go overseas--is going to start to reverse, and it is  none too soon. We needed to do this years ago. Many of us have been  talking about it for years.   Finally, we are putting American workers in a position where they can  compete and they can win. Isn't that what it is all about? I don't want  these 4,700 companies going overseas. I don't want three times as many  American companies bought by foreign companies instead of the other way  around. We don't want that. What we want is people to say: I am going  to invest in America and American workers.   I believe we have so many advantages in this country, and we are so  blessed to be Americans. We have great universities. We have the  opportunity here, through our workforce, to be as productive as anybody  in the world. But when we have a tax code that is holding us back, it  is unfair. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress to fix it,  and that is what we have done. We should have done this sooner, but now  that we have done it, I think we will see continued good results, as we  have talked about today. We are going to see the opportunity for more  investments in American workers, in American jobs, in American  families, and in American businesses, and that investment will pay off  for all of us.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.
