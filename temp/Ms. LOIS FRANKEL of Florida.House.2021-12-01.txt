 Mr. Speaker, people sometimes ask me  what was the greatest moment in my life. I have had a lot of great  moments, but I will say three. The first was the birth of my son, Ben,  and I would say the next two were the birth of my grandchildren, Ivo  and Bruno.   The decision for me to bring Ben into the world, the decision to  raise a child, that was a personal decision made by me and my husband,  and we didn't have to call a Governor, we didn't call a State  legislator, we didn't call our Member of Congress and say, hey, is it  time?   Mr. Speaker, I stand here to talk about freedom, freedom of everyone  to have the right to make that very, very personal decision of whether  or not to bring a child into the world, because we know the raising of  a child brings so many blessings but also great responsibility. None of  us really know the individual circumstances of other people.   I raise that point today, Mr. Speaker, because as I stand here in the  Chamber, across the street at the United States Supreme Court, the  Court is hearing a case about a law in Mississippi that would  effectively overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that has given women the  right to access abortion for the past 50 years.   That Mississippi law is an effort by Republican legislatures, and in  this case the Mississippi legislature, to ban abortion. It is about  politicians controlling women's bodies. It is about politicians taking  away the personal decision of people to access the healthcare that they  need.   Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today and have trepidation whether or  not the Supreme Court is going to uphold this right to access to  abortion, it is a clarion call for the United States Senate across the  hall to take up and pass the Women's Health Protection Act, which we  passed here in the House. That act would forever protect a woman's  right to access a safe, legal abortion. Let freedom ring.                            ____________________
