 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Amherst County teacher John ``Andrew'' Fister.   Mr. Fister was an exemplary educator who dedicated nearly 25 years of  his life to teaching, training, and developing his students.   After teaching Bible, math, and German for 18 years in Ohio, he moved  to Virginia to serve 3 years as an academic instructor, helping young  adults enter the workforce.   In January of 2022, Mr. Fister joined Amherst County public schools  as a math and German teacher. Despite his relatively short time there,  he left an indelible impact on the student body.   Mr. Fister was loved by many students, even those not in his classes,  and served as a mentor for many who walked those halls.   With a special gift working with students needing a second chance or  just a little extra help, he taught them to believe in themselves and  to work hard to achieve their dreams.   Mr. Fister's enthusiasm for life was contagious, and he meant so much  to so many in the Amherst community.   Only 50 years old, his time on Earth was too short for those who  loved him, but his personal testimony and the influence he had on  others will live beyond his life here.  [[Page H6150]]    His family and those who knew him best are comforted by the knowledge  that he is in Heaven with his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I support the DETERRENT Act, and I  urge all Members to vote for this bill.   Education is a battleground for influence, and it seems that foreign  countries understand this better than some Members of this Congress.   On our watch, the Federal Government doles out billions in taxpayer  dollars to fund expensive degrees that empower an anti-American agenda  while these woke universities secretly collect checks from hostile  nations and watch their endowments grow and grow.   The DETERRENT Act would strengthen existing law, requiring colleges  to publicly report gifts and contracts with foreign countries. Under  the DETERRENT Act, this information would be publicly available on a  searchable database because taxpayers, parents, and students deserve to  see who is buying the opportunity to influence the next generation of  Americans.   The DETERRENT Act would further expose disturbing data that has  recently come to light. At least 200 American colleges declined to  report a total of $13 billion in contributions from authoritarian  countries like Qatar, China, and Saudi Arabia.   For some reason, the Biden administration has halted many of the  existing investigations of reporting violations and has declined to  enforce current law. Why would that be? Could it have something to do  with the $14 million donated to the Penn Biden Center from unnamed  contributors in China?   The Biden administration minimizes it, and universities try to hide  it, but the American people are suffering the effects of foreign  influence.   Just yesterday, in the Education and the Workforce Committee, the  presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT defended the influence Hamas has  on our campuses and students across this country. The number one donor  of these undisclosed funds, Qatar, is a country that says Israel alone  is responsible for the attacks by Hamas and even houses an office for  the Hamas leader in its capital city.   International partnerships can be beneficial for universities but  should not come at the cost of our national security, intellectual  property, academic freedom, or perpetuation of our American values.   Mr. Chair, I support passage of the DETERRENT Act to ensure greater  transparency regarding who is funding our colleges and universities,  and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight, concerned about  our country, and I am concerned about our willingness as Members of  Congress to meet the moment, to stand in the gap, to validate the hope  placed in us as the Republican majority, to stand in the gap and to  meet the moment to deal with the great crisis, the threats facing our  country.   I will begin by mentioning our national debt. The days of spending  without consequence are over. We have 40-year-high inflation as a  result of unprecedented, excessive, reckless spending. We are on track  this year for a $2.5 trillion deficit. We are running a monthly deficit  of about $200 billion a month.   We are suffering the consequences with 40-year high inflation and  grocery prices where Thanksgiving dinner costs 40 percent more than it  did when this President was sworn in 3 years ago. Gas prices are up,  utility prices are up, housing prices are up, rent prices are up, and  then you have got interest rates.   The American people are suffering further under 20-year high interest  rates, interest rates that have been increased by the Fed in a futile  attempt to try to combat inflation. Historically, you raise interest  rates because you have a hot economy and you are trying to ward off  inflation. In this case, the inflation has been caused by the  unprecedented levels of spending, and then we have further exacerbated  this, this administration, this Federal Reserve under this President,  with interest rates that have put home prices out of reach for most  Americans.   Now, we have got our credit being downgraded. Two credit rating  agencies have downgraded our debt, which will further cause interest  rates to go up and payments on our national debt to increase even more.   The snowball effect of $34 trillion in debt, record interest rates, a  $200 billion monthly deficit, is taking its toll. With each passing day  that we fail to deal with the greatest fiscal crisis in the history of  the country, we deepen the pain and the suffering that is put upon the  American people not only just today but in the future.   Meanwhile, how do we see Congress responding? Do we see a commitment  here in this House to cut our spending, to deal with our discretionary  spending, as we call it? Every dollar we spend in this House and in the  Chamber next door, every dollar we spend for discretionary spending,  everything that we vote on in spending, is borrowed. The total this  year of discretionary spending is somewhere around $1.7 trillion.  Again, with a $200 billion monthly deficit and $2.5 trillion worth of  deficit for the 12-month period, all of the discretionary spending is  essentially borrowed.   Are we going to meet the moment? Are we going to rise to the occasion  as a Republican majority?   If not now, when?   When will we take this seriously? When will we be willing to do what  the American people elected us to do?   If not now, when? If not us, who?   I am pleased to have with me my good friend, the courageous fiscal  warrior from Arizona, Mr.   Andy Biggs, and I would like to hear his  thoughts on this national debt subject.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for  the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate his bringing up the  supplemental, because I want to give Speaker Johnson credit for what he  did with that House supplemental.   The supplemental, the $106 billion package that was proposed by the  President and the Senate majority leader of the Democrat-controlled  Senate, represents everything that is wrong with Washington.   To the point, we are running a $200 billion deficit, and yet we have  a supplemental, which again, as he said, means we don't pay for it. We  add it on; we tack it on; we borrow more; let's borrow $106 billion.  Virtually everyone in Congress, I think--certainly all Republicans and  most Democrats--want to support one of our true allies on the global  stage--one of our, I would submit, two or three allies at a minimum-- Israel, through the brutal terrorist attack by Hamas. We want to come  to the aid of our friend and our genuine ally Israel and give them the  help that they need, but Israel doesn't have $34 trillion in national  debt. Israel is not running a $200 billion deficit. Israel is fiscally  solvent. We are not. Even for something so worthy as this cause, we  have a responsibility to pay for it, if we can, and we can.   Therefore, Speaker Johnson met the moment and said let's pay for it  by taking some of the $80 billion that was allocated for the 87,000 IRS  hirings in the inflation increase act last summer, let's cut $14  billion from there to pay for the $14 billion for Israel, and it passed  on a bipartisan basis in this Chamber. Twelve Democrats voted for it.   Honestly, I thought, you know what? We are plowing new ground in the  House. We are separating the Israel aid. We are not doing again that  which is represented by what we typically do here in Washington, which  is all that is wrong with Washington. We say, we are going to hijack or  hold hostage our desire to support Israel. We can't give them that $14  billion unless you also give them the $92 billion that has nothing to  do with Israel: $60 billion for Ukraine, as was said, humanitarian  support for Hamas, and more money for Mayorkas to process illegals in  the country more quickly and more deceptively, another ill-defined,  disastrous humanitarian system. We are going to hold hostage $14  billion for Israel with the $92 billion we have got to choke down.   I thought when Speaker Johnson and this Republican majority rose to  the occasion with the support of 12 Democrats, who courageously crossed  the aisle and did the right thing, that the Senate would have to take  it up, that they wouldn't hold up support for Israel on a bipartisan  bill just because it was paid for and just because it was going to cut  by $14 billion the $80 billion IRS expansion and just because it didn't  include the $92 billion that didn't have anything to do with Israel.   I know my colleague joined me in calling upon the Speaker and calling  upon our Republican majority to stand with our Speaker. He needs to  know we have his back and we stand with him. We have passed Israel  support out of this House. We are requiring it to be paid for because  that is the responsible thing for our kids and our grandkids and for  the American people. We are not going to take up any other supplemental  that has support for Israel, and every supplemental must be paid for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) to  hear some additional thoughts.    That you were responsible in helping to craft  that bill--you and our friend Chip Roy.    Just in Portland?    I want to go back to what you were talking  about in the supplemental, actually on the spending, as well as on the  FISA reforms.   This is a town of power and persuasion of leverage. I'm not sure we  effectively know how to use leverage when we have it. We are a town  that does things--a body that only does things when we have to, when  there is a deadline and when there is the pressure.   You talked about relieving the pressure on the FISA reforms because  of  [[Page H6203]]  the approaching deadline, the expiration of the current authorization.  Why would we be so fearful of that expiration to the extent that we are  unwilling to force upon the Senate the reforms that we are trying to  pass out of the Judiciary Committee? The Judiciary Committee voted 35-2  on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis that would pass this body if we  put it on the floor today.   The Senate apparently isn't so worried about the expiration that we  think they will take up our bill and pass it. There we would relieve  the pressure to reform FISA so it doesn't expire.   You can apply that to the debt situation. We did another continuing  resolution where we extended the Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer policies  and spending levels into mid-January and early February with the  promise that we work on passing our remaining five bills.   I am sorry to say and disappointed to acknowledge, we have not had  any demonstrated effort to bring those remaining five bills to the  floor. We don't have the commitment to the top line total programmatic  spending levels. Our commitment to cut spending, no matter how modest,  to cut spending from a year ago. This is something Congress hasn't  done--you know your history better than I do--in how many years, where  they cut the spending year over year.   We relieve the pressure. And then instead of trying to work during  the time that we have to pass these spending bills, we are not doing it  as we approach January 19. I expect this body is going to go home next  week and not report for nearly a month to work on the spending bills  that, in theory, we are supposed to pass before January 19's  expiration, this continuing resolution.   Where is our unified commitment?   We talk a lot about unity here. Unity requires a unified mission, a  unified purpose, and a unified vision to accomplish what?   We could point to so many existential crises created by our friends  on the other side, the Democratic majority when they had control, the  Senate majority, and the White House. I think you might agree, the two  most pressing are the two we mentioned tonight: the border and the  spending.   What, in the words of one of my favorite movies, ``The  Untouchables,'' Sean Connery saying, ``What are you prepared to do?''   What are we prepared to do to force a lawless administration to  secure the border?   What are we prepared to do to deal with the unprecedented level of  spending that is literally crushing us, creating the greatest fiscal  crisis the country has every faced?   What are we prepared to do as a Republican majority to come together  in a unified manner?   Why would we continue to fund our fiscal demise?   Why would we continue to fund an open border?   You know the border issue better than anybody. Some 8 million plus  were helped across this border by this administration and this  President's policies. Helped across.    There would be irreparable harm done if we secured the border today.  There are some 2 million known got-aways. These are the ones who don't  want all the free stuff and don't surrender to Border Patrol under the  policies of this administration for free travel, free housing, free  social services, free education, free--just about everything--benefits  that the American people don't get as citizens.   These are the ones who don't surrender for that because they have  criminal backgrounds and terrorist ties. We find 100 a year, the dumb  terrorists who Border Patrol apprehends. There are 100 a year with  terrorist ties. How many are among the 2 million?   If we sealed the border today, only time will tell on what scale the  American people will suffer catastrophic harm because of this  President's policies--far beyond what we have seen across the ocean  with our friends in Israel. What are we prepared to do?    I thought you might.    You cannot overstate the harm being done and  the damage to our country by this border invasion. It is a border  invasion. As we have had hearings on this issue in the Budget Committee  or in the Education and the Workforce Committee, my friends across the  aisle don't like that I call it a border invasion.   Mind you, they don't care about the border invasion. They just don't  like me to call it a border invasion. This is on purpose. This is  intentional. Every resource and every effort directed to the border  over these past 3 years from this administration has been with the  intent to get as many illegals, as quickly as possible and as  successfully as possible, into the country.  [[Page H6204]]    To your point, why would we continue to fund and give billions of  dollars a month--hundreds of billions of dollars a month to a lawless  administration that is perpetrating this kind of harm on the country?   I would submit that never in the history of the country has our own  President done more to intentionally harm the United States than what  is happening with this border.                                time  2000    I will say it again. Never in the history of the country has our own  President done more to intentionally harm the United States than what  this President has done with the border. Give me an example of  something that comes close.   The American people are counting on us. They gave us the majority a  year ago because we ran on fiscal responsibility. We have not met that  responsibility. We ran on securing the border, yet we continue to  maintain the spending levels and policies with continuing resolutions  and extensions that don't deliver for the American people.   They are trusting us, and they are putting their faith in us to stand  in the gap to be that one barrier to the policies under which they are  suffering and that are destroying the America that we know and love.   I am proud to serve with the gentleman from Arizona and many of my  colleagues here in Congress who are ready to do what needs to be done,  to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, and to honor the  trust and faith that the American people placed in us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
