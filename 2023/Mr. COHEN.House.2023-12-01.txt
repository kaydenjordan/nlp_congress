 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, will be the beginning of the  weekend of the St. Jude Marathon in Memphis, Tennessee.   Memphis is a city that has much to be proud of, but one of our most  prideful things is we are home to St. Jude Children's Research  Hospital. It cures cancers, tries to cure the ones that they haven't  yet, and gives children with cancer opportunities to be treated free of  charge.   This week, there will be a St. Jude marathon through Memphis; a big  race with thousands and thousands of runners who are there to raise  money for St. Jude and to bring attention to what St. Jude does for the  children of the world.   I praise St. Jude, and I am appreciative that they are in Memphis. I  encourage everybody to support them and to contribute.   I am not supposed to say that but I did.                            ____________________
