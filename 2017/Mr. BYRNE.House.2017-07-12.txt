The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. MacArthur). The gentleman from Alabama  is recognized for 1 hour.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 431 provides for full  consideration, including making six amendments in order to H.R. 23, the  Gaining Responsibility on Water Act, and allows us to begin  consideration of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018.   H.R. 23 is legislation necessary to deal with the severe water supply  crisis facing California and other Western States. The region has  experienced the worst drought in over 1,000 years, and many Western  communities have been very negatively impacted.   This commonsense legislation fixes the broken regulatory system that  is only exacerbating the impact of the drought conditions. The current  regulatory system is overly complex and inconsistent. Making matters  worse, various court decisions have only further complicated efforts to  resolve these issues.   For example, this bill will help bring California's water  infrastructure into the 21st century. The current water storage and  delivery system is designed to serve approximately 22 million people,  but the State currently has 37 million residents.   The bill is not only important to people in California. In fact,  around half of our Nation's fruits and vegetables come from California.  Every American could be hit in the pocketbook at the grocery store or  checkout line if the California drought is allowed to continue.   Through this legislation, we can help expand water infrastructure and  allow for greater water conveyance while ensuring environmental and  water rights protections. Passing H.R. 23 will directly help address  the drought crisis and benefit families, farms, the environment, and  the American economy.   The rule also allows us to begin consideration of the National  Defense Authorization Act. The bill provides for general debate and  makes in order 88 amendments, including 41 minority amendments and 20  bipartisan amendments. Another rule is expected tomorrow to provide for  consideration of additional amendments.   This open process actually started in the Armed Services Committee on  which I serve. At the committee level, 275 amendments were offered, and  231 amendments were adopted during our committee markup last month.   I have said this many times on this floor, but it is worth saying  again: there is no greater responsibility of the Federal Government  than to provide for the safety and security of the American people.  This year's NDAA does just that by reforming, repairing, and rebuilding  the United States military.   The bill addresses the realities of the dangerous threat environment  facing our Nation and ensures our troops and their families have the  necessary resources and benefits.   Over the last decade, we have cut our military at an alarming rate.  As the threats rack up, we have planes that can't fly, ships that can't  sail, and soldiers who can't deploy. We must reverse this readiness  crisis.   Thankfully, there is bipartisan support for boosting our Nation's  military. In fact, this bill passed out of the Armed Services Committee  by a vote of 60-1, continuing a strong bipartisan tradition of passing  NDAAs.   I want to briefly highlight just a few of the positive provisions of  this legislation.   The bill increases total military spending by 10 percent to rebuild  the military from the current readiness crisis. This includes  increasing the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army Guard and  Reserve, Naval and Air Reserve, and Air Guard.   Given the serious threat posed by North Korea, the bill boosts  missile defense programs, including adding an additional $2.5 billion  above the President's budget request.   The bill also authorizes the construction of 13 new Navy ships,  including three more littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a  355-ship fleet. It funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops and  extends special pay and bonuses for servicemembers.   Importantly, the bill continues to advance Chairman Thornberry's  priority of reforming and strengthening the military's acquisition  process to make it more effective and efficient.   Given the evolving threats related to cyber, the bill improves the  oversight of cyber operations.   The bill also helps set policy for the U.S. military relating to  Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Russia, Africa, and the Asian  Pacific region.   All told, this bill achieves important priorities of reforming,  repairing, and rebuilding our military.   Each and every day, more than 2 million men and women put on the  uniform of the United States and serve our country. As we have seen by  two recent tragedies, the Marine plane crash in Mississippi and the USS  Fitzgerald collision off the coast of Japan, these individuals put  their lives on the line in order to protect the freedoms we all hold  dear. They deserve the resources necessary to fulfill their mission and  the benefits worthy of those who sacrifice so much.   So I am hopeful we can continue to move forward in a bipartisan  manner to pass this NDAA, to support our troops, and to fulfill our  constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 431 and  the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman referred to what this would do to the  budget. I would point out to the gentleman, and I think I did this in  committee yesterday, that if this is passed, it will only be 16.8  percent of total Federal outlays, which means the single most important  thing that we do here in government only gets less than 20 percent of  the money that we are going to spend. So I don't think it is asking too  much of ourselves, as the people responsible for providing for the  defense of America, that we spend 16.8 percent of all the Federal money  we are going to spend next year on making the American people safe and  secure.   He spoke about tradeoffs. Let me tell you one tradeoff I don't think  any of us should be willing to make, and that is trading off the safety  and security of the American people for trying to keep some other  overspending in some other part of the budget going.   We need to focus today, and in this bill, on what it takes to  authorize the defense and the safety and security of the American  people, and I believe this bill does that, as did all but one of my  colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee.   So I believe that we have struck the appropriate balance here that  does all that. Yes, we have got some budget things we need to take care  of. That is for later. For today, we are going to focus on defending  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Austin  [[Page H5449]]  Scott), my colleague on the Armed Services Committee.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne) for his work on the National Defense  Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my fellow Members to support the  fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.   After nearly 13 hours of debate, my colleagues and I on the Armed  Services Committee, we came together, we passed the legislation to  provide critical resources and reforms for our Nation's military to  undertake the 21st century threats that our country and the world  faces.   Part of facing these challenges is ensuring that our military  personnel are able to combat the dangerous and illegal actions of  transnational criminal organizations, particularly those close to home  in the SOUTHCOM region.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman who spoke earlier about the  opioid epidemic. I would just remind my fellow Americans that over  5,000 Americans die every month from drug overdoses.   Just a few months ago, I, along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey), had the opportunity to visit with the Joint Interagency Task  Force South and SOUTHCOM's headquarters in Florida to hear and see  firsthand the challenges that migrant and drug interdiction within the  Caribbean region pose on homeland and national security.    Included in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act  is a provision that I authored aimed at addressing the threat these  transnational criminal organizations pose on our country and seeking to  find new ways to support SOUTHCOM in their continuing efforts to tackle  those threats head-on.   To all of the members of the SOUTHCOM team, I want to thank you for  the important work that you do in securing our coastlines, supporting  our national security, and protecting your fellow Americans.   To my colleagues, I urge your support in passage of the fiscal year  2018 NDAA to keep the U.S. military the best and most prepared fighting  force in the world.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Arizona.   This was not done in the middle of the night in secrecy. This was  done in full committee with cameras watching us, and done early in the  evening with full debate, so I disagree with him about that.   Let's talk about the wall for a second.   I support President Trump and what he is trying to do with the wall.  I hope we get to a point where we can deal with that.   This is a defense authorization bill. This is not a wall  authorization bill. The wall is already authorized. We don't need an  authorization bill for the wall. It is already there. The next step for  us to take for the wall is an appropriations bill, and this is not an  appropriations bill.   So what the Rules Committee has done is made it clear that we are not  going to deal with the wall one way or the other in the National  Defense Authorization Act. That is not the proper place for it. That is  not the proper place to be spending money for it. There is another part  of our budget, another law for us to deal with there.   So I hope that we all will understand that what we have done is made  it clear there is nothing in this bill--nothing--about a wall, nor  should there be anything in this bill about a wall, because that is for  another committee, another bill, another time, and another place.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney), our newest member of the Armed Services Committee and the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments and concerns about protecting  all of our privacy on the internet. I think we all should be about  that. But instead of having a misguided and unauthorized regulatory  action that left vast gaps in this system, we should have a  comprehensive bill to deal with it. That bill is not before the House  today.   What is before the House today in this rule are two bills: one that  deals with the drought in the West, which is very important; and the  second is provide for the safety and security of the American people.  So that is what we are here today about.   I appreciate her concerns about that. I join with her, and I hope  that we have a bill on this floor that comprehensively deals with the  issues that she brought up, but now is not the time, these are not the  bills, and this is not the rule to deal with it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I strongly agree with my colleague from Vermont's remarks regarding  the Budget Control Act. It was passed for a good intention, but it has  worked out quite differently from what people thought it was going to  accomplish.   It is time for us to take responsibility, as the gentleman from  Vermont said, and to do what we are supposed to do to make the priority  decisions about what is important for America and what is not.  Providing for the safety and security of the people of America, that is  important. And if we have to make cuts in other parts of our budget to  make sure we are doing that, first and foremost, I am happy to do it.   The gentleman is absolutely right about micromanagement. We have been  micromanaging the people that we charge with defending America with how  they are going to carry out combat responsibilities, particularly in  the Middle East. President Trump, I think, quite rightly, has delegated  many of those decisions down to Secretary Mattis so that our combatant  commanders can make the decisions they have got to make as and when  they need to make them.   I understand what he is saying about the State Department budget,  something that we all should be concerned about. The appropriate time  to talk about that is when the appropriations bill for the State  Department is here, not when we are talking about the National Defense  Authorization Act.   Finally, with regard to Afghanistan, which if I may make a little bit  broader and talk about the Middle East in general, it is time for a new  AUMF. The AUMFs that were passed in this Congress over 15 years ago  were for a different time, with different circumstances altogether. And  I do sense  [[Page H5452]]  a bipartisan urging for us to do that, but this is not the right time  for us to do it on this particular piece of legislation.   I hope that at a future time the Foreign Affairs Committee, that has  appropriate jurisdiction over that issue, will come forward with an  AUMF that we can all discuss because we are now not just in Afghanistan  and Iraq, we are in Syria, we are in Yemen, we are in Libya, we are in  Somalia, where we have had some past history that is not so good.    We all--everybody, not just from the Armed Services Committee--need  to understand these threats to our country and what we are going to do  about them, have a strategy with a clear endgame, which we need and we  haven't had for the last several years.   Then we should authorize it because only Congress has the power to  declare war. We should authorize it. And by authorizing it, we not only  take responsibility, but we communicate to our friends and our foes  alike, and to those servicemen and -women who put themselves at risk  out there that we are behind it. We, as the Representatives of the  American people, are behind it. So I hope that we can do that, but it  won't be in this particular bill.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If I may make sure that we are all clear about where we are on the  START; the START runs through 2021. That is 4 years from now. What the  bill says is that if we find that Russia is in violation of the INF  Treaty--and there is some indication that that is true--that we  wouldn't extend it beyond 2021. But that is 4 years from now.    So what does that mean?   This is a shot across the bow to Russia. We are telling Russia: If  you continue to violate the INF Treaty, we are not going to extend with  you on START.   This is telling them: We are not going to let you get away with this.   And I would think, at this point, after all that we have heard, we  would want to stand up to Russia, and this is a very vital way to do  that.   Secondly, about the GTMO issue that he brought up, there are two  amendments made in order by this rule for us to discuss GTMO, and I  believe we are going to have that debate tonight. Now, I don't agree  with the amendments, but we made them in order so we can have that  debate on this floor.   So we are going to debate GTMO. My prediction is that we are going to  defeat both of those amendments, but the people on the other side of  the aisle have been given a great opportunity to make their argument  that we shouldn't do that.   Nukes. Why are we trying to modernize our nuclear force?   Because our adversaries are modernizing theirs, and if we don't, we  are not doing the proper thing to protect the people of the United  States.   And then the gentleman talks about the budget bills. Now, there is a  budget bill coming. Now, the budget bill is for the next fiscal year,  October 1, 2017. That is several weeks from now. We have got time to  pass a budget for next fiscal year.   But the way we have everything set up here, we try to move these  defense bills about this time of year so that we can do what we have  got to do to make sure we have communicated to the military what they  are going to have to do their jobs.   If I may walk briefly around the world to remind us about where we  are. Kim Jong-un has continued to test missiles throughout last year  and this year, and he is getting better. And what he seeks is not just  to strike South Korea or Japan, he wants to strike America. That is why  you have an ICBM if you are in North Korea.   We need to step up to the plate and do more in missile defense and  more in other things to make sure we are doing everything we can to  protect America from an attack from North Korea.   China wants to take control of the South China Sea and the East China  Sea. What does that mean to us for America?  [[Page H5453]]    Forty percent of the trade in the world moves through those two  oceans. The greatest population center in the world is right there. It  is where we want to do more business, where people there want to do  more business with us; and not having a robust military presence there  means we cede that part of the world to China.   I guess we could pull back to where we were on December 6, 1941, when  we didn't have a presence in Guam and Japan and South Korea and  Singapore. Or we could take the understanding from what happened that  terrible day on December 7, 1941, that we have to be thinking now for  the challenge to us then and, by making those preparations and making  sure we have the defense in place, we keep December 7, 1941, from  happening again.   Then we have our good friends in Russia, as they push not only into  Eastern Europe, but now into the Middle East. It used to be we thought  that Russia was kind of off the table; you know, the Soviet Union  collapsed; didn't have to worry about Russia anymore.   Russia is back. They are back in many different military ways, in  their navy, in their missiles, and what they are doing with their armed  forces, including the little green men in Ukraine. We need to take that  threat seriously, as we haven't had to take it for years.   And then there is the Middle East. We know what is happening today in  Mosul and in Raqqa. Perhaps ISIS is being pushed out of those places,  but it is not disappearing. It is not going away as a threat, any more  than al-Qaida has gone away as a threat. We still have terrorist groups  like them and others who seek to do harm to the American people,  whether it is over there or over here, and we have to provide for the  defense against that.   Then there is Iran; Iran that, because of an ill-considered agreement  reached with them by the Obama administration, now is on a path to get  an ICBM of its own, which it doesn't need to strike Israel. It needs an  ICBM to strike us.                                time  1330    Then they get as close as they want to under that agreement that we  reached with them. Right up to the edge of violation, where they  perfect their nuclear technology, they decide in a short period of time  to violate it, put a nuclear weapon on one of those ICBMs and threaten  us directly.   That and a host of other threats are what we are talking about in  this bill. We have never faced such a complex set of threats since the  end of World War II. It is not my word. It is the word of countless  experts who have come before our committee.   We have to do this. The American people expect us to do this. Like  many other people in this body, I do tele-townhalls. At my last two  tele-townhalls, I have asked this open-ended question: What is the most  important issue to you?   We give them a broad range of issues to pick from: healthcare, tax  reform, you name it. The number one issue in those two tele-townhalls,  by far, for the people in my district was national security. They see  what is happening in North Korea. They see what is happening in the  Middle East. They know what Russia is up to. They are worried about  China, and they want to know what we are doing.   This bill that this rule provides for does what we need to do to  protect the American people. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everything that  I have heard today from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  because I know people on both sides of the aisle care a great deal  about these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 431 and  the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 431 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access       service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the       Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1868.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). The question  is on ordering the previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment. We have  debated this issue for years now, and every year we successfully  maintain the prohibition on transferring dangerous detainees out of  GTMO.   It is important to remember that most of the 41 remaining prisoners  are very dangerous. The language in the underlying bill is required to  keep the American people and our allies safe.   One of the main goals of Guantanamo Bay is to keep these terrorists  from returning to the battlefield. Sadly, it has become clear that some  of the detainees released have returned to the field to fight the  United States.   We ask our servicemembers to put their lives on the line each and  every day in order to keep the American people safe. How can we ask  them to do that, while knowing that we are releasing cruel, brutal  terrorists back to the battlefield? It would be reprehensible.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and protect our  servicemembers and the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 37 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until today,  Thursday, July 13, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
