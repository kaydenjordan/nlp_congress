 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 184.    Mr. President, this amendment would strengthen  community health centers across this country. In Nebraska we have 7  federally qualified health centers and 40 clinic sites that have served  over 75,000 people. These centers provide quality personalized health  care that women need and deserve.   Last year I had the opportunity to visit one of these in Omaha, the  Charles Drew Medical Clinic. I saw firsthand the comprehensive,  compassionate care that they provide to Nebraskans. Many times, women  are the ones who make health care decisions for their families, but  with higher costs and fewer choices, ObamaCare has hurt, not helped,  women in this country.   They have seen their premiums go up, they have had a hard time  finding the doctors that they trust, and they have had to sign up for  plans that they don't like. With this amendment, we can alleviate this  frustration. We can help ensure that they receive quality care in their  communities surrounded by a support system. It would strengthen women's  health. It would help take care of our families, our neighbors, and our  friends.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
