 Mr. Speaker, I sit as the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs that deals directly with  the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and other territories  of the U.S.   We had a very good briefing this week led by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon  from Puerto Rico, as well as Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands. It  was very important information. As we all know of the difficult  situation, especially we are seeing so much in Puerto Rico as well as  the Virgin Islands; President Trump visiting Puerto Rico this week.   Help is on the way. Indeed, it has been on the way, and we need to  just keep pushing to rebuild that infrastructure and push out into the  islands where the need is still felt.   So we know, we see, we are aware, and we will keep working to achieve  positive results in the short term as well, as we look at the situation  with Puerto Rico and the difficulty with PREPA, the power company, and  other  [[Page H7884]]  issues that we will address as a committee in order to have a long- term, positive solution for the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico and what  they need.                            ____________________
