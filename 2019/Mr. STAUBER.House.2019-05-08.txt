 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Father  Richard Kunst, an ordained Catholic priest for the Diocese of Duluth in  northern Minnesota.   Before ordination, Father Kunst was a Senate staffer for United  States Senator Rod Grams out of Minnesota. He earned his B.A. in  political science from Saint Mary's University in Winona, Minnesota,  and a master of divinity from Saint John's University in Collegeville,  Minnesota.   Father Kunst has had several parish assignments in northeastern  Minnesota, including parishes in Brainerd, Cromwell, Floodwood,  Meadowlands, and three different assignments in Duluth. He was the  vocations director for the Duluth diocese for 12 years and has been the  bishop's representative for the diocesan newspaper, The Northern Cross,  since 2005. Father Kunst has also been the auditor of the diocesan  tribunal since 2000.   As a hobby, Father Kunst collects artifacts associated with the  history of the Vatican and the popes and has one of the largest private  collections in the world.   I consider Father Kunst to be a great friend to my wife and me, and I  am grateful that he can be here today to open this wonderful Chamber up  with a prayer.                            ____________________
