This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important Major Non-NATO ally in the       region. This sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to       provide key partners in the region with modern systems that       will enhance interoperability with U.S. forces and increase       security.        The proposed upgrade will allow the Jordan Armed Forces       (JAF) to fire Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-      Alternative Warhead (GMLRS-AW) rockets using a digital fire       control system. The expansion will ensure uniformity among       all indirect fire systems used by the JAF. The upgrade and       expansion of the AFATDS fire control system will allow the       JAF to defend its borders and ground forces with indirect       fire weapon systems. This proposed sale will advance the       JAF's efforts to modernize its military and to enhance       interoperability with U.S., allied, and coalition military       forces. Jordan will have no difficulty absorbing these       defense articles and services into its armed forces.        The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region.        The prime contractors for the AFATDS and supporting       equipment include Raytheon Company and the Harris Company.       There are no known offset agreements in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any U.S. Government or contractor representatives to       Jordan.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-76       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. All equipment, documentation, software and associated       information proposed in this sale is UNCLASSIFIED.        2. The AFATDS software and tailored, international       ballistic kernel included in this proposed sale will be       formally tested to verify release for export and to verify       the excision of any and all elements not authorized for       release or export to Jordan.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Jordan can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                 Netherlands--MK-48 Torpedo Conversion Kits         The Government of the Netherlands has requested to buy       sixteen (16) MK-48 Mod 7 Advanced Technology (AT) torpedo       conversion kits. Also included are spare parts, containers,       associated hardware, torpedo handling equipment, and cables;       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The total estimated program       cost is $85 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       security of a NATO ally which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Northern Europe.        The Netherlands desires to upgrade additional MK 48 Mod 4       torpedoes to the MK 48 Mod 7 AT model. They intend to use the       MK 48 Mod 7 AT torpedo on their Walrus Class submarines. The       Netherlands will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Raytheon Company, Portsmouth,       RI. The Netherlands may require offset agreements in       connection with this potential sale. Any offset agreement       will be defined in negotiations between the Purchaser and the       prime contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Netherlands. Travel of U.S. Government       or contractor representatives to the Netherlands on a       temporary basis for program technical support and management       oversight will be required.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-75       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Mod 7 configuration is the United States Navy's most       capable submarine launched torpedo. It has a new sonar       receiver that has a broader bandwidth capability than       previous versions, and also employs a new tactical processor       that has increased memory and throughput. The Mod 7AT       configuration has the same guidance and control system and       the same software as the Mod 7. However, it employs the Mod       4M afterbody which results in higher radiated noise.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the Netherlands can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sustainment program is necessary to the furtherance       of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives       as outlined in the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Netherlands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The GBU-12 is a maneuverable, free-fall Laser Guided       Bomb (LGB) that guides to a spot of laser energy reflected       off of the target. Laser designation for the LGB can be       provided by a variety of laser target markers or designators.        3. GBU-58 is a 2501b Mk-81 GP bomb body fitted with the       MXU-1006 AFG, and MAU-209C/B or MAU-l68L/B CCG to guide to       its laser designated target. The GBU-58 is a maneuverable,       free-fall LGB that guides to a spot of laser energy reflected       from the target. Laser designation for the LGB can be       provided by a variety of laser target markers or designators.        4. Mk-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb is a 500 pound, free-      fall, unguided, low-drag weapon usually equipped with the       mechanical M904 (nose) and M905 (tail) fuzes or the radar-      proximity FMU-113 air-burst fuze. The Mk-82 is designed for       soft, fragment sensitive targets and is not intended for hard       targets or penetrations. The explosive filling is usually       tritonal, though other compositions have sometimes been used.        5. BDU-50 (Mk-82 Inert) GP bomb is a 500 pound, free-fall,       unguided, low-drag training weapon. There are no explosive       elements with this bomb; it does not have a fuze and will not       detonate when it hits the ground. It is used from flight       training to give the pilot the insight into aircraft handling       characteristics with the additional weight on the wing.        6. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-152 is a multi-      delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with general       purpose blast, frag and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The JPF settings are cockpit selectable in flight when used       with JDAM weapons.        7. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) II All-Up-      Round (AUR) is an air-to-ground weapon that consists of an       APKWS II Guidance Section (GS), legacy 2.75 inch MK66 Mod 4       rocket motor, and legacy MK152 and MK435/436 warhead/fuze.       APKWS II uses a semi-active laser seeker. The GS is installed       between the rocket motor and warhead to create a guided       rocket. The APKWS II may be procured as an independent       component to be mated to appropriate 2.75-inch warheads/fuzes       and rocket motors purchased separately, or may be purchased       as an AUR.        8. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures, which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        9. A determination has been made that the recipient country       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy       and national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        10. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Tunisia.                            ____________________
