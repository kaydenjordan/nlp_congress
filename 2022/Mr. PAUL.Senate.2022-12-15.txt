 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Just  For You Boutique of Frankfort, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Across the country you will not find two small businesses with the  same origin story. In most cases, the tale behind how one gets started  is just as unique as the business itself. Such is the story of Nicole  Boyd's business, Just For You Boutique. Nicole, a native of the  Bluegrass State, was driving through its capital when she found herself  stopped at a red light. As she gazed out the window towards an empty  storefront, she couldn't help but notice a big ``Available for Sale or  Rent'' sign in the window. It was in that moment that Nicole decided  that she would open her own clothing store, right there in that  location. Sometimes, all it takes is a self-starting individual to make  their dream a reality, as is the case with Nicole. Not long after that  fateful stop in Frankfort traffic, Just For You Boutique opened up on  March 8, 2016.   As an active member of the community, Nicole's favorite aspect of  owning her own business is that it enables her to really engage with  the people of Frankfort, as she is constantly seeing  [[Page S7248]]  friends and neighbors walk through her doors. Moreover, Nicole  understands that successful businesses put their community first. She  often collaborates with other small businesses around Frankfort to  offer products and experiences that are unique to Kentucky and to  Frankfort specifically. Nicole offers a wide variety of goods in her  store, from fashion-forward apparel and jewelry to everyday home goods  that could liven up any living space. Nicole pays special mind to  feature homegrown Kentucky products, between coffee grinds made by  local brewers and handcrafted artisanal soaps from local companies,  Nicole makes Kentucky vendors her merchandise mainstay. Given the wide  variety of goods she keeps in store, it would only make sense that  Nicole would choose to name her boutique Just For You as it is a place  where anyone, whether shopping for a gift or for themselves, can find  something that is uniquely for them.   Part of what makes Just For You Boutique so special is that Nicole  understands that strength often comes in numbers. She jumps at every  opportunity to amplify her store by collaborating with other small  businesses around the State capital, thereby growing the customer base  for businesses across Main Street. Just this past Halloween, Nicole  participated in a ``Trunk-or-Treat'' trunk show where small businesses  all around Frankfort came together in a local park to brave the autumn  rain and sell their goods. The Halloween trunk show was just one of  many community events that Just For You participates in, as they also  enjoy vending their goods at other Frankfort festivals and events.  Nicole has even offered a unique promotion where customers can show  their receipts from other local businesses to receive 10 percent off  their purchase from Just For You Boutique. As an entrepreneur, it is  clear the Nicole looks beyond the success of her own storefront and  works to support those operating around her.   Not only does Nicole do her best to support other small businesses  around Frankfort, she runs her store with a charitable heart. When a  young lady around Frankfort was diagnosed with breast cancer, Nicole  jumped into action. Suzanna, who had spent a lot of time inside Just  For You Boutique, designed shirts emblazoned with a pink cancer ribbon  with the hashtag #SuzannaStrong. In a show of support for Suzanna,  Nicole printed shirt with her design and began selling them in her  store, with all proceeds from the sales going towards the cost of  Suzanna's medical treatment. It is acts of kindness such as these that  sets Just For You Boutique apart from other businesses, as Nicole keeps  her finger on the pulse of developments around the community and always  keeps an ear out for those in need. I want to commend Nicole on making  her dream of owning her own a store a reality and thank her for all  that she does to support small businesses. Congratulations to Nicole  Boyd along with the entire team at Just For Your Boutique. I look  forward to seeing your continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
