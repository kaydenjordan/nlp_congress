 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  legislation that would posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal  to honor Marshall Walter ``Major'' Taylor and would finally recognize  him as America's first international sports champion.   Marshall Taylor was affectionately known as Major Taylor, and he  remains in death as he was in life; namely, America's first sports  superhero, a feat that took place in the late 1800s and makes what he  accomplished all the more extraordinary and astounding.   Consider, if you will, the fact that here is an African-American man  born in 1878 amid the sound and fury of post-Civil War America.  [[Page H6823]]    For those who missed the significance of this, it means that Major  Taylor came into being at a time when the old resentments of the  defeated Confederacy were beginning to push the Nation back into the  clutches of a desperate and cynical racial antipathy.   Major Taylor did not come of age at a moment in American history when  it was easy to be African American. In fact, he dared to be great at a  time when the color of his skin was a crime; that is to suggest a  punishable offense for which millions of Black people were persecuted  without justification or cause. Yet, in spite of the indignities  assigned to him because of his race, in 1899, Mr. Taylor went on to  become the fastest man in the world on a bike and an international  world champion in the sport of cycling.    Yet oddly, Mr. Speaker, very few people in this country know anything  about him. Very few people know the biggest sport in the latter half of  the 19th century was cycling and that an African American was the first  great international champion in this country and in this sport.   One wonders today: How is such a thing even possible that Mr. Taylor  can be forgotten? Why has it taken so long to honor a man who never  should have been forgotten in the first place? How can it be the case  that most people know little or nothing about the extraordinary  contributions of this man to the American experience, to say nothing of  his quantifiable greatness with respect to American sports?   Let me put a final point on this. Before there was a Jack Johnson,  before there was a Jackie Robinson, before there was a Joe Louis,  before there was a Jesse Owens, there was a Marshall Taylor, the son of  an enslaved family, the son of a veteran of the American Civil War, our  first international superstar, the first Black athlete to have a  corporate sponsorship, the fastest man in the world at his time.   He was a man so committed to his faith that he would not race on  Sundays, so subsequently the governing body of the international  cycling community changed racing day to Saturday in order to  accommodate the discipline and dedication of his faith.   Major Taylor was the first African-American world champion of any  sport, and yet most people don't even know who he is because he has  been conveniently erased. That is to say, he has been rendered  invisible and, therefore, condemned to exist on the peripheries and in  the margins of the historical memories of what he was and soon to be  forgotten and was not of any note. He had no value in our history,  tragically insignificant and unimportant, but nothing could be further  from the truth.   With the heel of an entire nation pressing down upon his neck, after  280 years of enslavement in America, here arose Mr. Marshall ``Major''  Taylor. He had no one to look up to. He had to set a precedent. He had  to exemplify greatness and carry that great burden of the race on his  shoulders, and he did so magnificently.   The recriminations of an entire culture withholding him from the  support he deserved, when he won in America, they played ``Dixie.''  When he won abroad, internationally, they played ``The Star-Spangled  Banner.'' Marshall ``Major'' Taylor said that made him so proud to be  an American.   Marshall Taylor strived in spite of it all. He didn't just win. He  won in spite of the facts. He didn't just succeed. He succeeded against  the odds. He didn't just achieve, but impressively, he achieved with  one hand tied behind his back, and he would not be stopped.   Frederick Douglass said that a man should not be judged by how high  he climbs but rather he should be judged by the depths from which he  has had to climb from.   Marshall ``Major'' Taylor is a quintessential example of the American  spirit and African American capacity for resistance and excellence in  the midst of it all.   I rise today in support of legislation that would posthumously award  the Congressional Gold Medal to Marshall Walter ``Major'' Taylor.   And would finally recognize him as the first American international  champion.   Marshall Taylor was affectionately known as Major Taylor, and he  remains in death as he was in life, namely, America's first sports  hero--a feat that took place in the late 1800s and makes what he  accomplished all the more extraordinary and astounding.

How can it be the case that most people know little to nothing about  the extraordinary contribution of this man to the American experience-- to say nothing of his quantifiable greatness with respect to American  sports?   Let me put a finer point on it . . .   Before there was Jack Johnson,   Before there was Joe Louis,   Before there was Jesse Owens,   Before there was Jackie Robinson,   There was Marshall Taylor.   The Son of an enslaved family   The son of a veteran of the civil war.   The first international superstar.   The first black athlete to have a corporate sponsorship . . .   The fastest man in the world . . .   A man so committed to his faith that he would not race on Sundays, so  subsequently, the governing body of the international cycling community  changed racing day to Saturday in order to accommodate the discipline  and dedication of his faith.   Major Taylor was the first African-American world champion of any  sport.   And yet most people don't even know who he is because he has been  conveniently erased.   That is to say, rendered invisible,   And therefore, condemned to exist on the peripheries and in the  margins of historical memory as if what he accomplished was not of any  note.   Not valuable.   Tragically insignificant and unimportant.   But nothing could be further from the truth.   With the heel of an entire nation pressing down upon his neck--and  with the recriminations of an entire culture withholding from him the  support he deserved . . . Marshal Major Taylor did it anyway.   He didn't just win; rather, he won in spite of the facts.   He didn't just succeed; he succeeded against the odds.   He didn't just achieve, but impressively, he achieved with one hand  tied behind his back.   And he would not be stopped.   Frederick Douglass said that a man should not be judged by how high  he climbs, but should rather be judged by the depths from which she has  had to climb from.   Marshall Major Taylor is the quintessential example of the American  spirit, and the African-American capacity for resistance and excellence  in the midst of it all.   I rise today in support of this legislation because the awarding of  this medal is an act long over due.   To bestow this honor is the least a grateful nation can do for  someone denied the recognition and respect he deserved.   And so . . . . it is all together fitting that we memorialize the  achievements and legacy of this extraordinary American.   And each of us should take pride in knowing that the time has finally  come for this nation to honor one of its most accomplished sons.   A Trailblazer,   A Pioneer,   A man of dignity,   An American,   An African-American,   A Champion.   And perhaps most of all, a man of remarkable faith.   The first great African-American world champion in any sport should  not be relegated to the ash-heap of history--and today, with this  legislation, we endeavor to put Major Taylor back where he belongs.   In the winner circle.   And alongside the best of what this nation has to offer. I yield back  the remainder of my time.  [[Page H6824]]                                ____________________
