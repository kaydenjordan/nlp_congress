 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Refugio High  School Bobcats football team for winning their fifth State  championship. The Bobcats had a 16-0 record this year on the way to the  Class 2A Division 1 championship game, where they won 28-7.   What makes this win extra special is that Refugio was one of the  hardest hit communities by Hurricane Harvey. Initially, the vast  majority of students was homeless, and football games were delayed as  the school and stadium were repaired. While the damage to homes,  schools, and businesses in that community were devastating, the spirit  of Refugio remained strong.   Head coach Jason Herring consistently gives all the credit to the  kids who put in the hours and showed up to get their work done. He has  played a big role in helping these students fulfill their potential.  All in all, it was an awesome year for the team.   In Refugio, winning football games is part of the legacy that goes to  building  [[Page H318]]  that strong community, and I look forward to seeing what the team does  next year.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the players, coaches, families, and the  entire Refugio community on this achievement.                            ____________________
