 Madam Speaker, I rise today to say how honored I am to be  able to file two amendments to the critical reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   My first amendment aims to protect the safety and privacy of  survivors by creating a statutory mandate that a victim's safety should  be central to housing decisions made by covered housing providers. This  amendment will ensure that housing providers do not evict survivors,  keep their information confidential, and prioritize their safety when  considering admissions, assistance, transfers, and more.   My second amendment is a direct response to an issue in my home State  of North Carolina. Sexual assault nurse examiners, or SANE nurses, play  a critical role in providing medical care to sexual assault survivors  and collecting evidence for criminal prosecution.   Unfortunately, in North Carolina, SANE nurses can be difficult to  locate, and some survivors travel to multiple hospitals and have to  wait hours to see a SANE nurse. My amendment allows certain grants in  the bill to be used to create databases.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lawrence for her  leadership and for organizing this Special Order hour on this  incredible night in this incredible month of Women's History Month.   I also want to point out that all three women from the North Carolina  delegation participated, and that is true sisterhood.   I rise today to highlight an extraordinary North Carolinian in honor  of Women's History Month, Reverend Nancy Petty.   Nancy is a trailblazer in the community. As a member of the LGBTQ  community and the faith community, she has championed marriage equality  and brought these welcoming ideas to her own church, Raleigh's historic  and progressive Pullen Memorial Baptist Church. I worshipped virtually  with Pullen just last Sunday.   A kind and compassionate person, Nancy often preaches inclusivity and  understanding. She has focused on facilitating interfaith dialogue with  Raleigh's Muslim community and has partnered with the Jewish community  on social justice advocacy.   She truly represents the best of our community, and I am honored to  call her a friend and a neighbor. She has inspired a generation by her  example to treat others the way you would want to be treated.   I am so pleased to recognize Reverend Petty for this Women's History  Month and the example she sets for us all.
