 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Milton ``Woody'' Woodside for serving more than 30 years as president  of the Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce.   After graduating from the Citadel, Mr. Woodside has dedicated his  entire career to public service. Without his work, coastal Georgia  would likely look very different than it does today.   To start, he worked 13 years for the First Congressional District of  Georgia with Representatives Bo Ginn and Lindsay Thomas. Since his work  with the House of Representatives, he has held the top position with  the Chamber of Commerce and is one of the longest continually serving  chamber leaders in Georgia.   In his position with the chamber, Mr. Woodside advocated for the  creation of the South Georgia Parkway, funding to deepen the Port of  Brunswick, a replacement for the Sidney Lanier Bridge, the building of  both the Golden Isles Convention Center along with the Career Academy,  and much more.   Whether it was at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the statehouse in  Georgia, or the mayor's office in Brunswick, Mr. Woodside was  constantly working to help Brunswick grow. Although he is retiring on  May 15, I am sure that Mr. Woodside will continue to help the Brunswick  community in any way he can.    Woody, thank you for your service. You have been an inspiration to  all of us. You were an icon in our community. Our community thanks you,  our State thanks you, our country thanks you, and I thank you, my  friend.                         Remembering Roy Kent Hodnett     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Roy Kent Hodnett who passed away at the age of 98 on Friday,  April 26.   Known throughout Glynn County in the First Congressional District as  a gentleman with a caring personality, he brightened the day of  everyone around him.   He served in France during World War II directly after D-day, earning  the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Victory Medal. When he came home to  the United States, he stopped in St. Simons Island while vacationing,  fell in love with the area, bought a home that same weekend, and  started raising a family.   While there, he built one of the most successful companies in the  area, Hodnett Cooper Real Estate and Vacation Rentals.   Through all of this, Mr. Hodnett's passion was with his family and  his community. For him, the key to a successful business was having a  wife of 75 years who has stood beside him and believed in him. He also  mentored and advised countless young people, helping them to find their  own paths through life.   I am proud to have had Mr. Hodnett spend so much of his life in the  First Congressional District of Georgia. His family and friends will be  in my thoughts and prayers during this time.                            ____________________
