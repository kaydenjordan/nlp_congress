 Madam President, I rise today to address a continuing  concern: the online sale of firearms using deceptive and misleading  means. It simply continues to be too easy for individuals to evade  existing restrictions and buy firearms through online platforms. This  behavior endangers us all.   Companies like Facebook have taken important steps by banning the  sale of firearms on their websites. However, despite these efforts, the  online sale of firearms continues to persist as a significant problem.  Disturbingly, between April and June 2020 alone, Facebook had to remove  a staggering 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms from its  platform.   One of the primary challenges we face is that sellers are employing  new tactics to circumvent online sales restrictions for firearms. They  resort to posting listings for firearms under deceptive names such as  ``stickers'' to evade detection.   I am proud to once again introduce legislation that addresses this  issue head-on. My Stopping the Fraudulent Sales of Firearms Act aims to  establish a Federal crime for the sale of firearms online through  fraudulent representations. Specifically, it targets the deceptive  marketing of firearms as seemingly innocuous items like ``stickers.''  These practices undermine the safety and security of our communities  and must be met with swift and robust consequences. I thank my  colleagues Senators Booker, Blumenthal, and Menendez for joining me in  this effort.   We must act decisively to address the persistent problem of  uncontrolled online firearms sales and ensure that our laws keep pace  with evolving practices. By passing this legislation, we can  demonstrate our commitment to protecting the public and preventing  firearms from falling into the wrong hands. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill and join me in safeguarding our communities from the  dangers posed by deceptive online firearm sales.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to address a continuing  concern: the online sale of firearms using deceptive and misleading  means.
