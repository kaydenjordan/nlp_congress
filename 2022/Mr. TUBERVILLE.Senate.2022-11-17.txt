 Madam President, I would like to echo the words of  our Senator from South Dakota about Veterans Day. We weren't here. In  my State of Alabama, we have 400,000 veterans who have served our  country and served our country well. A lot of them put their life on  the line. We have a lot of injuries. And I just want to thank them for  what they have done, being that we weren't here in the Chamber on  Veterans Day. And I want to again thank them for their service. And,  hopefully, in the future we can talk more about our veterans here in  this Chamber because there is not a more special group than that.                           Tribute to Stephen Boyd    Madam President, also, I want to start today by taking time to honor  my departing chief of staff, Stephen Boyd, and thank him for his  service to the State of Alabama and to our country.   For the past 2 years, Stephen has been at the center of every  decision and every action we have taken on behalf of the State of  Alabama in my office. And after nearly two decades of public service,  we say goodbye to this integral part of our team.   When you run for Congress, you learn that people are quick to give  you advice, especially when you have had a lifelong career in something  outside of politics. One tip I heard over and over was hire a great  chief of staff. But when I thought about what would make a good chief  of staff, I decided I needed someone with three main qualifications:  One, someone who knew the Federal Government; two, someone who knew the  great State of Alabama; and, No. 3, someone who would lead with  integrity. And that someone was Stephen Boyd.   Stephen brought a wealth of knowledge to my office from his time  working in the House, in the Senate, and as a Senate-confirmed  Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs.  Stephen has been quietly working in the background to help improve the  lives of the people in Alabama. And I have no doubt that he will  continue with that sense of service and succeed in his next endeavors.   So, Stephen, thank you for your service to our office; thank you for  your service to the great State of Alabama; and thank you for your  continued long service to the great country that we live in.                              Midterm Elections    Madam President, meanwhile, our work here in Washington continues.  Moving forward, Congress has a lot to do to get our country back on  track, with a lot of division. Last week, millions and millions of  Americans across the country took part in one of the most sacred  traditions that we have here. It is called voting.   The right to vote in free and fair elections is the cornerstone of  our democracy. I was proud to see so many Alabamians exercise that  right and also people across our country. Voting is the best way for  the American people to tell the government how they feel about our  performance. That is how we are evaluated.   As expected, the people used that opportunity last week to send a  message to us here in DC: No more one-party rule in this building. For  too long, this Congress has been controlled by the Democrats and has  ignored a lot of the issues facing the American people as inflation has  skyrocketed.   My Democratic colleagues continue to spend trillions of dollars on  partisan bills that have made the problem worse. My Democratic  colleagues passed the so-called Inflation Reduction Act a few months  ago. You know, the name of the bill, which was intentionally  misleading--it really has nothing to do with contents. There is a lot  of content in that bill, a lot of money being spent, a lot of money  going to the so-called climate change. Is that going to help inflation?  Is that going to help the American people as we speak? No, it is not.   My Democratic colleagues need to know that the legislation will do  nothing--absolutely nothing--and has done nothing at the present time  to help inflation. But it does spend nearly 750 billion--with a ``b''-- more dollars on radical leftwing priorities, many of them focused on  green energy policies that have accelerated our economy's slide toward  recession.   You know, we are all environmentalists. We all love our environment.  But we also love the people in this country from top to bottom. And the  people come first. The lives of the people in this country come first.  As gas prices hit record highs and home utility bills are expected to  go through the roof this winter--and they have already started--this  administration has done nothing--absolutely nothing--to ease the pain.  Our President last week said, after the election--What do you plan on  doing to help in the future--to the American citizens--What do you want  to change?--he said: ``Nothing.''   So we can take him at his word. This looming energy crisis has been  obvious--very obvious--to all of us for months. Yet President Biden and  his allies have nothing to stop it from happening. Prices will continue  to go up. We have no answers. And that is why we are here. We are here  to have answers for the American people. In fact, this administration  has done the opposite: siding with climate activists and begging for  foreign adversaries for oil instead of promoting and unleashing energy  production right here at home.   Just a couple of weeks ago, President Biden promised a group of  climate protesters that there would be no new drilling while speaking  at a campaign rally. There are no answers in that statement for the  American people whom we represent.   In addition to inflation, painful high gas prices, leadership in DC  has done nothing to address the rising crime ravaging our communities.  The wide-open borders--it is a magnet for cartels and deadly, deadly,  deadly drugs.   I recently visited the southern border to see the madness taking  place just a few weeks ago and what it is costing the American  taxpayers. I visited Eagle Pass, TX. At Eagle Pass, which is the Del  Rio Sector, they control 200 miles of the border. That is basically  just a third of the border on our southern tip of the United States-- only one-third. We were spending $15 million a month just processing  the illegal immigrants coming across the border. That is only the cost  of processing. They come across, and they are released into our country  no less than 72 hours after they are brought across our border. And  they go to no-telling where--all over our country. It is a taxpayer's  nightmare. We are talking about 14- to $15 million per month for just  200 miles. You could imagine what the rest of the border is having to  pay out of the taxpayers' pocket.    One thing I want everybody to understand, I keep hearing about how  our border is secure. Folks, our border is not secure. I was almost run  over by the herd of people coming across the line early one morning,  standing there. People are excited about being in the USA. We don't  know who they are. Most can tell us where they are coming from, but  they have no identification. As of today, we have taken people from 180  different countries. A lot of them are here doing no good.   I will tell you this: Just talking to the Border Patrol, we have a  lot of people coming across maybe for a better life, but the ones  coming across running from our Border Patrol which we do not catch, we  do not see, which is 15 percent to 20 percent, when you are running-- running--from the Border Patrol at the border, when we are letting you  come across no matter who you are and come into our country, if you are  running from Border Patrol, you have something to hide. That something  to hide usually is not going to be very good for our country.   In addition to the tens of millions of illegal immigrants already in  the United States, we already had 5 million come across that we know  of. So you can probably add, as the Border Patrol said, another million  to that list--another million people here that include people selling  drugs, human trafficking, terrorists. It is a scary situation. We will  pay the price in the near future for this.  [[Page S6753]]    Right now, the American taxpayer is paying a financial price, but in  the near future, we will pay a price that we will have to overcome. We  don't know what that is yet, but we will pay the price. The fact that  this administration has ignored the border is a difficult reality for  me to accept, and it should be a difficult reality for all of us to  accept.   We love people in this country. We are an immigrant country. We all  come from immigrants. When you are born in this country, you hit the  lottery. We live in, no doubt, the best country on the face of the  Earth. We are very fortunate. A lot of people weren't born in this  country, but we take a lot of people into our country from all  different places. But they should come in the right way, the proper  way, where we can recognize them, identify them, and understand that  they are coming here for the reasons of having a better life where we  can help them.   But right now, our border is overrun, and we better get control of  this because it is going to be a sad day when something happens in our  country and we are going to be on this floor apologizing to the  American people of something terrible happening again.   I am going to continue to push back on the radical spending in these  next 2 years in this Congress, our open borders, counterproductive  energy proposals, and the policies that take place.   And we make our criminals victims in this country. We have to stop  that. We have to make sure we put criminals in jail and don't make them  the victim. When my new Republican colleagues come to Washington in  January, our party will be united. We have had our problems. We work  out our problems, and we hope to be more united than ever before.   We want to deliver lower costs, safer communities, and a secure  border. We need to continue to talk about that. I would love to hear my  Democratic colleagues get up and talk about what they see when they go  to the border because it is one of the most important things that has  ever happened in this country--one of the most important. And we have  to have an answer to that. We can do this by cutting spending and  unnecessary resolutions.   We can help the American people. People ask: What are the Republicans  going to do? We want to cut spending, we want to cut regulations, and  we want to lower taxes, put more money in American people's pockets to  where they can live a better life.   Our Federal Government, the Fed now is raising interest rates. Their  job is try to keep inflation down. I understand that. Why do they do  that? They raise interest rates to slow down housing.   Folks, we have ruined housing in this country in the last 3 months.  We have achieved our goal. We have achieved our goal of people not  building homes. We have gone to almost zero in the State of Alabama. We  have put thousands of people out of jobs. We accomplished our goal of  putting housing on the back burner. I am for slowing down interest rate  increases. Let's see what has happened in the Fed. Let's make sure they  are working. We tend to raise them every couple of months now. Let's  see what has happened. Let's help the American people. Let's don't keep  kicking them to the back burner. We have slowed housing down. Let's put  people back to work now. Let's put them back to work and give them an  opportunity to live a better life.   We are in a tough time. It is going to get tougher. We will see a  deep recession in 2023. It is coming. There is no way around it. We  need to start making plans to help the American people overcome this  recession that is going to hit us all right between the eyes in the  next few months. We live in a great country, and this body needs to  help the people that live in this great country.
