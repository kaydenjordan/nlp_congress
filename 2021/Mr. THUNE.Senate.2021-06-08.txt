 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I am grateful  to Senators Klobuchar, Blunt, Peters, and Portman and the two Senate  committees that they lead for their bipartisan investigation into the  events of January 6, and for producing a detailed report in a short  amount of time. The report makes clear that there is more work ahead  for the committees. More importantly, it also highlights the immense  bravery of the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police who defended  the Capitol Complex on January 6.   In the coming days, after a thorough review of the 100-page report, I  will discuss its recommendations with my colleagues and work to  institute reforms that will make a meaningful change to better protect  the U.S. Capitol
