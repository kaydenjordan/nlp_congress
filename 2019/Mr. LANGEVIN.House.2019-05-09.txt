 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, Americans with disabilities have always faced  significant barriers to healthcare. A decade ago, an insurer could  charge a family an exorbitant amount to cover a child, merely because  the child had asthma. An insurer could tell an amputee that they would  cover her medical equipment except for treatment related to her  amputated limb. Or an insurer could flat-out deny coverage to the  victim of an accidental shooting at the age of 16 simply because he had  a spinal cord injury.   Essentially, insurers could legally discriminate against individuals  with disabilities and face no consequences. That is absolutely  outrageous, Mr. Chairman.   Then Congress finally passed the Affordable Care Act and started to  bring those barriers down. For the first time, people with preexisting  health conditions, including the one in four Americans living with a  disability, no longer had to worry about whether they would be denied  comprehensive health insurance.                                time  1530    Coverage of essential health benefits meant a mother with a traumatic  brain injury could obtain rehabilitative services and learn how to  walk, a man with Parkinson's could access medication to control his  tremors, or a child with a vision impairment could visit an eye doctor  to prevent further vision loss.   This access to healthcare is vital because, when Americans with  disabilities are healthy, they can stay active with their families,  pursue fulfilling careers, and engage in their communities.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration is, once again, working to  raise barriers to health coverage instead of working to eliminate them.  The administration's October 2018 guidance encourages States to allow  insurers to offer short-term, limited-duration plans that do not have  to provide coverage of preexisting conditions or essential health  benefits.   This means insurers offering these junk plans can discriminate  against disabled individuals by charging astronomical prices, excluding  necessary treatments from coverage, or denying an individual health  insurance altogether.   This is outrageous. If you are having deja vu, it is because this is  exactly what was happening to Americans with disabilities before the  passage of the Affordable Care Act.   The amendment that I am offering today makes clear exactly what  people with disabilities have to lose if States act on the  administration's guidance.   I have spent my near two decades in Congress championing efforts to  eliminate barriers to access and integration for people with  disabilities and helping my fellow Americans understand their great  potential.   But, fundamentally, none of that matters if people with disabilities  are not healthy because insurers deny them coverage to treat their  conditions.   The damage from the administration's guidance would be borne  disproportionately by the disabled community, my community, and my  amendment makes that clear.   Whether someone is born with a disability, develops a disability, or  becomes disabled due to an accident, that disability--I assure you-- happened by chance, not by choice.   Even the healthiest 30-year-old today could be in a car accident  tonight and wake up with a lifelong disability tomorrow; and, if that  30-year-old had one of these junk plans, much of the cost of that care  would fall on his or her own shoulders, and they would be on their own.   I had hoped that, 9 years after the passage of the Affordable Care  Act, I would no longer have to come here and defend the idea that  quality, affordable healthcare is a right and not a privilege. But,  once again, here we are.   Mr. Chairman, I support my friend Congresswoman Kuster's underlying  legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to make  clear the damage the Trump administration's guidance would cause to  people with disabilities.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to, in reference to the  gentleman from Oregon's comments, state that the plans under the Obama  administration were supposed to be very short in duration, for a 3- month period, while individuals sought more comprehensive, appropriate  health coverage according to their needs.   It wasn't supposed to be a replacement for a good quality, affordable  healthcare plan that would cover preexisting conditions and essential  health benefits to identify problems early on, a potential lifelong or  a very serious illness with long-term health consequences that could  potentially even lead to losing one's life.   They took what was supposed to be a stopgap, and now they are trying  to make that a permanent plan. That is just wrong.
