 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the story of  a family in my district that is working to make sure their friends and  neighbors know where and how their beef is raised.   Last Saturday the Naeve family of Camanche, a sixth-generation  farming family, officially opened the new Naeve Family Beef processing  plant. For generations the Naeve family has raised cattle and grown  crops in eastern Iowa, with three generations currently working the  farm in Camanche.   For years, smaller meat packing operations like the Naeve's have  faced an uphill battle against the bigger meat packers in the industry.  Last year, I introduced the Meat Packing Special Investigators Act to  tackle anticompetitive practices in the meat and poultry industries  that threaten the American food supply and U.S. national security.   Right now, the four big meat packers purchase and process 85 percent  of the total U.S. beef production. My legislation would give the  Department of Agriculture the tools it needs to crack down on bad  actors and push for fair competition within the marketplace.   Overconcentration in the meat packing industry is costing Iowa  farmers money left and right while the average American pays more at  the store.   I will continue to fight for family operations like the Naeves and  wish them the best of luck as they begin this new journey and improvise  to create a better marketplace.                            ____________________
