 Madam President, I rise in support of the Patient Right  to Know Drug Prices Act, which is legislation that I have introduced  with Senators McCaskill, Barrasso, Stabenow, and Cassidy. Our bill has  also been cosponsored by Chairman Lamar Alexander and 19 other Senators  from both sides of the aisle. This is one of those rare occasions on  which we are  [[Page S6171]]  taking up a bill that has widespread bipartisan support and that is  going to really make a difference.   This commonsense bill would ban the use of pharmacy gag clauses--an  egregious practice that prevents pharmacists from telling their  consumers when they can purchase those prescriptions for less money by  paying out-of-pocket rather than by using their insurance. This  legislation is action that we can take right now to help lower the  costs of prescription drugs for some consumers.   More than half of Americans, as well as more than 90 percent of  seniors who are, say, 65 or older, take at least one prescription drug  each month. Americans have been estimated to spend nearly $45 billion  out-of-pocket each year for prescription drugs. According to a recent  poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, as many as one out of five  Americans does not fill a needed prescription because they are unable  to afford it.   I witnessed this struggle firsthand recently at a pharmacy in Bangor,  ME. When a couple ahead of me in line received their prescription, they  were told by the pharmacist that the copay would be $111.   The husband looked to his wife and said: Honey, we just can't afford  that.   They turned around and walked away, leaving the prescription behind.   I was so upset when I saw that that I asked the pharmacist: How often  does this happen?   His reply: Every day.   Our bill would ensure that pharmacists could volunteer information to  customers on how to lower their costs for prescription drugs.   A recent study that was published in the Journal of the American  Medical Association found that 23 percent--nearly one-quarter of  prescriptions filled through insurance--ended up costing consumers more  money than if they had purchased the drugs without using their  insurance. Who would think that using your debit card rather than your  insurance card to purchase a prescription drug would be less expensive?  It is, of course, so counterintuitive that consumers do not think to  ask this question of the pharmacists, and gag clauses in contracts  prohibit pharmacists from volunteering this information to patients.  They prohibit them from telling patients how to obtain the lowest  prescription drug prices. Thus, consumers are paying more than they  should unless they ask for specific guidance. Americans have the right  to know which payment method provides the most savings when purchasing  their medications.   By prohibiting gag clauses, our legislation takes concrete action to  lower the cost of prescription drugs, saving consumers money and  improving healthcare.   More than 40 organizations support our bill that will ban this unfair  restriction, including the National Community Pharmacists Association,  the American Medical Association, the Alliance for Transparent &  Affordable Prescriptions, the ERISA Industry Committee, the  Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, and America's Health  Insurance Plans. Our bipartisan bill was approved by the HELP  Committee, with unanimous support, on July 25. The administration has  also condemned gag clauses and is on record as supporting our bill.   Despite this widespread support for banning this egregious practice  that restricts the free speech of pharmacists, Senator Lee has filed an  amendment that would eviscerate our bill. The Lee amendment would limit  the gag clause prohibition to only self-insured employer plans. That  would exclude all other employer group and individual market plans.  Under the Lee amendment, approximately 85 million Americans would be  excluded from protection. Think about that. There are 85 million  Americans who are receiving coverage under employer-sponsored plans or  in the individual market who would be excluded from this protection.  The gag clauses that would be banned in our bill are unconscionable  regardless of the type of insurance plan.   We know that patients who do not take their medications experience  greater complications. One study has estimated that medication  nonadherence costs the healthcare system some $337 billion, not to  mention there being poorer health outcomes for the individuals  affected.   The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act prohibits gag clauses from  being used by health plans that are sponsored by employers or offered  in the individual market.   The Federal Government's role in regulating these plans and  protecting consumers who are served by these markets is already well  established. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act--better known  as ERISA--was enacted in 1974. Employers who sponsor insurance plans  for their employees, as defined by ERISA, are able to deduct the  expenses associated with these plans. These expenses are also not  subject to the payroll tax. In 2017, the value of the Federal tax  benefit for employer-sponsored health insurance was estimated at $260  billion.   I strongly support our State-based system of insurance regulation.  Indeed, I spent 5 years overseeing the Maine Bureau of Insurance as  Maine's commissioner of professional and financial regulation. Our bill  does not change the longstanding deference to States on this issue. Yet  I would note that even though ERISA preserves the authority of the  States to impose insurance regulations on fully insured plans, these  plans must still comply with a multitude of provisions that have been  set by the Federal Government, and it has been that way for many, many  years. For example, regardless of State law, a fully insured health  plan must comply with COBRA and must cover minimum hospital stays after  childbirth, reconstruction after a mastectomy, and students who take  medically necessary leaves of absence. Also, these plans are prohibited  from discriminating based on genetic information.   Unlike Senator Lee's amendment, our legislation would prohibit gag  clauses in all group health plans so that no matter how the employer  decides to provide insurance coverage, the employees are able to get  the best prices for their medications by consulting freely with their  pharmacists.   Our bill will also prohibit the use of gag clauses in individual  health insurance plans, protecting consumers who don't have employer- provided insurance and who are, rather, purchasing insurance on their  own.   Americans who purchase insurance in the individual market may qualify  for tax credits to help cover the cost of their policies or they may be  eligible for tax-preferred savings accounts, such as health savings  accounts established by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Senator  Lee's amendment will eliminate the protections our bill provides for  these individuals, many of whom already face growing out-of-pocket  costs.   We need this bill as a complement to another bill we passed just  recently that prohibits these gag clauses for the Medicare Part D  prescription plans. This is a companion bill to that legislation.   The bottom line is this: Pharmacists should not be restricted from  telling customers if there are other ways for them to purchase needed  prescription drugs less expensively. The administration has made  banning these clauses a top priority, and this important consumer  protection should be written into law.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose Senator  Lee's amendment and to support passage of S. 2554. Today the Senate can  go on record taking a concrete step to help reduce prescription drug  prices for some consumers. It makes no sense to exclude 85 million  Americans from this protection, as Senator Lee's amendment would do.  Reducing prescription drug prices must be a national priority.   I am pleased to yield to the leading cosponsor of this bill, Senator  McCaskill.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have one  minute to respond to my friend and colleague.    Mr. President, it seems very arbitrary to me to exclude  potentially 85 million Americans from the protections this bill would  provide when there is such a clear Federal nexus to act in this area.   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 58 percent of workers  insured in self-insured plans are actually in ``partially insured''  plans. The reason this matters is that some States may attempt to  regulate these plans, believing they can, and then have their State  laws challenged in the courts and preempted.   Why not take the commonsense approach our bill does and simply ban  the use of pharmacy gag clauses--an egregious practice that prevents  pharmacists from telling their customers  [[Page S6179]]  they could purchase their prescriptions with less money by paying out  of pocket rather than using their insurance.   We have the support of 40 medical and consumer groups for this bill,  and this legislation is action we can take right now to help lower the  cost of prescription drugs for some consumers. It has widespread  bipartisan support. It came out of the HELP Committee unanimously, and  it is supported by the administration. I urge a ``no'' vote on the  amendment offered by the Senator from Utah and a ``yes'' vote on the  underlying bill.                            ____________________
