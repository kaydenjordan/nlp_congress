 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 30 seconds.    Madam President, veterans, meaning our veterans of war  or veterans in uniform who have not been in a war environment, have a  big impact on the American economy. There are 2.5 million veteran-owned  businesses in the United States that account for more than $1.1  trillion in revenue. In Iowa, there are 26,119 veteran-owned businesses  that employ 51,801 people and bring in $10.9 million.   Iowa is working hard to attract veterans and help them start and  expand their businesses. I honor these hard-working entrepreneurs who  have served our country by joining my colleagues in recognizing this  week, the week of November 4, as National Veterans Small Business Week.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have a couple of issues on which I  want to speak. Trade and section No. 232 would be my second issue. The  first one about which I want to speak is commonsense entitlement  reform.   In the past year, we have seen a flurry of drug-pricing proposals. I  am encouraged by the efforts of my colleagues here in the Senate,  especially by Ranking Member Wyden, by my colleagues in the House of  Representatives who agree with this effort to reduce drug prices, and  by the President of the United States, who has already been involved  for a year and a half in lowering drug prices. All have made lowering  prescription drug costs one of the core principles of our efforts and  particularly a core principle for this administration.   I have paid attention to each of the pieces of legislation that have  been proposed and have looked at their pros and cons closely. However,  so far, there is only one bipartisan proposal that cuts prescription  drug prices, that protects innovation, that lowers what senior citizens  will pay at the pharmacy counter, and that brings along with it  entitlement reform. The Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019  is the bill I am talking about. It responsibly reduces Medicare Part D  costs.   As with any widely encompassing piece of legislation, there has been  some spirited debate surrounding the different provisions of our bill.  So I am here today, hoping to clear up some of the confusion  surrounding a phrase that I have heard thrown around in this debate-- ``price setting.'' Opponents of the legislation criticize the bill for  price setting. The scare tactic associated with this claim is centered  on one particular policy in our bill--that of matching the growth of  government subsidies that drug manufacturers receive to the rate of  consumer inflation.   When I set out at the beginning of this year to create a piece of  bipartisan legislation that had real and meaningful change, I knew the  focus had to be on individual Americans. That is why we kept out-of- pocket costs at a level at which seniors could see relief. That is why  we banned spread pricing, which games the healthcare system to the  detriment of the beneficiaries and the taxpayers. That is why we  created a new way of paying for lifesaving but very costly Medicare  drugs. That is why we kept the growth of government subsidies in  Medicare Part D to the rate of inflation.   Unlike other proposals, the Senate Committee on Finance's policy does  not tie the launch price to an artificially low price. The bill doesn't  stop a drug company from recouping its research and development costs,  which will lead to more innovation.   What the Part D inflationary rebate does is really quite simple.  After launching, if a drug manufacturer chooses to raise the price  above the rate of inflation, it has to return the difference for the  drugs paid by Medicare. This policy limits government subsidies in  order to provide predictability for the Medicare Program. At the same  time, it provides protection for the American taxpayer. That is simply  all it does. Any subsidies that the pharmaceutical companies would have  received from an exorbitant raise in price is then returned to  Americans rather than to line pharma's pockets. The inflation rebate  incentivizes companies to stabilize their pricing, and the taxpayers'  money is used more prudently and more efficiently.   You have all heard of CATO, the research organization and policy  organization. CATO is one of the Nation's leading libertarian and free  market organizations. It has praised the bill for its significant cost  savings for the taxpayers. Does anyone really think a libertarian  organization would endorse price controls? In its analysis of the bill,  CATO wrote that this bill ``would not impose price controls'' and  ``would reduce wasteful Medicare spending.'' CATO also acknowledged  that these ``commonsense tweaks to a bloated entitlement program are  encountering strong opposition . . . mostly from those who would not  make quite as much money off the taxpayers.''   We all know that Medicare's finances are worsening. The program is  projected to become insolvent within the next 6 years if we continue  down this very same path. In getting back to my bipartisan bill, the  Grassley-Wyden bill will ensure that the Federal Government uses  Medicare's budget to pay for lifesaving treatments in a fiscally  responsible manner.   This goal is not without precedent. For those who say we are acting  in an unprecedented way and are setting prices, I say it isn't setting  prices. They forget that throughout the American healthcare system, the  government has, at one time or another, set up different ways to  constrain high and rising costs.   For example, States have not been allowed to pay Medicaid providers  at a rate that has been higher than Medicare's. Another example is in  the Medicare Program. Medicare Part A has paid for the operating costs  associated with acute inpatient care and has used the inpatient  prospective payment system, or what is referred to as IPPS. Congress  enacted the inpatient prospective payment system to constrain the  growth of Medicare's inpatient hospital payments by providing  incentives for those facilities to provide care more efficiently.   Congress also requires that the concept of budget neutrality be  applied to a number of Medicare payment systems, including to provider  payments. This is simple. In other words, the government says that if  one provider gets an increase, another provider is reduced.   Finally, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, within the  CMS, is required by statute to enforce financial controls on total  Medicare spending. The Center can only test different ways to pay for  services in Medicare and Medicaid if they are expected to lower costs  while they maintain quality. So this idea of using taxpayer dollars  responsibly and in a targeted manner exists in many facets of the  American healthcare system.   My point is, while some call the inflationary rebate in Part D a  price control, I urge all of the Members to consider how Congress is  using measures to contain costs currently. Isn't it the fiscally  responsible thing to do when Federal taxpayer dollars are being spent  by those of us in Congress? Shouldn't we do what we can to contain  costs? After all, it is not what hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical  companies may charge; it is about what the American taxpayer will pay  for services. That doesn't fall into the category of price controls. At  the markup for my prescription drug bill, even the Director of the  independent Congressional Budget Office agreed with me.   I could continue to give examples of budgetary tools in the toolbox  that Congress uses in an attempt to be fiscally responsible with regard  to Medicare and Medicaid. I could also continue to provide examples of  outrageous drug costs. Yet the bottom line is that the Prescription  Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019 is a win for Americans across the  board.   Seniors will pay less out of pocket; taxpayers will know their money  is being used appropriately; and drug manufacturers will continue to be  able to innovate.   That is why Ranking Member Wyden and I strove to achieve these things  in the very beginning. I urge my colleagues to keep these  considerations in mind, and hopefully my colleagues will support this  legislation as a way of answering the concerns that constituents  express in almost every State. At least in the 99 county meetings that  I hold in Iowa every year, doing something about the pricing of  prescription drugs comes up. It has to be that way all over the  country.
