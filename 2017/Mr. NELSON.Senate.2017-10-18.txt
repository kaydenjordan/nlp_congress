 Mr. President, before Medicare, one-half of senior  citizens in this country did not have any healthcare, health insurance.  Medicare changed that. So why in the world would we want to cut $473  billion from Medicare? It does not make sense.   My amendment simply restores that cut and replaces it with  eliminating a number of tax loopholes. It is a simple amendment. Save  Medicare.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
