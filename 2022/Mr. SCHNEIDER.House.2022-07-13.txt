 Madam Speaker, we are hearing a lot of arguments  today. My colleague on the other side talked about America at its best.  Let me tell you about America at its best.   Last Monday on July 4 in Highland Park, Illinois, thousands of people  gathered together. Families, parents, grandparents, and children lined  the road for a parade. Many of them came there year after year,  generation after generation, to celebrate the birth of our country, the  values of our Founders, and the belief that this is a Nation for us  all. I saw America at its best.   At 10:14 on July 4 last week, a shooter who had climbed a roof with  an AR-15 fired 83 bullets in less than a minute, killing seven people  and wounding dozens of others.   Thousands of people fled that parade, the best America has to offer,  not  [[Page H5999]]  knowing where to go, not knowing what to do. They heard there was a  shooter. Was it one? Was it two? It could have been many. Should they  go home, or should they go somewhere else? Nobody knew.   Imagine if on their phones they had been told of an active shooter at  the corner of Second and Central. Imagine if on their phones, they had  been told, go and seek safety in your home. For 8 hours, people  watched, people talked, rumors swirled. An entire community of 30,000  people was left to grieve and to fear.   That is what this bill is about. That is why we are here. We are here  to give the people of Highland Park or of the many communities around  our country that have experienced an active shooter, or will experience  an active shooter, a little bit of security.   According to the FBI, last year, there were 61 active shooting  incidents in the country. That was last year alone and double the year  before. We are seeing more violence in our country. We have to do  something about this violence.   I know the people who are arguing against this bill aren't willing to  do that. They are not willing to stand up and defend our communities,  to keep our children safe from this kind of violence. They are not even  willing to give our communities the information they need to seek  safety on their own.   We have to take action to stop these killings in our communities, but  that is not what this bill is about. This bill is about getting people  the critical, potentially lifesaving information in a quick and  efficient way in the event of a shooter. That is what this bill is  about. That is why I am asking people to vote for it.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in September of 2020, FBI Director Christopher Wray,  while testifying to Congress, stated that the greatest threat to the  homeland were lone actors radicalized online. He went on to talk about  domestic violent extremists, homegrown violent extremists, and racially  motivated violent extremists.   The fact of the matter is that in our Nation, we are seeing an  increase in extremism and the threat of domestic violence extremism  across the country. From Charlottesville to the shooting at the Tree of  Life synagogue, we are seeing this increase in our communities. No  community is free from it, and no segment of our society is immune from  the threat.   In May of this year, in an unclassified presentation by the Defense  Counterintelligence and Security Agency titled ``Insider Threat and  Extremist Activity Within the DOD,'' they laid out a very clear  presentation defining what is domestic violence extremism, laying  [[Page H6282]]  out the stages of development, and highlighting seven cases of  extremism in Active-Duty and former military servicemembers. They went  on to describe for commanders steps they could take in prevention and  reporting: alertness, early intervention, communication.   My amendment would require the Department of Defense, the FBI, and  the Department of Homeland Security to report on extremism or threats  of extremism within our military or within our uniformed services.  Threats of neo-Nazi, white supremacist activity, or any other extremist  activity that could be a threat not just within the services but  including servicemembers separated from the service or Federal law  enforcement, whether it is due to white supremacist or neo-Nazi  incidents. The amendment requires the agencies to develop a plan to  prevent those incidents in the future.   Such behavior, such extremism is a threat to us in all segments of  society. There is no reason to believe that our military is any  different. These are exceptions. They are rare. But we must do  everything we can to identify them and to thwart them before risks  become reality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment in no way denigrates the many fine, overwhelming in  number, vast, vast majority of fine people who serve in our military  and uniformed services.   But the fact is, we have had incidents, and this is, again, from that  report I mentioned earlier: a mass casualty attack, a uniformed officer  killing fellow soldiers, threats against religious communities, threats  against media and government communications, and bomb-making  instructions, material support to terrorists.   These are not made-up examples. They are real examples. They are  exceptional. They are exceedingly rare, but it is incredibly important,  critically important that we identify these threats before they become  incidents, before lives are lost.   We need to make sure we are getting this information and taking the  appropriate action. It is something we can do together. I hope we can  do it in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing Naval Station Great  Lakes. Every single recruit to the Navy--whether they enlist in  California, in the Carolinas, or even from overseas--comes to Naval  Station Great Lakes for basic training.   I have had the privilege of speaking to them at their graduation from  boot camp. I see the exceptional character of all the people who go  through. The men and women who put on the uniform to defend our Nation  are the best our Nation has to offer. I am exceedingly proud of them.   The presence of even one person embracing extremism, embracing  racism, embracing hatred denigrates our entire military forces. Our  forces represent us as a Nation and, again, they are the best we have  to offer.   This amendment doesn't denigrate but celebrates our Armed Forces by  asking our Armed Forces and uniformed services to report to Congress.  It looks to us as Representatives to do our job in oversight, making  sure they have the resources they need to ensure that everyone in our  military represents the best values we have as Americans.   This is not a denigration; it is a celebration. It is an important  amendment. I urge all my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise with my colleagues from Illinois  to honor the lives and bless the memory of the seven precious people  murdered in a heinous act of evil on July Fourth in Highland Park at  our Independence Day Parade.   As I speak now, the residents of Highland Park are also gathering to  honor the victims: Katherine Goldstein, Irina McCarthy, Kevin McCarthy,  Stephen Straus, Jacki Sundheim, Nicolas Toledo Zaragoza, and Eduardo  Uvaldo.   There are no words to describe the heartbreak of our community, the  grief, but also the anger.   These beautiful people were the center of the universe for their  families and pillars of strength for their communities. They were  loving parents and  [[Page H6287]]  grandparents, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters. They had  personal passions and diverse interests. And all loved life. Each one  had a special spark that will still burn bright within the people who  knew and loved them.   In standing and honoring them, we also confront the fact that, as  Rabbi Wendy Geffen poignantly said at one of the funerals: ``We should  not have to be here.''   Yet, here we are, giving sorrowful remarks and moments of silence  time and time and time again. Every day, in communities across America,  we needlessly lose 111 lives to gun violence. No community is left  untouched.   Today, we unite and stand with Highland Park as they mourn. Tomorrow,  I pray that we can unite in this body to stand up and work together to  bring this awful violence to an end.   I ask now that my colleagues in the House join the Illinois  delegation in a moment of silence in honor of the victims in Highland  Park.   Before we lift our heads, may we take an extra moment to reflect on  the many more lives lost to gun violence in the 9 days since. May their  memories forever be a blessing.                            ____________________
