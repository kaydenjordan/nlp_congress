 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today is Earth Day, our planet's largest  annual civic event. More than 1 billion people in 192 nations are  expected to participate in activities to draw attention to the urgency  of the climate crisis and environmental degradation. From the South  Side of Chicago to South America and South Asia, ordinary citizens-- schoolchildren, scientists, environmental activists, business and  government leaders, and others--are calling for help for our ailing  planet.   This year, the most important Earth Day gathering is just 16 blocks  from where we meet. At the White House today, President Biden is  hosting a 2-day virtual summit of leaders from 40 Nations--leaders from  the highest emitting countries, China, India, Russia, as well as  leaders from countries that suffer the worst consequences, such as  Bangladesh and Kenya. The leaders are coming together, after a year of  staggering pandemic hardship and climate-related crises, to renew their  commitment to save our planet from irreversible climate catastrophe.   With this Earth Day Leaders Summit, President Biden is sending the  world a clear message: The United States is back and is ready to be a  leader again in combating climate change. The White House Leaders  Summit is meant to encourage countries to make strong commitments under  the Paris Agreement to prevent the global average temperature from  rising more than 1.5 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels. This  sounds technical and dry and wonky, but here is what it means. At 1\1/ 2\ degrees Celsius of warming, much of the world will likely see sea  level rise that swallows coastlines, leaves millions of homes  underwater, and produces recordbreaking droughts, floods, and other  climate catastrophes. Hundreds of millions of people will be pushed  into poverty because of this, and climate-related famine and conflicts  would trigger a global refugee crisis worse than anything we have ever  seen. That is the future if we do nothing. That is something we must  avoid, and the United States needs to show leadership.   President Biden does that today with this meeting. One of his first  official acts as President, on his first full day in office, was  starting the process of recommitting the United States to join every  nation in the world in the Paris Agreement. If you will remember, the  previous President decided that America would step away from that.   At the White House Leaders Summit, the President will announce a new  goal: to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent by  the year 2030. The Biden administration's leadership stands in sharp  contrast to what we have seen over the last 4 years. We saw a President  withdraw from the Paris Agreement, ridicule science at every  opportunity, deny the existence of a growing climate threat, and even  censor the remarks of government scientists that might suggest  otherwise.   Fortunately, the disengagement by the previous administration didn't  prevent the American people, scientists, real business leaders and  entrepreneurs, and cities and States from ignoring President Trump and  moving ahead.   There is no substitute, though, for leadership at the top. The  American Jobs Plan, which President Biden plans to pass, and I hope  there is support, is a plan to secure America's global economic  leadership, strengthen America's working families, and build the  infrastructure of the future we can count on. The American Jobs Plan,  of course, will rebuild America's crumbling rail lines, roads, bridges,  ports, and water systems; strengthen America's power grid; and invest  in 5G broadband internet for every community in America. The previous  President promised it but didn't deliver. This President wants to  deliver, with our help.   I have heard those on the floor who then criticize that part of the  American Jobs Plan, which goes further. President Biden also wants to  invest in green energy, wind, solar, and other renewable energy  projects. To hear that described by some of his Republican critics, it  is just pure socialism. Socialism? It is a realistic response to the  21st challenge of climate change. The American Jobs Plan includes  billions of dollars to retrain any workers who are dislocated if they  work in the fossil fuel industry and to find better, well-paying jobs  with a future in clean energy and other fields. Just this week, the  president of the United Mine Workers of America--a sixth generation  [[Page S2141]]  West Virginia coal miner--announced that his union was going to support  President Biden's American Jobs Plan in exchange for training his coal  miners in how they can be effective and also have good jobs in a  cleaner energy future. That union understands clean energy. Most  Americans do. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will.   American business gets it. I have introduced two bills that would  bring efficiency and innovation of the marketplace and the financial  clout of the Federal Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and  create a more sustainable economy that works for the people and the  planet. My bills are called the America's Clean Future Fund Act and the  Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act.   We talked about investing in American infrastructure so we can tackle  climate change and create renewable energy jobs and the industries of  the future. But I want to make it clear that our highest priority is to  create those jobs right here in America. I hope my colleagues will work  with us and won't filibuster the President's efforts to move our  economy forward in a dramatic way.   We can't afford denial, defeatism. We can't afford people who say it  is too late to do anything about climate disaster. We owe it to our  children, grandchildren, and future generations to do everything in our  power to save this planet from what is obviously coming our way.   Safe, effective vaccines have brought us so far in fighting this  pandemic. We have developed in a short period of time under this  President not only the vaccines but also their delivery and  administration to the people of our country at a rate no one ever  expected. The research that led to this was good scientific research.  Two of the leading vaccines were developed using something called  messenger RNA--mRNA--and it worked. The basic science that led to the  discovery of mRNA was largely funded by American taxpayers--government  programs--and applied by the private industry with great success. And  now, because of our investment in science and belief in science,  people's lives are being saved in the United States and around the  world. Imagine solutions we can find if we harness the power of public  partnerships together with science and citizen engagement to address  climate change.    The first Earth Day was 51 years ago. It was proposed by a Senator  from Wisconsin named Gaylord Nelson. It brought 20 million Americans  together at the time, put preservation of our planet on the national  agenda, and ushered in a decade of remarkable environmental progress.  That decade saw the creation of some of our most important protections  of clean air, land, and water.   Ten years later, Gaylord Nelson looked back on that first Earth Day  and the decade that followed. His words bear repeating today, And this  is what he said: ``So long as the human species inhabits the Earth,  proper management of its resources will be the most fundamental issue  we face. Our very survival will depend upon whether or not we are able  to preserve, protect, and defend our environment. We are not free to  decide about whether or not our environment matters. It does matter.  Apart from politics, it is fundamental to survival. We disregard the  needs of our ecosystem at our mortal peril.'' That was the lesson of  Earth Day, and it should never be forgotten.                                    S. 937    Madam President, this morning, we are going to take up the COVID-19  Hate Crimes Act that Senator Hirono and Senator Duckworth bring before  us.   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have, unfortunately,  witnessed an appalling rise in hate incidents targeting the Asian  American and Pacific Islander community. The numbers are shocking.  Between March 2020 and February 2021, the Stop AAPI Hate Initiative  documented nearly 3,800 hate incidents in the United States, and a  recent analysis by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism found  that while hate crimes in 16 of America's largest cities decreased  overall by 7 percent in the year 2020, those targeting Asian Americans  increased by nearly 150 percent.   Our friends and neighbors in the AAPI community are facing an urgent,  imminent threat. It is time to do something about it. That is why I am  proud to support the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. This will provide State  and local law enforcement with guidance and tools to track and address  hate crimes and hate incidents.   I am grateful for the bipartisan support, which Senator Collins and  others have brought to this bill to strengthen it. These efforts  include Senator Blumenthal's and Senator Moran's NO HATE Act, critical  legislation that will improve hate crime reporting and expand  assistance and resources for victims of hate crimes.   There is so much more we can do and should do to address the broader  issue of domestic terrorism, identified by the Director of the FBI as  one of the gravest threats to security in our country. That is why I  introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act earlier this year, and  I will continue with my efforts to send that legislation to the  President's desk.   But today, we have an opportunity to come together--Democrats and  Republicans, Americans--and support our friends, our siblings, and our  fellow Americans in the AAPI community. Millions of Americans count on  us to do that. Let's show them that we can.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, if you believe the COVID-19 Hate Crimes  Act is a good piece of legislation--and, obviously, over 90 Senators  voted to move to proceed to this bill--then you can't vote for the Lee  amendment because the first thing he does before he puts out his own  idea of what we should consider instead is to strike key sections of  the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act that require the Attorney General to issue  guidance to establish online reporting of hate crime incidents, collect  data on hate crime incidents, and expand public education in campaigns.  The Lee amendment strikes that. He doesn't want us to do that.   He wants us to assign the Attorney General the responsibility, in the  next 180 days, to survey every COVID-19 restriction in every State in  the Union.   I urge a vote against the Lee amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1425     I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) are necessarily  absent.
