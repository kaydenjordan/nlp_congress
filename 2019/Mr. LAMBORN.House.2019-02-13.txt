 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the  committee for his leadership.   I rise to speak against this resolution, which would direct the  removal of U.S. forces from Yemen. This resolution is dangerous, and  the majority should immediately take this vote off of our schedule.   The majority claims to be concerned about the threat of Iranian and  Russian influence around the world. If that were the case, they would  not force a vote on this war powers resolution.   Let's be clear: The U.S. is not involved in hostilities in Yemen, so  this resolution would set a dangerous precedent by calling into  question many security agreements we have with nations around the world  that do not involve hostilities. The Pentagon has repeatedly stated  that America is only providing support to our allies in the region as  they combat the Houthis, and everyone is trying to reduce civilian  casualties. Ultimately, we want to limit Iran's ability to gain more  influence in the region.   The Houthi rebels are just one part of the Iranian regime's proxy  battles around the world with the ultimate goal to destroy Israel,  America, and all those who share our democratic values.   Mr. Chairman, a vote for this resolution is a vote for Iran. A vote  against this resolution is a vote for Israel. I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on this dangerous resolution, and I urge the administration  to veto this resolution, if it should somehow pass.
