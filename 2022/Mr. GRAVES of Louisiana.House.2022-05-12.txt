 Mr. Speaker, last year there were over  60,000 police officers who were assaulted in the line of duty. Over  60,000 were assaulted, and 295 of those officers died. This year  already we have had over 123 police officers who have been shot.   This is National Police Week. This is the time when we need to  reflect upon the difference between total chaos in our community and  civilized order, holding people accountable for the crimes that they  commit, ensuring that we are not defunding the police but we are  lifting up the police, and that we are holding these peacekeepers and  their families in our prayers.   Mr. Speaker, on July 17 of 2016, we had five police officers in my  hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shot. Brad Garafola, Matthew  Gerald, and Montrell Jackson died that day. They died. Bruce Simmons  and Brad Montgomery were both injured.   Nick Tullier was an East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's deputy. Nick  took three bullets--one to the head, one to the chest, and one to the  abdomen. Every single medical professional--doctors, nurses, and  hospital officials--everyone said that he wasn't going to make it  through the rest of that day, July 17. Nearly 6 years later, Nick  Tullier was still fighting for his life. He sat there for 2,119 days-- 2,119 days--with his father, James, and his mother, Mary, by his side  fighting. Nick was unbelievable.   This shooting was designed to rip our community apart. It was  designed to attack law enforcement, to attack peacekeepers, and, I  think, to offend the police and to intimidate the police. It did  completely the opposite. Rather than ripping our community apart, it  brought all of us together--all of us--together. No matter political  party, race, socioeconomic situation, or neighborhood, everyone came  together in support of these officers, their families, their  departments, and what they did, their sacrifice.   These people are underpaid and overworked, and every single day when  they leave the house they kiss loved ones and they kiss dependents  because it may be the last time they come home.   Mr. Speaker, Nick Tullier didn't let the evil win. He didn't let the  bad guys win. Nick was completely a fighter. He sat there, and against  all odds he refused to let death prevail.   Mr. Speaker, Nick inspired our entire community and our State. You  saw these bracelets all over the place: ``Pray for Nick Tullier'' or  ``Nick Tullier Strong.'' Even the President signed a note to him a few  years ago. It was a rallying cry for our community.   Mr. Speaker, the numbers that we have seen this year alone in not  lifting up the police and supporting the police--supporting these  peacekeepers--but rather disrespecting them is absolutely inexcusable.   These people--I can't say it enough--put their lives on the line for  our communities so we can be safe. Nick Tullier fought, he beat that  evil, and he defied all odds. But, sadly, on Tuesday of this week, he  was buried after 6 years of fighting death, of saying no, of upholding  good, and of bringing our community together.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the amazing work of his parents again, Mary and  James Tullier, who every single day were at his side making it clear to  Nick that not just they were there for him but the entire community was  and that their boundless love for this man would be so clear to him  throughout this process. It was so clear.   I thank his sons, Trenton and Gage. I remind them their father was a  role model for our community. I say to his brothers, Jamie and Shannon,  please don't let the void that Nick's passing to the Father has  created. Do not let that become a void here on Earth. Continue his  mission, the Nick Tullier Foundation, St. Jude, and others.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to say the difference between  chaos and order is what our peacekeepers do. Underpaid,  underappreciated, and overworked, these are great people. We cannot  allow this trend of seeing an increase in shootings. There were over  60,000 attacks against our law enforcement officers last year alone. We  cannot allow this to continue.                            ____________________
