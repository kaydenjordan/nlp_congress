 Mr. Speaker, the people of America are suffering. We  have repeatedly told them that they are our priority, but the people of  America are suffering while my colleagues insist on a government  shutdown, which is what they are doing.   Blatantly they have violated the very agreement that Speaker McCarthy  and the President of the United States--two people holding the greatest  trust--agreed to to be able to go forward on a funding scheme that  would save the American people.   Yet, we stand here today where my very constituents in Houston,  Texas, are going to have the soldiers that served in our Nation's  military not paid. It is going to have $2 billion in loans to small  businesses not given. It is going to stop nearly 800,000 children from  getting nutrition. It is going to stop 456 million people from getting  housing, and yet, we are standing here stating that we are patriots?    I don't want a government shutdown. Food safety will be, in essence,  in jeopardy. Law enforcement will not be paid. These are the people who  say we are pro-law enforcement, but, yet, they will not be paid.   What goes on with the Senate? It is a bipartisan resolution that if  we vote on it today as it comes across, the government will stay open.   I support the previous question because the people of America are  suffering, and I don't expect this draconian cutting of everything,  losing salaries for the military, cutting out food benefits, cutting  Social Security payments, cutting Medicare payments, Medicaid payments,  to be our definition of individuals who are standing here working for  the American people and fellow Houstonians.   My commitment is to be here to insist that the government not close.  I don't know why a commonsense continuing resolution cannot be passed.   I do want to say that as this has been offered into the Record, the  President's statement, how can we run government if a deal that Speaker  McCarthy made with the President of the United States on behalf of the  people of this Nation cannot be kept?   As I stand here today, I want to say that people are suffering. Let  us stop their suffering and keep the government open.    Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to offer my  deepest sympathy to the people of California, her family, and the  people of this Nation on the passing of Senator Feinstein.   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious moment in history. This is a serious  moment for patriots and persons courageous enough to do the right  thing.   I started out this morning by saying it will be the American people  that will suffer, but it will be my neighbors in Houston and my fellow  Texans.   We have a solution, and I think it should be very clearly stated.  What my friends on the other side of the aisle are arguing is chaos and  confusion. They are arguing no solution. They are shouting from the top  of their lungs to be heard and to generate excitement for social media,  but we have a very calm situation.   The Senate has voted 77-19 to put forward a reasoned extension,  keeping the funding as it is, making sure our military is being paid,  not cutting off women and children from supplemental nutrition--these  are infants we are talking about--and taking care of communities, like  the firefighters in the West who are suffering after fighting fires and  other natural disasters.   They have a CR. It will come here. It has a privileged status. That  status will allow us to vote. The government will be open, and then the  engagement on issues that are in disagreement or agreement could be  worked out.   If we continue this shrill talk and don't reasonably act courageously  as patriots to be able to stop the suffering of the American people, we  will have 50,000 pounds of cocaine here because we won't have Customs  and Border officers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  additional time.   Mr. Speaker, we will have 110,000 children--where their parents are  going to work--that will have no Head Start slots; 65,000 will not have  access to childcare; 60,000 seniors will be robbed of nutrition  programs. Then we will have 2.3 million women, infants, and children,  as I said, without WIC. No educational dollars, fewer teachers, 4,000  fewer safety inspections, and we will be undermining law enforcement.   So if everyone wants to be shrill, here is a solution. Bring the  temperature down, pass the Senate CR, open the doors, and stop these  draconian cuts because you are hurting the American people and my  fellow Houstonians.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. 5525 Continuing  Appropriations and Border Security Enhancement Act, 2024.   The reckless funding proposal included in this bill would painfully  impact the lives of millions of Americans by making disastrous cuts to  programs that workers and families count on every day.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are more  focused on introducing unpopular and dangerous funding bills that cut  virtually all non-defense discretionary funding by 8 percent than  working on a bipartisan solution that could be enacted.   The Republican funding bill is a short-term radical solution and  would only keep the government open until October 31, 2023.   This deadline guarantees Congress will need to pass another  Continuing Resolution (CR) and means either House Republicans will  slash critical resources again at the end of October or the dangerous  cuts in this extreme bill will be in place until Congress is able to  pass all 12 full-year bills.   In exchange for keeping the government open, House Republicans are:   Slashing investments in the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Medical research into treatments and cures for diseases like cancer,  Alzheimer's, and heart disease would be cut with the reduction of 2,000  research grants.   Furthering their goal of eliminating public education by cutting  funding for Title I, IDEA, and Head Start. Cuts to Title I and IDEA  would be the equivalent of removing more than 40,000 teachers and  service providers from classrooms serving low-income students and  students with disabilities. And approximately 100,000 children would  lose access to Head Start, undermining early education for children in  low-income communities and parents' ability to go to work.   Failing to support communities recovering from natural disasters. In  the midst of hurricane season and with several response and recovery  efforts to major disasters underway, this bill harms FEMA's readiness  by failing to address the urgent need for additional Disaster Relief  Funds to address existing shortfalls and respond to future unknown  disasters.   Cutting border security funding. Despite claims that this bill  prioritizes border security, it does the opposite by cutting funding  critical to those operations. The bill would ensure disruption and  chaos at the border, harm our economy, empower transnational criminal  organizations, endanger communities, and put our agents' and officers'  lives at risk.   Neglecting our water infrastructure by cutting funds to the Army  Corps of Engineers. House Republicans are cutting funds to the Army  Corps of Engineers Construction activities by 21 percent. With $444  million slashed from the Corps of Engineers' Construction activities,  projects critical to waterway navigation of supply chains, reducing  flood and storm damage, or providing ecosystem restoration would  freeze.   Taking food out of the mouths of children, families, and seniors.  House Republicans are threatening food safety, raising the costs of  food, and killing jobs in rural communities by slashing the Food Safety  and Inspection Service (FSIS) by 11 percent (or $124 million).   Turning their backs on America's small businesses. The Small Business  Administration (SBA), Entrepreneurial Development Programs would be cut  by 8.1 percent. This means approximately 107,000 fewer small businesses  would be assisted. This would have a significant impact on underserved  communities such as Veterans, Women, and Native American entrepreneurs.   Slashing resources for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and Opioid  Use Disorder treatment. The Republican CR cuts funding for the 988  Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by 18 percent. Nearly 1 million people  facing a suicidal or mental health crisis would be unable to access  support services through the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, and  thousands of individuals would be denied admission to opioid use  disorder treatment, denying them a potentially life-saving path to  recovery.    Mr. Speaker, their unrealistic proposals almost guarantee that our  government will shut down tomorrow at midnight.  [[Page H4893]]    A Republican government shutdown would hurt hard working families in  Texas:   172,877 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed  forces in Texas would be forced to go without the pay they earn during  a shutdown.   The Small Business Administration would stop processing small  business loans, halting a program that provides $2,742,702,800 in  funding to small businesses in Texas every year.   176,276 people flying through Texas airports every day would face  potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA  agents and air traffic controllers.   786,686 people in Texas would soon lose access to Special  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)  benefits.   168,4l3 federal workers in Texas would be furloughed or forced to  work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with  government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their  hours cut.   Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined,  risking interruptions and delays to the 892 food safety, pharmaceutical  manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Texas last year.   The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing  housing loans, which provide $456,125,359 in funding to help 2,742  families in rural Texas communities buy homes every year.   The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm  loans which provide $209,391,000 in funding for farmers in Texas every  year.   3,291,584 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  beneficiaries in Texas would lose access to benefits in a prolonged  shutdown.   5,4l3,161 people who visit national parks in Texas every year would  be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.   State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially  risking benefits for the 20,846 TANF beneficiaries in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5525 as its  passage would be detrimental to lives of millions of Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to acknowledge our great  President Jimmy Carter and thank him for his life and service.   It is becoming that we stand on the floor today to be able to speak  in contrast to the generosity of the Carters to where we are today  because we are supposed to be saving America.   Frankly, we now have a challenge where the Republican leadership  cannot even find a way to stop the government from shutting down. I  think if the American people knew what their plan was, you might ask  the question: Is it possible to lead in this way?   Attacking the National Institutes of Health, that is what they are  doing.   They are cutting education and dollars for disabled children and  taking money away from 150,000 teachers who  [[Page H4901]]  I will be engaging with in my hometown by phone.   Of course, they are not recognizing the needs of energy support for  those low-income families and not helping those communities that are  suffering every day from natural disasters. We know the West has  suffered from fires. We in the southwest have suffered from floods.   Of course, they are disrespecting the needs of Israel and Ukraine.   This is not the American way, and now we are gone because the bill  they put up could not even get the Republican votes.   Let's do what is right for the American people. Don't shut down.  Stand up for the American people.                            ____________________
