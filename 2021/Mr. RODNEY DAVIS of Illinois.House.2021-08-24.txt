 Madam Speaker, recently, another friend  of ours and our colleague, Congressman Burgess Owens, who grew up in  the Jim Crow South, testified before my committee, and I want to  highlight two very important points he made: Not only is our country  not facing a new era of Jim Crow voting laws, as many of my Democrat  colleagues have falsely claimed, but it is incredibly offensive to lie  to the American people to further a political agenda.   Our country has come a long way since the Jim Crow era, and it is in  part because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   More Americans voted in the last two elections than in any midterm or  Presidential election in our Nation's history. This includes historic  turnouts among African Americans and other minority voters.   We should celebrate this progress, not ignore it.   Using Georgia as an example, since my friends on the other side of  the aisle were so quick to condemn new election integrity laws in this  State; in Georgia, which was once covered under the VRA's preclearance  formula, African-American turnout in the last election was 64 percent,  compared to 27 percent in 1965. And an amazing 95 percent of the total  eligible voting-age population in Georgia is registered to vote.   That is incredible. It is easier to vote in Georgia than it is in  Democrat-run States like New York and Delaware and even others.   Democrats on the Committee on House Administration held hearing after  hearing on election issues where they produced zero evidence of voter  suppression, likely due to the fact that voter discrimination and  suppression remain against the law in this country.   Yet, the bill before us goes far beyond the original VRA and would  subject every State to preclearance, an extraordinary measure  established in 1965 to prevent Democratic-led Southern States, with a  history of discrimination, from intimidating and preventing African  Americans from voting.   If you vote for this legislation, you are voting for a Federal  takeover of elections; you are removing the people elected at the State  and local level to run elections from making decisions about how  elections are run, including voter ID laws, and putting an  unaccountable, unelected election czar at the DOJ, the Attorney  General, in charge of all election decisions in this country.   Members of this body and the American people should be asking the  simple question: If it is easier to vote today than at any time in our  history and more Americans are voting than ever before, then why are  Democrats going to such extreme measures to ensure a Federal takeover  of elections?   I hope my colleagues and the American people will see this bill for  what it is, a partisan power grab which circumvents the people to  ensure a one-party rule.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a report I released as ranking  member of the House Administration Committee earlier this month titled  ``The Elections Clause: States' Primary Constitutional Authority Over  Elections.''    [From Representative Rodney Davis (IL-13), Ranking Member, House of     Representatives, Committee on House Administration, Aug. 12, 2021]  Report--The Elections Clause: States' Primary Constitutional Authority                               Over Elections                              Executive Summary         Republicans believe that every eligible voter who wants to       vote must be able to do so, and all lawful votes must be       counted according to state law. Through an examination of       history, precedent, the Framers' words, debates concerning       ratification, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution itself,       this document explains the constitutional division of power       envisioned by the Framers between the States and the federal       government with respect to election administration. Article       1, Section 4 of the Constitution explains that the States       have the primary authority over election administration, the       ``times, places, and manner of holding elections''.       Conversely, the Constitution grants the Congress a purely       secondary role to alter or create election laws only in the       extreme cases of invasion, legislative neglect, or obstinate       refusal to pass election laws. As do other aspects of our       federal system, this division of sovereignty continues to       serve to protect one of Americans' most precious freedoms,       the right to vote.        The Constitution reserves to the States the primary       authority to set election legislation and administer       elections--the ``times, places, and manner of holding of       elections''--and Congress' power in this space is purely       secondary to the States' power. Congress' power is to be       employed only in the direst of circumstances. Despite       Democrats' insistence that Congress' power over elections is       unfettered and permits Congress to enact sweeping legislation       like H.R. 1, it is simply not true. History, precedent, the       Framers' words, debates concerning ratification, the Supreme       Court, and the Constitution itself make this exceedingly       clear.        The Framing Generation grappled with the failure of the       Articles of Confederation, which provided for only a weak       national government incapable of preserving the Union. Under       the Articles, the States had exclusive authority over federal       elections held within their territory; but, given the       difficulties the national government had experienced with       State cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode Island to send       delegates to the Confederation Congress), the Federalists,       including Alexander Hamilton, were concerned with the       possibility that the States, in an effort to destroy the       federal government, simply might not hold elections or that       an emergency, such as an invasion or insurrection, might       prevent the operation of a State's government, leaving the       Congress without Members and the federal government unable to       respond. Indeed, as counsel for the Democrat Members of our       Committee so keenly observed:         For the Founders, particularly during the Federal       Constitutional Convention, the primary concern was informing       the discussions of federal elections in Article I was the       risk of uncooperative states. For example, Alexander Hamilton       noted that by providing states the authority to run       congressional elections, under Article I, Section 4,       ``risk[ed] `leaving the existence of the Union entirely at       their mercy.' '' Following the failings of the Articles of       Confederation, the Founders looked for processes that would       insulate Congress from recalcitrant states. Indeed, ``[t]he       dominant purpose of the Elections Clause, the historical       record bears out, was to empower Congress to override state       election rules, not to restrict the way States enact       legislation[,]'' and that ``the Clause `was the Framers'       insurance against the possibility that a State would refuse       to provide for the election of representatives to the Federal       Congress.' ''         Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a leading Federalist and       proponent of our Constitution, understood the Elections       Clause as serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, not       as a cudgel used to nationalize our elections process.       Writing as Publius to the people of New York, Hamilton       further expounds on the correct understanding of the       Elections Clause: ``T[he] natural order of the subject leads       us to consider, in this place, that provision of the       Constitution which authorizes the national legislature to       regulate, in the last resort, the election of its own       members.''        When questioned at the States' constitutional ratifying       conventions with respect to this provision, the Federalists       confirmed this understanding of a constitutionally limited,       secondary congressional power under Article 1, Section 4:        Maryland: ``[C]onvention delegate James McHenry added that       the risk to the federal government [without a fail-safe       provision] might not arise from state malice: An insurrection       or rebellion might prevent a state legislature from       administering an election.''        N. Carolina: ``An occasion may arise when the exercise of       this ultimate power of Congress may be necessary . . . if a       state should be involved in war, and its legislature could       not assemble, (as was the case of South Carolina and       occasionally of some other states, during the [Revolutionary]       war).''        Pennsylvania: ``Sir, let it be remembered that this power       can only operate in a case of necessity, after the factious       or listless disposition of a particular state has rendered an       interference essential to the salvation of the general       government.''        John Jay made similar claims in New York. And, as       constitutional scholar Robert Natelson, notes in his       invaluable article, The Original Scope of the Congressional       Power to  [[Page H4393]]       Regulate Elections, Alexander Contee Hanson, a member of       Congress whose pamphlet supporting the Constitution proved       popular, stated flatly that Congress would exercise its       times, places, and manner authority only in cases of       invasion, legislative neglect or obstinate refusal to pass       election laws [providing for the election of Members of       Congress], or if a state crafted its election laws with a       `sinister purpose' or to injure the general government.''        Cementing his point, Hanson goes further to decree, ``The       exercise of this power must at all times be so very       invidious, that congress will not venture upon it without       some very cogent and substantial reason.'' In Floor debate       during the 117th Congress concerning H.R. 1, the Democrats'       intended nationalization of elections, Ranking Member Davis       argued, as he has many other times, that:         According to Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution,       States have the primary role in establishing ``[t]he Times,       Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and       Representatives.'' Under the Constitution, Congress has a       purely secondary role in this space and must restrain itself       from acting improperly and unconstitutionally. Federal       election legislation should never be the first step and must       never impose burdensome, unfunded federal mandates on state       and local elections officials. When Congress does speak, it       must devote its efforts only to resolving highly significant       and substantial deficiencies. State legislatures are the       primary venues to correct most issues.         In fact, had the Democrats' view of the Elections Clause       been accepted at the time of the Constitution's drafting--      that is, that it offers Congress unfettered power over       federal elections--it is likely that the Constitution would       not have been ratified or that an amendment to this language       would have been required. Indeed, at least seven of the       original 13 states--over half and enough to prevent the       Constitution from being ratified--expressed specific concerns       with the language of the Elections Clause. However,       ``[l]eading Federalists . . .'' assured them, ``. . . that,       even without amendment, the [Elections] Clause should be       construed as limited to emergencies.''        Three states, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island,       specifically made their ratification contingent on this       understanding being made express:        New York: ``Under these impressions and declaring that the       rights aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and the       Explanations aforesaid are consistent with the said       Constitution, And in confidence that the Amendments which       have been proposed to the said Constitution will receive       early and mature Consideration: We the said Delegates, in the       Name and in [sic] the behalf of the People of the State of       New York Do by these presents Assent to and Ratify the said       Constitution. In full Confidence . . . that the Congress will       not make or alter any Regulation in this State respecting the       times places and manner of holding Elections for Senators or       Representatives unless the Legislature of this State shall       neglect or refuse to make laws or regulations for the       purpose, or from any circumstance be incapable of making the       same, and that in those cases such power will only be       exercised until the Legislature of this State shall make       provision in the Premises[.]''        N. Carolina: ``That Congress shall not alter, modify, or       interfere in the times, places, or manner of holding       elections for senators and representatives, or either of       them, except when the legislature of any state shall neglect,       refuse or be disabled by invasion or rebellion, to prescribe       the same.''        Rhode Island: ``Under these impressions, and declaring,       that the rights aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and       that the explanations aforesaid, are consistent with the said       constitution, and in confidence that the amendments hereafter       mentioned, will receive an early and mature consideration,       and conformably to the fifth article of said constitution,       speedily become a part thereof; We the said delegates, in the       name, and in [sic] the behalf of the People, of the State of       Rhode-Island and Providence-Plantations, do by these       Presents, assent to, and ratify the said Constitution. In       full confidence . . . That the Congress will not make or       alter any regulation in this State, respecting the times,       places and manner of holding elections for senators and       representatives, unless the legislature of this state shall       neglect, or refuse to make laws or regulations for the       purpose, or from any circumstance be incapable of making the       same; and that [i]n those cases, such power will only be       exercised, until the legislature of this State shall make       provision in the Premises[.]        This clearly demonstrates that the Framers designed and the       ratifying States understood the Elections Clause to serve       solely as a protective backstop to ensure the preservation of       the Federal Government, not as a font of limitless power for       Congress to wrest control of federal elections from the       States.        This understanding was also reinforced by debate during the       first Congress that convened under the Constitution. ``During       the first session of the First Congress . . . Representative       Aedanus Burke unsuccessfully proposed a constitutional       amendment to limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause to       emergencies.'' But those on both sides of the Burke amendment       debate already understood the Elections Clause to limit       Federal elections power to emergencies.        For example, the recorded description of opponent       Representative Goodhue's comments notes that he believed the       Elections Clause as written was intended to prevent ``. . .       the State Governments [from] oppos[ing] and thwart[ing] the       general one to such a degree as finally to overturn it. Now,       to guard against this evil, he wished the Federal Government       to possess every power necessary to its existence.'' With any       change to the original text therefore unnecessary to achieve       Burke's desired goal, Mr. Goodhue voted against the proposed       amendment.        Similarly, proponent Representative Smith of South Carolina       also believed the original text of the Elections Clause       already limited the Federal Government's power over federal       elections to emergencies and so thought there would be no       harm in supporting an amendment to make that language       express. So, even the records of the First Congress reflect a       recognition of the emergency nature of congressional power       over federal elections.        Similarly, the Supreme Court has supported this       understanding. In Smiley v. Holm, the Court held that Article       1, Section 4 of the Constitution reserved to the States the       primary        ``. . . authority to provide a complete code for       congressional elections, not only as to times and places, but       in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting,       protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt       practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and       canvassers, and making and publication of election returns;       in short, to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure       and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order       to enforce the fundamental right involved. And these       requirements would be nugatory if they did not have       appropriate sanctions in the definition of offenses and       punishments. All this is comprised in the subject of ``times,       places and manner of holding elections,'' and involves       lawmaking in its essential features and most important       aspect.''        This holding, of course, is consistent with the       understanding of the Elections Clause since the framing of       the Constitution. The Smiley Court also held that while       Congress maintains the authority to ``. . . supplement these       state regulations or [to] substitute its own[ ]'', such       authority remains merely ``a general supervisory power over       the whole subject.'' More recently, the Court noted in       Arizona v. Inter-Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. that ``[t]his       grant of congressional power [that is, the fail-safe       provision in the Elections Clause] was the Framers' insurance       against the possibility that a State would refuse to provide       for the election of representatives to the Federal       Congress.'' The Court explained that the Elections Clause ``.       . . imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . to prescribe the       time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and       Senators[.]'' And, while, as the Court noted, ``[t]he power       of Congress over the `Times, Places and Manner' of       congressional elections `is paramount, and may be exercised       at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and       so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations       effected supersede those of the State which are inconsistent       therewith[ ]'', the Inter-Tribal Court explained, quoting       extensively from The Federalist no. 59, that it was clear       that the congressional fail-safe included in the Elections       Clause was intended for the sorts of governmental self-      preservation discussed in this Report: ``[E]very government       ought to contain in itself the means of its own       preservation[.]''; ``[A]n exclusive power of regulating       elections for the national government, in the hands of the       State legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union       entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate       it by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to       administer its affairs.''                                  Conclusion         It is clear in every respect that the congressional fail-      safe described in the Elections Clause vests purely secondary       authority over federal elections in the federal legislative       branch and that the primary authority rests with the States.       Congressional authority is intended to be, and as a matter of       constitutional fact is, limited to addressing the worst       imaginable issues, such as invasion or other matters that       might lead to a State not electing representatives to       constitute the two Houses of Congress.'' Our authority has       never extended to the day-to-day authority over the ``Times,       Places and Manner of Election'' that the Constitution clearly       reserves to the States. Unfortunately for Democrats, this       clear restriction on congressional authority means that we do       not have the power to implement the overwhelming majority--if       not the entirety--of their biggest legislative priority, H.R.       1 and related legislation, which would purport to nationalize       our elections and centralize their administration in       Washington, D.C. Thankfully, the Framers had the foresight to       write our Constitution so as to prevent those bad policies       from going into effect and preserve the health of our       republic.    Madam Speaker, I have a joint report  from the Committee on House Administration and the Committee on the  Judiciary Republicans titled ``An Unprecedented and Unconstitutional  Power Grab: How Democrats are Abusing the Constitution to Nationalize  Elections.''    Madam Speaker, I have the Census Bureau  report detailing record turnout in 2020; the Election Integrity Network  H.R. 4 fact sheet; the Honest Election Project analysis titled ``H.R. 4  Legal and Constitutional Challenges''; the Independent Women's Forum  analysis titled ``D.C. Bureaucrats and Judges Will Steal the Pen in  Drawing Voting Districts''; and also the Foundation for Government  Accountability analysis titled ``H.R. 4 Isn't Voting Progress. It is a  Power Grab.''    Madam Speaker, I have the following  reports: an analysis of H.R. 4 titled ``How H.R. 4 Would Let Leftist  Extremists Control the Entire Nation's Elections''; the Lawyers  Democracy Fund H.R. 4 analysis; a RealClear Politics article titled  ``'Jim Crow 2.0' Is Imaginary''; a letter opposing H.R. 4 from the  Independent Women's Forum and others; a Heritage analysis titled  ``Another Bill in Congress to Give Partisan Bureaucrats Control Over  State Election Laws''; and lastly, the Honest Elections Project Action  analysis titled ``H.R. 4: The Nancy Pelosi Power Grab.''     Madam Speaker, a foundational  dependency of any democracy sustaining is its citizens having  confidence in the outcome of its elections. Simply put, if people don't  have faith in elections, democracy doesn't work.   According to a recent Gallup poll, America's confidence in our  elections has decreased by 20 percent since 2009. Ensuring that our  elections are run in a way that makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat  increases confidence. A common best practice to ensure election  integrity are voter IDs, a way for people to prove they are who they  say they are.   For Democrats to equate this with the poll taxes of the early 20th  century is a ludicrous, false equivalency. According to the Honest  Elections Project, 77 percent of all Americans support voter ID  requirements, including 75 percent of independents, 64 percent of  African Americans, and 76 percent of low-income voters.   Knowing that, what does the majority do? They include language in  H.R. 4 that would restrict commonsense voter ID requirements and  require the judicial branch to consider voter ID laws as evidence of  voter suppression, and by extension, racism. That doesn't restore faith  in elections.   H.R. 4, as introduced, would require preapproval by an unaccountable  election czar in the Biden DOJ before any State or locality under  preclearance could enact popular, commonsense voter ID laws. H.R. 4  goes even further, requiring almost a dozen States to have their  existing voter ID laws examined by the Biden DOJ before they can  continue to be enforced.    These are the same election integrity laws that have been in place  for years. This is a partisan power grab of maintaining control.   Madam Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct  the Committee on the Judiciary to consider my amendment to H.R. 4 to  strike from the bill the provisions that penalize State and local  governments who implement commonsense voter ID requirements.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  Michael DeMichael of my hometown of Taylorville, Illinois, who passed  away on August 17 at the age of 69.   Mike was a true lover of sports, especially when it came to coaching.  He began as the coach of the seventh grade Terriers basketball team.  His coaching career lasted over 20 years, taking teams to the State  tournament on four occasions. He loved the game, but his true passion  was caring for the kids he coached throughout the years.   Mike gave back to our community in many ways. He was a member of St.  Mary's Catholic Church, the Knights of Columbus, and the Moose Lodge.  He was a founding member of the Sertoma Club, the Taylorville Public  Schools Foundation, and the Lakeshore Golf Course improvement  committee. He was also a member of the Taylorville Junior High Terriers  Sports Boosters, the High School Band Boosters, and the Tornado Open.   His passing is a loss for our Taylorville community and everyone who  had the pleasure of knowing him. Shannon and I send our thoughts and  prayers to his wife, Karen; his children, Brent and Susie; his  grandchildren, Hudson, Hayden, Peyton, and Brayden; his brother, Tony;  his sister, Patricia; and the rest of his family.   May my friend Mike rest in peace.                            ____________________
