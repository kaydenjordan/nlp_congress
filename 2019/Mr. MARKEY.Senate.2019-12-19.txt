 Mr. President, thank you. This is a big day for consumers  in the United States, and I want to begin first by thanking my friend,  Senator Thune, for his tremendous partnership on this legislation and  the issue that we are discussing today, robocalls. That is because  there are no blue robocalls. There are no red robocalls. There are only  despised robocalls. That is what is bringing this Chamber together  today. So I thank Senator Thune for his great leadership.   I thank Senator Wicker and Senator Cantwell for helping us to  navigate this political pathway. Today is a big day. The daily deluge  of robocalls that Americans experience is more than a nuisance in 2019.  It is a consumer protection crisis. Today, the U.S. Senate is sending  Americans a holiday gift on everyone's list: stopping the plague of  robocalls. Americans across the country face an epidemic of illegal and  fraudulent robocalls bombarding their phones.   While their telephones were once a reliable means of communications,  they have been turned against us. They are now mechanisms for scammers  and fraudsters who wish to cheat and to defraud. The numbers are  staggering. In 2019, consumers have received an estimated 54 billion  robocalls. That is 6 billion more than 2018, and we still have 2 more  weeks to go. The year isn't even over. In November alone, an estimated  5 billion robocalls were made to Americans. That is 167 million  robocalls per day. That is 7 million robocalls an hour. That is 2,000  every second in our country. In the time it takes me to make these  remarks, 10,000 robocalls will have been placed across this country.   In 2019, already almost 600 million robocalls have been placed to my  constituents in Massachusetts. Enough is enough. The reality is that we  no longer have confidence in our phones. Our phones have become tools  for fraud, for scams, for harassment mechanisms by which those with bad  intent can access our homes, our purses, or even our pockets at any  time. Caller ID is not trusted. Important calls go unanswered. Innocent  Americans are defrauded. Our seniors in particular are targeted.   Years ago, scammers needed expensive, sophisticated equipment to  robocall and robotext consumers en masse. Today, they just need a  smartphone to target thousands of phones an hour at relatively little  expense, and readily available software permits them to spoof their  numbers, which means their true caller ID is, in fact, concealed from  the person picking up the phone. These new technologies allow illegal  robocalls to conduct fraud anonymously, both depriving Federal  regulators and consumers the ability to identify and to punish the  culprit.   Today, the U.S. Senate is putting robocall relief in sight. I have  been proud again to partner with Senator Thune on the Telephone  Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, or TRACED Act  for short. We introduced it earlier this year; today is the culmination  of that work in partnership with the House of Representatives. Stopping  robocalls requires a simple formula, which we have included in the  TRACED Act: 1, authentication; 2, blocking; 3, enforcement.   First, this bill requires carriers to adopt call authentication  technologies so they can verify that incoming calls are legitimate  before they reach consumers phones. This will be mandatory for phone  carriers. Second, the Federal Communications Commission will require  phone companies to block unverified calls at no charge to consumers.  Third, we will increase from 1 year to 4 years the time for the Federal  Communications Commission to pursue penalties for robocallers that  intentionally violate the rules. This is a recipe for success. That is  what our TRACED Act does.   At the same time, this bill also ensures that emergency public safety  calls still go through. The bill we will vote on today has enormous  support across the country: 54 State and Territory attorneys general,  all commissioners at the Federal Communications Commission, and the  Federal Trade Commission. Major industry associations and meeting  consumer groups endorse the legislation and agree that the TRACED Act  is an essential weapon in combating the rise of illegal, fraudulent  robocalls.   This robocall legislation is a political Halley's Comet. It is  something we can all gather around and learn from. The robocalls we  receive every day are neither Democrat, nor Republican. They are a  universal menace. They impact the elderly, the young, the small  business owner, and the student. Our grandparents and neighbors, our  teachers and our coworkers today, no one is spared from this consumer  protection pandemic.   Senator Thune and my efforts would not have been possible without the  great work of groups like the National Consumer Law Center, AARP,  Consumer Reports, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Action, the  National Association of Attorneys General, USTelecom, CTIA, NTCA, and  so many more groups. These groups join the chorus of countless  Americans who raised their voices and called on Congress to pass this  bipartisan commonsense legislation, and we thank you.   What I would like to do, as well as Senator Thune, is to thank my  staff, Joey Wender, who is sitting out here on the floor with me right  now; and Bennett Butler, right over my shoulder; and Daniel Greene, who  worked on it; for Alex Sachtjen, Daniel Ball, Olivia Trusty, Nick  Rossi, Crystal Tully, from the majority staff, all partnered to make  today possible. I just want to say, again, we can't thank Alex Sachtjen  enough for all the work that was done.   I thank Senator Thune, and I thank the entire Senate for their  support for this legislation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this month we recognize the 100th  anniversary of the founding of the American Meteorological Society,  AMS, which spent the last century advancing the atmospheric and related  sciences. The work of AMS contributed to technologies and services that  expand our understanding of the world and the risks associated with our  water, weather, and climate.   AMS was founded in 1919 in Milton, MA, to advance, promote, and  disseminate information about these important sciences. The society now  has over 13,000 members, including researchers, educators, students,  enthusiasts, broadcasters, and other professionals in weather, water,  and climate. Its rigorously peer-reviewed scientific publications and  scientific conferences have contributed to knowledge growth across the  geosciences, especially in the prediction of environmental phenomena  that has led to lifesaving services. AMS also offers nationally  recognized certifications that serve the public's need to identify  broadcast and consulting meteorologists who have achieved a high level  of competency in communicating complex weather, water, and climate  information.   AMS has been a leader in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion  in the science, technology, engineering, and math STEM fields. Its  activities in support of STEM education and development activities for  K-12 teachers have positively impacted millions of students nationwide.  Its leadership in education also brings AMS to the Halls of Congress,  where the society supports congressional fellows, research studies on  environmental policy, and policy briefings to ensure that policies are  developed using the best available knowledge and understanding.   AMS has also been crucial in developing the extensive scientific  evidence of manmade climate change and has helped us understand the  threat it poses to society if we do not act. AMS has been an  international leader in providing peer-reviewed information to support  evidence-based decision making related to climate change. Congress owes  a debt of gratitude to AMS for its advocacy and education on this  global threat.   With the scope and size of the challenge that climate change  presents, Congress and the American people will undoubtedly depend on  another successful century of leadership and scientific advancements  from the American Meteorological Society. We congratulate and thank AMS  for its century-long effort to understand the natural world, and we  pledge our continued support to the important sciences AMS aims to  advance.                            ____________________
