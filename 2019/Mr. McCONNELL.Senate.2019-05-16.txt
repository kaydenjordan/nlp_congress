 Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm  Kenneth Lee of California to serve as a U.S. circuit court judge for  the Ninth Circuit. Yet another well-qualified nominee will now bring  impressive legal experience and fine academic credentials to the job of  upholding the rule of law as a Federal judge.   Mr. Lee is far from the only nominee to an important position whom  the Senate confirmed this week.   On Tuesday we confirmed Michael Truncale of Texas to the Federal  bench in the Eastern District of Texas, and today we will consider  three more of the President's abundantly qualified picks to fill  vacancies in the executive branch and in the judiciary.   First, we will vote on Wendy Vitter of Louisiana, who has been  nominated to be a U.S. district court judge for the Eastern District of  Louisiana. Ms. Vitter's impressive legal career includes experience in  private practice and a decade in the Orleans Parish District Attorney's  Office, where she handled more than 100 felony jury trials. Ms. Vitter  has been favorably reported twice by our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee. I would urge every one of our colleagues to vote to confirm  her today.   Following the Vitter nomination, we will turn to Brian Bulatao,  nominated to serve as Under Secretary of State for Management. As I  have mentioned, the job description is essentially that of chief  operating officer at the State Department, ensuring that tens of  thousands of diplomats, civil servants, and staff are provided for and  a host of important missions around the world can actually be carried  out.   Fortunately, we have a strong nominee who is up to the task. Mr.  Bulatao is a graduate of West Point and Harvard Business School. After  service in the Army, he founded a business and worked in financial  management before entering public service as chief operating officer at  the CIA.   In Chairman Risch's assessment, he is ``eminently qualified.'' Our  colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee certainly agree, having  favorably reported his nomination with no opposition.   It has been 11 long months since the Senate first received his  nomination--11 months. I am glad that today we will finally be able to  put partisan delay behind us and get the nominee confirmed.   Finally, the Senate will vote today on the nomination of Jeffrey  Rosen to serve as Deputy Attorney General. As I have discussed earlier  in the week, the President has chosen a nominee with a rock-solid legal  reputation who served with distinction as the Deputy Secretary of  Transportation and who would be a clear asset to the Department of  Justice and to the Nation in this new capacity.   So I would urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm each of  these three well-qualified nominees for Federal service.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, this week I have  been discussing the stark contrast between the remarkable opportunity  economy that Republican policies have helped to unlock for the middle  class and my Democratic colleagues' hard turn toward far-left ideas  that would stifle all the progress. Our colleagues across the aisle,  particularly over in the House, have given top billing to the  legislation that would end Medicare as seniors know it, eliminate every  private healthcare plan American families have chosen to meet their  needs, and replace all of it--all of it--with a one-size-fits-all,  government-run insurance system while piling heavy taxes on the middle  class. And, of course, they have touted a proposal to drop an anvil--an  anvil--on a high-speed U.S. economy and shove a host of new Federal  rules between American citizens and their everyday life choices--all in  the name of going ``green.''   Now, most of my colleagues across the aisle know full well what would  happen if the supposed Green New Deal actually became reality. They  know what winding down our affordable forms of domestic energy and the  millions of jobs that support their production would do to a U.S.  economy that is currently firing on all cylinders. They know what  turning families' own choices about where to live, what to drive, and  how to make a living into Washington, DC's official business would mean  for the historic levels of job opportunities and the wage growth that  we have seen over the past 2 years. All of that would come to a  screeching halt.   Remember, our Democratic colleagues tried to claim this outlandish  proposal--this truly outlandish proposal--was just a conversation  starter from the farthest left fringes. But, then, push came to shove.  Then, the  [[Page S2896]]  American people really saw the score because we brought the thing up  for a vote. Right here on this floor we had the vote, and only 4 out of  47 Senate Democrats actually voted no. Only 4 of the 47 voted against  this plan to bring our economy to a screeching halt. Forty-three of our  Democratic colleagues couldn't bring themselves--couldn't bring  themselves--to vote even against this--not even as Republican policies,  taking the exact opposite approach, have helped the U.S. job market to  drive unemployment lower than it has been in half a century--lower than  it has been in half a century. They want to bring all of that to a  screeching halt--not even as 19 different States have hit new record  low State unemployment rates in just the year and a half since  Republicans passed comprehensive tax reform.   Well, I have good news for the American people. This Republican  majority is going to keep fighting for you. We will not let these far- left dreams get in the way of more progress for middle-class families.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
