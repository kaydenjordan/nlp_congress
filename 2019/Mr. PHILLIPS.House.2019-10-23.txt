 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, people in small towns and cities in my home State of  Minnesota and in neighborhoods all across the Nation are being targeted  for manipulation.                                time  1530    Foreign governments have found a weakness in our national security.  They are exploiting it by using social media platforms to influence  Americans, with the hope that they will vote for foreign interests, not  American interests.   Democrats and Republicans need to come together now--today--to do  something about it. It is what our Founders--Washington, Adams,  Jefferson, Madison, and others--would have demanded.   That is why I am proud to support the SHIELD Act, an important  legislative package that includes my bill, the Firewall Act, that  simply prevents foreign nationals from paying for online political  advertisements, something to which my distinguished colleague from  Illinois referred to just moments ago.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this historic and  necessary package and help us build a wall, a digital wall, to protect  Americans from foreign interference in our elections.
