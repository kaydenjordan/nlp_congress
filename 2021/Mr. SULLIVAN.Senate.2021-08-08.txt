 Madam President, I want to thank Senator Portman for  his outstanding work, all the great work that he is doing on this bill  with Senator Sinema and others, and I am hopeful that we can get some  of these amendments--bipartisan amendments--on the infrastructure bill  onto the floor.   I know my colleague Senator Hagerty is going to work on that here in  a minute. I support what he is trying to do.   I have an amendment, for example, that is very bipartisan and would  help all the Tribes in America--Alaska Native Tribes, lower 48 Tribes-- to simply get the authority to extend the spending of their original  CARES Act money that they got in March of 2020.   They just got authority to actually start spending it. All we want to  do is extend the deadline. No additional money for anybody. I think  every Senator here supports it.   These are some of the bipartisan amendments that we are debating,  and, hopefully, we are going to get votes on these because whether you  are going to be for the bill or against the bill, I think most of us  would agree they are going to improve the bill. My amendment would. But  I know a bunch of amendments--Senator Cornyn has one that I am  supportive of and cosponsoring. So there are a number of amendments  that we hope we can get and debate here on the floor.   But, as you know, the Senate has a lot of other work besides just  this, and I just want to talk a little bit about that work that is  going on. Right now, we are going to turn to the Senate majority  leader, Senator Schumer. After this debate, he is going to want to turn  to a completely different bill, and that is the $3.5-trillion partisan  tax-and-spend spree that is just completely inappropriate right now for  our country, especially after the Democrats finished up a partisan bill  in February of $2 trillion.   This is a reckless amount of spending that they are looking at doing,  and I am pretty sure some of my colleagues know that. But part of what  is going on here is a hijacking of the Democratic Party by the far  left. You have seen that in a whole host of areas.                                 Nominations    Let me give one other area that is really important, from the  Senate's perspective, where that is starting to happen, and that is on  nominees. I have been coming down to the floor to talk about nominees,  where we have an advice and consent role as U.S. Senators. One in  particular is being put up for a position for the Bureau of Land  Management, which has enormous power over my State and my  constituents--enormous. And yet, somehow, the President of the United  States has decided to put forward someone who is not just an extremist  but a violent extremist, a former ecoterrorist, named Tracy Stone- Manning, to be the head of the Bureau of Land Management.   I have been coming down to the floor and speaking out against this.  This nominee clearly undertook activities as part of a group called  Earth First!--tree spiking, they call it, that is actually meant to  harm Americans who are legally harvesting logs and timber. This is  unbelievable that we are actually even debating this nominee.   Now, some of my colleagues said: Well, that was a while ago; she is  sorry about that.   But then she came before the Senate and didn't tell the truth to  Senators. That should be No. 2--strike two, you are out.   But here is strike three, and this just happened. Her husband, in a  Harper's Magazine--I guess he is some sort of far-left radical, too-- said that firefighters who are trying to put out fires in national  forests should just let the  [[Page S6043]]  homes built there burn to the ground--burn to the ground. Ten months  ago, she applauded her husband's views on that. The person who looks  like they are going to be BLM manager is saying that if there is a fire  in, say, a national forest in Alaska and you have a cabin there: ``Let  the fire burn the cabin down.'' I mean, this is outrageous. It was just  10 months ago. It is disturbing. And, again, I ask that the President  pull that nominee.   I would also request that another nominee--here we go again--who has  been put forward by the Biden administration should also be withdrawn.  And I think some of even my Democratic colleagues have concerns about  Mr. David Chipman to head up the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives, ATF. He is another extreme activist, this time against  the Second Amendment and Second Amendment rights. He will be in charge  of an Agency, if confirmed, that is actually in charge of law  enforcement with regard to firearms.   As the senior Senator from Iowa so aptly put it, many see putting a  committed gun control proponent like David Chipman in charge of the ATF  like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health  and Human Services, or Antifa in charge of the Portland police  department.   Well said, Senator Grassley. I agree 100 percent with you. Count me  in and the vast majority of my constituents in Alaska for feeling the  same way.   I want to talk briefly about why I feel so strongly about this  nominee and am coming down to speak out against this nominee as well.   The Second Amendment is not some lower class constitutional right. It  is the Second Amendment to the Constitution. In my office, I actually  have the Bill of Rights emblazoned on the wall of my office--every word  of it--to remind me, and others who come there, just how important this  is for our country. If my colleagues believed that the Second Amendment  was as important as other amendments--freedom of speech, the right to a  jury trial, protections against search and seizures--they wouldn't be  supporting Mr. Chipman as head of ATF, the law enforcement Agency  tasked with enforcing our Nation's firearm laws. They just wouldn't.   Let me talk a little bit about his background. I respect Mr.  Chipman's 25 years as an ATF agent, but when he left government, he has  spent his time working as a gun control advocate and is well-known for  his views--extreme views--on restricting the Second Amendment.   For instance, on an online site in 2019, he said the following, which  is remarkable:         While at ATF I conducted studies involving people who       failed background checks to determine how many later       committed crimes with a gun--many did.    I am still quoting him.         This is a perfect opportunity to arrest people before       committing crimes rather than responding after the fact.    Let that one sink in.   Has anyone here seen the movie ``Minority Report,'' with Tom Cruise?  That is actually what that movie was about: Let's arrest people before  they commit a crime.   He has actually advocated arresting people who failed background  checks. This is extreme, to say the least.   And it is, apparently, not only the Second Amendment that he wants to  do away with. In his recent confirmation hearing, he appeared to want  to ban all rifles larger than a .22-caliber rifle. He couldn't define  what constitutes a so-called assault rifle. But good luck protecting  yourself in the Alaska wilderness with a .22.    He also called for more burdensome regulations on popular sporting  rifles under the National Firearms Control Act. And in his work  restricting the Second Amendment, he has lobbied Congress for universal  background checks and instituting age-based gun bans, which would  definitely not work in my State, and wanting to establish a national  firearms transfer delay period.   Not only is he hostile to Second Amendment rights, but, remarkably,  the person they want to put in charge of firearms is condescending to  the people in America who actually own them, as so many on the far left  are, especially first-time gun owners.   In an interview in April 2020, during the height of the pandemic,  when it started, he mocked first-time gun owners who were purchasing  firearms. Remember, this was a rather uncertain troubling time during  the country. And he talked about these people putting themselves and  their families in danger because they are going to go buy a firearm.   He said: First-time gun owners should put their guns away in their  cabinets behind their ``beef jerky and cans of tuna'' that they had  presumably been saving for the apocalypse and only take out the weapons  when ``the zombies start to appear.''   This is the guy the President has put forward to be in charge of  firearm laws. I guess he thought he was being clever in the same way  that former President Obama thought he was being wise when he spoke on  high about people in rural States clinging to their guns and their  religion. But most of us don't find this funny, especially my  constituents.   In Alaska, we take our gun rights very seriously. We need firearms to  put food on the table, to defend ourselves in the wild--rural, urban,  Native, non-Native, all races, all income levels. Responsible gun  ownership is part of the fabric of my State; so is valuing our  constitutional right, especially our Second Amendment.   We understand these rights form the foundation of our democracy, and  when these rights begin to erode, when people in power pick and choose  at will which rights of our Bill of Rights they want to protect and  enforce, our democracy erodes with it.   My constituents in Alaska do not think Mr. Chipman is remotely  qualified. And, by the way, I am starting to hear that it is not just  Republicans who have this view, but some of my Democratic colleagues  have this view. And I hope that is true.   Further, several former ATF career officers with whom Mr. Chipman  served, sent a letter recently to the Senate saying: His strong  personal belief on firearm issues will create serious long-lasting  problems for the Bureau in the effective execution of its law  enforcement mission.   The Biden administration should withdraw his nomination, just like it  should withdraw Tracy Stone-Manning's. Our country doesn't need radical  officials in charge of very important Agencies, particularly important  for my State, who do not view the law and the Constitution in the way  they should. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle work to  defeat these nominees if and when they come for a vote in the Senate.   I yield the floor.
