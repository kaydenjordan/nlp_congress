 Mr. President, throughout my years in the Senate, I have  met with people from around the world who have been persecuted by their  own governments, but the stories I have heard from survivors and family  members of the victims of China's efforts to silence and eliminate  religious minorities continue to shock me. The Chinese Government  systematically brutalizes millions of people, including Tibetan  Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners.   Those who practice Falun Gong use meditation and are guided by a  philosophy of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, but because the  Chinese Communist Party fears any organized religion or association it  cannot control, it views this revival of traditional Chinese religion  as a threat to its survival.   Falun Gong practitioners recently marked the 20th anniversary of the  beginning of China's campaign of brutality against their community. On  July 20, 1999, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were arrested in  their homes in the middle of the night. Over the following week, as  many as 50,000 Falun Gong were reportedly detained. In the years since  that initial crackdown, the Chinese Government has relentlessly  continued its repression of Falun Gong.   Falun Gong practitioners have been arrested, interred at reeducation  camps, beaten, sleep-deprived, starved, sexually assaulted,  electrocuted, force-fed, shackled, and had their limbs slowly broken,  until they have renounced their beliefs and practices. They have been  ordered to participate in propaganda vilifying their own community.  They have had their organs harvested against their will. They have been  murdered. We will probably never know how many innocent people have  been the victims of these atrocities, since the Chinese Government  denies to the outside world that it is happening, while justifying it  to their own citizens.   The Chinese Government should immediately cease its arbitrary  detention and brutalization of Falun Gong practitioners and other  religious and ethnic minorities. It should release political prisoners  from reeducation centers, decriminalize religious and spiritual  practices, and allow international human rights groups and journalists  to interview survivors. It should commit to ending the use of torture,  organ harvesting of prisoners, and propaganda against minorities.   The plight of these people in China, the horrors of torture and  murder by the government, can seem very far away from Washington, DC,  and very far away from my State of Vermont. Yet Vermonters travel to  Washington to meet with me and my staff, urging Congress to take action  on behalf of Falun Gong. Vermonters are persistent people who rightly  refuse to let us forget about Falun Gong and the other victims of  China's repression. It is all too easy to ignore crimes against  humanity on the other side of the globe, when the victims are people we  will never meet, but Vermonters demand that we pay attention. The Falun  Gong deserve to be remembered, and they deserve the international  community's collective action.                            ____________________
