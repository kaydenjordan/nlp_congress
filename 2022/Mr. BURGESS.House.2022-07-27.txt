 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   One of the many lessons we learned during the pandemic is the ability  to take care of patients who are safely in their own homes. It was  truly a highlight.   Understanding that we will not be going back to the status quo of  2019, we must recognize how telehealth has allowed our country to take  a monumental step forward toward digitally enabled care.   Telehealth has allowed Americans to take care of immediate and  necessary health needs from their homes without the costs and health  risks that are often associated with an in-person visit. They don't  incur costs for parking. They don't have to take time off from work.  They don't have to hire a babysitter.   While I am in support of this legislation, it does not go far enough.  We do need to provide a permanent solution for Medicare providers and,  most importantly, their patients.   It is important that providers are given long-term certainty when  taking care of their Medicare patients and are technologically capable  of delivering the best care possible.   Yesterday, I introduced, along with Representatives Greg Murphy and  Yvette Herrell, H.R. 8506 to permanently extend Medicare coverage of  telehealth services for federally qualified health centers and rural  health clinics.   This important permanent extension would ensure that following the  pandemic, providers and patients continue to have access to telehealth  flexibilities, especially in rural and underserved areas. These are  arguably communities that have benefited the most from an increase in  telehealth access.   We will continue to see innovation and technology that will further  influence how we deliver care to American patients. We need to keep up  with the times. This bill is an important step, but it is not the end  of the discussion.                                time  1300
