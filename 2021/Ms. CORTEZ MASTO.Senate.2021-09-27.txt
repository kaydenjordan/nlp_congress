 Mr. President, today I am honored to  recognize Susan Meuschke, executive director of the Nevada Coalition to  End Domestic and Sexual Violence--NCEDSV--who will officially retire on  September 30, 2021.   Ms. Meuschke has been a champion for victims of domestic violence and  their families for more than three decades. Her career in advocacy and  awareness of the problem of family violence in our communities began  when she was a volunteer for the Committee to Aid Abused Women in Reno,  NV. It was there, while listening to the struggles and the courage of  those dealing with family violence, that she found her lifelong passion  for helping those in need. Ms. Meuschke then went on to work with  NCEDSV for 32 years and was instrumental in developing the organization  into a powerful force in the State of Nevada with 10 full-time staff  members, a variety of consultants, and offices in both Reno and Las  Vegas. Ms. Meuschke is also a founding member of the Nevada Domestic  Violence Prevention Council and a former member of the National  Coalition Against Domestic Violence Steering Committee. In 2019, Nevada  Governor Steve Sisolak proclaimed February 1 as a day in honor of Ms.  Meuschke, a fitting tribute for such a remarkable woman.   It has been an honor to work with Ms. Meuschke to help grow domestic  violence programs. While I was Nevada's attorney general, I worked  closely with Ms. Meuschke to ensure we passed legislation to create  dedicated funding for domestic violence programs through fees on  marriage licenses. Before her retirement, Ms. Meuschke and NCEDSV were  also working on a bill to increase statewide funding for domestic  violence services and to create funding for sexual violence services.  These efforts reflect her dedication to working across the aisle to  build a safer, more caring world for survivors of domestic and sexual  violence.   During 2020 and the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Meuschke  worked hard to ensure that Federal coronavirus relief funding delivered  to NCEDSV went to programs aimed at providing education and support to  survivors in rural communities. The funding also sought to improve the  financial independence of survivors through the Financial Empowerment  Microloan program. Ms. Meuschke was crucial in seeing that the funds  were distributed equitably to programs that would make the biggest  difference in the lives of survivors.   As Ms. Meuschke enters her retirement, I want to make sure her  decades of strong advocacy and empowerment are recognized for the  important impact they have had in the State of Nevada. First as  Nevada's attorney general and now as a U.S. Senator, I have been  fortunate to work side-by-side with Ms. Meuschke to support families  and make our communities safer. NCEDSV is not only a strong advocate  for policies that protect victims but a resource for survivors who are  looking for help. Much of its strength can be attributed to Ms.  Meuschke's leadership and her unwavering resilience and fortitude to  advocate on behalf of all survivors.                            ____________________
