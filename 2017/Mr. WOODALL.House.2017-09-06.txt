 Will the gentleman yield?    I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I was not here for opening statements. I imagine that all time was  yielded for the purpose of debate only.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think my colleague is confused about where he is  on this issue, and I don't think any amount of talking on the floor is  going to change his mind on this issue. I would say that the underlying  bill, which makes in order over 140 amendments so that we can have a  conversation about different ideas and different outcomes and lets the  people's voice be heard, is the right way to craft legislation. With  the support of this body and this bill, we will move on to that  underlying debate, and we will have that voice heard.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to thank you for that admonition.   Mr. Speaker, these are very serious issues that my friends on the  other side were trying to have a debate on the appropriations bills. My  friends have a very legitimate concern about an immigration issue,  characterized with terms like ``cruel'' and ``nasty'' and ``rotten''  and ``no courage.''   I would say to my friends we can try to belittle each other into a  compromise. I have not seen that work before. We can try to insult each  other into a solution. I have not seen that work before.   I have seen my colleagues coming down the other side of the aisle,  Mr. Speaker, one after the other to tell a compelling story about a man  or a woman they know who they believe would make an amazing United  States citizen, who they believe would add value to our communities,  and who they believe is serving admirably in our church and is working  admirably in our community. They have a story to tell, and they should  tell it.   Guess what? I have got a few of those stories to tell myself. But I  would say to my friends, I don't believe, Mr. Speaker, that the insults  and the acrimony are going to get us where any of us wants to be.   For my friends who believe differently, I would tell you I think we  have tried that path before, and it didn't take us where we want to go.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts  I am prepared to close when he is. I have no further speakers  remaining.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I fear you are going to have to use that admonition a  great deal in the coming days, and I regret that.   I regret that folks have begun to confuse civility with weakness. My  experience is, when you are strong, you don't have to insult the people  around you. When you are strong, you don't have to call folks around  you names. Civility and weakness are confused. In fact, more often than  not, there is a loss of civility when folks feel at their weakest.   My friends on the other side of the aisle right now, Mr. Speaker,  with good reason, feel very restricted. Being in the minority in the  House of Representatives is a hard place to be. For my friend from  Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, being in the minority on the Rules  Committee is among one of the hardest places to be. So I don't fault  him for his frustration one little bit. If I was in his shoes, I would  be frustrated as well.   Let me be clear: we are in this position with DACA today for one  reason and one reason only, and that is because instead of leading the  Congress and leading the Nation, President Obama chose to act alone in  a way that he knew would not be permanent.   The instability that you see today is the result of folks acting in a  way that was not stable. The confusion that you see today is the result  of an administration that committed itself to that confusion instead of  committing itself to consensus.   I have been in this Congress for 7 years, Mr. Speaker. That is 7  years. For 4 of those 7 years, the United States Senate was led by the  Democratic Party. Not once in those 7 years has an immigration bill  come to my desk from the United States. Not once. I know, as we sit  here right now, the House Judiciary Committee has acted on immigration  bill after immigration bill after immigration bill.   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker: the situation that the DREAMers find  themselves in today is the symptom of a Nation that does not have the  security of its borders. Had America had security for its borders, we  would not have allowed these families to put their children in these  positions.   Today, we have an amazing opportunity to have this debate. I tell you  that our President is in a unique position to lead us.   It frustrates me so much, Mr. Speaker, that folks want to assume the  worst about one another and that the media is all too anxious to report  the worst about one another. The President could have just canceled the  DACA program. He could have instructed DHS to start proceedings today.  He didn't. It wouldn't have been the right thing. It wouldn't have been  the prudent thing to do. He didn't do it.   What did he do?   He said: I have read this thing called the United States  Constitution. It turns out that only one group in the land has the  opportunity to write the laws. It is me and my friend from  Massachusetts. It is the majority leader from Kentucky and the minority  leader from New York across the way.   He said: Congress, there is only one way this should have even been  done. It should have been done in the Halls of Congress. That is not  the way President Obama chose to do it. He should have done better. He  didn't. We can do better. Let's do.   Now, to the sky-is-falling reports that came out one right after the  other almost with glee from the fourth estate, the President spoke  again to say: Listen, you know what? If Congress doesn't get it right,  I may have to act myself.   I hope he doesn't. I think that folks have too little confidence in  what we can do together when we set our minds to it, but we do have to  ask ourselves, watching the display here on the floor today, watching  the displays we have had here on the floor in the past: Do we have a  serious group of men and women here who want to work together on  solutions? Or do we have a group of men and women here who want to just  get the next headline, who want to just send out that next tweet, who  just want to just make that next front page story of hysteria?    I believe the former is true. I know the men and women on this floor,  Mr. Speaker, not the caricature of the men and women that you read in  the newspaper, but the real men and women on this floor, who each come  here every single day to diligently serve the almost 700,000 men and  women that they report to back home. And I am proud to do it.   I plea, Mr. Speaker, for you to use your leadership to not allow us  to devolve into the name calling and the acrimony that the fourth  estate would like to suggest characterizes this Chamber, but to lead us  to the sincere debate of caring about people, caring about the rule of  law, caring about families.   Let me just say, the best part of this job is the casework that each  one of us does back home. You all know it. People think the job happens  in Washington, D.C. It doesn't. It happens one family at a time back  home.   You have heard the comments on the floor of the House today, Mr.  Speaker. I have families in my district separated from one another. You  want to talk about uniting families? I have families separated from one  another standing in line to come to this country legally.   I ask you, Mr. Speaker: How many folks have you heard standing up for  my constituents whose families have been separated because they have  been standing in line to get here for more than a year? How many folks  have stood up for them? Not one.   What about those families standing in line 2 years, Mr. Speaker? I  have got them in my district, too.   What about those families who have been separated for 3 years and  standing in line trying to get to America the right way? Who is  standing up for them? I don't hear those calls on the floor of the  House. I have got them in my district, too.   What about 4 years, Mr. Speaker; 5 years, Mr. Speaker; 6 years, Mr.  Speaker? If you wanted to bring your adult child in from Mexico, you  had to file in the 1990s for their number to be coming up today. That  is crazy. It is crazy.   Where is the conversation about reforming the system that got us here  to begin with? I applaud my friend for trying to solve the symptom. I  beg my friend to work with me to cure the disease.   We have a President who can lead us in that direction, Mr. Speaker.  He has the credibility of being tough on borders and he has the heart  of someone who wants to keep families united. We have an opportunity,  Mr. Speaker. We can take it or we can reject it. I believe we are going  to take it.   But that is not for the business today. The business today is an  appropriations process. My friend from Massachusetts called it  unprecedented. He is right. I take no small amount of pleasure in  talking about how right he is. I have been in this body for 7 years and  we don't generally get the appropriations bills done before the end of  the year, Mr. Speaker. Deadlines don't tend to mean anything to us. We  are about to make that happen.   Mr. Speaker, 1997 was the last time Congress funded the government  ahead of schedule, before the deadline. It has taken a continuing  resolution every other year since 1997. We have an opportunity this  year to do it. I don't know if we will take it or not. I hope that we  will.   We can't solve everything every day, but we can solve something every  day. We can make something better for someone every day.   If you support this rule, we will bring to the floor four  appropriations bills and 119 amendments, give or take. We are up in the  Rules Committee right now making even more amendments in order, Mr.  Speaker, to have even more voices be heard, to have even more  opportunity to make a difference for the families that we all represent  back home.   Support this rule. Be proud of this rule. Be proud of the work the  Appropriations Committee did. Mr. Speaker, you don't hear it on the  floor of the House, but it so frustrates me. If you had been in the  Rules Committee last night, you would have seen Democrats and  Republicans sitting side by side talking about the amazing work they  did together on the appropriations  [[Page H6693]]  process in the Appropriations Committee, talking about the great  admiration and respect that they had for one another because of the  work they do together on the Appropriations Committee.   We don't hear that here on the floor of the House, and we should. We  should hear more of that. We should hear more about the good work we  are doing together. If we support this rule, Mr. Speaker, we will get a  chance not to hear about it, but to experience it, to do it.   I know my colleague from Massachusetts and I have another 6, 7, 8  hours of Rules Committee work to do together tonight. I know my  colleague is going to challenge us to do even better than what we are  doing. I am prepared to accept that challenge.   But for today, Mr. Speaker, for this moment, I urge my colleagues to  come to this floor; support this rule; move the appropriations process  forward; finish the appropriations process before the September 30  deadline; and serve your constituents back home, like I know every man  and woman in this Chamber does.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and support for the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 500 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (HR.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment to provide the  maximum flexibility to States that are being asked, under this bill, to  rescind $800 million in an obligated budget authority.   As you know, Mr. Chairman, we put money in a lot of different pots  and send it out to a lot of different places to do a whole lot of good  for a whole lot of people, but when you have a bill that is going to  ask the States to pull back some of that money, historically, we have  limited the ability of States to make those decisions.                                time  2000    With all due respect to anyone's hometown team, I will tell you no  one knows more about how to take care of the safety of the citizens of  Georgia than do the citizens of Georgia and our local elected  officials.   What this amendment would do is allow our local Departments of  Transportation, our State Department of  [[Page H7047]]  Transportation, maximum flexibility in meeting this Federal mandate to  rescind those $800 million worth of unobligated funds.   I ask my colleagues for their support in providing that maximum  flexibility, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am one of those authorizers. I sit on the Transportation Committee,  so I will make myself available to anyone who has questions about the  intent of the Transportation Committee on that measure.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for those comments.   Again, I want to provide maximum flexibility to what is a very  difficult job, and that is reclaiming those obligated funds from each  one of our districts back home. The question is: Will we trust our  local officials to make the best decisions or will we structure how  those decisions are made here? I trust our local engineers, our local  builders, and our local folks in charge of our public safety.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
