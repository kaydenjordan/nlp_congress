 Mr. President. With a growing number of older adults and  people with disabilities in the U.S., our Nation is becoming  increasingly reliant on the direct care workforce and family caregivers  who support older adults and people with disabilities. Unfortunately,  the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this need.   The direct care workforce, such as direct support workers, home care  workers, personal care workers or other paid workers who support older  adults and people with disabilities in their homes and communities, has  long experienced staffing shortages in part because of low wages and  high turnover. Currently, 4.5 million workers--including nearly 2.3  million home care workers--make up the direct care workforce, and this  industry is expected to grow by more than a million jobs by 2028, not  including the jobs that will need to be filled as existing workers  leave the field or exit the labor force. The shortage of direct care  workers often puts pressure on family caregivers. The number of  American caregivers providing unpaid caregiving has increased over the  past 5 years, and 23 percent of caregivers say that caregiving has made  their health worse.   Today, I am pleased to introduce the Supporting Our Direct Care  Workforce and Family Caregivers Act along with my colleagues Senators  Bob Casey, Maggie Hassan, Tammy Duckworth, Jack Reed, Ron Wyden,  Kirsten Gillibrand, and Jacky Rosen. Our legislation would direct the  Department of Health and Human Services, through the Administration on  Community Living (ACL), to award grants to states or other eligible  entities for initiatives to build, retain, train and educate, and  promote the direct care workforce, including self-directed workers and  direct care supervisors or managers, and to provide education and  training support for family caregivers to help ease stresses associated  with caregiving. Grants could be used for preapprenticeship and on-the- job training opportunities, apprenticeship programs, career ladders or  pathways, specializations or certification or other activities to  recruit and retain direct care professionals in the field.  Additionally, the bill creates a technical assistance center at ACL to  bolster coordination across Federal agencies, provide consultation to  States, and make policy recommendations to support the direct care  workforce and family caregivers.   The bill aligns with President Biden's American Jobs Plan, which  calls for substantial investments to meet the demand for home and  community-based services and invests in our country's care  infrastructure. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see  the Supporting Our Direct Care Workforce and Family Caregivers Act as  an opportunity to invest in the direct care workforce and family  caregivers--both critical pieces of the care team who provide support  for millions of Americans every day, ensuring they can live their lives  independently and with dignity.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina (for himself and Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 2348. A bill to establish within the Office of Entrepreneurial  Development of the Small Business Administration a training curriculum  relating to businesses owned by older individuals, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
