 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Denise  Cohen.   Denise was a loving mother of two. She worked as a property manager  in Santa Barbara, California, and always made everyone around her feel  good.   She attended the Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas with her  boyfriend, Bo, to celebrate her 56th birthday. Denise was a huge  country music fan, and she loved concerts and was a vibrant and  positive woman.   She is remembered by her son, Jeff, as a strong and beautiful person  who made a difference in the lives of the people she knew. She always  had a vibrant and positive attitude.   I would like to extend my condolences to Denise Cohen's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
