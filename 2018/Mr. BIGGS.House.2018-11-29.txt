 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the special work of  Marc Community Resources of Mesa, Arizona. Marc is a nonprofit  organization dedicated to providing education, rehabilitation, and  other social services to children and adults with physical disabilities  and developmental health challenges.   Since 1957, Marc has been committed to helping those with  disabilities live, learn, work, and play. Each year, Marc helps more  than 4,000 people overcome the limitations of their disabilities to  reach their full potential.   The challenges that the disabled face in day-to-day life are often  underappreciated, and their achievements in overcoming those challenges  are frequently overlooked.   I am sure the employees of Marc would say that it is their patients  who are the real heroes; and while they courageously battle severe  challenges, today I rise to commend the heroic efforts of Marc  Community Resources--its owners, managers, and employees--in the work  they do. I am grateful for their service to Mesa and the entire east  valley.                            ____________________
