 Madam Speaker, I rise because I love my  country, and I have great concern for where it is headed.   I am very much concerned, Madam Speaker, because I have seen, and the  multitudes have seen, photographs of children who have been separated  from their parents.   I have here one such display; a child who is separated from a parent,  a child that is distraught. And my concern emanates from the notion  that if you can tolerate this, if you can look at this, and if you have  the power to do something about it and you won't, if your heart is so  hardened that you can look at this picture of this baby and conclude  that this is just a part of a process, then that says to me I should be  concerned about the direction of my country.   We have come a long way in my lifetime. I had to drink from colored  water fountains. I had to sit in the back of the bus. I had to go to  segregated schools. I know what segregation looks like. I know what it  smells like. I have had to go to these filthy colored restrooms. I know  what it sounds like. I was called the ugly names. I know what it hurts  like when you have people who would chase you just because of who you  are.   So we have come a long way, and that concerns me because I am not  sure where this says we are going.   But I do know this: I don't want to see us go back to that dark past  because, Madam Speaker, for those who don't know, here is what it looks  like.                                time  0915    This is a picture from Little Rock, Arkansas. This is a picture of a  child merely attempting to go to school, committing no crime. This is a  picture of what hate looks like.   Children ought not be subjected to this level of hate and vitriol.  This is a past that I don't want to revisit.   For this young lady and others to get into this high school--that was  being paid for with their tax dollars, I might add--President  Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne Division of the Army. It  took the Army to integrate Central High.   It is an unpleasant thing to have to endure and to have to visit, but  for some of us, it is about more than just a process. For some of us,  it is about a way of life that we endured and that we suffered. For  some of us who have felt the sting of discrimination, this is a painful  thing to see.   For those who would say: ``Well, we will never go back there. You  will never see that again,'' well, I never thought I would see a day  when a President of the United States would ban people from the country  who happen to be of a certain religion. I never thought I would see a  day when a President of the United States would say: ``There were some  nice people'' among the bigots, the xenophobes, the White nationalists,  and the Klansmen in Charlottesville. I never thought I would see that  come from the Presidency, from the President of the United States, not  in my lifetime.   So to those who say: ``Worry not. We won't go back,'' I say: We  should be warned, and we should not allow ourselves to be deceived.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding me the time.   Madam Speaker, this bill does many things, but the one thing that it  does not do is heal the wound in the soul of America. It does not  provide a pathway for these babies to return home to their parents.   This bill is about as bad as it can get if you care about what you  see in this picture. Children should not become the tools of the trade  for politicians.   This bill will legitimize children as the tools of the trade. We  cannot pass it. We should not pass it. We must rethink what we are  doing to this country.
