 Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor of H.R. 6611 and U.S. Chair  of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD), I urge swift passage  of this legislation. H.R. 6611, introduced by Representative Bill  Keating earlier this year, would authorize the establishment of a  commemorative work in Washington, D.C. to honor the contributions of  French Diplomat Jean Monnet. I thank Congressman Keating for leading  this legislation.   Jean Monnet was a distinguished French diplomat whose efforts in the  immediate post-World War II era were instrumental in the establishment  of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was a precursor to what  eventually became the European Union (EU). Monnet is widely considered  a ``founding father'' of the EU. His vision argued that a unified and  economically integrated Europe would lead to long-term peace and  stability on the continent.   Monnet was a strong ally and partner of the United States. He spent  time in Washington, D.C. during World War II and was a strong advocate  for U.S. military assistance to the Allied countries. During his time  in Washington, Monnet lived near Rock Creek Park and frequently took  long walks in what he referred to as ``my park.'' Monnet claimed that  it was on these walks that he thought out and developed plans to  achieve lasting peace through a unified Europe.  [[Page H9676]]    With this in mind, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  that would authorize a fitting tribute to Jean Monnet, a critical  figure in European history and our Transatlantic Relationship.
