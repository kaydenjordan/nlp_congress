 Madam Speaker, I am honored to be here today to talk  about H.R. 1530, as amended, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of  2023.   We have an obligation to support our veterans who served and  sacrificed for our country. However, there is currently a lot of red  tape that prevents veterans from easily accessing the disability  benefits they have earned from the VA.   This bill takes important steps to identify and break down these  barriers in the disability exam process, ensuring our veterans receive  the highest quality care and support.   This bill would make several improvements, including clarifying  publishing requirements for disability benefits questionnaire forms on  VA's website and easing communication about the scheduling of  disability exams between contract examiners, veterans, and veterans'  representatives so that the veterans do not miss their appointments.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pappas and my colleagues,  Representatives Ciscomani and Self, for working with me to include  their respective legislation in this amendment. All of their provisions  will take steps to provide VA with the resources they need to address  the backlog of appeals, especially since the passage of the PACT Act  last year, as well as mitigate the recruiting and retention problems at  the board to get new lawyers in the door for our veterans.   I know firsthand how cumbersome the disability claims process can be,  and it is past time to modernize these efforts.   I am proud to have a bill on the floor that will make improvements  for my fellow veterans going through the VA claims process.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1530, as  amended.
