 Madam Speaker, inflation is at the highest level that we  have seen in decades and rising. The cost of buying a home is up. The  cost to fill your gas tank is up. The cost to feed your family is up.  Even the cost of buying Christmas presents for your children or  grandchildren is up.   While the pandemic certainly bears some blame, the failed policies of  the Biden administration have made things considerably worse. His  administration and his allies here in Congress have spent trillions of  dollars that we don't have, which inevitably will lead to higher taxes  and higher prices for items that hardworking Americans buy every day.   Despite the bad news nationally, one county in my congressional  district actually has good news for its residents. Warren County  Commissioners Tom Grossmann, Shannon Jones, and David Young announced  recently that they would not be collecting property taxes from their  residents this year. The commissioners are able to do this by  exercising fiscal responsibility, as we ought to do here in the House,  and putting aside money for a rainy day, rather than spending money  that they didn't have.   Kudos to the Warren County commissioners for giving their taxpayers a  little extra holiday cheer this year.                            ____________________
