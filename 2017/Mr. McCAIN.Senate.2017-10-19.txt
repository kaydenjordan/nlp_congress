 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate as in morning business.    Mr. President, I came to the floor today in support of  the budget resolution for one reason. It is because it provides the  Senate a path forward on tax reform. I strongly support this effort to  fix America's burdensome tax system. It is my hope that reform will  lead to simplifying the Tax Code, strengthening the middle class, and  ultimately boosting our economy.   Unfortunately, I cannot offer my support without reservation, so I  have come to the floor today to explain my concerns and remind my  colleagues of the important work ahead of us. Even as we support this  resolution as a means to achieve meaningful tax reform, we must  acknowledge the fact that the underlying budget contains an  insufficient level of funding for national defense. As chairman of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, my highest priority is to ensure that  our men and women serving in uniform have the training, equipment, and  resources they need to keep our Nation safe.   The Senate budget resolution will set fiscal year 2018 defense  spending at the levels dictated by the Budget Control Act cap. This  budget is $54 billion less than the President's request and $86 billion  less than this body authorized just last month in the National Defense  Authorization Act. We passed the National Defense Authorization Act by  a vote of 89 to 9, a demonstration of the overwhelming bipartisan  belief that the Budget Control Act level of defense spending is  inadequate and unacceptable.   Let be me clear. There is no BCA-level defense budget that would be  sufficient to provide our military with what they need to fulfill  current missions and prepare for future threats.   For those of us who have been paying attention, we heard the warnings  of the steady decline of our military. Time and again our senior  military and civilian defense leaders have sounded the alarm about the  dangers of the Budget  [[Page S6613]]  Control Act spending caps. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  our highest uniformed military officer, General Dunford, has warned  that if we continue on the current path, he assesses that ``within 5  years, we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we  defend the homeland, and advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance  commitments.''   Make no mistake about what that means. America's military advantage  is degrading. Without the ability to project power, the United States  will no longer be a global power. That means that we put at risk not  only our ability to secure our interests and protect our Nation but  also the unprecedented era of security and prosperity that American  global leadership has provided the world.   I might add for the benefit of my colleagues that former President  George W. Bush today gave a very strong statement emphasizing this  problem and the challenge we face. This is the strategic reality we are  facing in the next 5 years. It should not be a surprise. We have seen  the steady degradation of the military. The strain of constant  operational tempo, combined with inadequate and unstable funding has,  over the past 16 years, worn down the greatest military in the world.   Just this week, Secretary of Defense Mattis sent a letter to the  Armed Services Committee expressing his concerns with regard to the  National Defense Authorization Act that we are currently negotiating  with the House. The very first thing he said before addressing any of  the policy changes and reforms in the bill is that his primary concern  is the Budget Control Act, and we know why--because the defense  spending caps are doing such immense harms to our military. Secretary  Mattis wrote:         As I have testified before your committee, no enemy has       done more to harm the warfighting readiness of our military       than sequestration.    I will repeat that for the benefit of my colleagues.         . . . no enemy has done more to harm the warfighting       readiness of our military than sequestration. Current caps       continue to unnecessarily defer critical maintenance, limit       aviation availability, delay modernization, and strain our       men and women in uniform.    We have seen the evidence of this harm. Over the last few months  there have been a rash of training accidents, collisions, and crashes.  We are seeing the tragic accidents in the news far too often.   Seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a  containership off the coast of Japan.   A Marine KC-130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board.   An Osprey helicopter crashed off the coast of Australia and that  resulted in the deaths of three marines.   An Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five  soldiers presumed dead.   Ten sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near  Singapore.   An Army Black Hawk helicopter went down during a training mission off  the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died.   One soldier died during helicopter training at Fort Hood.   An amphibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15  Americans.   A demolition accident in Fort Bragg killed one soldier and injured  seven others.   Two Navy pilots died in a T-45 crash in Tennessee.   My friends, we are now losing more of our men and women in uniform in  totally avoidable training accidents than we are in combat. There is  plenty of blame to go around for all of these incidents, but we cannot  ignore the fact that Congress's inability to provide adequate, stable,  and predictable budgeting has contributed to the troubling state of  affairs. While increased funding is not the only answer, there is no  scenario where our military can get healthy and ready to meet the  challenges of an increasingly unstable world without additional  resources. There is broad, bipartisan agreement about that from Members  of the House of Representatives, here in the Senate, and the President.  Yet we are about to vote for a budget resolution that severely  underfunds the military because the reality is that we all know that it  would not impact the actual appropriations. To solve these problems and  to fulfill our duty to the men and women in uniform we must negotiate a  bipartisan budget agreement that will lift the caps on defense  spending. Only then can we rebuild the military, reverse the disturbing  readiness crisis, and retain our ability to project power and secure  our interests around the world.   I remind my colleagues that the fiscal year started 3 weeks ago and  that the Defense Department is currently operating under a continuing  resolution. We know the harmful effects it will have on the military.  That is why getting to work on a budget deal is so urgent. We must  delay no longer.   The budget resolution is not meant to provide that broader budget  agreement. This budget resolution is simply a means to get us to tax  reform. However, this budget resolution does represent something  extremely troubling. The Republican Party used to be unified in its  support for a strong national defense. If our leaders in Congress and  the White House don't immediately get to work negotiating a deal to  lift the defense caps and fund the military at a higher level than in  this budget resolution, I am not sure we will be able to claim that  mantle any longer.   I just want to sum up by saying that we have a problem in the  military today, and that is, whenever there are cuts in defense  spending, the first thing that goes are the easy ones--the training,  readiness, the spare parts, the flying hours. Those are the ones that  get cut first because they are the easiest. Cutting a major weapons  system or program is extremely difficult.   So now we have this list, as I just read off, of men and women  serving in the military and we are responsible, at least partially, for  their death and injury. Why? Because they are not able to be trained.  They are not able to be equipped. They are not able to be maintained,  and 60 percent of the F-18s are not able to fly. We have sailors and  airmen who are working 100-hour workweeks. We have gigantic problems  with the ability to simply operate.   Meanwhile, our adversaries are stepping up their capabilities.  Obviously, every time we turn around there is another crisis of some  kind. Look at the world 8 years ago and look at the world today. You  will find an incredible deterioration of America's position and  influence in the world. The front page of the Economist magazine this  week has a picture of the dictator of China and the title is ``The  world's most powerful man,'' and it is true.   So here we are with a budget resolution that basically has cut our  military--that is basically not funding what we need. My friends, I do  not mean to get emotional, but why should we send these young men and  women in uniform in harm's way without all they need in order to fight  and defend this Nation? Right now, they are not ready. Right now, their  planes can't fly. Right now, they are not able to operate and train.  They are not ready, and that is not just McCain's word. That is our  military leaders' words and those of some of the most respected people  in America and in the world. General Mattis, General McMaster, and  General Kelly will all tell you the same thing.   We are sending our young men and women into hazardous situations  without their being completely equipped and capable of defending  themselves. That is wrong. What greater responsibility do we have than  to the men and women who are serving us in uniform today? Four just  died in Niger. How many of the 100 Members of this body knew that we  even had an operation in Niger? I will not go into the details, in  deference to the family, but this is wrong, what we are doing. We saw  it in the 1970s, and now we are seeing it again. It was Mark Twain who  said: ``History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.'' It is  beginning to rhyme, and if we don't, with this resolution that we are  going through, increase our spending to the level as authorized by the  National Defense Authorization Act, then we will bear some  responsibility for what happens.   I yield the floor.
