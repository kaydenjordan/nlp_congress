 Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden's border policies have led to an  all-out land invasion at our southern border, which is why the Homeland  Security Committee should be investigating.   Joe Biden's border policies have led to a drug crisis and thousands  of fentanyl overdoses across our Nation--again, the jurisdiction of the  Homeland Security Committee.   Joe Biden's border policies have led to the murders of countless  Americans at the hands of illegal aliens--again, a priority for the  Homeland Security Committee.   His blatant dereliction of duty to preserve, dereliction to protect,  and dereliction to defend the United States of America and the American  people deserves impeachment.   Instead, Joe Biden has demonstrated time and again, in policymaking  and political decisions, that he prioritizes illegal aliens over  American citizens, over our wives, our daughters, and our children.   His gross neglect and refusal to take action at the border warrants  removal from his post--again, why the Homeland Security Committee must  investigate.   That is why I support Congresswoman Boebert's Articles of Impeachment  and referral to committee.   The CBP had a record number of encounters with terrorists at the  southern border. The security of our Nation is being undermined by  foreign enemies because they know we have weak leadership.   We need to remove Joe Biden from the Oval Office and ensure that  Americans are safe. We need a leader that puts America and its people  first, not illegal immigration.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Boebert, Speaker McCarthy, and  Chairman Green for taking this up, and I urge all my colleagues to  support the referral of Articles of Impeachment to committee.
