 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss an issue that  is probably on the radar for almost everybody in this country that is  watching or listening, but it involves new accounting standards being  proposed called CECL.   This is supposed to put some transparency into the balance sheet for  people investing in banks, but it has a far-reaching impact in credit  unions, debt collection, and all sorts of other funds, including the  GSEs and credit cards; yet this accounting standard is being promoted  by the Federal Accounting Standards Board without any study to show  whether it is going to have an impact or not on our economy and on our  consumers.   The Home Builders Association says, for every $1,000 incoming into  the cost of a home loan, 100,000 people across this country will no  longer have access to home loans.   What a dramatic impact on low- to moderate-income folks as well as  our economy as a whole, as well as to financial institutions as a  whole.   The result of this, in other words, whenever this thing is  implemented, when we have a downturn in the economy and all of a sudden  you have to reserve additional money because of that, it will  exacerbate, in my opinion, the downturn.   This is a horrible deal. We need to take another look at it. We need  to stop it and study it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Since its inception, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has  disregarded congressional intent in a number of alarming ways. Under  the previous Director, Richard Cordray, the agency took it upon itself  to essentially write law through guidance and regulate through  enforcement. Bureaucrats at the CFPB worked diligently to eliminate  options for Americans, arrogantly believing they were better equipped  to make financial decisions than consumers themselves.   Thankfully, under Acting Director Mulvaney and Director Kraninger,  the CFPB is striving to foster an environment that promotes  transparency, legitimacy, and great consumer choice. The American  people deserve a Bureau that enforces law rather than creates it, while  placing power and choice back in the hands of consumers themselves.   Unfortunately, the legislation we are considering today accomplishes  the exact opposite.   I appreciate the chairwoman's attempt to reform the Bureau and share  the belief that it needs significant reform. However, instead of  solving underlying issues that make the CFPB an unaccountable  bureaucracy with little oversight, this legislation cherry-picks  specific actions of former Acting Director Mulvaney and attempts to  reverse his decisions.   Ignoring the underlying structural issues of the Bureau, Democrats  are attempting to codify their CFPB agenda with respect to staffing by  limiting political appointees, directing political initiatives through  the creation of the Office of Students and Young Consumers, and  emphasizing the powers and duties of the Office of Fair Lending and  Equal Opportunity.   Yet again, my friends across the aisle are more focused on who is  leading the agency than on real reforms that would increase oversight  and accountability at the CFPB and could shed light on some of the  issues this legislation seeks to address. For example, if the CFPB were  subject to an Office of Inspector General, we would have reports on  whether or not staffing levels are sufficient to fulfill the Bureau's  statutory goals. If the Bureau was subject to the appropriations  process, Congress would have a voice in choosing the number of  political appointees at the Bureau. Some of these issues, Mr. Chairman,  are not even partisan, they're near bipartisan, and yet we can't get  these things done.   Instead of working with Republicans to reform the Bureau, create  transparency, and avoid partisan policy shifts from Director to  Director, the  [[Page H4077]]  majority is choosing to advance legislation that mandates the  advancement of political priorities.   The bottom line here is the legislation before us is wholly partisan  and does nothing to ensure the CFPB can carry out its mission to  protect consumers. I oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues  to do so, as well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), ranking member of the full  committee.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment  that would place, I believe, an unnecessary burden on credit bureaus  with no benefits to consumers.   Currently, consumers have access to free credit scores through the  annualcreditreport.com website run by the big three credit reporting  agencies, or CRAs. On this website, consumers can get three separate  credit scores, one at each of these three CRAs, for free. This  amendment will use the CFPB to require that the CRAs provide an  additional credit score to consumers. That is right, a fourth credit  score.   Specifically, the amendment requires CRAs to use the credit score  that is most frequently used. What the legislation fails to mention is  that the most frequently used score is a FICO score. FICO scores are  not free.   This amendment requires that the credit bureaus, all private  companies, purchase credit scores from FICO, another private company;  and in doing so, it is mandating the transfer of potentially hundreds  of millions of dollars from one company to another company.   One has to ask oneself, why is this designed to punish these three  CRAs or to create a massive payday for FICO? This is the USA, not USSR,  not China, and not Venezuela. The government has no right to force a  private company to hand millions of dollars to another private company  simply because the government official prefers one product over  another.   In addition, the chairwoman has introduced legislation to reform the  CRA and has yet to bring a bill up before the committee. I would  imagine this amendment that deals with credit scores, not consumer  protection, is better suited to be debated under regular order in our  committee than thrown onto a bill that seeks to amend CFPB governance.   In short, this amendment has the government picking winners and  losers, provides little or no benefit to consumers, is irrelevant to  the subject of this bill, and should be soundly defeated.   This sets a horrible precedent, Madam Chairwoman. We are dictating  one private company to pay another private company for a service. When  do we ever do that? That is amazing precedent to set. How can we do  this?   We are not a dictatorial government here. We allow the winners and  losers to be chosen by the people through economic freedom. We don't  dictate who buys a product from here and who buys a product from there.  That is what the people are allowed to do on their own, and that is  what makes our country so great is economic freedom to be able to do  that: pick and choose between what companies provide what services and  which ones they want to pay for. Instead of dictating how one company  should pay another, we should be allowing the freedom for them to  choose.   Again, this amendment is about picking winners and losers. It  provides no benefit to consumers and should be soundly defeated.   Madam Chair, is my understanding correct that the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) has no time remaining?    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).    Madam Chair, I have the right to close, so I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the ranking member.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
