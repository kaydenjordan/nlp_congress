 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  DeSaulnier) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of two measures,  a bill that seeks to protect older Americans from discrimination in the  workplace and a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn a  Department of Education rule on borrower defense to repayment. While  both pieces of legislation appear to protect vulnerable Americans, they  likely have no chance of becoming law.   First, H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination  Act, adds a section to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that  shifts the burden of proof in age discrimination cases to allow a  plaintiff to show that any practice by the employer for which age may  be an involved factor, not the sole factor, is covered by the act.                                time  1230    This changes congressional intent and disregards case law.   In 1967, Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to  protect applicants and employees over 40 years of age from  discrimination on the basis of age in employment matters. It is  enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.   In 2009, the Supreme Court held that, in the case of Gross v. FBL  Financial Services, Inc., the standard of proof for a claim under the  Age Discrimination in Employment Act requires that age stand alone as  the cause of the adverse employment action rather than in conjunction  with other factors.   In 2013, the Supreme Court also ruled in the University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center v. Dr. Naiel Nassar that the plaintiff must  prove that a retaliatory motive was the decisive cause of adverse  employment action.   H.R. 1230 would reverse these Supreme Court decisions by allowing  mixed-motive claims in Age Discrimination in Employment Act cases,  clarifying that age need only be a motivating factor for  discrimination, even though other factors also motivated the action  unfavorable to the employee. This would actually make it more difficult  to prove discrimination because an employer would simply have to show  that they would have taken the same action in the absence of age as a  motivating factor, which will be more easy to show under the mixed- motive legal framework.   Congress previously rejected amendments to add age discrimination to  the Civil Rights Act, resulting in the passage of the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act using a different legal procedure.  Lowering the standard would apply the legal procedure of the Civil  Rights Act to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. In addition, a  lower standard is likely to lead to increased litigation that, in fact,  only benefits the plaintiffs' bar.   Other provisions of H.R. 1230 prohibit a court from awarding damages  or requiring any employment activity other than injunctive relief. This  means that discriminated parties are precluded from actually receiving  monetary relief, and the only true beneficiaries of this law will be  trial lawyers.   The Supreme Court stated in the Nassar case that ``lessening the  causation standard could . . . contribute to the filing of frivolous  claims, which would siphon resources from efforts by employers,  administrative agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.''   Republicans are committed to eliminating discrimination in the  workplace, including for older Americans. Discrimination of any kind is  already against the law.   Let me rephrase that. Discrimination of any kind is already against  the law through the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans  with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil Rights  Act.   Now, the second measure included in this rule is the Congressional  Review Act resolution to overturn a 2019 Department of Education rule  called Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability.   In 1994, the Department of Education issued the Borrower Defense to  Repayment regulation. In 2015, the Department of Education began  considering borrower defense claims prior to default or collection  proceedings, prompting a significant increase in applications for loan  relief.   On November 1, 2016, the Department of Education published a Borrower  Defense to Repayment regulation that did not distinguish between  intentional fraud and a simple mistake by an institution of higher  education. These regulations went after institutions rather than  working to help students. Offending institutions suffered significant  financial penalties, resulting in a taxpayer cost of $42 billion and  the loss of access to higher education for millions of students.   These Obama administration regulations were, in fact, overly broad,  with the intent of loan forgiveness, despite taxpayer cost.   The Trump administration's Department of Education subsequently  issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and reviewed over 30,000  comments prior to publishing a final rule in September of 2019 to  revise these 2016 regulations.   And let me just remind you, these 2016 regulations actually came  about right at the end of the previous administration. The 2019  regulations, those that were derived after the 30,000 comments, the  2019 regulations will apply only to loans disbursed after July 1, 2020.  So existing loans will remain subject to the 1994 or the 2016 rules,  depending upon the issue date.   The new regulations will provide loan relief to those students who  have been lied to and suffered financial harm. They will also hold  institutions accountable, grant due process to all parties, allow for  the use of arbitration, and expand the closed school look-back period  from 120 to 180 days.  [[Page H218]]    If this rule is not allowed to take effect, the 2016 regulations will  remain. The definition of misrepresentation under the 2016 regulation  is so broad that nearly everyone will eventually receive loan  forgiveness, so this may, in fact, have the effect of making college  free.   Now, free college sounds like a great benefit to society, but it is  not practical, and it would force those who can't or won't go to  college to pay for those who do.   In addition, eliminating the cost to higher education will limit the  competitiveness of institutions, reducing the superiority of American  colleges and universities.   Now, we heard last night in the Rules Committee that this  Congressional Review Act is important to combat for-profit colleges,  but the rules apply to all institutions. This means that even those  institutions that inadvertently make a mistake, such as not updating a  graduation rate on a flyer, will suffer financial penalties and, in  fact, may have to close, despite no intentional wrongdoing.   The 2019 borrower defense rule is a significant improvement over the  2016 regulations and will save the taxpayer money, ensure due process,  and hold fraudulent higher education institutions accountable.    Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Soon we will vote on the previous question, and if we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to require the  House to immediately proceed to consideration of H. Res. 791, a  resolution supporting the protestors in Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader, to explain the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier) how many more speakers he has.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying measures do not protect vulnerable  Americans as intended.   H.R. 1230 would make it more difficult to prove age as a motivating  factor in adverse employment actions. Republicans remain committed to  eliminating all forms of discrimination and ensuring a productive and  competitive workforce, but this bill ignores Supreme Court decisions  and will place opportunities in the hands of trial lawyers rather than  hardworking Americans.   H.J. Res. 76 is simply another partisan attempt to deny President  Trump any success, even if it means harming American students.   Mr. Speaker, I remember when President Bush signed a Congressional  Review Act overturning some of the ergonomic rules that the Clinton  administration issued literally days before that President left office.   At the time, I ran a medical practice. I was a business owner  wondering how I was going to pay for and comply with these new rules  that seemed burdensome, complicated, and confusing. The repeal of these  rules relieved what was sure to be a heavy burden on my shoulders and,  certainly, many other small businesses.   Congressional Review Act resolutions have consequences, and we should  fully evaluate the effect that they will have on Americans rather than  just play politics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, a ``no''  vote on the rule, and a ``no'' vote on the underlying measures.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
