 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up to the substitute and be reported by  number and that they be the only remaining amendments in order: First,  Ernst, No. 2639; Cornyn-Padilla, No. 2602; Wicker-Stabenow, No. 2206;  Cruz, No. 2389; Lee, No. 2517; Grassley-Klobuchar, No. 2500; Crapo- Wyden, No. 2507; Blackburn, No. 2328; Warner-Portman, No. 2617; Wyden- Lummis-Toomey, No. 2619; Cantwell, No. 2588; Wyden-Murkowski, No. 2603,  Cantwell-Braun, No. 2621; Van Hollen, No. 2613, as modified; Cruz-Lun,  No. 2490; Daines, No. 2599; Sullivan, No. 2586; Shelby, No. 2535;  Rounds, No. 2636; Sinema-Portman, No. 2620; further, that the Senate  vote in relation to all pending amendments, with no amendments in order  to the amendments prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; and  that if a rollcall is ordered, then 60 affirmative votes be required  for adoption for the amendments listed in this agreement, except for  Lee, No. 2517; Warner, No. 2617; Wyden, No. 2498; Ernst, No. 2639; and  Grassley, No. 2500; and that there be 2 minutes for debate, equally  divided, prior to each vote.    Madam President, the Senator's objection exposes the  Democrats' true intention. I have never objected to considering  amendments on this bill--not once. Democrats say they want amendments,  but they can't take yes for an answer. The Democrats' true intention is  to rush this bill through so that they can hurry up and light the fuse  on their $3.5 trillion spending spree--a socialist debt bomb--and then  leave town for vacation.   If they want to vote on amendments, why would the Senator object to  my reasonable request? The only way the Democrats will agree to the  amendments is if they can rush this bill through.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
