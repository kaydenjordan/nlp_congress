 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize  Pete Goicoechea for a lifetime of service to Nevada and to congratulate  him on his induction into the Nevada Cattlemen's Association Hall of  Honor.   Pete may have been born in Salt Lake City, UT, but he came into his  own in Nevada--Eureka to be specific. After attending school in White  Pine County and graduating from Eureka High School, he returned to Utah  to get a degree from Utah State University and married his wife Gladys  ``Glady'' Goicoechea in 1972. Pete's service to Nevada spans the better  part of four decades, but before his public life, Pete's primary  commitment was to take care of his family and their ranch in Diamond  Valley. The family still owns the ranch--Pete runs it with his son,  J.J.--and his children and grandchildren are still the center of Pete's  life.   Pete was a leader in Eureka from the beginning as a volunteer  firefighter and director of the Eureka County High School Rodeo Club.  In 1987, he ran for Eureka County Commissioner, a seat he won and held  for 16 years, serving 14 years as chairman. In 2002, he was encouraged  to run for the Nevada Legislature and won a seat in the State assembly,  where he would serve for 12 years. He moved on to the Nevada State  Senate, and when his current term ends, he will term out after serving  for 24 years in the Nevada State Legislature.   During his time as a State legislator, Pete was a powerful voice for  rural Nevada and the unique needs of the communities and constituents  he served. He has always employed a collaborative approach, working  with people from all corners of the State and all walks of life towards  common goals. Pete has remained committed to working across the aisle  for the benefit of Nevadans.   Pete filled many roles during his time in the State legislature,  including that of chair of the senate committee on government affairs,  member of the cowboy caucus, and of the senate committee on finance and  governance. He was perhaps most well-known as a long-serving member of  the natural resources committee and the public lands committee in every  session that he served, utilizing his expertise and experience as a  rancher. He has been a strong advocate for the agriculture and mining  industries that are the lifeblood of Nevada's rural economies. His  tireless dedication to working with his colleagues to address these  issues has been lauded by all who have been fortunate enough to work  with him.   Congratulations to Pete Goicoechea on a lifetime of achievement and  service. Nevadans across the State owe you their gratitude.                            ____________________
