 Madam President, what you just witnessed here is, we  hope, a new day in the U.S. Senate. You see, we have the responsibility  of appropriating the money for the Federal Government. We do it in 12  different bills. The total cost to the taxpayers for the resources for  the government come to the neighborhood of $1 trillion, so it is a big  undertaking.   For 5 years, we failed to pass those 12 bills individually. We passed  them in a group known as an omnibus. It is usually done either at the  end of the fiscal year, which ends September 30, or a few weeks or  months thereafter.   So this year, we decided in the Senate to try to do it differently,  do it better. What we have done through the  [[Page S4546]]  Appropriations Committee, which I serve on, is to take up each  individual bill of the 12 bills. We are trying to pass them on a  bipartisan basis because this body is divided, 51 Democrats and 49  Republicans.   We picked two of the best legislators in the Senate to accomplish  this--Senator Patty Murray, who just spoke, from the State of  Washington, a Democrat, and Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, from  Maine. The two of them did miracle work in the committee; they got all  12 bills individually passed.   We are in the process of trying to consider three of those bills at a  time--three of those bills now. That is what we were embarking on last  week. In order for us to take up these bills, we needed to suspend the  rules of the Senate because of the procedure that we face. When we  tried to do that, one Senator, a Republican Senator from Wisconsin,  objected. Because of his objection and the nature of the Senate, we  were back to the starting point, and it led to what we saw today.   Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Senator Murray, the  President pro tempore and chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, have asked for permission to take up those three bills  and to amend them and debate them and pass them. In order to do that,  we have to suspend the rules of the Senate. It is not an easy thing.  Usually we do it by saying, ``Do I have unanimous consent to suspend  the rules?'' and it happens. This time, when we said, ``Do we have  unanimous consent?'' that one Senator objected. He has his own reasons.  He can explain them. But it meant we had to come back here today and  start to suspend the rules. It takes a two-thirds vote, 67 votes, in  the Senate.    So, you see, this isn't an easy Chamber in which to get things done,  but I think we are on the right track. It is a bipartisan undertaking,  and we are considering each of the bills and subjecting them to  amendments--just the way it used to be for many years, for many  decades. I think that is better.   Contrast that with what is going on in the House of Representatives.  At this point, they can't pass any bills. They couldn't pass any  appropriations bills, and now they are considering a bill for short- term spending for our government. Speaker McCarthy said he will call  for a vote this week. I don't know if it will pass or not. There is  quite a feud going on over there.   We are following an orderly, bipartisan process to have a closer look  at each of the spending bills for the Senate and for taxpayers in this  country. I think this is the right way to do it. I hope the Republican  leadership in the House of Representatives can get their act together.  We will find out this week.   That is not the reason I came to the floor, but I wanted to make sure  that we made a point of what Senator Murray said. This is a historic,  bipartisan undertaking. I think the American people more than anything  want us to get along and work together and solve some problems, and  this will be a step in that direction.   So that is what we just went through.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, each year, the United Nations in New York has a  General Assembly meeting. Countries come with their leaders from all  around the world.   Many people--myself included--watch ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday. Last  night on ``60 Minutes,'' Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine,  talked about what he is facing with this Russian invasion by Putin and  what it has meant to his country. He said that he is coming to New York  to make a presentation to the United Nations.   I think it is important that he does this. I want him to remind the  American people, who, through the NATO alliance, have been steadfastly  in support of the Ukrainian people, what is at stake.   Vladimir Putin said he wants to restore Russia's so-called ``lost  glory.'' That is the twisted rationale behind his disastrous invasion  of Ukraine, one that has led to nearly half a million Ukrainians and  Russians being killed or wounded simply for Putin's bloodthirsty  ambition.   Putin will not be traveling much outside Russia. If you wonder why,  it is because the International Criminal Court, when it looked at the  activity of the Russian invaders in Ukraine, ended up issuing an arrest  warrant, branding Vladimir Putin a war criminal.   Why would they call him a war criminal? Because they killed innocent  civilians certainly but equally because they had a mass abduction of  Ukrainian children into Russia--something that has hardly ever happened  in history, but Putin has done it.   So they issued an arrest warrant for Putin over the war crimes. It is  the first time in history for a leader of one of the permanent members  of the U.N. Security Council to be so charged. It is no surprise when  you see what he has done and what he threatens to do. Putin has  isolated Russia. He has arrested Russians for political dissent. He has  quashed the freedom of the press. He is destroying the Russian economy.   Despite these clearly tragic outcomes, he is doubling down even  further in a move my Delaware colleague, Senator Coons, aptly called  the ``devil's deal.'' You see, international sanctions, global  isolation, and a determined Ukrainian military have left Putin  scrambling for military supplies and weapons. He first turned to help  from one of the world's worst rogue nations. You might have heard  Senator McConnell talk about Iran earlier. That is right--while the  Iranian Government was beating, murdering, and repressing mass  protesters who were demanding basic freedoms, Putin was there, hat in  hand, pleading for military weapons.   Just last week--what classic photographs these are. He turned and  asked for help from Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea. It is hard  to imagine a more deadly duo than these two.   While the Iranian Government was doing these things, he is pleading  for weapons; and now he has met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un,  further request for weapons. His effort to restore Russian glory has,  instead, resulted in pleading for help from two global despots and  fostered NATO enlargement along Russia's border. That is the thing that  we have got to keep in mind that has been achieved by this war. There  is more unity in the NATO alliance than anytime in its history. In  fact, for the first time in recent history, we have expanded NATO to  include Sweden and Finland.   It has been my good fortune to attend the Munich security council in  Germany this spring and to meet, again, the President of Finland,  President Niinisto.   This morning's New York Times has an article, which I commend to you.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Finnish Leader Warns Europe About Russia                            (By Steven Erlanger)         Helsinki, Finland--The president of Finland, Sauli       Niinisto, is the person considered most responsible for       bringing his country into the NATO alliance--and Sweden, too,       which is awaiting ratification--following the Russian       invasion of Ukraine. President Biden has consulted him about       Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom Mr.       Niinisto has met numerous times.        In a long interview in his light-filled modernist residence       in Helsinki, Mr. Niinisto warned European leaders and       citizens not to become complacent over the risks of       escalation in Russia's war against Ukraine.        The war in Ukraine will last a long time, he said, and wars       can take unexpected paths, even toward the use of nuclear       weapons.        The invasion, Mr. Niinisto said, was ``a wake-up call'' for       Europe and NATO.        ``Well, it was ringing loudly in February 2022,'' he said.       ``But do you hear it anymore? That clearly? That might be a       good question--whether all Europeans realize that this is a       European issue.''        Mr. Niinisto, 75, is nearing the end of his 12 years as the       Finnish president. In the interview, he was philosophical,       but troubled, too. Finland has much experience--and an 830-      mile border--with its imperialist neighbor, Russia.        Recalling Finland's numerous wars with Moscow, including       the 1939 Winter War and World War II, when the Finns fought       off the Soviets but had to cede some territory, Mr. Niinisto       said European countries that let down their defenses after       the collapse of the Soviet Union made a grave mistake.        Here are a few highlights from the interview:        He warned about the risks of Russian escalation and even       nuclear war.        Speaking about debris from what appeared to be a Russian       drone landing recently in Romania, which is a member of NATO,       Mr.  [[Page S4547]]       Niinisto cautioned: ``We're in a very sensitive situation.       Even small things can change matters a great deal and       unfortunately for the worse. That is the risk of such large-      scale warfare.'' He added, ``The risk that nuclear weapons       could be used is tremendous.''        Given those risks, he urged critics without political       responsibilities to understand the hesitation of leaders to       accelerate the war.        His warnings, he said, were partly a response to those who       criticize the policies of Mr. Biden and Chancellor Olaf       Scholz of Germany as too cautious in supplying Ukraine with       sophisticated, long-range missiles and drones that could       easily hit Russian-occupied Crimea and Russia.        ``There's a difference between those who have       responsibility and those who don't,'' he said. ``Also, in       Finland, we hear voices that America should do that or that.       And I just wanted to point out that if there's escalation to       a big war, that's world war, so then the nuclear risk becomes       clearly bigger.'' He urged everyone ``to understand the       position of those who have responsibility.''        Some countries shrank their militaries after the collapse       of the Soviet Union. Finland did not.        He urged Europeans to heed Finland's example.        Unlike Sweden, a close neighbor in all fields, including       defense, Finland still has conscription for males, and also       allows women to enlist. Those who finish conscription remain       in the reserves, as they do in Israel, for decades, and take       part in military training and exercises at least twice a       year--now more often--in conjunction with other public       services, such as the police and the fire brigades.        And Finland, schooled in self-reliance, maintains large       artillery forces, still makes its own shells and ammunition,       and even bought advanced F-35 fighter jets before Russia's       invasion of Ukraine.        After the Cold War, Mr. Niinisto said, ``we Europeans       learned to live an always improving life.''        ``Decade after decade,'' he said, ``it strengthened the       feeling that it's a bit old-fashioned even to talk about       defense forces or defending because that's not possible in a       modern world. Now there's a huge wake-up. Fortunately, in       Finland, our position remained totally different.''        He has few illusions about Russia and Mr. Putin.        In their meetings before the invasion in February 2022, Mr.       Niinisto said, Mr. Putin was focused, aggressive and well-      informed, even obsessive, about Russian culture. He said he       decided to test Mr. Putin by asking him about Mikhail       Lermontov's poem on the death of Pushkin, Russia's greatest       poet. Mr. Putin spoke for more than half an hour. ``He knew       everything about that--for him it's Russia, Russia overall,''       Mr. Niinisto said.        Russia ruled Finland for more than a century, until, in the       chaos of Lenin's takeover, Finland declared independence in       1917. The wars with Russia since then are seared ``in our       backbone,'' Mr. Niinisto said. Russian history goes in waves,       he said, citing ``a centuries-old Finnish saying that `the       Cossack takes anything that is loose,' '' that is not tied       down. (Finns used to use ``Cossack'' as shorthand for       ``Russians,'' he said.) But it is a reminder that free       countries must keep their defenses up and their goods safely       stored.        He and Mr. Biden talked often about Russia.        The two presidents spoke about Russian intentions in       Ukraine before Mr. Niinisto met Mr. Putin in Moscow in       October 2021, continuing their conversations at the Glasgow       climate summit the next month and afterward, as Russian       troops were building up on the border with Ukraine. They       spoke again in January, and Mr. Biden asked Mr. Niinisto to       urge Mr. Putin not to invade. Russia invaded the next month.        After the invasion, Mr. Niinisto was among the first       European leaders to meet Mr. Biden in the White House, on       March 4, where he put forth the possibility of Finland       joining NATO. After the Russian invasion, he said, ``it       became very obvious that we had no other alternative than       giving up our military nonalignment.''        Mr. Biden was supportive from the start, Mr Niinisto said.        Russia isn't going anywhere.        Mr. Niinisto said he does not know how long the war will       last, or how it will end, or ``what life will be like when we       again have paece.''        But even when the conflict ends, Russia will remain.       ``There's also a big European interest to the make sure that       Russia is not returning back to warfare after peace in       Ukraine'' without insisting that the Russians ``have to be       blown out,'' he said carefully. But he emphasized that trust       would be needed to ensure that ``a new war is not waiting       behind the door.''        There is always life after war, he said, and there is       nothing more valuable for people than peace.        ``Without peace, you have nothing, so I'm sure that       ordinary Russians share these feelings,'' Mr. Niinisto said.       ``It's a basic human feeling.''        There must be a way to maintain a relationship with Russia,       he said. ``I don't mean any great friendship'' Mr. Niinisto       said, ``but the capability to tolerate, even understand each       other a bit.''     Madam President, the September 18 New York Times, the  Finnish leader, President Niinisto--now serving his second term--made  an historic decision to ask for membership in NATO. He is a wonderful  man; he is on a second term and is extremely popular in his country.  And he asked to join the NATO alliance so that it could stand up  against Putin.   He reminds us in this article that Finland has a great experience  with its neighbor Russia and an 830-mile border with the Russian  leadership.   He recalls ``Finland's numerous wars with Moscow, including the 1939  Winter War and World War II, when the Finns fought off the Soviets but  had to cede some territory, Mr. Niinisto said European countries that  let down their defenses after the collapse of the Soviet Union made a  grave mistake.''   And so he has asked to join the alliance.   I was at a meeting with President Niinisto, and he said he picked up  the phone one day and called Vladimir Putin in Moscow. It is hard to  imagine, isn't it? But he said: I told him, point-blank, I am joining  the NATO alliance.   Putin said: You don't have to. I am not going to invade your country.   He said: I can't trust you anymore after what you have done to  Ukraine.   That is a message that Zelenskyy was delivering last night on ``60  Minutes.'' I want to make clear on the floor: Putin is not going to  stop his ambition to acquire other countries, and there are many that  are in fragile, dangerous situations.   I am blessed to represent the State of Illinois and city of Chicago,  as the Presiding Officer does. And there are some wonderful groups of  people who have come to the State and our city that have made us what  we are today. Among them are the Polish people. They say that Chicago  is the second largest Polish city in the world, next to Warsaw. It is  probably true. They are great folks, and I am honored to represent  them. They know what the Soviet occupation through the Warsaw Pact  meant to Poland, and they understand the danger if Putin is successful  in Ukraine. The neighbors to Poland feel the same way--the Baltic  nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. I have a special connection  there. My mother was born in Lithuania. I have been there many times,  and I greatly admire the people of all the Baltic states. But they are  small countries; they couldn't stand a chance of fighting off Vladimir  Putin if he decided to invade them.   The point made by Niinisto--the point made by the NATO alliance, the  point that President Biden is making and, I might add, many Republican  leaders, like Senator McConnell, is that it is in our best interest to  stop Putin now in Ukraine because he has ambitions that reach far  beyond the borders of that country.   The United States is not sending troops. We are sending military  equipment, artillery, ammunition; and we are giving advice to the  Ukrainians so that they can win this battle. This battle is not just  for Ukrainian sovereignty; it is for our own protection in the years to  come.   This week in Washington, we will be visited by President Zelenskyy of  Ukraine. He will go to New York first to address the United Nations  General Assembly. I think he is going to come through with a clear  message to global leaders, to NATO, to Congress, and to the American  people: Quite simply, Ukraine is fighting with the lives of its own  people against a nuclear state--Russia--that threatens the world. If  Ukraine falls, Putin will certainly go farther--to Poland, to the  Baltic states--and trigger an even wider war. Putin cannot be changed,  but he can be stopped in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people are showing  extraordinary courage and determination.   I agree with President Zelenskyy. We must continue our support for  these brave people fighting for their country and against Russian  tyranny that threatens the world.   We can start by passing the Biden administration's most recent  funding request. I am going to do my part in the Senate to make sure we  get that done, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.   I would say to President Zelenskyy: Your message was delivered on  ``60 Minutes.'' You are looking for allies who will stand up against  the aggression of the war criminal Vladimir Putin. The United States  and NATO will be those allies.   Madam President, I yield the floor.  [[Page S4548]]     I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) is  necessarily absent.
