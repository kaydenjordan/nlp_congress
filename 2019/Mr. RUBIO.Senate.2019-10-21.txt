 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week it is my honor to  recognize a small business that exemplifies family values and  dedication to its community. I am proud to recognize Amelia Island  Kayak Excursions of Fernandina Beach, FL, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Established in 2013, Amelia Island Kayak Excursions is the product of  the Bullington family's love of kayaking in the Amelia Island inlands.  Six years ago, Mark Bullington and his two children, Amber and Aaron,  decided to turn their hobby into their livelihood. Their love of  Florida and commitment to responsible stewardship of the Earth led the  Bullingtons to share their passion with visitors and their community.   Showcasing Florida's beauty, Amelia Island Kayak Excursions offers  both kayak and boat expeditions throughout wildlife-rich Egan's Creek,  Lofton's Creek, and more of Florida's coastal environment. Tours range  from 2 to 5 hours, and overnight tours are offered for experienced  kayakers. Additionally, Amelia Island Kayak Excursions offers private  boat tours for small groups to observe the diverse local wildlife.   Since its founding, the tour guides of Amelia Island Kayak Excursions  have continued to learn more about Florida's unique environment and  community. Over the span of his career, Mark has logged more than 4,500  miles kayaking and canoeing, gaining extensive knowledge about the  scenic ecosystem in the process. Amber not only leads tours but is also  involved with the local business community through the Nassau County  Chamber of Commerce and, in 2018, was recognized as the chamber's  Ambassador of the Year. Aaron is certified through the University of  Florida as a Florida Master Naturalist, a certification which lends  itself easily to his role as tour guide.   As a well-established tour service, Amelia Island Kayak Excursions  has become an essential part of the economic framework of Fernandina  Beach. This business's influential role has not gone unnoticed. In  2017, Amelia Island  [[Page S5917]]  Kayak Excursions was recognized by the Nassau County Chamber of  Commerce as the Small Business of the Year and received the Bold City  Best Water Sports Award. In addition to its accomplishments, Amelia  Island Kayak Excursions is dedicated to giving back to the community  through engagement with local charities and corresponding fundraisers.  To educate the next generation about Florida's wildlife, the  Bullingtons have partnered with an after school program by gifting  students a free kayak trip if they meet their academic goals.   Amelia Island Kayak Excursions is a great example of a community- oriented small business. I am proud to honor and congratulate Amelia  Island Kayak Excursions for its hard work and dedication to the  Floridian landscape. I wish the entire team at Amelia Island Kayak  Excursions the best of luck and success in all of their future  endeavors.                            ____________________
