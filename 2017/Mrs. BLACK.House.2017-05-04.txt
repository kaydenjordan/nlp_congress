 Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed when I start hearing  conversations about the Affordable Care Act and how it is working so  well today.   I want to talk about two situations in my home State of Tennessee.   When the Affordable Care Act went into place in the State of  Tennessee, we had a risk pool. The risk pool covered about 28,000  people. They were happy with their care, they were happy with their  providers, and they were happy with the cost. It was patient centered.  They determined what best fit their needs. These were people with  preexisting conditions, happy with where they were.   In 1 day, because the Federal Government said, You don't meet this  and you don't meet that and you don't meet this, they lost their  insurance. They were in the marketplace.   I want to tell you about two situations that are very close to me,  but they only represent a number of the many calls that I get in my  office.   One is a good friend of mine who has lupus. She went on the  marketplace. For the first year, she did pretty good. Her premiums were  pretty low; her deductible was reasonable. But here is what she found:  she couldn't keep her doctor.   Can you imagine someone who has had lupus for a number of years, it  is being controlled, and now she is told she cannot keep her doctor?  She had to find other doctors. She was not happy with that because she  had a relationship. They didn't use the same treatment and care that  she had received before. So she has not felt very healthy.   In the meantime, every year that it is renewed, she calls me to say:  My premiums have gone up, my deductibles have gone up, and now it is  more than what I was paying before when I liked what I had and I  couldn't keep it, opposite of what the President told everyone: If you  like what you have, you can keep it.   The second one is someone who has myasthenia gravis. Again, on that  same risk pool. She lost her opportunity to get the medication that she  was receiving, an IV medication. She has myasthenia gravis. She was  very controlled, able to work, living a healthy lifestyle.    She lost her opportunity to have that medication because  that medication was $400 a month, now  [[Page H4146]]  it is $3,400 month, and no longer can she get her medication.   When the other side talks about how wonderful this system is, I  implore them to come to our State and talk to the people in our State.   I am a registered nurse. I know what it is like to take care of  people who have healthcare conditions who need to be in a risk pool.  But let's do it the right way. Let's give it to our States. Let's allow  this now to be used in a way that is patient-centered, the way it was  working in my home State of Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I am looking forward to the  vote later on this afternoon.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of the American Health Care Act, a  bill that repeals the worst parts of ObamaCare and begins to repair the  damage it has caused. This bill brings choice and competition back into  the healthcare marketplace and puts healthcare decisions back into the  hands of patients and doctors where it belongs.   It has been a winding road to get to this point, but we are here  today to fulfill the promise that we made to the American people. I  will point out right now to those who say we should have just moved on  from healthcare reform, American families and individuals are suffering  from rising costs and barriers to getting the care that they need right  now.   Under ObamaCare, the situation is getting worse every day. In Iowa,  just yesterday, one of the last remaining insurers announced that it  will pull out of the ObamaCare exchanges, leaving nearly all of the  State's residents with no--and, yes, I will say again, nearly all of  the residents with no available health insurance plan for the purchase  under ObamaCare.                                time  1230    And in a few of the Iowa counties which are the remaining insurers,  even that company is saying it might stop offering plans, leaving the  entire State without an insurance plan available under ObamaCare. That  is happening this very week. We can't wait a moment longer than  necessary to provide relief for the American people by repealing and  replacing ObamaCare.   I applaud the Members of this body who stuck with us during this  process and worked hard to make the bill better. I, myself, had  concerns about the bill as it was introduced. I worked hard to make  sure that the bill truly reflected my ideals and the views and desires  of my constituents. And when the bill came before the Budget Committee,  which I chair, I urged my members to stay in the fight and work to  improve the bill rather than stop it in its tracks.   And do you know what? Our members did just that, making some  recommendations that were eventually included in the various  amendments. That message was heard loud and clear by all of the members  of our Conference who have worked tirelessly to finalize a bill that  truly reflects our vision for healthcare reform.   Throughout this process, our commitment to undoing the damage done by  ObamaCare has remained steadfast. Day after day, my constituents call  my office begging us to do something to save them from ObamaCare, and  it is because ObamaCare is collapsing.   In my State of Tennessee, families are suffering. Premiums have  increased by 60 percent, while deductibles are so high that, even if  someone has an insurance card, it doesn't mean they have guaranteed  care.   There are parts of my State in Tennessee that don't have a single  insurance provider in the marketplace, and two-thirds of the counties  have only one provider. That is not competition. That is called a  monopoly.   While no legislation is perfect, this bill makes some important  changes to help American families get quality, affordable health  insurance: It zeros out the mandates, it repeals the taxes, and it  repeals the subsidies; it allows people to choose health insurance  plans to meet the unique needs of their families instead of purchasing  a one-size-fits-all plan mandated by a Washington bureaucrat; and it  modernizes Medicaid, a once-in-a-lifetime entitlement reform.   Ending Medicaid's open-ended funding structure will play an important  role in addressing our future budget deficits and our growing national  debt.   This is a particularly proud moment for me. I was working as a nurse  in Nashville in the 1990s when the Clinton administration pushed a  single-payer pilot program in Tennessee called TennCare. I saw  firsthand the negative impact government-run health care has on patient  care. I saw costs rise and the quality of care fall. It inspired me to  get involved in public service.   When in 2009 and 2010 I saw those same principles being debated and,  eventually, implemented on the national level, I thought my experience  in Tennessee could be valuable in the national debate; so, in 2011, I  sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a part of  ObamaCare. Today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing the American  people from this damaging, government-run healthcare system.   I, and many other Members of this body, have worked hard to make sure  that this bill truly reflects our visions for healthcare reform. I, for  one, cannot sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Governing  is hard, but our constituents did not elect us to do what is easy. They  elected us to do what is right.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the American  Health Care Act to rescue the American people from ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a physician and the chair of  the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee,  who has worked tirelessly on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the other side that  if they read the bill, they will see under section 137 it says:         No limiting access to coverage for individuals with       preexisting conditions. Nothing in this act shall be       construed as permitting health insurance insurers to limit       access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting       conditions.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4154]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our distinguished whip.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to myself.   The American Health Care Act has gone through many fits and starts  over the last few months. This bill begins to fulfill our promise to  the American people by reducing costs for American families. It  eliminates ObamaCare's burdens on small businesses and families and  protects those with preexisting conditions. We must continue to work to  build on this.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), our  majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it really is my privilege now to yield 1  minute to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the  Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
