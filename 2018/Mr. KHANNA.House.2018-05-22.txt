 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Representative Gabbard for  offering this amendment for one simple reason: it is going to stop the  march to war in Iran, another blunder like Iraq.   I don't understand our foreign policy. It seems that the  qualification, in John Bolton's case, is to be wrong for the last 25  years, and then that makes you an expert--wrong about Iraq and wrong  about the neoconservative philosophy that got us into this mess.   This amendment, forget all the details; we are rushing again to  another historic blunder, and this Congress needs to stop that. I  respect Representative Gabbard for putting this forward so we don't  make another blunder in our foreign policy.
