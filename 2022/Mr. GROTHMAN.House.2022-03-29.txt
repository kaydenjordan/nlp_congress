 Madam Speaker, I rise to hope for peace in Ukraine.   Estimates vary, but perhaps over 20,000 people have died in this war  already.   Recently, both President Biden and Senator Graham have weighed in on  what they feel should happen to Vladimir Putin. Obviously, their  language could delay the end of the war and heighten tensions at the  peace talks.   Have they cleared their comments with the Ukrainian people, who lose  more people every day the war goes on?   Both President Biden and Senator Graham got press from these remarks,  and some politicians just care about that.   I encourage all Senators and the President of the United States to  remember that they are in the big leagues now, and their careless  remarks to get a little bit more press can cost Ukrainian and Russian  lives.                            ____________________
