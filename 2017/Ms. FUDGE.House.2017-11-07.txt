 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, would  fundamentally redefine the relationship between employers and  employees.   Mr. Speaker, corporate profits and income inequality are at an all- time high, yet we are debating a bill that would strip workers of their  right to hold employers accountable, allowing corporations to further  stifle wage growth and undermine collective bargaining. This is yet  another Republican attempt to make the rich richer and the working  people poorer, just like their tax bill. What we should be fighting for  is a living wage and employee rights.   My Republican colleagues say the law is ambiguous and we must act to  save small businesses. The law is not ambiguous. They just don't like  it because it holds businesses responsible and forces them to bargain  with unions. This bill is an assault on workers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Economic  Policy Institute outlining how H.R. 3441 will ensure small businesses  are left with sole responsibility for business practices often dictated  by large corporations; and, in addition, a letter from the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters opposing this bill in support of  workers protections.                                      Economic Policy Institute,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chairwoman, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of           Representatives.      Hon. Bobby C. Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House           of Representatives.        Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       the Economic Policy Institute Policy Center, we write to       express our strong opposition the H.R. 3441, the so-called       ``Save Local Business Act,'' which would do nothing to       protect small business owners or their workers. The Economic       Policy Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank       founded in 1986, and our labor policy unit assesses actions       by Congress and federal agencies that impact workers and the       economy. We urge you to oppose this legislation.        The so-called ``Save Local Business Act'' (H.R. 3441) would       roll back the joint employer standards under both the       National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Fair Labor       Standards Act (FLSA). It has nothing to do with protecting       small businesses. In fact, the bill would ensure that small       businesses are left with sole responsibility for business       practices often mandated by large corporations like       franchisors. It would establish a joint employer standard       that lets big corporations avoid liability for labor and       employment violations and leaves small businesses on the       hook.        Given the realities of the modern workplace, in which       employees often find themselves subject to more than one       employer, working people deserve a joint employer standard       that guarantees their rights and protections under basic       labor and employment laws. Instead, this bill would establish       a standard that makes it nearly impossible for workers whose       wages are stolen or who are fired for supporting a union to       get justice. By limiting employer responsibility to only       those firms who ``directly, actually, and immediately''       exercise significant control over the essential terms and       conditions of employment, the bill would enable large firms       that contract for services to evade responsibility under both       the NLRA and the FLSA.        When two or more businesses co-determine or share control       over a worker's pay, schedule, or job duties, then both of       those businesses should be considered employers. A weak joint       employer standard robs workers of their rights, making it       impossible for them to effectively collectively bargain or       litigate workplace disputes--and it leaves small businesses       holding the bag when the large corporations that control       their business practices and set their employees' schedules       violate labor law and refuse to come to the bargaining table.       If this committee wishes to support small businesses and the       workers they employ, then it should support a strong joint       employer standard rather than this legislation.        Since the NLRB narrowed its joint employer standard in       1984, contingent and alternative workforce arrangements--      including reliance on temporary staffing firms and       contractors to outsource services traditionally performed by       in-house workers--have grown dramatically. Recent estimates       find that 15.8 percent of workers were engaged in alternative       work arrangements in late 2015, or around 24 million workers       in today's labor market.        The NLRB's 2015 decision in Browning-Ferris Industries       addressed this issue, requiring all firms that control the       terms and conditions of employment to come to the bargaining       table, ensuring that workers are again able to engage in       their right to collective bargaining. Employers already face       only narrow liability under Browning-Ferris, and the Board       would examine the specific circumstances of each case before       making a determination. Nothing in the decision implies that       all employers in a specific industry will be found to be       joint employers under the NLRA.        Similarly, the Wage & Hour Division's Administrator's       Interpretation on the joint employer standard under the FLSA       did not create any new policy; rather, it simply sought to       make clear for employers their responsibilities under       existing court law and opinion, and to provide the exact kind       of clarity and guidance to employers and the regulated       community that proponents of the H.R. 3441 purport to seek.       And yet, earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Labor       rescinded that Administrator's Interpretation, hiding it from       view.        In spite of its title, H.R. 3441 does nothing to save local       businesses. Instead, it saves large corporations from any       responsibility for violations of the FLSA and NLRA. The       legislation leaves small businesses and their workers without       meaningful recourse. We urge you, your fellow Committee       members, and all Members of the House of Representatives to       oppose this bill.            Sincerely,      Celine McNicholas,        Labor Counsel, Economic Policy Institute Policy Center.      Heidi Shierholz,        Senior Economist and Director of Policy, Economic Policy       Institute Policy Center.                                   ____                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am writing       to express our vigorous opposition to H.R. 3441, the Save       Local Business Act. I strongly urge you to reject this       legislation.        H.R. 3441 seeks to legislate around a century of consistent       case law and established joint employer standards in labor       and employment law. The bill redefines the term ``employer''       so narrowly that many workers will have no remedy when their       employers violate wage laws or their rights to organize and       bargain collectively. We believe the legislation will       encourage ``gaming the system'' so that no one exercises       enough control to be liable as an employer.        The legislation would overturn the National Labor Relations       Board (NLRB) Browning-Ferris decision and leave worker       protections weaker than they were prior to Congress adopting       the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935. On August       27, 2015, the NLRB, in its Browning Ferris Industries (BFI)       decision, affirmed the basic principle that two or more       employers are joint employers of the same employees if they       are both employers under common law and they ``share or co-      determine those matters governing the essential terms and       conditions of employment.'' H.R. 3441 would overturn this       decision and allow employers to evade their responsibility to       engage in meaningful collective bargaining.        The BFI case involves a labor-only, cost-plus staffing       contract under which BFI has subcontracted the employment       relationship only to a staffing agency, Leadpoint. BFI owns       the facility and equipment on which Leadpoint's employees       work; it directs the quality and quantity of work performed       by Leadpoint workers.        BFI oversees operations with its own personnel and retains       authority to approve or reject Leadpoint's workers. Leadpoint       can only pay its workers amounts that comply with its       staffing agreement with BFI. As the NLRB noted, the Union       ``assert(ed) that absent a change in the joint-employer       standard, a putative employer, like BFI, that is a necessary       party to meaningful collective bargaining will continue to       insulate itself by the `calculated restructuring of       employment and insertion of a contractor to insulate itself       from the basic legal obligation to recognize and bargain with       employees' representative.''        The NLRB joint employer decision is not a dramatic       departure from existing law. It does not upend business as we       know it, nor does it undermine the franchise business model,       as many have claimed. Current law balances the interests of       workers and employers by requiring a fact specific inquiry to       determine whether or not there is a joint  [[Page H8569]]       employer relationship. The NLRB joint employer decision in       the BFI case is fact specific and clarifies the joint       employment standard.        Workers at BFI/Leadpoint chose to exercise their right to       determine whether they wanted to organize and bargain       collectively. Workers voted and the ballots from that       election were impounded pending a decision in the BFI case.       After the NLRB issued its decision, the ballots were counted.       The BFI/Leadpoint workers decisively declared their desire to       bargain collectively by voting 4-1 in favor of Teamster       representation. The NLRB ruling will allow these (and other)       workers to negotiate with and hold accountable the employer       which actually controls the terms and conditions of their       jobs. This legislation will deny them the ability to do so.        Not only would H.R. 3441 overturn the BFI decision, the       bill would also drastically change the definition of       employment relationships under the Fair Labor Standards Act       (FLSA). The FLSA currently recognizes that more than one       business can be an employer. Thus, an employer cannot hide       behind labor contractors, brokers, or others. For example,       while there are many responsible employers in the       construction industry, it is well known that abusive schemes       are far too prevalent in this industry as well as others.       Contractors use subcontractors or labor brokers who       intentionally misclassify workers as independent contractors       or pay them ``off the books'' to the disadvantage of       responsible employers. We believe this legislation will serve       as an incentive for worker misclassification to defeat       employment and labor law, as well as facilitate tax       avoidance.        Because the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers       Protection Act (MSAWPA) refers to the definition of       ``employ'' in the FLSA, H.R. 3441 will have an adverse effect       on the ability of workers covered by the MSAWPA to       effectively enforce child labor laws, and seek redress for       wage theft and other employment abuses.        Again, H.R. 3441 would leave worker protections weaker than       when Congress adopted the FLSA in 1938.        This legislation will fuel a race to the bottom for       workers' rights, wages, benefits and workings conditions.       Working men and women have fought long and hard for the       rights and protections they now have under the National Labor       Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. H.R. 3441 is       another in a series of intensifying attacks by those who want       to return to the era when working men and women were without       rights, protections, and a voice in the workplace.        You will fail these workers if you do not reject H.R. 3441.       I hope I can tell our members that you stood with them and       other workers in their efforts to achieve and maintain       meaningful worker rights and protections. The Teamsters Union       urges you to vote no on H.R. 3441.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa.                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R.  3441. Let's get back to fighting for the people we were sent here to  serve.
