 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6348) to adjust the real estate appraisal thresholds under  the section 504 program to bring them into line with the thresholds  used by the Federal banking regulators, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6348         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Access to       Capital and Efficiency Act'' or the ``Small Business ACE       Act''.       SEC. 2. APPRAISAL THRESHOLDS.         Section 502(3)(E)(ii) of the Small Business Investment Act       of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 696(3)(E)(ii)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subclauses (I) and (II) as items (aa)       and (bb), respectively, and adjusting the margins of such       items accordingly;        (2) by striking ``With respect to'' and inserting the       following:         ``(I) In general.--With respect to'';         (3) in item (aa), as so redesignated, by striking ``is more       than $250,000'' and inserting ``is more than the Federal       banking regulator appraisal threshold'';        (4) in item (bb), as so redesignated, by striking ``is       $250,000 or less'' and inserting ``is equal to or less than       the Federal banking regulator appraisal threshold''; and        (5) by adding at the end the following:         ``(II) Federal banking regulator appraisal threshold       defined.--For purposes of this clause, the term `Federal       banking regulator appraisal threshold' means the lesser of       the threshold amounts set by the Board of Governors of the       Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and       the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for when a       federally related transaction that is a commercial real       estate transaction requires an appraisal prepared by a State       licensed or certified appraiser.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House Small Business Committee strives to create an  environment where small businesses can thrive and create jobs.  Unfortunately, small businesses are often hampered by conflicting  Federal rules and regulations. This is the case when it comes to the  appraisal threshold for commercial real estate.   Earlier this year, Federal financial regulators, including the  Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, increased the commercial  real estate appraisal threshold from $250,000 to $500,000.  Unfortunately, the Small Business Administration's threshold for the  real estate-heavy 504/CDC loan program is set in statute at $250,000.  The conflicting numbers produce confusion for and burdens on small  business owners and the organizations that strive to assist them.   H.R. 6348, the Small Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act,  also known as the Small Business ACE Act, modernizes and benchmarks the  SBA's 504/CDC threshold value with the value set by the Federal  financial regulators. This commonsense legislation will prevent future  threshold changes from hampering small businesses that utilize SBA's  many lending products.   I want to thank Mr. Curtis of Utah for leading the efforts on this  bill, as well as Ranking Member Velazquez  [[Page H8803]]  and Mr. Evans. It has broad bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6348, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for her  indications that we work very much in a bipartisan manner in our  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Curtis), whom I thank for his leadership in this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for his leadership on this.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, to conclude, the SBA's 504/CDC loan program is vital to  many creditworthy small businesses that cannot obtain credit elsewhere.  To reduce confusion from conflicting Federal rules, H.R. 6348 will  update and bring SBA's commercial real estate threshold to the same  level as other Federal financial regulators.                                time  1700    We must continue to work together to free small business owners from  conflicting Federal regulations. I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan reform instituted in H.R. 6348.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6347) to adjust the real estate appraisal thresholds under  the 7(a) program to bring them into line with the thresholds used by  the Federal banking regulators, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6347         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``7(a) Real Estate Appraisal       Harmonization Act''.       SEC. 2. APPRAISAL THRESHOLDS.         Section 7(a)(29) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       636(a)(29)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as clauses       (i) and (ii), respectively, and adjusting the margins of such       clauses accordingly;        (2) by striking ``With respect to'' and inserting the       following:        ``(A) In general.--With respect to'';        (3) in clause (i), as so redesignated, by striking ``for       more than $250,000'' and inserting ``, if such loan is in an       amount greater than the Federal banking regulator appraisal       threshold'';        (4) in clause (ii), as so redesignated, by striking ``for       $250,000 or less'' and inserting ``, if such loan is in an       amount equal to or  [[Page H8804]]       less than the Federal banking regulator appraisal       threshold''; and        (5) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) Federal banking regulator appraisal threshold       defined.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term `Federal       banking regulator appraisal threshold' means the lesser of       the threshold amounts set by the Board of Governors of the       Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and       the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for when a       federally related transaction that is a commercial real       estate transaction requires an appraisal prepared by a State       licensed or certified appraiser.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, similar to the SBA's 504/CDC loan program, the SBA's  7(a) loan program assists small businesses that have a business plan in  place for success but do not have the ability to obtain credit  elsewhere. Through a partnership with financial institutions, the SBA  provides a government guarantee to help the small business grow and  create jobs. Importantly, this program has been running on zero cost to  the American taxpayers for years.   While the economy has been improving, conflicting Federal rules and  regulations often present uncertainty and confusion for small  businesses and those within the 7(a) loan program.   When an SBA 7(a) loan is used in a commercial real estate  transaction, a formal State licensed or certified appraisal is  statutorily required on all transactions above $250,000. However, the  value set by Federal financial regulators has recently been increased  from $250,000 to $500,000. To provide clarity for small businesses,  H.R. 6347 modernizes and mirrors the SBA's commercial real estate  appraisal threshold with the value set by Federal financial regulators.   Similar to H.R. 6348, H.R. 6347 does not provide an exact dollar  threshold. Rather, it ties the SBA's 7(a) threshold to the value set by  Federal financial regulators. This benchmark provision will prevent  conflict as the threshold value is updated in the future.   I would like to thank Mr. Evans and Mr. Curtis for working in a  bipartisan manner to find a solution to this problem that is impacting  small businesses. The bill has broad bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6347, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to commend the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for his leadership on this bill.   Small businesses do not employ an army of tax and accounting  specialists. All too often, the small business owner must sacrifice  time and energy away from growing his or her business to comply with  Federal rules and regulations. While we are making progress on reducing  regulations, at times, Federal rules conflict.   As we have heard today, H.R. 6347 aims to reduce the confusion that  exists for small businesses that utilize the Small Business  Administration's 7(a) loan program when it comes to the commercial real  estate appraisal threshold.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan updates  proposed in this measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6316) to clarify the primary functions and duties of the  Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6316         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Advocacy       Improvements Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES OF THE                     OFFICE OF ADVOCACY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS                     ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Primary Functions.--Section 202 of Public Law 94-305       (15 U.S.C. 634b) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``and the international       economy'' after ``economy'';        (2) in paragraph (9), by striking ``complete'' and       inserting ``compete''; and        (3) in paragraph (12), by striking ``serviced-disabled''       and inserting ``service-disabled''.

[[Page H8805]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6316, the Small Business Advocacy  Improvements Act of 2018, which clarifies the role of the Office of  Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration.   The Office of Advocacy is charged with representing small businesses  before Federal agencies whose policies and activities may affect small  businesses. It also examines the role of small business in the American  economy and the contributions small businesses can make in improving  competition. This office plays a vital role in ensuring that small  businesses are heard when the Federal Government makes policy decisions  that will impact them.   Currently, the law is silent regarding the Office of Advocacy's  ability to study the role of small business in international economies,  which is an important avenue for small businesses as they seek  opportunities to expand overseas. This bill would clarify that the  Office of Advocacy should include international economies as part of  its research functions.   The law is also silent regarding the Office of Advocacy's authority  to represent small businesses before foreign governments and  international entities. It is important for small businesses to have  their views and interests on regulatory and trade initiatives  represented in the international space.   This bill clarifies the Office of Advocacy's ability to represent  small business views and interests before foreign governments and other  international entities for the purpose of contributing to regulatory  and trade initiatives.   I want to thank Mr. Comer and Ms. Adams for working on this issue and  producing a simple solution to clarify the Office of Advocacy's role.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), and I thank him for his leadership  on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to, again, thank Mr. Comer and Ms. Adams  for their leadership on this measure.   The Office of Advocacy is a critical Federal agency charged with  representing America's 30 million small firms across the Federal  Government. They have done outstanding work on behalf of our Nation's  small businesses. But as we have discussed, current law is silent on  whether it can research and advocate on behalf of small business on  international matters. This bipartisan legislation offers a simple  solution to allow the Office of Advocacy to expand their role in  international matters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6330) to amend the Small Business Act to modify the method  for prescribing size standards for business concerns.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6330         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

MODIFICATION TO METHOD FOR PRESCRIBING SIZE STANDARDS                     FOR BUSINESS CONCERNS.         Section 3(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II)) is amended by striking ``3       years'' and inserting ``5 years''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H8806]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Knight and Ms. Clarke for this leading  bipartisan legislation, which takes a critical step toward addressing  the challenge that small contractors face when entering the middle  market.   The primary objective of the SBA's small business programs is to  encourage the growth and vibrancy of the Federal supplier base, boost  competition, protect against supplier consolidation, and spur  innovation. These noble goals are thwarted when small businesses find  themselves competing in the open market prematurely before they have  the tools they need to succeed.   Given the increasing size of Federal contract awards made today, one  or two big awards won by a small contractor could easily force them out  of the category of small business. Since many do not have the  infrastructure or competitiveness to go head to head against firms many  times their size, they often fail or become consumed into a larger  competitor's supply chain. These results contravene the mission and  purpose of the small business programs, further widening the divide  between large and small contractors.   Competitiveness takes time, hard work, and significant resources to  build. However, difficult as it is to build competitiveness, it is just  as easily lost. H.R. 6330 provides a solution to this problem, allowing  small businesses extra time to potentially retain their ``small'' size  status while they continue to develop their competitive edge.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6330, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Knight) and thank him for his leadership  in this important measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation gives small businesses more time to  adjust to not being a small business anymore. We want our small  businesses to thrive and grow and break through to the mid-tier and big  business strata. Oftentimes, that is difficult.   H.R. 6330 gives these firms just a little more time to adapt to their  new business environment, so they can compete more efficiently and  continue to grow and create more jobs for more Americans.   I again thank Mr. Knight for his leadership on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6367) to amend the Small Business Act to specify what credit  is given for certain subcontractors and to provide a dispute process  for non-payment to subcontractors, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6367         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Incentivizing Fairness in       Subcontracting Act''.       SEC. 2. SMALL BUSINESS LOWER-TIER SUBCONTRACTING.         Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d))       is amended--        (1) by amending paragraph (16) to read as follows:        ``(16) Credit for certain small business concern       subcontractors.--        ``(A) In general.--For purposes of determining whether or       not a prime contractor has attained the percentage goals       specified in paragraph (6)--        ``(i) if the subcontracting goals pertain only to a single       contract with the Federal agency, the prime contractor may       elect to receive credit for small business concerns       performing as first tier subcontractors or subcontractors at       any tier pursuant to the subcontracting plans required under       paragraph (6)(D) in an amount equal to the dollar value of       work awarded to such small business concerns; and        ``(ii) if the subcontracting goals pertain to more than one       contract with one or more Federal agencies, or to one       contract with more than one Federal agency, the prime       contractor may only count first tier subcontractors that are       small business concerns.        ``(B) Collection and review of data on subcontracting       plans.--The head of each contracting agency shall ensure       that--        ``(i) the agency collects and reports data on the extent to       which contractors of the agency meet the goals and objectives       set forth in subcontracting plans submitted pursuant to this       subsection; and        ``(ii) the agency periodically reviews data collected and       reported pursuant to subparagraph  [[Page H8807]]       (A) for the purpose of ensuring that such contractors comply       in good faith with the requirements of this subsection and       subcontracting plans submitted by the contractors pursuant to       this subsection.        ``(C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph       shall permit lower-tier subcontracting goaling requirements       of prime contractors that are eligible to receive lower-tier       subcontracting credit under this paragraph.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(18) Dispute process for non-payment to subcontractors.--        ``(A) Notice to agency.--With respect to a contract with a       Federal agency, a subcontractor of a prime contractor on such       contract may, if the subcontractor has not received payment       for work performed within 90 days of the completion of such       work, notify the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business       Utilization (`OSDBU') of the Federal agency and the prime       contractor of such lack of payment, if such notice is       provided to the agency within the 15-day period following the       end of such 90 days.        ``(B) Agency determination.--        ``(i) In general.--Upon receipt of a notice described under       subparagraph (A), the OSDBU shall verify whether such lack of       payment has occurred and determine whether such lack of       payment is due to an undue restriction placed on the prime       contractor by an action of the Federal agency.        ``(ii) Response during determination.--During the period in       which the OSDBU is making the determination under clause (i),       the prime contractor may respond to both the subcontractor       and the OSDBU with relevant verifying documentation to either       prove payment or allowable status of nonpayment.        ``(C) Cure period.--If the OSDBU verifies the lack of       payment under subparagraph (B) and determines that such lack       of payment is not due to an action of the Federal agency, the       OSDBU shall notify the prime contractor and provide the prime       contractor with a 15-day period in which the prime contractor       may make the payment owed to the subcontractor.        ``(D) Result of nonpayment.--If, after notifying the prime       contractor under subparagraph (C), the OSDBU determines that       the prime contractor has not fully paid the amount owed       within the 15-day cure period described under subparagraph       (C), the OSDBU shall ensure that such failure to pay is       reflected in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting       system.''.       SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS WITH RESPECT TO CREDIT UNDER A                     SUBCONTRACTING PLAN.         Section 8(d)(6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       637(d)(6)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (G) and (H) as       subparagraphs (H) and (I), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the following:        ``(G) a recitation of the types of records the successful       offeror or bidder will maintain to demonstrate that       procedures have been adopted to substantiate the credit the       successful offeror or bidder will elect to receive under       paragraph (16)(A)(i);''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before we begin discussion of this legislation, I would  like to thank Mr. Lawson from Florida and Mr. Kelly from Mississippi  for their leadership in addressing an issue that is a cause of great  concern for small subcontractors; namely, prime contractor compliance  with their subcontracting plans.   Large prime contractors have a statutory obligation to develop and  submit a subcontracting plan as part of their bid and proposal package.  In this plan, prime contractors are required to outline their intention  to award a certain percentage of subcontracting dollars to small  businesses.   Unfortunately, it has been a challenge to ensure that prime  contractors are held accountable to these plans. Recently, the  Department of Defense Inspector General's Office issued a report that  found post-award compliance activities, specifically the oversight of  subcontracting plans, is not a high priority for contracting officers.  This finding is not limited to the military and can be generalized to  apply across the Federal Government.   As the number of prime contracts suitable for small business  continues to decline, subcontracting becomes increasingly important for  small contractors trying to gain a foothold in the Federal market.   H.R. 6367, as amended, proposes to strengthen subcontracting measures  by requiring large primes to maintain records proving they are  subcontracting to small businesses, as required by their subcontracting  plans.   Furthermore, this bill establishes an alternative avenue of redress  for small subcontractors, allowing them to engage the appropriate  Federal agency's small business advocate office if they believe payment  is being withheld unfairly by a large prime contractor.   Because of these important measures undertaken to protect small  contractors, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6367, as amended. I  also, again, thank my colleagues for their leadership in this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this  particular legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, as we have discussed, there are less prime contracting  opportunities that are available for small businesses nowadays. It is  in the subcontracting arena that is often the best and only way for a  small contractor to engage with the Federal Government, but the lack of  accountability and Federal oversight harms small subcontractors that  rely on these opportunities to survive.   This is a lose-lose situation for both America's small businesses  seeking to do work for the Federal Government and for the government  itself. We want our citizens to get the best bang for their buck, and  the more competition there is, the better it is for all of us. The  greater oversight reforms in this legislation take a big step in  ensuring small firms are protected.   I once again thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lawson) for his  leadership on this measure, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6368) to encourage R&D small business set-asides, to  encourage SBIR and STTR participants to serve as mentors under the  Small Business Administration's mentor-protege program, to promote the  use of interagency contracts, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6368         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. PROMOTING THE USE OF GOVERNMENT-WIDE AND OTHER                     INTERAGENCY CONTRACTS.         (a) Promoting Interagency Acquisitions.--Section 865 of the       Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(1)--        (A) by striking ``all interagency acquisitions'';        (B) in subparagraph (A)--        (i) by adding ``all interagency assisted acquisitions''       before ``include''; and        (ii) by adding ``and'' at the end;        (C) by striking subparagraph (B);        (D) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (B);        (E) in subparagraph (B), as so redesignated, by adding       ``all interagency assisted acquisitions'' before ``include'';       and        (2) in subsection (d), by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) The term `assisted acquisition' means a type of       interagency acquisition where a servicing agency performs       acquisition activities on a requesting agency's behalf, such       as awarding and administering a contract, task order, or       delivery order.''.        (b) GSA Assistance With Certain Small Business Contract       Awards.--        Section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638), as       amended by section 4, is further amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(uu) GSA Assistance With Certain Small Business Contract       Awards.--The Administrator of the General Services       Administration may assist another agency with the process of       awarding a contract to a small business concern under the       SBIR or STTR program or under a small business set-aside.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation was introduced by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat) and cosponsored by the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), so it is bipartisan. I  thank the gentlemen, both of them, for their leadership on this  important issue.   This legislation would make small but important changes to the Small  Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, and the Small Business  Technology Transfer, or STTR, programs.   A healthy and vibrant Federal marketplace is important to our Nation.  Competition breeds innovation, which is critical in our national  defense to save lives on the battlefield or healthcare advancements to  improve and prolong lives.   The SBIR and STTR programs are often one of the first places small  innovators and manufacturers venture into the Federal contracting  arena. The process can be daunting for small firms completely new to  contracting with the Federal Government.   H.R. 6368 provides an avenue for more experienced SBIR and STTR  companies to mentor newer companies to help them adjust to how the  Federal Government does business. By doing so, it aims to strengthen  the industrial base by bringing new firms into the contracting process.   The bill also rewards mentors with a past-performance rating boost so  they can be more advantaged when applying for a full research and  development set-aside or sole-source contracts going forward outside of  the program.   Additionally, this legislation provides clarity in the use of  government-side interagency acquisitions permitted through the fiscal  year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, by updating and  harmonizing the terminology used in acquisitions.   Finally, the bill expressly allows the GSA, General Services  Administration, to assist agencies with contract awards and vehicle  creation for small businesses receiving sole-source or set-aside  contracts in the SBIR and STTR programs.  [[Page H8809]]    Historically, there have been lengthy delays in the programs at  various stages, including award notification, payment, and advancement.  The bill aims to reduce these delays by allowing the GSA to assist  participating agencies in the SBIR and STTR contract creation and  management.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, September 18, 2018.      Hon.

This bill       contains provisions within the jurisdiction of the Committee       on Oversight and Government Reform. As a result of your       having consulted with me concerning the provisions of the       bill that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to       forgo consideration of the bill, so the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 6368,       we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter       contained in this or similar legislation, and we will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining       issues within our Rule X jurisdiction. Further, I request       your support for the appointment of conferees from the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any       House-Senate conference on this or related legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Committee on Small Business, as well as in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,      Trey Gowdy.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: In reference to your letter of       September 18, 2018, I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 6368, the ``Encouraging Small       Business Innovators Act of 2018.''        I appreciate the House Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform's waiver of consideration of provisions       under its jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in       your letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only       to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6368 and does not in       any way waive or diminish the House Committee on Oversight       and Government Reform's jurisdictional interests over this or       similar legislation. I will support a request from the House       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for appointment       to any House-Senate conference on H.R. 6368 or similar       legislation.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Chabot,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                Washington, DC, September 18, 2018.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Chairman, Committee on Small Business,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 6368,       ``Encouraging Small Business Innovators,'' which was ordered       reported by your Committee on July 18, 2018.        H.R. 6368 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a       result of your having consulted with the Committee and in       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and request that you include a copy of       this letter and your response in the Congressional Record       during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2018.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: In reference to your letter of       September 18, 2018, I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 6368, the ``Encouraging Small       Business Innovators Act of 2018.''        I appreciate the House Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology's waiver of consideration of provisions under its       jurisdiction and its subject matter as specified in your       letter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to       expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6368 and does not in any       way waive or diminish the House Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology's jurisdictional interests over this or       similar legislation. I will support a request from the House       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for appointment       to any House-Senate conference on H.R. 6368 or similar       legislation.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Chabot,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I, first of all, thank the gentlewoman, the ranking  member, for her leadership on this, and Mr. Espaillat, as well, and Mr.  Norman for working together in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, the SBIR and STTR play pivotal roles in the development  of new technologies while giving Federal agencies innovative and cost- effective ways to solve operational problems. They are highly popular  and have helped thousands of small businesses create new technologies,  commercialize their ideas, and generate new jobs.   The reforms contained in H.R. 6368 will bring more firms into the  programs and make it easier for them to win contracts. This is a win- win for small businesses and the Federal Government as competition  breeds innovation, and innovation leads to saving taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and  commonsense reforms of H.R. 6368, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6369) to amend the Small Business Act to eliminate the  inclusion of option years in the award price for sole source contracts,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6369         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. REMOVAL OF ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION UPON                     IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS.         Effective upon the notification described under section 3,       the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 8(m)--        (A) in paragraph (7)--        (i) in subparagraph (C), by adding ``and'' at the end;        (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking the semicolon at the       end and inserting a period; and        (iii) by striking subparagraphs (E) and (F); and        (B) in paragraph (8)--        (i) in subparagraph (C), by adding ``and'' at the end;        (ii) in subparagraph (D), by striking the semicolon at the       end and inserting a period; and        (iii) by striking subparagraphs (E) and (F); and        (2) in section 36(a)--        (A) in paragraph (3), by adding ``and'' at the end;        (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the semicolon at the end       and inserting a period; and        (C) by striking paragraphs (5) and (6).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Dr. Marshall and Mr. Schneider for  their leadership on this bill.   The Small Business Act currently allows Federal agencies to award  sole-source contracts to women-owned; service-disabled veteran-owned;  HUBZone; and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses.  However, these awards can only be made in the narrowest of  circumstances, rightly protecting the ability of small businesses to  compete against each other.   Even though Federal contracting officers have this procurement tool  in their toolbox, the reality is that small business sole-source  contracting is rare and may be underutilized. This can, in part, be  attributed to the fact that the maximum dollar threshold for Federal  sole-source contracts designated in statute has fallen far behind the  typical size of contract awards made today.   As contracts increase in size and scope, the usefulness of small  business sole-source contracts diminishes, to the detriment of small  contractors eligible to receive such awards.   H.R. 6369, as amended, adjusts the dollar threshold to actually  reflect the size of contracts that are commonly used across the  government today. This modest change will provide agencies with an  accessible pathway to achieving their small business goals in  categories they have historically been unable to meet.   Additionally, and importantly, this bill institutes a new oversight  process which will help reduce the chances of sole-source awards being  made to ineligible firms by requiring positive confirmation by the  Small Business Administration that this small business is, in fact,  eligible to receive the award before it is issued by the Federal  agency.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6369, as amended, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the leader on this particular  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides greater opportunities for women- owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, and socially and  economically disadvantaged small businesses.   Additionally, it will help Federal agencies achieve and exceed their  small business goals. It reinforces oversight, and gives Federal  agencies a greater motivation to work with small firms.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan and  commonsense reforms in H.R. 6369, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6382) to amend the Small Business Act to require the  Administrator of the Small Business Administration to report certain  information to the Congress and to the President, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6382         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clarity on Small Business       Participation in Category Management Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING.         Section 15(h) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(h))       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Best in class small business participation       reporting.--        ``(A) Addendum.--The Administrator, in addition to the       requirements under paragraph (2), shall include in the report       required by such paragraph, for each best in class       designation--        ``(i) the total amount of spending government wide in such       designation;        ``(ii) the number of small business concerns awarded       contracts and the dollar amount of contracts within such       category awarded to each of the following--         ``(I) HUBZone small business concerns;        ``(II) small business concerns owned and controlled by       women;        ``(III) small business concerns owned and controlled by       service-disabled veterans; and        ``(IV) socially and economically disadvantaged small       business concerns.         ``(B) Best in class.--The term `best in class' has the       meaning given to it by the Director of the Office of       Management and Budget.        ``(C) Effective date.--The Administrator shall be required       to report on the information described by subparagraph (A)       beginning on the date that such information is available in       the Federal Procurement Data System, the System for Award       Management, or any successor to such systems.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to thank Ms. Adams for leading this important piece of  legislation.   Category management is a procurement initiative that is currently  being rolled out across the Federal Government. It can be a positive  tool, allowing the Federal Government to better understand its  purchasing habits and identify cost savings where appropriate. However,  setting mandatory targets to manage agency spending may result in  unintended consequences.   Specifically, there is concern that this initiative may have the  effect of reducing competition to only a few select vendors. As we  continue to see increased use of these best-in-class vehicles by  Federal agencies, it is important to remember that it is not the job of  the government to pick winners and losers. We must be vigilant and  ensure that maximum opportunities are given to small businesses, even  as we continue to pursue cost savings across the Federal Government.   H.R. 6382, as amended, takes that critical first step by tracking the  potential impacts of category management on small businesses. The bill  requires the SBA to report exactly how much of these dollars spent  through best-in-class vehicles are awarded to small businesses.  Obtaining this data and identifying trends or patterns affecting small  businesses will become increasingly important as category management  continues to be used in years to come.   This is a commonsense piece of oversight legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ms. Adams for her leadership on  this measure and congratulate her for its passage here shortly.   This legislation raises the profile of this important issue and  requires that the SBA keep track of how much Federal spending is made  through best-in-class vehicles. I applaud the administration for  looking for ways to ensure taxpayer dollars are utilized in the most  efficient ways possible.   At the same time, we must be watchful to safeguard small businesses'  proper importance and place in the Federal marketplace. Enacting this  legislation will help ensure that the correct data is collected and  reported to help maintain that balance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 791) to amend the Small Business Act to expand intellectual  property education and training for small businesses, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 791         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Innovation       Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act--        (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of       the SBA;        (2) the term ``Director'' means the Under Secretary of       Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO;  [[Page H8814]]         (3) the term ``SBA'' means the Small Business       Administration;        (4) the term ``small business concern'' has the meaning       given the term in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632(a));        (5) the term ``small business development center'' means a       center described in section 21 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 648); and        (6) the term ``USPTO'' means the United States Patent and       Trademark Office.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the USPTO and the SBA are positioned to--        (A) build upon several successful intellectual property and       training programs aimed at small business concerns; and        (B) increase the availability of and the participation in       the programs described in subparagraph (A) across the United       States; and        (2) any education and training program administered by the       USPTO and the SBA should be scalable so that the program is       able to reach more small business concerns.

(a) In General.--Beginning not later than 180 days after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in       consultation with the Director, shall develop partnership       agreements that--        (1) provide for the--        (A) development of high-quality training, including in-      person or modular training sessions, for small business       concerns relating to domestic and international protection of       intellectual property;        (B) leveraging of training materials already developed for       the education of inventors and small business concerns; and        (C) participation of a nongovernmental organization; and        (2) provide training--        (A) through electronic resources, including Internet-based       webinars; and        (B) at physical locations, including--        (i) a small business development center; and        (ii) the headquarters or a regional office of the USPTO.       SEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS.         Section 21(c)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       648(c)(3)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (S), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (T), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(U) in conjunction with the United States Patent and       Trademark Office, providing training--        ``(i) to small business concerns relating to--        ``(I) domestic and international intellectual property       protections; and        ``(II) how the protections described in subclause (I)       should be considered in the business plans and growth       strategies of the small business concerns; and        ``(ii) that may be delivered--        ``(I) in person; or        ``(II) through a website.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 791, the Small Business  Innovation Protection Act of 2017.   As small-business entrepreneurs continue to expand both here and  abroad, they must have the tools they need to protect their  intellectual property. However, the process for obtaining intellectual  property protections both in the U.S. and abroad can be daunting, even  for the most experienced small-business owner.   We must ensure that small-business owners have the tools they need to  protect their innovative ideas and products, as intellectual property  protections are essential to promoting entrepreneurship and innovation.   Small-business owners often do not have the resources to protect  their ideas and products, especially when they are competing in the  international marketplace. Most simply cannot afford to retain  attorneys to guide them through the difficult process of obtaining  intellectual property protections, which leaves them vulnerable to  their innovative ideas and products being stolen both here in the  United States and internationally.   This legislation addresses this issue by developing a partnership  between the Small Business Administration, the SBA, and the United  States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, giving entrepreneurs the  full breadth of knowledge of a Small Business Development Center system  and the USPTO.   The bill utilizes existing resources at both agencies to better  assist small-business owners and expand their outreach efforts to  provide small businesses with the resources they need to address  intellectual property issues.   Considering the important role that small-business entrepreneurs play  in our global marketplace, it is our responsibility to ensure that they  have the resources they need to better protect their intellectual  property.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Chairman, Committee on Small Business,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Chabot, I write with respect to S. 791, the       ``Small Business Innovation Protection Act.'' As a result of       your having consulted with us on provisions within S. 791       that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       the Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this       bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor       for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of S. 791 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to S. 791 and would ask that       a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of S.       791.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: In reference to your letter of       September 20, 2018, I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding S. 791, the ``Small Business       Innovation Protection Act of 2017.''        I appreciate the House Committee on the Judiciary's waiver       of consideration of provisions under its jurisdiction and its       subject matter as specified in your letter. I acknowledge       that the waiver was granted only to expedite floor       consideration of S. 791 and does not in any way waive or       diminish the House Committee on the Judiciary's       jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation. I       will support a request from the House Committee on the       Judiciary for appointment to any House-Senate conference on       S. 791 or similar legislation.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                                      Steve Chabot,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 791 is the Senate counterpart to legislation  spearheaded on the House side by Mr. Evans and Mr. Fitzpatrick, both of  Pennsylvania. Once again, it is bipartisan legislation coming out of  the Small Business Committee.   That bill, H.R. 2655, was also reported unanimously out of our  committee this spring. I commend them on their work on this important  issue.   This legislation helps small businesses receive better access to  education and training opportunities both domestically and abroad.   A partnership between the Small Business Administration and the USPTO  would help more small-business owners learn how they can use  intellectual property to protect their ideas and products. This  important partnership between the two agencies will help to reach more  small-business owners and better prepare them for doing business both  here and abroad.   It is vital that small-business owners have as many tools and  resources as possible to help protect their innovative ideas from  intellectual property theft.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just advise the gentlewoman not to  get ahead of herself there. It ain't happened yet, and I don't think it  is going to happen. But nonetheless, we have had a wonderful working  relationship over the years. I have been the chair; I have been the  ranking member. The gentlewoman from New York has been the chair and  the ranking member. We would like to keep it just the way it is now,  but we will see in about 6 weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I have already given the closing statement, so I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6758) to direct the Under Secretary of Commerce for  Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and  Trademark Office, in consultation with the Administrator of the Small  Business Administration, to study and provide recommendations to  promote the participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurship  activities and the patent system, to extend by 8 years the Patent and  Trademark Office's authority to set the amounts for the fees it  charges, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6758         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Study of Underrepresented       Classes Chasing Engineering and Science Success Act of 2018''       or the ``SUCCESS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Patents and other forms of intellectual property are       important engines of innovation, invention, and economic       growth.        (2) Many innovative small businesses, which create over 20       percent of the total number of new jobs created in the United       States each year, depend on patent protections to       commercialize new technologies.        (3) Universities and their industry partners also rely on       patent protections to transfer innovative new technologies       from the laboratory or classroom to commercial use.        (4) Recent studies have shown that there is a significant       gap in the number of patents applied for and obtained by       women and minorities.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the United States has the responsibility to work with the       private sector to close the gap in the number of patents       applied for and obtained by women and minorities to harness       the maximum innovative potential and continue to promote       United States leadership in the global economy.       SEC. 3. REPORT.         (a) Study.--The Director, in consultation with the       Administrator and any other head of an appropriate agency,       shall conduct a study that--        (1) identifies publicly available data on the number of       patents annually applied for and obtained by, and the       benefits of increasing the number of patents applied for and       obtained by women, minorities, and veterans and small       businesses owned by women, minorities, and veterans; and        (2) provides legislative recommendations for how to--        (A) promote the participation of women, minorities, and       veterans in entrepreneurship activities; and        (B) increase the number of women, minorities, and veterans       who apply for and obtain patents.        (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the       Committees on the Judiciary and Small Business of the House       of Representatives and the Committees on the Judiciary and       Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate a report on       the results of the study conducted under subsection (a).       SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF FEE-SETTING AUTHORITY.         Section 10(i)(2) of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act       (Public Law 112-29; 125 Stat. 319; 35 U.S.C. 41 note) is       amended by striking ``7-year'' and inserting ``15-year''.       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the Small Business Administration.        (2) Agency.--The term ``agency'' means a department,       agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government.        (3) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Under       Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director       of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6758, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6758, the SUCCESS Act.   Back in 2011, I was one of five Members of Congress who cosponsored  the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act that the President eventually  signed into law. In it, a provision was included to provide the  Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the  authority to set fees to cover the cost of examining patent  applications and registering trademarks.   Today, as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I  recognize the need to extend that authority another 8 years.   The PTO plays a critical role in the development of new technologies.  The agency operates on fees it collects from patent and trademark  applicants. To ensure that the PTO has the resources it needs to  properly examine patent applications and register trademarks to study  the issue of patenting by women, minority, and veteran entrepreneurs,  and to perform the countless other activities it undertakes that are  essential to maintaining America's competitiveness, Congress needs to  reauthorize the PTO's authority to adjust its fees.  [[Page H8816]]    Additionally, we need to ensure that every American with a great new  idea has access to the tools necessary for success in order for our  Nation to realize its full potential and to secure an even brighter  economic future for ourselves and our children.   The SUCCESS Act helps us achieve that goal by requiring that the PTO  provide recommendations to Congress on how to increase the  participation of women, minorities, and veterans in entrepreneurship  activities in the patent system.   While American ingenuity is unparalleled, recent reports indicate  that we have not tapped into all that the American people have to  offer. Those reports indicate that while U.S. women earn almost half of  all undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, and an estimated  39 percent of all new Ph.D.s in those fields, it appears that only  between 10 percent and 20 percent of innovators listed on patents are  women. A 2017 study showed that racial minorities fair even worse.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank Representatives  Comstock and Adams for introducing language that served as the  inspiration for the study included in H.R. 6758. I want to also thank  my fellow members on the Judiciary and Small Business Committees for  being original cosponsors of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close, and I will be very brief.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank the gentleman from Georgia  for his hard work on this legislation. We worked together on a number  of bills in the past, and I really do appreciate the bipartisan effort  in this area.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5075) to encourage, enhance, and integrate Ashanti Alert  plans throughout the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5075         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States,       the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,       the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and       the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.        (3) Ashanti alert.--The term ``Ashanti Alert'' means an       alert issued through the Ashanti Alert communications       network, related to a missing adult.       SEC. 3. ASHANTI ALERT COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.         (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall, subject to the       availability of appropriations, establish a national       communications network, to be known as the Ashanti Alert       communications network, within the Department of Justice to       provide assistance to regional and local search efforts for       missing adults through the initiation, facilitation, and       promotion of local elements of the network (referred to in       this Act as ``Ashanti Alert plans''), in coordination with       States, units of local government, law enforcement agencies,       and other concerned entities with expertise in providing       services to adults.        (b) Integration With Blue Alert Communications Network.--In       establishing the Ashanti Alert communications network under       subsection (a), the Attorney General shall integrate the       Ashanti Alert communications network into the Blue Alert       communications network established under the Rafael Ramos and       Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015 (34 U.S.C. 50501       et seq.), to maximize the efficiency of both networks.       SEC. 4. ASHANTI ALERT COORDINATOR.

SEC. 8. EMERGENCY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE.         Section 609Y(a) of the Justice Assistance Act of 1984 (34       U.S.C. 50112(a)) is amended by striking ``September 30,       2021'' and inserting ``September 30, 2022''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 5075, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we will vote today on H.R. 5075, the Ashanti Alert Act  of 2018. This bill establishes a national alert network for missing  adults at the Department of Justice. It will allow law enforcement to  coordinate the use of communication systems to alert the public that an  adult is missing.   In order to issue an alert, the missing adult must either suffer from  a proven mental or physical disability, or law enforcement must certify  the person's physical safety may be in danger, or their disappearance  was not voluntary.   This Ashanti national alert network will be integrated into the  existing Blue Alert system. The Blue Alert system issues alerts to  notify the public of nearby suspects or threats to their community's  law enforcement officials.   This legislation will also allow the Attorney General to designate a  national coordinator to work with States to establish alert systems for  missing adults and to develop voluntary guidelines States may use in  creating their networks.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Scott Taylor for introducing this  legislation. We appreciate Mr. Taylor being here today and appreciate  his leadership in this effort.   I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. It was my  understanding that the gentlewoman would like to participate in a  colloquy.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    The gentlewoman is correct. This outreach to tribes shall  be conducted in the same manner as the Blue Alert program, yes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, on behalf of all Members of the House, I  would like to offer my condolences to the family of Ashanti.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Taylor for his leadership in proposing this  very important legislation. Hopefully, other people will benefit from  its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
