 Madam President, when the Constitution was written, there  were some fundamental principles which were included, and one of them  said that any declaration of war in the United States had to have the  approval of the American people through their elected representatives  in Congress. It was an awesome responsibility and an important one. I  think it was the right responsibility given to the people through their  elected representatives.   After World War II, there were several engagements by the American  military without such declaration of war. Those were, of course,  controversial and debated, but I am sure you recall and I do, too,  October of the year 2002, when this Senate was called on, with the  House of Representatives, to consider the invasion of Iraq and the  authorization of use of military force for that purpose.   We may have forgotten by now, 20 years later, but I remember very  vividly the fearsome national debate over whether this Nation, having  been hit by 9/11, needed to invade Iraq.   The rationale was weapons of mass destruction were present in Iraq,  threatening not only nations in the Middle East, which were our friends  and allies, but even threatening the United States of America.   That threat, weapons of mass destruction, was beaten into our heads  day after day. But many of us were skeptical, and the vote came on the  floor of the Senate, I recall, in October of 2002. It happened late at  night. And at the end of the day, there were 23 of us--1 Republican and  22 Democrats--who voted against that authorization for the use of  military force in Iraq.   I look back on it, as I am sure others do, as one of the most  important votes  [[Page S811]]  that I ever cast. It was not only a decision about going to war, but it  was a false argument that weapons of mass destruction were threatening  anyone.   After invading and after making the commitment of the American  military force, along with our allies, no weapons of mass destruction  were ever found in Iraq. It was a lie perpetrated by those who wanted  to drag the United States into the Middle East for a long-term  commitment and a dubious threat to our country.   The repeal of this authorization of use of military force does not  mean the United States has become a pacifist nation. It means that the  United States is going to be a constitutional nation, and the premise  of our Founding Fathers will be respected.   If there is cause for us to use military force in the future, we  should properly follow that Constitution and let the American people  have their own voice in this process through their elected  representatives in Congress. I am cosponsoring and fully support  removal of this authorization of use of military force and believe it  is consistent with the vote many of us cast in 2002 against that  premise.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman) are  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Jessica G.L. Clarke to the U.S. District Court for the Southern  District of New York.   Born in Akron, OH, Ms. Clarke received her B.A. from Northwestern  University in 2001 and earned her J.D. from The Ohio State University  Moritz College of Law in 2008. She then clerked for Judge Solomon  Oliver, Jr., on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  Ohio from 2008 to 2010.   Ms. Clarke began her legal career in 2010, as a trial attorney at the  Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the Housing and Civil  Enforcement Section. During her 6 years investigating and litigating  civil rights violations, Ms. Clarke gained significant litigation  experience, including successfully trying a ``first-of-its-kind''  housing discrimination case and also securing the largest settlement of  its kind in another housing discrimination matter. In 2016, Ms. Clarke  went into private practice in New York City for 3 years, focusing on  commercial litigation and affirmative civil rights work. Since 2019,  she has served as the chief of the Civil Rights Bureau at the New York  State Office of the Attorney General, supervising the Bureau's  attorneys and staff in enforcing Federal, State, and local civil rights  laws in New York.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Ms. Clarke  ``qualified'' to serve on the Southern District of New York. Senators  Schumer and Gillibrand strongly support her nomination as well.   I will be supporting this outstanding nominee, and I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, behind the scenes of our Nation's  courtrooms and jails, we will find some of our most dedicated public  servants. They are America's public defense lawyers. They work long  hours for low pay, and even less attention and acclaim, to protect the  most American ideal: equal justice under the law. It is thanks to their  service that every single citizen in this country is guaranteed the  right to legal counsel.   Well, this Saturday, we have a chance to honor them. It is National  Public Defender Day. This year, National Public Defender Day also marks  a major milestone in legal history. It is the 60th anniversary of the  Supreme Court's decision in the landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright.   As hard as it is to imagine, there were days before the Gideon  decision when the constitutional right to legal counsel was not  protected. That means, in some States, if you were charged with a crime  but couldn't afford a lawyer, you were on your own.   That is exactly what happened to a man named Clarence Gideon in the  summer of 1961. At the time, he was down on his luck, struggling with  the disease of addiction on the streets of Panama City, FL.   Early one morning in June, he was arrested for a burglary. The  evidence against him: A witness claimed that they saw him steal from a  local pool hall. The police arrested him based on that accusation  alone.   When Mr. Gideon appeared in court, he told the judge he couldn't  afford a lawyer, and he asked for an appointed attorney. The judge  denied his request. He told Mr. Gideon the court could only appoint  counsel to defendants facing the death penalty. In other words, Mr.  Gideon was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which has been  enshrined in our Constitution since the enactment of the Bill of  Rights, because he wasn't accused of a very serious crime.   Well, Mr. Gideon didn't need a law degree to know something was wrong  here. So he picked up a pen and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter to  the U.S. Supreme Court, and with that letter, he changed history.   The Supreme Court agreed to hear his case and finally appointed him  an attorney--and not just an average attorney--future Supreme Court  Justice Abe Fortas.   Fast-forward to March of 1963. The Court issued its decision. All  nine Justices ruled unanimously in favor of Mr. Gideon. In the majority  opinion, Justice Hugo Black said, ``Lawyers in criminal courts are  necessities, not luxuries,'' and he concluded that the ``noble ideal .  . . [of] . . . fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every  defendant stands equal before the law . . . cannot be realized if the  poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer  to assist him.''   In the six decades since Gideon, generations of public defenders have  stepped up to ensure that no one is denied their right to legal  counsel, and for our most vulnerable neighbors in particular, public  defenders are an indispensable protection. They have protected the  rights of low-income and indigent Americans. They have helped  defendants access resources and services to get their lives back on  track, and they have worked day in and day out to secure sentences that  are humane and proportional.   Moreover, public defenders provide a service to all of us by  strengthening the integrity of our system of justice. Think about this:  The United States has one of the highest rates of incarceration in the  world. So when defendants are denied adequate legal representation,  they could end up behind bars for crimes they did not commit or receive  excessive or even inhumane sentences for those that they did commit.  That is a subversion of justice that wastes resources, violates  fundamental values, and, worst of all, treats humans as if they are  disposable objects. So all of us owe a debt of gratitude to the public  defenders fighting against these injustices.   But we also need to show that gratitude by providing public defenders  with the resources they need to advocate for their clients. While the  legal profession may be lucrative for attorneys working in big,  corporate boardrooms, the reality is very different for lawyers who  dedicate themselves to public service. One recent study indicates  that--when accounting for the cost of overhead--public defenders can  earn as little as $5.16 an hour.   With meager salaries for long hours of work, it is really no wonder  that we are currently facing a shortage of public defense lawyers. And  that shortage is having a detrimental impact across the country.  Criminal cases are going unresolved, defendants in need of medical and  mental services are not being treated, and justice is being delayed-- and therefore--denied. This is a problem that effects every part of the  country. And right now, States like New Mexico and Oregon have a third  of the number of public defenders they need to clear their criminal  caseload.   Today, Senator Booker and I will be introducing two bills to  underscore the value of public defenders and provide them with greater  funding and resources. One of these bills is a piece of legislation we  first introduced in 2021: the Sentencing Commission Improvements Act.  We wrote this bill for a simple reason. Public defenders not only  provide an invaluable service to our country, they also offer an  invaluable perspective.   These legal professionals spend countless hours with vulnerable  defendants, as well as their families. They see firsthand how the  disease of addiction can lead people down the wrong path and understand  how to best support them, so they can get on the road to recovery.   Public defenders help console children who are coming to terms with  the fact that they may not hug a parent for years because they are  behind bars. And they are there to hold a parent's hand when they find  out their son or daughter has received a lengthy sentence. Public  defenders understand the sobering--and sometimes grim--reality of our  justice system better than anyone. So to build a system that actually  prepares incarcerated people to reenter society and become productive  citizens, we need to give public defenders a seat at the decision- making table. The Sentencing Commission Improvements Act will achieve  that by adding an ex officio member to the U.S. Sentencing Commission  who is a public defender. It is exactly the perspective the Commission  needs to develop fairer sentencing guidelines.   Our other bill is the Quality Defense Act. It will create a grant  program to help fund data collection, hiring, increased compensation,  and loan assistance programs for public defenders. This bill also  directs the Justice Department to study and develop best practices and  recommendations on appropriate public defender caseloads and levels of  compensation. These measures will provide public defenders with  resources that reflect the importance of their service and encourage  attorneys to pursue careers as public defenders.  [[Page S831]]    I believe our justice system is stronger when it incorporates the  insights of experts who have worked across the legal spectrum. That is  why, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have worked to  confirm Federal judges who have served as public defenders. These  perspectives have long been excluded from the Federal bench, which is a  disservice to the American public. Thankfully, we are finally changing  course. Last year, this Senate confirmed the first former public  defender to ever serve on the Supreme Court: Justice Ketanji Brown  Jackson.   And in the past 2 years, we have confirmed more circuit judges with  experience as public defenders than all prior Presidents combined. One  of them is Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, who serves on the Seventh  Circuit in my home State of Illinois. Back in 2017, Judge Jackson- Akiwumi reflected on her time as a public defender--and how it tested  her as a legal professional.   She wrote that, as a public defender, ``I am a counselor, helping  clients to navigate difficult choices. . . . I am a teacher,  introducing clients and their families to the federal court system . .  .   ``[and] I am a lay social worker: many of our clients have  disadvantaged backgrounds, extensive mental health histories, substance  abuse issues, and other everyday challenges.''   When you work as a public defender, the job demands a lot more than a  simple attorney-client relationship. It is a job that demands  resourcefulness, thoughtfulness, and quick, strategic thinking. These  are the same qualities we need in the judges who serve on our Nation's  Federal courts. And they are the same qualities people look for when  they enter the courtroom as a plaintiff or defendant.   So as we honor National Public Defender Day this weekend, I want to  thank all of our courageous and dedicated public defense attorneys  across America. We are grateful for your commitment to defending equal  justice under law.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr.          Blumenthal):   S. 858.

When Mr. Gideon appeared in court, he told the judge he couldn't  afford a lawyer, and he asked for an appointed attorney. The judge  denied his request. He told Mr. Gideon the court could only appoint  counsel to defendants facing the death penalty. In other words, Mr.  Gideon was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which has been  enshrined in our Constitution since the enactment of the Bill of  Rights, because he wasn't accused of a very serious crime.   Well, Mr. Gideon didn't need a law degree to know something was wrong  here. So he picked up a pen and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter to  the U.S. Supreme Court, and with that letter, he changed history.   The Supreme Court agreed to hear his case and finally appointed him  an attorney--and not just an average attorney--future Supreme Court  Justice Abe Fortas.   Fast-forward to March of 1963. The Court issued its decision. All  nine Justices ruled unanimously in favor of Mr. Gideon. In the majority  opinion, Justice Hugo Black said, ``Lawyers in criminal courts are  necessities, not luxuries,'' and he concluded that the ``noble ideal .  . . [of] . . . fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every  defendant stands equal before the law . . . cannot be realized if the  poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer  to assist him.''   In the six decades since Gideon, generations of public defenders have  stepped up to ensure that no one is denied their right to legal  counsel, and for our most vulnerable neighbors in particular, public  defenders are an indispensable protection. They have protected the  rights of low-income and indigent Americans. They have helped  defendants access resources and services to get their lives back on  track, and they have worked day in and day out to secure sentences that  are humane and proportional.   Moreover, public defenders provide a service to all of us by  strengthening the integrity of our system of justice. Think about this:  The United States has one of the highest rates of incarceration in the  world. So when defendants are denied adequate legal representation,  they could end up behind bars for crimes they did not commit or receive  excessive or even inhumane sentences for those that they did commit.  That is a subversion of justice that wastes resources, violates  fundamental values, and, worst of all, treats humans as if they are  disposable objects. So all of us owe a debt of gratitude to the public  defenders fighting against these injustices.   But we also need to show that gratitude by providing public defenders  with the resources they need to advocate for their clients. While the  legal profession may be lucrative for attorneys working in big,  corporate boardrooms, the reality is very different for lawyers who  dedicate themselves to public service. One recent study indicates  that--when accounting for the cost of overhead--public defenders can  earn as little as $5.16 an hour.   With meager salaries for long hours of work, it is really no wonder  that we are currently facing a shortage of public defense lawyers. And  that shortage is having a detrimental impact across the country.  Criminal cases are going unresolved, defendants in need of medical and  mental services are not being treated, and justice is being delayed-- and therefore--denied. This is a problem that effects every part of the  country. And right now, States like New Mexico and Oregon have a third  of the number of public defenders they need to clear their criminal  caseload.   Today, Senator Booker and I will be introducing two bills to  underscore the value of public defenders and provide them with greater  funding and resources. One of these bills is a piece of legislation we  first introduced in 2021: the Sentencing Commission Improvements Act.  We wrote this bill for a simple reason. Public defenders not only  provide an invaluable service to our country, they also offer an  invaluable perspective.   These legal professionals spend countless hours with vulnerable  defendants, as well as their families. They see firsthand how the  disease of addiction can lead people down the wrong path and understand  how to best support them, so they can get on the road to recovery.   Public defenders help console children who are coming to terms with  the fact that they may not hug a parent for years because they are  behind bars. And they are there to hold a parent's hand when they find  out their son or daughter has received a lengthy sentence. Public  defenders understand the sobering--and sometimes grim--reality of our  justice system better than anyone. So to build a system that actually  prepares incarcerated people to reenter society and become productive  citizens, we need to give public defenders a seat at the decision- making table. The Sentencing Commission Improvements Act will achieve  that by adding an ex officio member to the U.S. Sentencing Commission  who is a public defender. It is exactly the perspective the Commission  needs to develop fairer sentencing guidelines.   Our other bill is the Quality Defense Act. It will create a grant  program to help fund data collection, hiring, increased compensation,  and loan assistance programs for public defenders. This bill also  directs the Justice Department to study and develop best practices and  recommendations on appropriate public defender caseloads and levels of  compensation. These measures will provide public defenders with  resources that reflect the importance of their service and encourage  attorneys to pursue careers as public defenders.  [[Page S831]]    I believe our justice system is stronger when it incorporates the  insights of experts who have worked across the legal spectrum. That is  why, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have worked to  confirm Federal judges who have served as public defenders. These  perspectives have long been excluded from the Federal bench, which is a  disservice to the American public. Thankfully, we are finally changing  course. Last year, this Senate confirmed the first former public  defender to ever serve on the Supreme Court: Justice Ketanji Brown  Jackson.   And in the past 2 years, we have confirmed more circuit judges with  experience as public defenders than all prior Presidents combined. One  of them is Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, who serves on the Seventh  Circuit in my home State of Illinois. Back in 2017, Judge Jackson- Akiwumi reflected on her time as a public defender--and how it tested  her as a legal professional.   She wrote that, as a public defender, ``I am a counselor, helping  clients to navigate difficult choices. . . . I am a teacher,  introducing clients and their families to the federal court system . .  .   ``[and] I am a lay social worker: many of our clients have  disadvantaged backgrounds, extensive mental health histories, substance  abuse issues, and other everyday challenges.''   When you work as a public defender, the job demands a lot more than a  simple attorney-client relationship. It is a job that demands  resourcefulness, thoughtfulness, and quick, strategic thinking. These  are the same qualities we need in the judges who serve on our Nation's  Federal courts. And they are the same qualities people look for when  they enter the courtroom as a plaintiff or defendant.   So as we honor National Public Defender Day this weekend, I want to  thank all of our courageous and dedicated public defense attorneys  across America. We are grateful for your commitment to defending equal  justice under law.                                  ______    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
