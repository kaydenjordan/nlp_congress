 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and  continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department of  Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and request  a conference with the Senate thereon.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the ranking member's motion is very much in the spirit  of the House position. I am really appreciative of that. Quite frankly,  it makes our bill better.   H.R. 2 makes the historic commitment to protecting our Nation's  livestock herd and, frankly, our national security by establishing and  funding forward-looking animal health initiatives that address existing  and emerging pest and disease threats.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing this discussion in  conference, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's motion, and I  ask Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
