 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize March as National  Frozen Food Month.   In my district, growers count on our food processors to ensure that  their agricultural products make it from farms to kitchen tables.   Jobs in agriculture depend on the ability to transport our products  to buyers across the country and around the world. In my district,  there are over 6,000 jobs in the frozen food industry, ensuring that  families across the U.S. can enjoy Washington's agricultural products.   As a farmer and a former State director of agriculture, I understand  how important frozen foods are to enable timely delivery and freshness,  despite seasonal changes. Freezing reduces food waste and increases  safety and affordability. Freezing also allows Americans to have access  to the diverse array of food products they enjoy every day.   Join me in celebrating National Frozen Food Month and all those who  work to ensure that the U.S. has the safest, most reliable, and most  affordable food supply in the world.                            ____________________
