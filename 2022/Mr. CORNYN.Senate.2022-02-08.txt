 Mr. President, many Americans are watching the news,  reading the newspaper, watching cable news, and they are seeing the  Russian buildup of troops on the border of Ukraine.   So I thought what I would do is take just a few moments to speak  about what is at stake in Ukraine. Why should Americans care, and what  should we do in response?   Tensions along the border are high. Shuttle diplomacy is occurring  and is the order of the day. But more than 100,000 Russian troops are  in position should an invasion of Ukraine be ordered by Russian  Federation President Putin.   Reports indicate that Russia has created a graphic propaganda video,  something called a false flag operation, to serve as a pretext for  invading and cyber attacks like those that might precede a planned  invasion are already underway.   Not surprisingly, the Kremlin is engaging in a disinformation  campaign, making every attempt to blame the United States--or any other  country for that matter--for its own aggressive actions.   This kind of gaslighting might work in a totalitarian state, but in  the rest of the world, where we have access to more complete and  accurate information, we know better. There is no question that Russia  and Russia alone is responsible for the military buildup on Ukraine's  border and is also threatening peace in Europe.   As Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,  has written:         This isn't primarily a Ukraine crisis. It's a Russia       crisis. More precisely, [it is] a Putin-created crisis aimed       at destroying [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,       otherwise known as] NATO.        It's Putin's attempt to drive the [United States] and its       West European allies to put ourselves in a time machine, [to]       abdicate our alliance obligations, expose countries       previously occupied, brutalized, and exploited by the Soviet       Union to Putin's continued aggression, demonstrate our       unreliability as partners, and show our unseriousness       about defending our own vital national security interests.       In return for a promise of nothing at all.    The United States has played no part in creating this crisis, but I  do believe we have some responsibilities--not just a treaty obligation  to our NATO allies--because Ukraine is not yet a member of NATO, so  that obligation under article 5 does not apply to Ukraine, as I will  discuss in a moment.   But I do believe that we have a responsibility to support the  Ukrainian people as they fight to defend their own sovereignty, despite  the fact that they are not members of NATO.   With so many challenges on the home front, though, and around the  world, it is easy for folks in Texas or Massachusetts or anywhere else  around the country to wonder, why should we care what is happening in  Ukraine? Americans are experiencing the highest inflation in 40 years;  there is growing concern about violent crime; we have a humanitarian  crisis on our southern border; and let's not forget the ongoing fight  against the pandemic. We know families are struggling to face the  challenges right in front of them, let alone those on the other side of  the globe.   Americans want to know, how does a conflict on the other side of the  globe actually impact the United States and, importantly, why should we  help? I think those are fair questions. The human and financial costs  of armed conflicts are very high. And we have learned the painful  lesson during many times in our Nation's history, twice in the last  century in Europe alone, where there were World Wars centered.   But we also know how much the free world depends on the United States  and its leadership and strength to provide stability and prevent wars  and promote peace, if we can, while safeguarding freedom and democracy  around the world.  [[Page S565]]    The United States is a global power, but we are no longer the only  one. That day has passed. Our leadership role and responsibilities in a  rules-based international order were earned by the sacrifices of  generations of Americans who defended our freedoms and our way of life  and those of our allies.   Believing, as Ronald Reagan said, that peace comes through strength,  America's role in the world has been achieved by our military might, by  our strategic alliances, our commitment to free markets and trade  around the world that have produced the economy that has allowed us to  defend ourselves as well as an unwavering dedication to our values. And  whether we like it or not, our unique role in the world brings with it  certain responsibilities.   We can't give anyone--adversary or ally--a reason to doubt our  commitment to freedom, peace, stability, and security. Unfortunately,  our reputation for reliability has suffered some damage recently. The  botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, for example, caused our NATO  allies to doubt the future of American leadership and our commitments  under the North Atlantic Treaty.   Our friends and adversaries alike are wondering if the Afghanistan  debacle is a one-time misstep or the beginning of dwindling U.S.  commitment and power. Of course, Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi will not miss an  opportunity to disparage America's credibility as a reliable ally.   Our urgent task, by our actions as well as our words, should be to  convince friend and foe that we will remain a credible friend and ally.   But either way, Putin is an opportunist, and today the eyes of the  world are on the United States to see how we will respond to this  threatened Russian aggression. Will we stand strong in support of  Ukraine or will we sit passively on the sidelines?   Make no mistake, Russia is doing far more than just threatening  Ukraine. President Putin told the world in a speech in 2005 that the  collapse of the Soviet empire--the Soviet Union--was what he called  ``the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.'' That is his  mindset.   Putting that empire back together was clearly on his mind when Russia  invaded the nation of Georgia in 2008, formerly part of the Soviet  Union, and when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, also part of the Soviet  order.   And, of course, we can be confident this is foremost in his mind as  he threatens to invade Ukraine, another country that used to be part of  the Soviet Union.   So Putin is trying to get away with as much as he can, and it would  be naive to think that he will stop at Ukraine.   If the United States fails to support Ukraine at this pivotal moment,  other authoritarian governments, like those in China and Iran, will  take note.   Today's New York Times had a story that said, ``Both Sides of the  Taiwan Strait Are Closely Watching Ukraine's Crisis,'' in other words,  the People's Republic of China--mainland China--as well as Taiwan, the  independent democratic state right across that thin band of water known  as the South China Sea.   Here is what one of the representatives of Taiwan said in this  article. He said: ``If the Western powers fail to respond to Russia,  they do embolden the Chinese thinking regarding action on Taiwan.''   So this is not just about Ukraine. This is not just about Europe.  This is about America's credibility and that of our friends and allies  around the world and our willingness to stand up for our values and  defend our freedoms.   If our adversaries see that the United States responds merely with  passivity or words, they too will inevitably see opportunities for them  to exploit. That would risk further geopolitical instability and the  cause of peace. It would inevitably diminish America's leadership  position in the world, the global order of which we are what Elbridge  Colby has termed the ``cornerstone balancer,'' a powerful country  anchoring the coalition of freedom-loving nations.   So, yes, Ukraine is on the frontlines of the current crisis, but the  security of Europe is also in question. The reach of Russia's  aspirations for reestablished empire are, as well, and, as I said,  there are global repercussions to however we choose to respond.   I am not suggesting that President Biden send American troops to  Ukraine. I want to be clear on that point. I know of no one calling for  American troops to be deployed to Ukraine.   There are, however, concrete steps we can take to help Ukraine defend  itself without putting American lives on the line, and, fortunately,  there is precedent for that.   In the early 1940s, Nazi Germany was making dramatic advances across  Europe, and Great Britain was being pummeled by the blitz, a bombing  campaign by the German air forces. While Britain was hanging on by a  thread, Prime Minister Churchill asked President Franklin Delano  Roosevelt for help from the United States.   This ultimately resulted in a very creative and successful solution  known as the Lend-Lease Act. In the words of President Roosevelt, this  legislation transformed the United States into the ``arsenal of  democracy'' by supplying Great Britain with the materiel it needed to  fend off German attacks.   He compared it to lending your neighbor a garden hose if his house  was on fire. It wouldn't just protect the neighbor's home; it would  protect your home as well.   Congress and the American people agreed with President Roosevelt's  logic, and this legislation was signed into law in March 1941.   Soon after, American warships, aircraft, weaponry, oil, food, and  other critical resources made their way across the Atlantic to Allied  forces fighting against Germany.   I think this is part of the response we need to provide today to  provide the Ukrainians with the ability to defend themselves under a  modern version of the 1941 Lend-Lease Act.   With the inspiration of President Roosevelt in the 1941 act, I have  worked with a number of my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats  alike--to draft a 2022 version of that legislation, called, not  surprisingly, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, which will  ensure that Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people will have what  they need to deter and defend against Russian invasions.   As it stands today, the President of the United States has a menu of  options to support our international friends in times of conflict. In  some cases, such as the loan of equipment, the United States will  eventually retain end use. In others, such as grants and emergency aid,  we do not recover the funding or the assets sent to our friends.   This bill would provide an additional option to that menu, allowing  the United States to provide assistance that may otherwise be  unfeasible unless we could retain end use.   This legislation would authorize President Biden to enter into lend- lease agreements directly with Ukraine and provide military equipment  necessary to protect the Ukrainian people.   In an ideal world, access to this materiel will help the Ukrainians  defend themselves and deter Russia from mounting an invasion in the  first place. Knowing that Ukraine has access to the ``arsenal of  democracy'' could help prevent Putin from risking a deadly war. But if  Putin makes a bad decision to move forward, Ukrainian forces will have  the lethal weapons that they need to defend their sovereignty.    They will also have the support of the United States and our NATO  allies.   In the Senate, there is clear support for this sovereignty of  Ukraine, and I am glad to have worked with my colleagues on this  legislation that includes this lend-lease component.   I want to thank Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch on the  Foreign Relations Committee and a larger bipartisan group of our  colleagues who have been working on a comprehensive approach to counter  this threatened aggression by Russia. We have discussed my lend-lease  bill, as well as additional security assistance and lethal aid for  Ukraine. And, as we have read, Senator Menendez and Senator Risch are  negotiating a limited but immediate sanctions response to this  aggression, including cyber attacks, as well as the threat of  additional sanctions in the event of an invasion.   As the chairman and the ranking member have said, negotiations are  making some progress, and I hope we  [[Page S566]]  can wrap things up quickly and bring the bill to the Senate floor  without much more delay.   The fact is, we are racing against the clock. Putin could invade  Ukraine at a moment's notice, and he is not going to wait on the U.S.  Senate to act. That is why time is of the essence.   Ideally, the lend-lease agreement, military assistance, sanctions,  and other provisions included in this package will cause Putin to think  twice about invading. But that can only happen if we act before Putin  acts.   So the clock is ticking, and we need to move. I am encouraged by the  bipartisan support we have seen for Ukraine and for this effort, and I  hope we can take action soon to reaffirm America's position as the lead  defender of global peace and security.   I yield the floor.
