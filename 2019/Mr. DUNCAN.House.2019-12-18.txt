 Madam Speaker, we are not debating impeachment of an  American President today. Your minds are already made up. The Democrat  majority has had a verdict, impeachment, looking for a crime since the  inauguration.   The Washington Post ran the headline, ``The Campaign to Impeach  President Trump Has Begun'' just 19 minutes after President Trump took  the oath of office.   The freshman Congresswoman from Michigan told a group of supporters,  ``We are going to impeach the mother-blank'' shortly after she was  sworn in.   Even Speaker Pelosi admitted last week that the impeachment effort  has been going on for 2\1/2\ years, long before any phone call between  two world leaders.   In fact, 71 percent of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  supported an impeachment before the phone call. The impeachment sham is  based on hearsay, conjecture, and opinion. And you know what, you can't  even get a speeding ticket in this country based on hearsay, yet we are  going to impeach an American President based on just that.   Where are the crimes of treason, high crimes or misdemeanors  committed here? Those are things that constitute impeachable offenses,  not hatred or policy disagreements. If memory serves me right, Congress  told the administration to withhold aid to Ukraine until they got their  act together, addressed corruption, and straightened it out. That was  in multiple NDAAs voted on by both parties in this Chamber.   So in the simplest terms, we are impeaching the President for doing  something we told him to do. Give me a break. We have wasted precious  time we were given to serve the American people while you held secret  hearings and depositions behind closed doors in Chairman Schiff's  chamber of secrets.   But the American people have a great sense of fairness, I promise  you. They see President Trump has not been treated fairly in this  process. Impeachment based on hearsay and opinion, not facts. It is a  sad day in this Chamber, the people's House.
