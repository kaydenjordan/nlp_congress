 Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump has  made an excellent selection of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme  Court. The Aiken Standard lead editorial today is correct: ``Brett  Kavanaugh the Right Choice for Court.''   ``A judge's job is to interpret the law, not to make the law or make  policy,'' writes Judge Brett Kavanaugh. The judge will apply the law as  written and enforce the text, structure, and original understanding of  the Constitution.   Judge Brett Kavanaugh's credentials are impeccable. He served on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for 12 years. He has  authored more than 300 opinions.   A graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School, Judge Kavanaugh has  clerked on the Supreme Court under Justice Anthony Kennedy and on the  Third and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has taught at Yale,  Harvard, and Georgetown.   Judge Kavanaugh has devoted his life to public service, and the  Senate should confirm him quickly, as America, he, and his family  deserves. The biased media will fail again as it smears the judge,  making up more fake news and destroying its own credibility.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
