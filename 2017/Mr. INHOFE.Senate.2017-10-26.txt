 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have a very significant couple of votes  coming up. One is the nomination of Scott Palk to be a district judge  for the Western District of Oklahoma. We have been working on this for  about 2 years now. He is one of the highest qualified individuals.   I thank the leader for moving forward on his nomination this week. I  know judicial nominations are a priority of the leader's, and I share  his belief in the importance of filling the many vacancies we have with  judges who will uphold the rule of law, not predetermine outcomes and  not legislate from the bench. Scott Palk fulfills and embodies this  philosophy, and I have full confidence that he will be a judge whom  Oklahoma and the Nation will be proud of.   This nomination is of great need to the Western District, located in  Oklahoma City, which has a very heavy caseload. In fact, we have three  vacancies on the bench there. One vacancy goes back over 4 years and  another over 3 years, so this nomination is desperately needed.   Mr. Palk was nominated in the last Congress--so it was not this  Congress--during the previous administration. He made it through the  Judiciary Committee by voice vote before we ran out of time at the end  of the 114th Congress. We would have had this done, but we just flat  ran out of time. He had bipartisan support in the last Congress and has  in this Congress, with there having been a 17-to-3 vote in the  Judiciary Committee. It is not very often that happens.   He also has bipartisan support back home in Oklahoma. He comes highly  recommended by David Boren. Everyone here knows who David Boren is. The  Presiding Officer remembers David Boren. He was my predecessor in this  seat. He was the president of the University of Oklahoma but is retired  now. He is a Democrat. Actually, he and I were elected to the House of  Representatives in Oklahoma on the same day, so we go back a long way.  David Boren knows Mr. Palk very well because Scott Palk has worked at  the University of Oklahoma College of Law for about 15 years now after  his having left a successful career in both the U.S. attorney's office  and as a county district attorney.   David Boren said of Palk--now, this is a Democrat talking about Scott  Palk--``He would make an excellent judge,'' would be ``balanced and  fair in his approach,'' and has ``an excellent reputation for complete  honesty and integrity.'' I don't know what more you could want in a  judge.   That is David Boren talking, my predecessor in the Senate.   Again, I thank the leader for his commitment to fulfilling our  judicial vacancies, and I ask that my colleagues support the  nomination, as I am sure they will, with a ``yes'' vote for Mr. Palk.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the  Schwan's Company on the 75th anniversary of their Stilwell food  production facility. This is a significant milestone for Schwan's and  its employees, but also for Adair County and the entire State of  Oklahoma. Throughout their 75 years, Schwan's has been a committed  community partner, hiring over 300 residents and supporting hunger  relief and youth activities.   The food production facility in Stilwell, originally called the  Stilwell Canning Company, first opened in 1942 when World War II drove  up the demand for canned items. The company has demonstrated a strong  commitment to excellence, first expanding in 1999, when it became the  largest frozen dessert production plant in the country. After being  acquired by Schwan's Company in 2003, they have continued to invest in  the plant and its employees, putting the facility on the leading edge  of pie production in the country. Today the plant is a 610,000-square- foot state-of-of-the-art facility that employs about 300 people.   Congratulations on your 75th anniversary, and I look forward to  seeing Schwan's continue to make a positive impact in Stilwell.                            ____________________
