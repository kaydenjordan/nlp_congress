 Mr. President, I very much thank Chairman Isakson for his  work on this bill. As a veteran, as the spouse of a veteran, as the  mother of a young lady who will enter into the service this summer, and  as the grandmother to a young man who will begin his enlistment this  fall, I thank him for the work he has done. I appreciate your service  as well. Thank you so much.    Mr. President, ``We can and we must do better for our veterans.''   I spoke those words during my first speech given here on the Senate  floor just over 3 years ago. I also spoke about the need to fulfill the  promises made to our veterans who have sacrificed everything for our  country. At that time, the average wait for a mental health appointment  at the VA was 36 days. There were, on average, 22 veteran suicides  every single day in the United States. It underscored the troubles  within the VA and the urgency to act immediately to help our veterans  get the quality and the timely care that they have earned and that they  deserve.   That is why I introduced on that very day my first bill, the  Prioritizing Veterans' Access to Mental Healthcare Act. My bill would  have eliminated the distance and the wait time requirements for  veterans seeking mental healthcare under the current Choice Program.  Every veteran should have the choice to receive care in the community,  but they should not be burdened by bureaucratic redtape or strict  guidelines that serve as roadblocks to receiving this type of care.   To illustrate how burdensome and sometimes ridiculous these  guidelines are, I want to share a letter I received from a veteran in  Ames, IA. The veteran wrote:         I am a disabled veteran who currently receives healthcare       at the De Moines VA Hospital. I live 39.7 miles from the De       Moines VA Hospital, which means I do not meet the 40-mile VA       Choice criteria. While I have not had a bad experience at the       De Moines VA, it is burdensome to travel approximately 40       miles when I have had surgeries that require a family member       to transport me. I am unable to utilize a nonVA facility in       my own backyard.    The frustration evident in this veteran's letter has been present in  hundreds of letters and stories, and I have received many of those over  the years.   I am frustrated too. Those who are willing to lay down their lives  for our country shouldn't have to jump through hoops to receive the  care they have earned.   I am thrilled that this week the Senate has the opportunity to do  better for  [[Page S2808]]  our veterans. Just last week, the House passed the VA MISSION Act,  which improves how veterans access community care. Under the VA MISSION  Act, the VA remains the coordinator of a veteran's care. The VA would  still be in charge of scheduling those appointments, ensuring that a  veteran is going to followup visits, as well as ensuring that no  veteran experiences a delay or a gap in their care.   The VA MISSION Act also makes significant improvements to accessing  community care. A veteran will no longer be bound by strict distance  and wait time requirements, just as I expressed from that veteran who  lives in Ames, IA. Instead, that decision rests with the veteran and  their provider. If a veteran and their provider determine that it is in  the veteran's best medical interest, the VA will be required to offer  access to community care. The VA MISSION Act ensures that veterans have  a say and a choice in their care.   This legislation also includes my bipartisan Veterans E-Health and  Telemedicine Support Act, also known as the VETS Act, which I  introduced with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. VA providers will now  be able to practice across State lines, expanding telehealth services,  which can include critical mental healthcare and care desperately  needed to veterans in rural and underserved areas.   The VETS act will also expand VA caregiver benefits to pre-9/11  veterans, create a commission to evaluate how to modernize VA  facilities, increase resources to hire more providers, which is very  important, and ensure prompt payment to community providers.   I am also pleased to report that this bill has bipartisan support and  the support of over 30 veteran service organizations.   Funding for the Choice Program is expected to run out at the end of  May--in a matter of weeks. The men and women who have put their lives  on the line for the freedom of every American deserve better than the  status quo. Again, I say that we can and we must do better for our  veterans.   The VA MISSION Act is a positive step forward toward getting veterans  the care they need. That is why I will be voting in support of it. I  urge my colleagues to do the same and cast their vote in favor of the  VA MISSION Act.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
