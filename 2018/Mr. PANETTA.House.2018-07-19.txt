 Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to recognize the reopening  of Highway 1, located south of Big Sur in Monterey County in my  district on the Central Coast of California.   Two winters ago, after a long drought and then a large amount of  rain, there were a number of landslides along scenic Highway 1, just  south of Carmel and north of Morrow Bay. One of those landslides  occurred 14 months ago, when close to 8 million cubic yards of dirt and  truck-sized rocks came sliding down off that mountain, taking Highway 1  and putting a quarter mile of it right into the Pacific Ocean.   This was the largest landslide and the longest closure along that  stretch of the world's most scenic roadway. Unfortunately, it prevented  many people from traveling on that route and many businesses in Big Sur  from benefiting from that tourism.   But now, 3 months ahead of schedule, the California Department of  Transportation, Caltrans, finished rebuilding this road, literally on  top of the slide, and it will open today.   I recognize the opening of Highway 1 because it is an example of what  can happen when people work hard, work smart, and, most importantly,  work together.   Congratulations, and all of us in this body can learn from this.                            ____________________
