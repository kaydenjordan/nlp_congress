 Mr. President, we have come to a crisis in our country.  My State of West Virginia has the highest drug overdose death rate in  the Nation. West Virginia reported 818 overdose deaths last year--four  times the number that occurred in 2001 and a nearly 13-percent increase  over 2015. We lost more than 700 West Virginians who died from an  opioid overdose last year. Some 42,000 people in West Virginia,  including 4,000 youth, sought treatment for illegal drug use but failed  to receive it because of a lack of treatment centers, which we have  been trying to correct. In West Virginia, drug overdose deaths have  soared by more than 700 percent since 1999.   West Virginia had the highest rate of prescription drug overdose  deaths of any State last year--31 per 100,000 people. In West Virginia,  providers wrote 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100 people.  Think about this. Doctors are prescribing and manufacturers are  producing. They have written 138 painkiller prescriptions for every 100  people in my State--the highest rate in the country. I hope Arkansas is  not facing the same dilemma we are.   Every day in our country, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose.  Opioids now kill more people than car accidents. In 2015, the number of  heroin deaths nationwide surpassed the number of deaths from gun  homicides. Since 1999, we have lost almost 200,000 Americans to  prescription drug opioid abuse.   Mr. President, 2.1 million Americans abuse or are dependent on  opioids. According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users  abused prescription opioids before moving to heroin. Heroin use has  more than doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25 in the past decade.  Forty-five percent of the people who used heroin were also addicted to  prescription opioid painkillers. Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent  of Americans suffering from opioid addiction participated in any form  of addiction treatment.   Misuse and abuse of opioids cost the country an estimated $78.5  billion in 2013 in lost productivity, medical costs, and criminal  justice costs.   Every week, I come to the Senate floor to read letters from West  Virginians and those struggling all throughout our country with opioid  abuse. The reason I do this is because it is a silent killer. We don't  talk about it. There is not one of us in the Senate, not one of us in  Congress, not one of us in any gathering who doesn't know someone in  our immediate family, extended family, or a close friend who hasn't  been affected, but we would never talk about it because it was so  embarrassing--how did it ever break down in our family, whether you had  a model family or you thought you did. This is a killer. Whether  Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, this is a killer. It  has no discretion. It has no partisan base. It goes after one and the  other. So this is what we are dealing with.   The letters I read have a common theme: They all mention how hard it  is to get themselves or loved ones into treatment. Sometimes it takes  months, and sometimes it never happens. This problem stems from our  lack of a system to help those who are looking for help. We need  permanent funding to create and expand substance abuse treatment  facilities to help people get clean and stay clean.   I know the Presiding Officer has heard this before, but that is why I  introduced the LifeBOAT Act. The LifeBOAT Act puts one penny per  milligram of opiates--basically, one penny for every milligram of  opiates produced in America, consumed in America--into a fund that pays  for treatment centers. In the Presiding Officer's beautiful State of  Alaska and my State of West Virginia, people need treatment. This is an  illness. I used to look at it 20 years ago as basically a criminal act,  and we put them in jail. Guess what. They came out of jail just as  addicted as they went in. Nothing changed, so I am willing to change. I  have always said that if you can't change your mind, you can't change  anything. This is an illness that needs treatment, and we are  responsible for that. This lifeboat would establish a steady,  sustainable funding stream to provide and expand access to substance  abuse treatment.   Today I am going to read a letter from parents from West Virginia who  lost their son to drug abuse. This is Renee and Criss's letter, which  they want me to read. This fine-looking young man was a father, and  this is such a tragic ending to this story.         Dear Senator Manchin,        I am writing to you in the hope of bringing to light the       devastating effects of heroin addiction, overdose death and       the difficulty in finding treatment for those afflicted with       the disease and their families.        On November 12th, 2016, we lost our 23-year-old son, Nick,       who died from what we thought at the time was a heroin       overdose. When Nick's autopsy report came back, we discovered       that his body contained no trace of heroin in his system. He       had died from a fatal dose of straight fentanyl.        Nick was a quiet, kind and inquisitive child. He learned to       speak and read at an early age and spent most of his time       absorbed in books and riding his bike and scooter. He also       loved playing in the woods and dreaming up adventures with       his sisters and neighborhood friends. He was a protective big       brother, and he had a natural way of connecting with kids who       were ``different'' and making them feel accepted.        Nick was always tall for his age. He came into this world       on July 5th, 1993, weighing in at 10 pounds and topped off at       6'8". He loved sports and excelled in basketball and soccer.       He even met you when you were Governor Manchin, after his       basketball team traveled to Charleston, WV, to celebrate       their A State Basketball Tournament Championship in 2011.        After high school he went on to play basketball for the       Glenville State College Pioneers. Nick wasn't able to keep       his grades up and had to drop out of Glenville after the       first semester of school. Shortly after that, he met a girl.       They instantly connected, and he soon became a father to her       daughter. After several years together, they had a son of       their own.        After having difficulty holding down jobs and providing for       his family, Nick came to me in November of 2015 and told me       that he was addicted to opiate prescription drugs. We had       suspected drug use for quite some time but didn't realize the       extent of it. He said that he could no longer live the life       he was leading and needed help. Nick and his girlfriend had       started using opiate-based prescription drugs after she was       prescribed them for her recovery from the birth of her       daughter in 2013. At first, they would make trips to the       doctor or quick care with fake ailments in order to get their       prescriptions. If they couldn't get prescriptions, then they       bought from drug dealers. The pills were easy to get up until       the time he came to me for help.        I told my husband about Nick's drug problem, and not       knowing what to do, we turned to the Internet as a source of       information. We found a lot of information and many treatment       centers across the country. I began calling a few of the ones       that looked reputable, but in each case, they required three       to five thousand dollars up front for a 28 to 30 day       treatment. The question now was: Were these treatment centers       as good as they appeared to be on their websites or were they       simply out to make a profit and marketing their centers to       bring in more patients?        While we researched and tried to make a decision, Nick, not       wanting to be away from his family, went through detox at       home and had convinced him and us that he could do this on       his own. Nick made it through his first round of self-detox       but started using again for a short while at the end of       January. We confronted him, and he immediately started his       second round of self-detox. He again swore that he could do       this himself and was finished with the life he was leading.       We were still trying to figure out what to do with him and       what would happen to his family while he was gone. We didn't       know that his girlfriend was also using and detoxing along       with Nick.        After speaking to several people at a local treatment       center and trying to arrange for him to be admitted, we were       told that they wouldn't take him because [of] our insurance.       My next course of action was to call local counseling centers       that offered addiction counseling, hoping that they would be       able to offer advice. Each one I called politely told me that       they couldn't help.        Nick's addiction, and our focus on him, was taking away       from our being able to celebrate and focus on our other       children, Nick's two sisters. We decided to put Nick on the       backburner while we prepared for our daughter's graduation       party and the school events that preceded it, thinking that a       few weeks wouldn't hurt. Were we ever wrong!    It is a sad scenario when a family has to hope that their child gets  arrested  [[Page S2063]]  and gets a conviction record so they can go to a drug court to get  treatment, that that is the only help they have.         One of our daughters had learned that Nick could get       treatment if we pressed charges against him for theft. He       would be charged, then court-ordered to be sent to an       addiction treatment center. She felt that this was the best       course of action to get Nick the help he needed, but Criss       and I were hesitant because of the negative impact a felony       charge would have on Nick's life if the charges weren't       expunged after completing his treatment.    Which is our what we call fresh start or last-chance bill, which the  Presiding Officer has been so graciously looking at and hopefully will  be a part of this. It is a shame they fall into this.         Our decision to not go this route caused even more anger.    Since they knew that, hindsight being 20/20, this was the only way to  get Nick help.         Little did we know that, by late-March or early April, Nick       and his girlfriend had decided to celebrate their being clean       by using heroin ``just this once'' as a reward for staying       clean.    They were rewarding themselves by using heroin to celebrate being  clean. Now, understand, that is not proper thinking. That is not  rational common sense.         In the past, the two had snorted heroin but had never       injected it. When they went to buy from their dealer, he told       them that since they didn't have much money and there were       two of them, they could get a better high with less heroin if       they injected it. And that was the beginning of a rapid       decline.        On June 2, 2016, Nick had his first overdose. Without our       knowledge, his girlfriend had taken Nick, along with the       children, to the emergency room, where he was treated and       released within a few hours. Unbeknownst to us, this       initiated a call to CPS that would result in her daughter's       father taking custody of her and CPS involvement for Nick and       his girlfriend and their son.        At the hospital, Nick and his girlfriend talked with a       doctor out of Pittsburgh about Suboxone. They agreed to try       the program. I traveled with Nick, his girlfriend and her       mother for the first visit to Pittsburgh. They had a high       success rate, and it was decided that once the treatment was       established, the two would go to Pittsburgh once a month for       drug testing, counseling and their Suboxone prescriptions.       The clinic would line up additional support services in       Parkersburg or close by. We were very impressed with the       clinic, their staff and their program, which only took on 100       patients at a time.        Criss came to the next meeting two weeks later to speak       with the counselors and was now more comfortable with the       treatment plan. Unfortunately, when the counselors tried to       set up local support services, they were shocked to find the       small number of places that treated addiction and the fact       that the ones that were here would not provide services for       patients who were not in their program. The decision was made       to increase their sessions to twice a month and eventually       once a week when it became apparent through consistent       ``dirty'' screens that the two were struggling with the       program [and still using].        In August, his girlfriend suffered an overdose. The       Pittsburgh Clinic called shortly after that and said that       they were releasing the two from the program, letting us know       that they needed a more intense treatment plan than they       could provide. I called the CPS case worker and addiction       counselor that were assigned to watch over the children and       monitor the two after Nick's overdose in June. We all met at       the house to determine the next course of action. After       numerous phone calls, we were able to find an ``open'' bed in       Las Vegas, Nevada, for Nick, while his girlfriend would       decide the following week to go to a treatment center in       Fairmont, WV.        In less than a week, Nick was on a plane to Vegas, eager to       begin a new, clean life. He was upbeat and positive before he       left, excited by the prospect of finally leaving behind the       life of addiction that he'd been living for so long. During       his phone calls home, he had positive things to say about his       treatment. He was staying in nice homes that were part of the       treatment center. Along with their daily treatment schedule,       they were taken on hikes and went go-cart racing. He even had       a manicure at the facility's salon. The purpose of these       activities was to teach the patients natural ways of       experiencing highs.        Nick's release date was scheduled for October 3rd. There       were longer-term treatment plans offered at the facility, but       Nick missed his son and worried about his girlfriend and       wanted to come home. The treatment center had set up group       sessions for him three times a week for a period of about six       weeks.        Nick came home on a beautiful, sunny day. I waited at home       for him with his son, who had been staying with me, and his       other grandmother.    I wish we had this picture of his son, a beautiful little boy.         When I saw Nick for the first time, he looked beautiful. He       looked and acted like the Nick that we had known before       addiction. He told us about his stay in Vegas and was       literally shining with hope! He told me, ``Mom, I will       never go back to that life!'' And I believed it was       possible.        That hope began to fade pretty quickly. Nick had started       working about six weeks before he left for rehab. It had       taken him a long time to get that job and he enjoyed it and       felt that he could actually provide for his family if he       could work his way up. However, after rehab he was unable to       secure a job. Nick was going to his scheduled group sessions       and going to nightly NA meetings for support. Nick finished       up his six weeks of group therapy. He was so proud when he       received his ``sixty day's clean'' chip at the NA meeting.       Seven days later he and I spent part of the afternoon       together. He wanted to look for a job and I had some errands       to run. He dropped me off where I needed to be and applied       for jobs. When I finished, he picked me up and I took him to       Sam's Club to show him cute toys for his son for Christmas.       We picked out a racetrack together and I showed him a few       other things I had bought for my grandson. I had mentioned       that Criss might get his son a basketball hoop for Christmas       and he told me, ``No Mom, I want to buy that for him with my       own money.''        We had a good afternoon together. He had made plans for the       evening, to meet up with some of his high school friends who       were in for the weekend. He left my house around eight       o'clock and I heard him return around 12:35 am. All of his       friends later said that he'd had a good night. He was happy       and smiling and there was nothing to indicate that there was       anything wrong. Shortly after I heard Nick come in, my       grandson's crying woke me up and I woke to change him, give       him a bottle. I headed back to bed and noticed the light on       in the bathroom and knocked and opened the door. It was       around 1:45 am and Nick was lying on the bathroom floor with       no pulse and not breathing. I called 911 and began CPR.       Within minutes the ambulance arrived. They worked on him for       some time while I spoke to the police officer then they took       him out to the ambulance. I assumed they had stabilized him       enough to transport him and waited for my in-laws to arrive       to watch our grandson.        When Criss and I were called back into the emergency room       we did not expect to hear that Nick had passed. We didn't       expect that we would have to call our daughters to tell them       that their brother was dead or that we would sit in a room       with him feeling him go cold while we waited for our daughter       to arrive from Morgantown. We weren't able to get in touch       with our other daughter and had to send my sister over the       following morning to tell her the news. We didn't expect that       in less than two days we'd be picking out a coffin and       cemetery plot for our son.        We expected that we would be sending him back to treatment       in the hope that the next round would be successful. We       expected another chance. And what we have now is the       knowledge that we failed our son in the worst way possible.        Sincerely,        Renee and Criss Fisher.    There is a picture that would be hard to show because it was the most  moving picture I have ever seen. They sent me the picture of Nick, this  wonderful young man, lying in a casket and his little boy tiptoed up  holding on. That should move all of us to do the right thing here, to  start finding treatment centers, to start working with this illness, to  find ways to understand, and to start intervening. You have to  intervene from inception, from birth and all the way through, educating  children. It is destroying economies. It is destroying families. It is  destroying, basically, communities all over this country.   It is something that I hope we all can fight. To lose a young man-- this was a terrific young man, and to lose him to drugs is uncalled  for.   I yield the floor.
