 Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer Congressman Luetkemeyer's  [[Page H4646]]  amendment to ensure the United Nations climate change organizations are  no longer used as an international slush fund for ineffective climate  change research and projects.   Unfortunately, many of the United Nations climate change  organizations operate with little oversight or accountability, while  being financed, in part, by the American taxpayer.   Unelected bureaucrats and foreign leaders across the globe should not  have greater control over U.S. policy than our citizens and elected  officials, especially when we are paying for it.   The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or  IPCC, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or  UNFCC, and the Green Climate Fund, GCF, have been surrounded in  controversy since their inception.   The IPCC, which is broadly represented as the top authority on  climate matters, was under fire when emails were publicly released from  a university in England that showed that leading global scientists-- that 95 percent, they are always quoting--intentionally manipulated  climate data and suppressed legitimate arguments in peer-reviewed  journals.   Further, while the IPCC supposedly issues assessments based upon so- called independent surveys of published research, some of the most  influential conclusions summarized in its report have neither been  based upon truly independent research nor properly vetted through  accepted peer-reviewed processes.   The United Nations Green Climate Fund, which, unfortunately, received  $1 billion in taxpayer funding thanks to the Obama administration, has  not approved a new project since 2017, causing the executive director  of the fund to resign.   According to the Green Climate Fund former co-chair, 30 percent--yes,  30 percent--of the funds pledged are never going to materialize.   Despite its stated goal of supporting developing countries to pursue  renewable energy sources, the Green Climate Fund's pledges that do  materialize are going to wealthy nations with little to no effect on  emissions.   Let me give a couple of examples.   One project to install a solar plant in Kazakhstan directly benefited  Chinese construction companies instead of investing in Kazakhstan's  companies. Directly investing in one of our economic rivals, China, is  definitely the best use of taxpayer funds.   Worse yet, the fund proposed a $9.8 million investment in the wealthy  kingdom of Bahrain's oil sector. How is this pursuing renewables in  developing countries?   Many former and current members of the United Nations climate change  organizations acknowledge they have made little to no progress and  don't see the organization being successful in the future.                                time  1045    This amendment is not about climate change, but about the proper  stewardship of taxpayer dollars.   Our constituents should not have to foot the bill for organizations  that have no track record of success and have a proven history of  funding corruption and bad science to advance a radical climate change  agenda.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Rogers).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, throwing money into the wind  when it has no accountability is foolhardy. We have seen these over and  over. Good process builds good policy is good politics.   We want to see outcomes, and what we are not seeing from this is  outcomes.   Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to join in.   This isn't about climate change. This is about accountability. We  need to see results, not just throwing money to the wind.   Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote for this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I want to applaud the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), but I also want to highlight that there is a further issue  that we need to address.   Not only is there a pipeline problem, but there is a floodplain  problem that needs to have some jurisdiction and some changes and  involvement.    We have become the victims in regard to when floods run. We see our  infrastructure on this side of that international border being  destroyed.   Mr. Chair, this is a golden opportunity to highlight an opportunity  that is a joint venture between the two countries that we can actually  see some camaraderie to actually facilitate change.   Mr. Chair, I applaud the gentleman for bringing this up, and I look  forward to seeing us remedy this continuing problem.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It would prevent any  funds in this bill from being used for the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change.   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is  responsible for some of the worst multinational agreements we have  signed onto.   These agreements are technically implausible and have unrealistic  emission goals in order to appease environmental extremists. This  includes the flawed Paris Agreement, for example.   Americans for Tax Reform estimates the Paris Agreement will cost the  U.S. an estimated 6.5 million jobs by 2040 and reduce our GDP by over  $2.5 trillion.                                time  1100    NERA Consulting estimates those numbers are even higher and that the  [[Page H4648]]  Paris Agreement will cost the U.S. an estimated 31.6 million jobs by  2040 and reduce the GDP by over $3 trillion.   In June of 2017, President Trump announced he will withdraw the  United States from the Paris Agreement, stating: ``The Paris Climate  Accord is the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement  that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other  countries, leaving American workers. . . . and taxpayers to absorb the  cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and  vastly diminished economic production.''   The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change has also become a  mechanism for executive overreach. For example, when President Obama  signed us up in the Paris Agreement, he did not consult Congress in any  way. This was a direct assault on Congress' constitutional duty to  approve any treaty signed on to by the United States.   Fortunately, there is an alternative. Mr. Chairman, the best way to  improve our environment and ensure our economic prosperity is to allow  energy innovations in this country, not by sending millions of dollars  to some transnational organization.   We have new innovations being implemented in our energy sector as we  speak, every day. From carbon sequestration coal plants in Texas, to  the shale revolution in the Midwest, to solar facilities in my home  State of Arizona, locally driven solutions are creating thousands of  jobs and benefiting our environment.   It is a simple concept. The people who depend upon our energy  resources to provide security for their families and communities  understand those resources best. States and municipalities are best  suited to deal with local issues than are the distant out-of-touch  Washington and U.N. bureaucrats.   The facts are clear: The U.S. has had one of the largest absolute  decreases in carbon emissions of any country in the world. From 2005 to  2017, the U.S. cut 862 million tons of carbon, a 14 percent decline.  Over the same period, global emissions increased by 26 percent. China  increased its emissions by 4 billion tons, and India increased its  carbon dioxide emissions by 1.3 billion tons, a 70 percent increase.   America's energy renaissance is the backbone of our economy. It is a  story of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity. The story of the United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a much different one,  one that is characterized by a one-size-fits-all policy that gives  special preferences to some of the world's worst polluters, like China  and India.   This isn't a partisan issue. This is about doing what is right for  America and protecting freedom and opportunity for our children and  grandchildren. I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to support  my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, we hear the same lame excuse  over and over again, that doing the same thing over and over, we are  going to get a different result. Well, that doesn't work anymore.   Trust is a series of promises kept. Why don't we set by example? And  that is exactly what we are proposing here.   The United States, by our technology, by our innovation, has shown  the way in regards to combating climate change. That is exactly the way  that we ought to handle it, not by some failed multinational  bureaucracy that uses the United States as a slush fund.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, doing the same thing over and  over again and expecting a different result is insanity. Once again, we  have seen the ineptness of the United Nations in regard to this. We  have seen the misuse of money to developed nations like China and  India, and we allow them to continue to pollute when we set the  example.   I like the idea of setting the example for everybody else to follow.  We are the innovators. We are the leaders. We ought to establish that.  I ask everybody to vote for this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
