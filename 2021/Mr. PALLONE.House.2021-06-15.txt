 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, my friend from California, for moving this bill  through the committee as quickly as he did.   I rise today in support of the bill, H.R. 1257, the Homeless Veterans  Credit Repair, Enhancement, and Debt Improvement for Tomorrow Act.   We know that veterans' homelessness continues to be a blight on our  Nation. Congress and advocates from across the country have worked hard  to nearly halve the homeless veteran population in the past decade.   Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic jeopardized this progress by  negatively impacting the credit and financial stability of our Nation's  veterans.                                time  1430    Now is the time to redouble our efforts and do everything we can to  ensure stable housing for veterans. We must start by examining the  underlying causes of veteran homelessness in our Nation.   The VA has declared credit and financial counseling services a top 10  unmet need for our homeless veterans. My bill directs the Secretary of  the VA to conduct a study of the credit and financial counseling  services available to homeless veterans and veterans facing housing  instability. The study will assess current services available to  veterans and the barriers they face in utilizing them, including the  COVID-19 pandemic and other health challenges.   During a time of such economic uncertainty, we must look out for our  [[Page H2777]]  most vulnerable communities, including homeless veterans and veterans  experiencing housing instability. We have a responsibility to help  those who served in uniform and stood ready to make the ultimate  sacrifice for our country.   The CREDIT Act will identify the credit and financial counseling  services needed to help our veterans avoid financial pitfalls and make  informed decisions about their future.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank Chairman Takano for his partnership on  this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation. Together, we can improve veterans' financial  literacy to build a better life for themselves after they complete  their service to our country.   Madam Speaker, I also thank my staff member, Jake Freed, who  basically came up with this idea, after talking to various veterans  groups, and put this together.
