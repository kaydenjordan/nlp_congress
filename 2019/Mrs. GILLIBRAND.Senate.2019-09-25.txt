 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  as much time as I consume.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  Republican motion to instruct on paid family and medical leave.   Before I move to the issue at hand, I do want to address the very  serious allegations against President Trump and the new information we  are learning from the memo the White House released today.   It is deeply concerning to learn that President Trump asked Ukrainian  President Zelensky to work with the United States to investigate Vice  President Biden. Our democracy is at risk, and President Trump has  betrayed our country. I support Speaker Pelosi in starting the  impeachment inquiry she announced yesterday, and the revelations today  make these investigations even more necessary.                        Paid Family and Medical Leave    Mr. President, I now want to talk about an opportunity that we have  in the Senate today to serve the Nation by guaranteeing paid family and  medical leave for 2 million Federal workers and their families through  the Schatz motion.   Every other industrialized country in the world has some version of  paid leave, which allows workers to take care of their loved ones when  a medical emergency arises. Yet the vast majority of our workforce in  America lacks access to paid leave. That means far too many of our  workers are unable to take paid time off if they need to care for a new  child, a sick parent, or their spouse. Sadly, this includes 2 million  of our Federal employees--and I know the Presiding Officer is aware of  this, given his own family situation--but we have a chance to fix that  right now. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Schatz motion.   However, Senate Republicans have offered an additional motion that  would block this benefit from every other working American. This is  nothing short of an attack on all workers' access to affordable and  accessible paid family and medical leave.   What my Republican colleagues are suggesting is that our workers  should work overtime to compensate for family leave. Their motion would  require workers to shift around their hours and take on more hours in  order to receive the paid time off they need in an emergency situation  or when welcoming a new child.   Let me be very clear. This is not a benefit. It is a cynical plan  that would erode our American workers' abilities to make ends meet and  harm their access to real paid leave. It would hurt those who need this  the most, including women, communities of color, and low-wage workers.   Most workers living paycheck to paycheck will not be able to take  extra shifts to earn paid leave. Too many families across the country  don't even have $400 in savings for emergency expenses. Take Shelby  Ramirez Martinez, for example. She found herself in the most untenable  situation when her daughter and her father both had simultaneous  surgeries scheduled. Shelby is a mom of two, caregiver to her father,  and a full-time student and security officer. She didn't have access to  paid leave, so she was forced to take 2 weeks off and forgo her pay.  She couldn't have planned for that by working overtime and sacrificing  time with her daughter or with a flex savings account. What Shelby and  all Americans need is dedicated and extended time off for medical  emergencies and births.   The Republican motion to instruct calls for employer tax credits that  are handouts to large and rich companies like Google, which already  provide paid leave and leaves taxpayers footing the bill. They are  false incentives for small businesses that still will not be able to  afford the leave.   My bill, the FAMILY Act, would provide 12 weeks of paid family and  medical leave for all workers. It is the only comprehensive proposal  that is accessible and affordable for all working Americans. It is  modeled off of very successful State programs like California's,  ensuring that working Americans do not have to choose between their  family and their paycheck.   It shouldn't be so hard. So many workers around the country have new  children, sick spouses, or elderly parents, and they need access to  paid leave. Today, let's stand together and reject fake paid leave by  voting no on the Ernst motion to instruct, for people like Shelby and  her family.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment because, as it is written, it really rewards only companies  that are very wealthy and successful with additional tax credits to do  something they are already doing. By that measure, it will leave most  American workers without basic access to leave.   The other potential idea is about shifting hours and suggesting that  workers have to work overtime to be able to have paid leave. Every  parent in America, every person in America, will have a time when they  have a family crisis--whether it is a dying parent, whether it is a  sick spouse, whether it is a new child--and we are still the only  industrialized country in the world that doesn't have access to  national paid leave. We should be able to come together around this  commonsense solution that Senator Schatz has offered to create at least  the first step to make sure our Federal workers aren't  disproportionately harmed because they can't compete with the private  sector.   I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
