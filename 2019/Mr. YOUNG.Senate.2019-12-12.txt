 Mr. President, I rise to formally express my appreciation  to Mr. Jeremy Wheeler. Jeremy is a congressional relations officer in  the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, over the last year, he  served as a fellow on my national security and veterans team.   Jeremy has supported my work helping the veterans of Indiana and the  Nation using his exceptional knowledge of the Veterans Affairs system  and his experience working with many of the veterans service  organizations. A dedicated public servant, Jeremy has spent much of the  last two decades serving our Nation. He served in the U.S. Army for 6  years, including two combat tours in Iraq in 2003 and 2005. After 5  years working in Hollywood, he returned to government service at the  Department of Veterans Affairs and has spent much of this decade  working to improve the quality and access to care for our Nation's  heroes, establish deeper relationships with veterans service  organizations, and strengthen the VA's outreach and communications  capabilities.   In my office this year, he has provided valuable insight into how the  legislation before this Chamber would be implemented and how it would  impact the VA's ability to continue serving our veterans. And perhaps  most impressively, I am not sure how many offices on Capitol Hill can  boast an Emmy-winning staff member. This is just one of the many unique  contributions Jeremy has brought to my office. In the last year, I have  continually been impressed with Jeremy's work ethic, professionalism,  candor, and knowledge.   Next month, Jeremy will be returning to the VA, where I have no doubt  he will continue seeking innovative ways to caring for veterans. I wish  him the best in all his endeavors, and I look forward to working with  him in the future.                            ____________________
