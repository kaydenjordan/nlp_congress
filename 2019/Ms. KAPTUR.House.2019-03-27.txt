 Madam Chair, our Republican colleagues say the Paycheck  Fairness Act is unnecessary, a boom for trial attorneys and a burden on  employers, but once again the latest numbers tell a different story.  American women continue to lag far behind fair pay for equal work.   The latest numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau once again revealed  that American women working full-time, year-round, are typically paid  only 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. The pay  gaps are even more severe for women of color: 61 cents for African  American women and 53 cents for Latina women.   Women take home less money than they have rightfully earned in every  industry, no matter what they do, how high their level of education, or  where they are from.   Not only is this a matter of basic equality, economic justice and  freedom, it also compounds and is a significant issue impacting women's  retirement security.   The Paycheck Fairness Act provides a long-overdue remedy to the 1963  Equal Pay Act. It will give women the tools needed to successfully  challenge pay discrimination and to incentivize employers to comply  with the law.   I urge all my colleagues to support its passage.    Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate World Water Day,  just celebrated on March 22.   Water sustains life on Earth. It is critical to health, sanitation,  food production, and the economy at large.   Tragically, over 2 billion people around our world lack access to  safe drinking water, a humanitarian crisis. Some live in our country.   Limited access to freshwater is an ever-increasing risk to our  national security as nations go to war over this precious resource.  Meanwhile, terrorist organizations seek to control water resources to  finance their destabilizing activities. That is why we must fully fund  U.S. diplomatic leadership, to ensure that the looming conflicts over  water can be nipped in the bud.   My own constituents in northern Ohio are acutely aware of how  precious access to clean water can be. In the summer of 2014,  fertilizer runoff led to massive clusters of harmful algae blooms in  Lake Erie, compromising water supplies to over half a million residents  of Toledo. Flint, Michigan, shortly thereafter, endured its own water  crisis.   As the Appropriations Committee's Energy and Water Development, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee chair, I can assure you that our  committee is working tirelessly to fight for improved infrastructure,  environmental protections, and access to clean water.   Together, we will meet this crisis in our country and abroad and  allow the vital human right for freshwater to belong to everyone.                            ____________________
