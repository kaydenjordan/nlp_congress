 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bost for his  leadership on this important bill.   I rise in support of the AUTO for Veterans Act. This legislation  would expand, as stated, access to the Department of Veterans Affairs'  automobile grant, which assists severely disabled veterans.   Veterans, especially those in rural communities, Madam Speaker, face  transportation challenges, as we all know, that affect their quality of  life and independence. Expanding the VA auto grant program is a  commonsense step toward improving this program for men and women who  made tremendous sacrifices serving our country.   Improving access to safe and reliable transportation for disabled  veterans will ensure they can maintain their independence and lead  fulfilling, healthy lives.   I introduced the AUTO for Veterans Act, a bill nearly identical to  this legislation, in the last Congress, and it did receive support from  numerous veterans service organizations and garnered over 70  cosponsors, including Democrats and Republicans. I am glad that my  Democrat colleagues were able to see the merit of this legislation, and  I do look forward to the Senate taking action on this legislation and  providing much-needed support and independence for our wounded  veterans.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
