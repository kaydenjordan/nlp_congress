 Madam Speaker, I am here in the House of  Representatives. I have had the honor to have been elected to this  incredible body for, now, four terms. But I just want to report to you,  Madam Speaker, that we have, in fact, passed 275 bipartisan bills in  the last 12 months in these Chambers.   Madam Speaker, I thank my Republican colleagues, my Democratic  colleagues, and, yes, the one Independent colleague who is part of  every single one of those votes.   I just want to say, that is the business of the House of  Representatives. I just want to remind you, Madam Speaker, that we are  serious here, from all parties, to make sure that we adhere to the  needs of the entire American people and, in some cases, to the world.   We have addressed issues such as reducing drug pricing to all  Americans. We have addressed issues when it comes to making sure that  children have a safe place to go to school.   We have many issues that we are faced with here in the House of  Representatives, and I am proud to say that, although the media says  that we just can't get along, and, yes, we disagree at times, but, at  the same time, we are, in fact, getting the work of the people done in  the House of Representatives.   I pray that we see the same go on in the Senate and, in addition to  that, see many of those bills get signed by the President of the United  States.                            ____________________
