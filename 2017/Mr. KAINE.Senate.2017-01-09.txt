 Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues, and I am  thrilled to be here with them, to save our health care and to try to  convince our colleagues that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would  be health care malpractice, and because health care is one-sixth of the  American economy, it would be economic malpractice as well.   What I thought I would do basically is just tell two stories. I am  going to tell a Virginia story from before the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, and I am going to tell a Virginia story since the  passage of the act.   I was first elected to statewide office in 2001, and I became the  Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Shortly after, I started to attend, on  a fairly regular basis, a most amazing annual event. It is called the  Remote Area Medical clinic in Wise County, VA. It is in the heart of  Appalachia, in a community on the border of Kentucky where my wife's  family is from. This was an annual medical clinic that was set up by  some Catholic nuns who were driving a van around trying to offer  medical care to people who didn't have it, and they decided they would  recruit volunteers. They would set up at a dusty county fairground, the  Virginia-Kentucky fairground in Wise, VA, and open the doors on  Saturday to people who didn't have health care. It had been going for  many years when I first went as Lieutenant Governor. I had heard so  much about it, and I was anxious to go see it.   Here is what I saw when I first went there. People start to come on  about Tuesday of the week when it is going to open on Friday, and they  come in groups of three or four families, and then they come in groups  of ten or dozens, and then hundreds, and then thousands, to this dusty  county fairground in late July--hot in Southwestern Virginia. They  gather so that on Friday morning, at about 7 o'clock when it opens,  they have gotten a number, they know where they are in the line, and  sometime over the course of Friday and Saturday, they will be able to  see a doctor, in some instances for the first time in their lives.  There are doctors, dentists, medical students, the Lions Club  volunteers to give vision screenings, hundreds of volunteers, and  thousands of people seeking medical care.   The first year I went to this, I was overwhelmed at the magnitude of  the philanthropic spirit of the volunteers, and I was also overwhelmed  at the depth of the need. Something made it more palpable by walking  around the parking lot to see where people had come from.   This is a community that is on the border of Virginia and Kentucky so  I wasn't surprised to see Virginia license plates and Kentucky license  plates. It is kind of near West Virginia so I wasn't surprised to see  West Virginia license plates. It is near Tennessee. I saw Tennessee  license plates. I saw North Carolina license plates. What struck me as  I went through the parking lot was to see license plates from Georgia  and license plates from Alabama and license plates from as far away as  Oklahoma.   We are the richest Nation on Earth. We are the most compassionate  Nation on Earth. Yet, in order to get medical care, people would get in  their cars and drive for days, and then camp for days, for the chance  to see a doctor or a dentist.   It reminded me that first year, and it reminds me still, of the way  health care was delivered in the poor country of Honduras where I  served as a missionary in 1980 and 1981. There wasn't really a health  care network. Occasionally, missionaries or others would set up a  clinic in a mountain community once a year--maybe less than that--and  people would gather, and that was the way we were delivering health  care in a successful State, in the most compassionate and wealthiest  Nation on Earth. It is just not right. It is just not right.   The RAM clinic still goes on. It hasn't gone away, but I will tell my  colleagues what has happened since the passage of the Affordable Care  Act. The percentage of Americans without health insurance has dropped  from over 16 percent to about 8 percent. It has almost been cut in  half, and the uninsurance rate in this country is at its nearly lowest  percentage since we have been able to record that number. That means  there is less of a need for the RAM clinics because more people can  have a medical home and can seek care. That decline has also been  significant because in Virginia, we were about 14 percent uninsured in  2010, and that number has now come down to about 9 percent.   So that first story--the story of this RAM clinic, pre-Affordable  Care Act, with one in six Americans not having health insurance--we  have done a good thing as a Congress to provide access to dramatically  reduce that number.   Let me tell my colleagues a second story. The second story is just  about a family, a story in a letter that I received just a few days  ago. It is a different aspect of the Affordable Care Act. It is not so  much about the reduction in the uninsured, but it is about more peace  of mind and security for the majority of Americans who do have health  insurance.         Dear Senator Kaine,        As a Senator, you have been charged with an immense task.       Your constituents rely on you to work on our behalf to uphold       and protect the freedoms we enjoy as Virginians and       Americans. We also rely on you to safeguard the legislation       that exists to keep our family and so many of our friends and       neighbors healthy and safe.        When I graduated from the University of Virginia, I was       fortunate to enter a career through which I received       excellent benefits. I taught second grade and kindergarten in       both Chesterfield and Albemarle Counties. My health insurance       was comprehensive and affordable. I didn't know how good I       had it.        After years in the classroom, I put my career on hold while       I stayed at home with our children. We were so lucky to have       been in a position to be able to make that choice. I know       that being able to rely on a single income is not a reality       for many Virginians. We enrolled in a private health       insurance plan through my husband's company, a small business       based out of Richmond, Virginia.        Our new plan came at a higher cost than my excellent       public-school teachers' insurance, but it was comprehensive       and it allowed my husband and me, and especially our       children, access to outstanding health care. Just this past       year, my husband, who was by then a part-owner in the       company, left his position to open his own Financial Advisory       firm. It was a move that was made easier because we had the       option of enrolling in a health insurance plan through the       Affordable Care Act, which we did in July of 2016.        In addition to well checkups, sick visits, prescriptions       for antibiotics, and vaccinations, we rely on our health       insurance made affordable through ``ObamaCare'' to, quite       literally, save our children's lives.        Our oldest son is ``medically complex.'' He was diagnosed       with multiple and severe food allergies when he was just 10       months old. Though he was initially highly reactive to over       13 foods, with the help of a vigilant pediatric allergist,       multiple blood draws, tens of skin prick tests, and four in-      office, hours-long oral food challenges, my son can now       safely eat all foods except for nuts, peanuts, milk, and       shellfish. Still, we pay a premium for life-saving       prescriptions that we hope he'll never need: Epi-pens. He       needs one at school and one that travels with him from home       to extracurricular activities. Even after insurance, we pay       nearly $1,000 each year for these prescriptions.        In addition to his pediatrician and allergist, we have been       to a psychologist for his anxiety and a cardiologist for a       detected heart murmur. More recently, after his pediatrician       became concerned about his stagnation on his growth chart, my       nine-year old has been subjected to more blood draws, weight       checks, countless hemoglobin level checks, and a consultation       with a gastroenterologist. Next week he will undergo an       endoscopy and a colonoscopy to, hopefully, diagnose a       treatable condition that, once known and treated, will enable       him to get back on that weight chart and thriving.        Because of our health insurance, we have the peace of mind       of being able to afford these doctors' visits, lab work, and       medical procedures for our son. Our medical insurance through       the Affordable Care Act allows us access to the best medical       care and professionals in our area.        Please do what is right for our family. Please do what is       right for your constituents. Please do what is right for our       country. Please save the Affordable Care Act.        Thank you for taking the time to read one little piece of       our family's story.        Sarah Harris, Crozet, VA.    My first story was about people who didn't have health insurance. My  second story is about people who do have  [[Page S164]]  health insurance, but the health insurance is now affordable and  comprehensive. My second story about the Harris family is also about  something else important. Her husband was able to leave a job with  health benefits to start his own company, which we want to encourage in  this country. We want to encourage entrepreneurs. We want to encourage  innovators. Before the Affordable Care Act, somebody like Mr. Harris  couldn't leave his job and start a company because he wouldn't have  been able to buy insurance that would have covered a child with a  preexisting condition. Imagine being a parent with a dream, like so  many have, of starting your own business, and realizing you could not  achieve that dream and you would have to put it on hold because if you  changed your job, you would not be able to get health insurance for  your child.   I gave a speech about this on the floor last week. I will just  conclude and say this. Health insurance is to provide a protection for  you when you are ill or injured, but that is not all it is about  because if you are a parent, even if your child is healthy, but you do  not have health insurance, you go to bed at night wondering what is  going to happen to my family if my child gets sick tomorrow or if I am  in an accident tomorrow. Who is going to be there? How is my family  going to be taken care of?   So what the Affordable Care Act is about is, as Sarah Harris said,  peace of mind. It is about coverage, but it is also about the peace of  mind that you need as a parent to know that your child will be  protected if you are ill or if your child is injured. That is what the  Affordable Care Act has done for the Harris family of Crozet, VA. That  is what it has done for tens of millions of Americans.    The Urban Institute indicated that if the Affordable Care Act is  repealed without a replacement, or even a delayed replacement, it could  cause 30 million Americans to lose their health insurance--and 30  million Americans is the combined population of 19 States in this  country. This is not a game. This is very, very serious, life and  death, that we are grappling with in this body. My strong hope is that  our colleagues will join together and decide that we want to fix and  improve the health care system of our Nation but not break it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
