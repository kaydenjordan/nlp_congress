 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the former  Flying Aggie, Oklahoma State University graduate, and my Alpha Chi  Omega sorority sister, Mary Wallace ``Wally'' Funk, who today became  the oldest woman to have traveled to space. At 82 years old, Funk has  led an amazing life, from breaking down gender barriers to careers in  aviation, and now space travel.   In my home State of Oklahoma at Fort Sill, Funk achieved many firsts,  including the first female civilian flight instructor, first female air  safety investigator, and the first female FAA inspector.   Persistence is just one of the many wonderful qualities to describe  Funk. When NASA began accepting women to go to space in the late 1970s,  she applied three times.   As a pioneer of the aviation and space exploration, Funk's courage,  perseverance, and leadership has positively impacted the science  industry, especially for women. Mr. Speaker, I am truly honored to  recognize Wally Funk for her vast achievements.                            ____________________
