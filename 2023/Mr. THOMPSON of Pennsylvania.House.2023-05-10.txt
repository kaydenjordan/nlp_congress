 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the retirement and longtime service of Patton Township Manager Douglas  J. Erickson, who has served the Centre County community for over 25  years.   Douglas Erickson began as township engineer and director of public  works in 1998 before becoming township manager in 2006. While 18  township supervisors have come and gone since his first day as a  township employee, Erickson has remained committed to public service.   In his time, Doug oversaw the rapid expansion and development of the  State College suburb and left a long legacy of accomplishments.   Under his leadership, Patton Township has seen unprecedented growth,  including adding thousands of new residents and the construction of  nearly 3,000 new homes.   The township government has grown to include more than 15 employees  in police, public works, administration and finance and engineering,  and planning and zoning departments. Doug has secured an incredible $30  million in grants for township projects, helping to improve the quality  of life for all the township's residents.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Douglas J. Erickson for his commitment to  serving his community of Patton Township, and I wish him a very happy  retirement.                            ____________________
