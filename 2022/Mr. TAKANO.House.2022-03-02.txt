 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 950, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3967) to improve health care and benefits for veterans  exposed to toxic substances, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3967, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3967, as amended, the  Honoring our PACT Act of 2021.   When we sent our servicemembers into harm's way, we made a pact to  care for them when they came home. But for too long, Congress and the  Department of Veterans Affairs have been slow to accept responsibility  and cost of that care, citing high costs or lack of absolute,  scientific proof of illness connections to service. The result is a  disability claims process that is cumbersome and places the burden of  proof for toxic exposure on veterans themselves.   Every day more and more veterans speak out about exposure to  environmental hazards and other toxic substances during their military  service.   Recently, I put out a call encouraging toxic exposed veterans to  share their experiences with the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. We  heard from thousands of veterans in 49 States. These reflections are  very powerful, Mr. Speaker, and I would like to share some of them with  you now.   Navy veteran Ed described how toxic exposures overwhelmed his senses.  He wrote: ``You could not escape the jet fuel. You could see it, smell  it, and taste it.''   I heard from Marine veteran Mike who said: ``Even when we weren't  actively engaged in dumping items into the burn pit, we were still  exposed.''   Air Force veteran Christopher R. described his dealings with VA  stating: ``I continue to be rejected because they say that it is  impossible to prove that it is service related. I never worked with  chemicals before my service or since. I feel like a nuisance to the VA  health system.''   I heard from a widow of Army veteran Austin Monk who said: ``No wife  should have to bury her 22-year-old husband because of his exposure to  unsafe conditions while in service to his country.''                                time  1230    These stories are heart-wrenching and frustrating. Our veterans are  fighting their own government to grant them the care and benefits they  have earned.   We should be outraged listening to these stories, and it should be  clear how urgent passing the Honoring our PACT Act is for our veterans.  Veterans and veterans service organizations agree.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from more  than 42 veterans service organizations.                                                  February 24, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker,      House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the American service members and veterans we represent,       the undersigned representatives of our respective Veterans       and Military Service Organizations call on the House to       expeditiously consider and pass into law the Honoring Our       PACT Act (H.R. 3967).        Throughout our history, and most recently over the course       of more than 20 years of war in the post-9/11 era, service       members and veterans suffered prolonged exposure to dangerous       toxic substances, such as burn pits that destroyed trash,       medical and human waste, chemicals, and fuel, in and around       the battlefields of Iraq, Afghanistan and other places. Of       the hundreds of thousands of our members who have suffered       these exposures, many have returned home sick (or would       become ill), and many have also died of their injuries.        Collectively, we have spent years educating Congress,       national leaders, and the public on the enormous scope of the       injuries faced by our community. There have been small-scale       measures to boost education, training, research, and outreach       to begin to address the problem. Over the last several years,       many of our organizations have worked together to assemble       the components of comprehensive toxic exposure legislation       that provides VA health care, a new process to determine       future presumptive conditions, and provide overdue disability       benefits to thousands of veterans from all wars and eras       suffering from toxic exposures.        There have been a number of bills introduced in the House       that address different aspects of the toxic exposures puzzle,       however the Honoring Our PACT Act is the only bill that       provides a truly comprehensive solution. Although many of us       have supported some of these other burn pits and toxic       exposure bills, none of them provides a complete and lasting       solution for veterans who are or may become ill as a result       of toxic exposures. Consequently, when the Honoring Our PACT       Act is brought to the floor for consideration, if any such       legislation is offered as an amendment or motion to restrict       or substitute, rather than supplement, the underlying bill,       we would urge all members to oppose such amendments or       motions.        Our organizations call on the House to pass the Honoring       Our PACT Act without further delay, to finally provide those       who have laid their lives on the line for all Americans with       the health care and benefits they need and deserve.            Sincerely,        Air Force Sergeants Association (AFSA), Association of       Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS), Army Aviation       Association of America, Burn Pits 360, California Communities       Against Toxics, Cease Fire Campaign, Commissioned Officers       Association of the USPHS, Disabled American Veterans (DAV),       Dixon Center for Military and Veterans Services, Enlisted       Association of the National Guard of the United States       (EANGUS), Environmental Working Group (EWG), Fleet Reserve       Association (FRA), Gold Star Wives of America, GO2 Foundation       for Lung Cancer.

Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Nancy Pelosi, our Speaker,  for her commitment to bring this bill to the floor. After years of  diligent input from my colleagues, our staff, VA, VSOs, and toxic- exposed veterans themselves, I am confident that we are bringing the  best possible version of this bill up for a vote.   The administration agrees and has stated that it ``strongly  supports'' this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administrative  Policy for H.R. 3967.  [[Page H1229]]                          Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 3967--Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT)             Act--Rep. Takano, D-California and 100 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3967, which would       expand veterans' access to health care and benefits to       address the health effects of harmful environmental exposures       that occurred during military service.        The President believes that our Nation has only one truly       sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our service       members when we send them into harm's way and to care for       them and their families when they return home. Far too often,       military service comes with a cost, and we owe it to our       veterans and their families to address these consequences       comprehensively. Unfortunately, it has taken decades to       understand the deleterious effects of environmental       exposures--leaving too many without access to the benefits       and services they need.        H.R. 3967 would make changes to the definitions for who is       eligible for VA health care based on presumed toxic exposure       during military service, including from burn pits, radiation,       or other environmental conditions. H.R. 3967 would also make       changes to the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA's) process       for determining presumptive service connection and mandate       several research studies related to military related       environmental exposures. It would also establish new       registries related to exposures, which would provide new data       on the long-term impacts from environmental exposures. H.R.       3697 also would allow a Federal cause of action related to       contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and       establish training requirements for health providers, and       require an outreach plan to educate veterans about their       eligibility for benefits and services related to toxic       exposure.        The Administration looks forward to working with the       Congress to enact this legislation and ensuring it is       effectively implemented. We must address the toxic legacy of       environmental exposures sustained by veterans during their       military service and fulfill our sacred obligation to our       veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. We must       also ensure that VA has the resources it needs to implement       this legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support  from The Independence Fund.                                          The Independence Fund,                                                  February 23, 2022.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chair, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: The       Independence Fund endorses the Honoring Our PACT Act (H.R.       3976) and urges its quickest adoption by the full House of       Representatives. We further urge the House to engage the       Senate with an appropriate legislative vehicle to get a       House-Senate conference started as soon as possible to work       out a final legislative solution this spring.        The Independence Fund's been proud to join with Wounded       Warrior Project, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America,       and numerous other veteran organizations through the Toxic       Exposure in the American Military (TEAM) Coalition since       August of 2020 and the initial introduction and Senate       passage of the Toxic Exposure in the American Military (TEAM)       Act of 2020 (S. 4393) and has applauded the serious and       intensive work the House Committee on Veterans Affairs       undertook over the last 16 months.        Now, with the potential House passage of H.R. 3967, we       commit to engaging the Senate to pass this bill as soon as       possible, and if necessary, proceed to a Conference Committee       as soon as possible to ensure this bill can be enacted in       this Session of Congress. We will also urge the other veteran       and military serving organizations with which we work to join       us in such an effort collectively.        A veteran The Independence Fund serves, Nick Ooley, joined       the Army in 2007 and deployed to Iraq the following year.       Today, he is unable to run, jog, or even play basketball with       his 11-year-old son. As he details, ``Burn pits were all over       the place. We did convoy security, so we would travel to Al       Taqaddum, Ramadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, all over the place. When       we would drive through or get stationed in those areas, we       would be breathing this smoke all the time. The smoke would       be so thick during the day that the lights would come on like       it was dark.'' But with 78% of all disability claims related       to toxic exposure denied by the VA, disabled veterans are       denied the help they desperately need and deserve.        While The Independence Fund will always support disabled       veterans like Nick through our disabled veteran assistance       programs, the presumptive condition relief and mandated       health care provided in The Honoring Our PACT Act will be a       crucially needed lifeline for these veterans who have given       so much in the defense of our country. We salute your       leadership on this issue and stand ready to assist however we       can in making this the law of the land.            Very Respectfully,                                                      Bob Carey,                                           Executive Vice President,                                               Advocacy & Strategy.     Mr. Speaker, it is now time for the Members of this body  to answer a simple question: Am I willing to support our troops and  honor our Nation's promise to them?   This bill addresses the true cost of war, and opposing it would be a  vote against our servicemembers and veterans. Such a vote would be  inconsistent with the thank-yous and patriotic displays so many of my  colleagues offer on Veterans Day. Veterans want action, and they  deserve our action.   We made a promise to deliver comprehensive toxic exposure  legislation, and I intend to keep that promise.   The Honoring our PACT Act will address the full scope of issues  affecting toxic-exposed veterans' access to VA care and benefits while  reforming VA's presumptive decisionmaking process. It will expand VA  healthcare eligibility for over 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn  pits and establish a presumption of service connection for over 23  respiratory illnesses and cancers. There is no other toxic exposure  legislation in Congress like this one in scope or in soundness.   Before I close, I must emphasize something essential. We cannot  renege on our responsibility to toxic-exposed veterans because of any  perceived sticker shock.   Cries for offsets and pay-fors did not stop Congress from passing a  $1.9 trillion tax cut for corporations and the wealthy in 2017. Over  the past 20 years, Congress and our country made the choice to spend  trillions on other priorities while sending servicemembers into harm's  way at the cost of $6.4 trillion.   We know that this Congress is willing to find money when it wants to,  as it recently demonstrated by adding $25 billion to the last National  Defense Authorization Act. When our country goes to war, we don't  nickel and dime the Department of Defense, and we shouldn't try to  pinch pennies when it comes to covering the care for toxic-exposed  veterans.   We will not stand by and be lectured about fiscal responsibility when  we have a moral obligation to America's veterans. And the time to meet  that obligation is now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), a person who  has done more for veterans in modern times than any other leader of  this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend, who serves as the chair of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the esteemed majority leader of this House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend who serves as chair of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations for the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend and cosponsor of H.R. 3967. She  is the chair of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee and also a veteran herself and former commander of a naval  surface ship.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), my good friend who serves as chair of the  Subcommittee on Technology Modernization on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), my good friend and neighbor in California,  someone who has authored a great big section of this bill on our  presumptives, a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and an  active member on the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), my very good friend who serves as a subcommittee  chair on the Appropriations Committee and also a former member of the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  [[Page H1235]]  (Mr. Castro), my good friend who serves on the Education and Labor  Committee and is a member of the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence and is a subcommittee chair on the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), my very good friend who serves on the  Education and Labor Committee with me and as is the subcommittee chair  on the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), my good friend who is a  valued member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, serving on the  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to how much time  I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Meng), my very good friend who serves on the House  Appropriations Committee.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Guam  (Mr. San Nicolas), my good friend who serves on the Committee on  Financial Services and the Committee on Natural Resources.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  the State of California (Mr. Ruiz), my good friend and colleague, the  author of the provisions on the 23 presumptions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to give the final words on the underlying bill, the PACT  Act, on my mind is a constituent, a Vietnam veteran named Zack Earp, a  distant relative of the great Wyatt Earp.   Zack sacrificed mightily on behalf of our country, and his body  trembles today from Parkinsonism, one of the presumptives that got  added during the blue water Navy debate. And I was happy to lead the  final charge on getting the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act across  the finish line.   But do you know what? Passage of that bill and its signage into law  finally brought justice to our Vietnam veterans who served on naval  surface ships on the territorial waters of Vietnam. It was 40 years  late, justice 40 years late.   Mr. Speaker, I vowed that this would not happen again. To pass half  measures, one-tenth measures, or one-half of 1 percent measures, which  is what the minority proposes to do today, as a substitute for a  comprehensive bill is simply repeating the history of what we did to  our Vietnam veterans. Burn pits are this generation of veterans' Agent  Orange.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends that we cannot repeat that history.  We owe our Vietnam veterans that implicit promise that we would not  repeat the history that was done to them.   As for the cost, I hear the other side competing with the President.  Let us send more billions of dollars to Ukraine. And I, myself, would  support a robust response to Ukraine in terms of money, but where is  that same sense of one-upmanship when it comes to taking care of the  veterans here in America?   People are falling over each other in this Chamber to get more money  to Ukraine. That is the right thing to do, but it is also the right  thing to do to take care of our veterans and to finish the unfinished  business.   Finally, the science, I am glad to see science is being taken so  seriously by the minority after we have seen skepticism about vaccines,  skepticism about climate change. Suddenly, we are looking for  scientific absolutism about our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my friends, the science is there. Let's get  this done. Let's pass the PACT Act today with a big bipartisan vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution  950, I rise to offer 23 amendments en bloc to H.R. 3967.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan en bloc of amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush), my good friend who serves on the  Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), my good friend who serves as a subcommittee  chair on the Agriculture Committee and as a member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the distinguished subcommittee chair of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  supporting these 23 amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of  my time.  [[Page H1242]]     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to Ranking Member Bost's  substitute offered in his absence by Representative Miller-Meeks.   I want to be clear about what this substitute is and what it is not.  The ranking member has offered this amendment as the solution to  addressing toxic exposure. But it is not that. The substitute amendment  is the exact text of a Senator Tester bill which is meant to be the  first part of a three-part effort in the Senate.   What Senator Tester has proposed, is doing in three phases what we  have done in the PACT Act together. Yet my colleague from Illinois and  my colleague from Iowa have taken the work of the Senate without  intending to do  [[Page H1244]]  any more. This is it. They are representing this as the complete  solution which amounts to really a bait and switch.   This substitute amendment would strike the entire PACT Act and  replace it with an expansion of existing healthcare eligibility for  combat veterans from 5 to 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office  estimates that this provision will impact roughly 16,000 veterans over  the next 10 years. This is laudable, but let's talk about the math.   Over the past 20 years, 3.5 million servicemembers deployed to areas  where they may have been exposed to toxic substances. So the ranking  member's amendment would leave behind over 3.4 million veterans.   This is not even a half measure, this substitute, this replacement,  that they offer. It is not even one-tenth. It is one-half of 1 percent,  a one-half of 1 percent solution compared to the comprehensive bill  that we need.   The policy of this amendment is something we agree on. We should  enhance eligibility for combat veterans which is why we included the  language in the bill before you today, Mr. Speaker. However, it only  covers less than half a percentage point of the number of veterans who  would be covered under PACT.   My colleague is asserting that less than one-half of a percentage  point is enough to be done and then walk away?   The math does not add up, and veterans know it. That is why over 42  veterans service organizations are supporting the PACT Act. Again, I  reference the letters previously inserted into the Record.   During the President's State of the Union Address last night, he  highlighted the importance of this topic citing his own family tragedy  and the loss of his son, Beau, to brain cancer after his military  service. He called on Congress to ``pass a law to make sure veterans  devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the  benefits and comprehensive healthcare they deserve.''   Let me repeat that: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by  toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and  comprehensive healthcare they deserve.   The Bost substitute is far from comprehensive. In fact, it is a  fraction of what our veterans have earned and deserve.   It is time we honored our pact to our veterans. That is why I implore  my colleagues to reject this incremental measure and join me in  supporting the only comprehensive toxic-exposure legislation that  delivers on our sacred promise, the PACT Act.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is my good friend and who  serves on the Budget Committee, the Homeland Security Committee, and as  the chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security on the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the chair of the  Subcommittee on Health.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Brownley-Miller-Meeks  amendment. Women who have served in the military are 20 to 40 percent  more likely to develop breast cancer than women who have never served.  It is believed that it is due to exposure to radiation and other  carcinogens while serving. It is therefore critical that VA ensure all  veterans who have served in locations associated with toxic exposure  have access to prompt, high-quality breast imaging services to detect  breast cancer early.   This amendment would ensure just that. Any eligible veteran who was  deployed and exposed to burn pits and airborne hazards would be  eligible for mammography screens by the VA. These screenings will save  lives.   Furthermore, it requires VA to submit a report to Congress on the  rates of breast cancer among those veterans deployed to such toxic  environments and compare those rates against their veteran peers who  were not exposed, as well as the civilian population.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment.                                time  1415
