 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 842, the so- called PRO Act. This bill undermines worker privacy, forces independent  contractors to become employees, and overturns right-to-work laws in 27  States, including my home State of Idaho.   The bill obstructs workers from getting rid of corrupt unions by  blocking or delaying elections from taking place due to frivolous  lawsuits.   Now, I have an amendment. It is unlikely to see the light of day. So  I will mention it here. It protects the worker's right to vote. Under  my amendment, if an unfair labor practice charge  [[Page H1148]]  is made, the election still takes place, with ballots secured by the  National Labor Relations Board until the charge is resolved.   Now, make no mistake, H.R. 842 would still be a bad bill, but at  least my amendment would ensure union elections take place as  scheduled, prioritizing worker rights over the unionization process.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.
