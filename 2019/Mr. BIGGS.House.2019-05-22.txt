 Madam Speaker, today highlights another success story from  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Arizona Public Service, the largest electric utility in Arizona,  recently announced that it will again be lowering electricity rates to  customers. Arizonans can now expect to save more than $100 a year on  their electricity bill thanks to the Republican-led tax reform package  signed by President Trump.   These savings are not crumbs. They are real, and they will benefit  millions of people across our State. APS services about 2.7 million  people and operates the Palo Verde Generating Station, which is the  largest source of clean-air energy in the United States. The Palo Verde  nuclear power plant has 2,500 full-time employees and generates an  economic impact of more than $2 billion to our State.   Madam Speaker, the 100-degree temperature days are upon us, and I  know firsthand how expensive summertime bills can be. This announcement  by APS is yet another example of Arizonans winning because of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act.                            ____________________
