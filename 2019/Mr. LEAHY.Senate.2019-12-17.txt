 Madam President, I support the fiscal year 2020 National  Defense Authorization Act. The final, conferenced version of this bill  reflects a compromise. As with any compromise, there are things I  support and things I wish the final bill had included.   Of great significance is the inclusion in this bill of a provision  providing 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all Federal employees.  There are Federal employees in every corner of this country, including  in Vermont. We lead by example when we say that the Federal Government  will support new parents, who will now be able to be home with their  new child in those important first days. I hope that this example is  one that can be replicated throughout our workforce.   The fiscal year 2020 NDAA includes important wins for servicemembers,  their families, and our national security as well. I am pleased that at  long last we have successfully introduced a phase-out of the so-called  Widows' Tax. This bill mandates gender integration for Marine Corps  training, makes much needed progress in addressing the use and after  effects of open-air burn pits, and demands new standards for  microelectronics supply chains, so we know our technology is working  for us.   Closer to home, the bill authorizes $30 million to construct a new  Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho. This is important to Vermont  and to the Nation. This major construction project will allow the  Vermont Army National Guard, one of the Nations' few mountain  battalions, to better fulfill their mission of training soldiers from  the Guard, Reserves, and Active Duty to accomplish their mission in  cold, rugged terrain. Vermont is an ideal training ground because its  mountains and climate are challenging, but still allow training  throughout the year for all levels of expertise. That training is  important to the Army because mountain skills require the ability to  move from one place to another when major obstacles are in the way,  something valuable anywhere the Army operates.   The bill includes an important measure based on an amendment I filed  as well to improve condolence payment authorities for civilians who are  killed as a result of U.S. military operations. We have included funds  for this purpose for years through the appropriations process, but very  few payments have been made and record keeping has often been poor. The  new provisions in this bill aim to improve the process and increase its  use, so that when civilians are harmed in war, their families are not  left economically destitute as well.   I am disappointed that this bill does not include measures that were  adopted by the House of Representatives to repeal authorizations for  the use of force that were adopted nearly two decades ago. We simply  must have a debate in Congress about our ongoing engagement around the  world that relies on these AUMFs.   I wish the final agreement had included a hazardous substance  designation for the dangerous chemicals known by their abbreviations  PFAS and PFOA, nor was a sufficient authorization included that would  support the cleanup of these chemicals. The NDAA also includes  authorization of the President's Space Force, which I believe increases  bureaucracy at the expense of our real priorities.   Nonetheless, I believe this is a good bill that supports our troops,  and for that reason, I support its passage.                            ____________________
