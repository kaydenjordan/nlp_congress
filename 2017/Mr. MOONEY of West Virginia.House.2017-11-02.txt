 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Colorado, Mr. Buck, for leading this Special Order effort and for  recognizing me to talk about this issue and the general problem in the  Senate today of having legislation considered, debated, and passed in a  way that we can go to conference committee.   As the gentleman mentioned, the Senate has already failed to act, and  is currently failing to act, as we stand here, on over 270 House-passed  bills. One of those bills is a really important one, very important to  the committee on which I serve.   I am proud to be on the Financial Services Committee. The tradition  of  [[Page H8433]]  that position was held by my predecessor, Shelley Moore Capito, who  served on that committee for 14 years. Ably led by Chairman Jeb  Hensarling from Texas, we work in a bipartisan fashion, as much as we  possibly can, to bring relief to the American people, give consumers  choices in banking products, and the ability to get a small loan or get  a mortgage for their house. We are doing very important work there.   So, as was mentioned, on June 8 of 2017, this year, here, the U.S.  House of Representatives, where I now stand, passed H.R. 10, the  Financial CHOICE Act, by a vote of 233-186. I was very proud to vote  for that legislation, as I know were a lot of my colleagues.   The Financial CHOICE Act, if you are not familiar with the bill,  after the financial crisis in 2007, Democrats held all the Chambers in  the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they passed sweeping  legislation that fundamentally changed the way our economy works for  the worse; much more interference in your lives in banking, and the  ability to make loans and consider requests for bank loans were done.   Basically, Dodd-Frank is to the financial services industry what  ObamaCare is to the healthcare industry. It is a government-knows- better, one-size-fits-all, federally mandated set of laws that have  hurt the very people they claim they want to help. It hurts the same  people they want to help. So we are repealing most of that, and we are  going to empower consumers, give you the choices back.   So we have passed this bill. Let me just give you one example of  something in the bill, to be specific. There was something that was  designated in the Dodd-Frank bill called too big to fail. You may  remember that term, ``too big to fail.''   That is a situation where Washington bureaucrats had decided that  certain banks--the theory is that they are so essential to the global  economy that failure would be catastrophic. So it takes the ability to  fail out of the banks' system, which then makes them act more risky.  Big does not necessarily refer to the size of the company, just what  the government decides is essential, too big to fail.   So the first bank that was too big to fail was Bear Stearns. In March  of 2008, the Federal Reserve lent $30 billion to JPMorgan Chase to buy  the failing investment bank. Bear was a small bank, but very well- known, and there was a worry that it would destroy confidence in other  banks. So your tax dollars were used to, essentially, bail out banks.   So this bill repeals the authority of the Financial Stability  Oversight Council to designate firms as systematically important  institutions. It prohibits the use of Exchange Stabilization Funds to  bail out banks. Most Americans I talk to don't think their taxpayer  dollars should be used to bail out banks, so this bill would stop that.   So we passed that bill. We sent it to the Senate. We didn't think the  Senate would pass the exact same bill, word for word, that the House  passed. We thought they would consider our bill, take the parts they  like, maybe change some parts, maybe add some parts, or move some  parts, pass a bill in the Senate, and then we would go to a conference  committee to reconcile the differences.   One of the biggest travesties I have seen around here of the  political process, Mr. Speaker, is the failure to have conference  committees in the Congress any longer. The House passes all these  bills, over 300 over there; 270 are waiting for the Senate to do  anything on. Anything. And we wait for the Senate to act so we can have  a conference committee and reconcile the differences.   It is important to understand that no one in the House is demanding  they get their way on every bill, every provision, all the time. We  simply want to have a product sent to the Senate, have the Senate do  their job, do their due diligence, pass legislation in whatever form  they can get out of the Senate, and have a chance to go to conference  committee, reconcile the differences.   There is some give-and-take there. They won't get everything they  want. We may not get everything we want. You can reconcile those  differences, and it has to go back and pass again.   Over the past 3 years, my third year in Congress now, I have taken to  reminding folks things they learned in fifth grade, in fifth grade  grade school, about how I am just a bill sitting on Capitol Hill, and  how it is supposed to go to one Chamber; then it is supposed to go to  the other, and they appoint a conference committee to reconcile the  differences.   Instead, as the previous speaker, Congressman Biggs from Arizona,  mentioned, the filibuster is abused. You have 48 Democrats in the  Senate who filibuster everything. Everything. And for some reason, my  colleagues on the majority side of the aisle, the Republicans, don't  put the bills on the floor to make the American people see them  filibuster, and obstruct, and shut down, avoid conference committees,  avoid passing anything in the Senate that would require action, and,  therefore, just stop anything from happening. It is a travesty of the  political process.   Neither Republican nor Democrats should stand for such an abusive  system in the Senate. So I think we should put the bills over there and  make them act. We have actually started passing pieces of the CHOICE  Act, one small bill at a time, in order to get other stuff over to the  Senate, in the hope that they will just do something, act on something.    But we shouldn't have to do that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, because the  Senate can simply pass any bill they want, or any Senate bills they  want, and then we can consider it in the House as well. We have led by  passing the CHOICE Act bill, which is the right thing to do.   You know, as disappointing as it was to see the U.S. Senate fail to  pass anything on healthcare, maybe the one silver lining was the  American people could finally see what happens if three Republicans  join with 48 Democrats to vote against the bill. We did not have the  votes to pass anything on healthcare, and the whole healthcare reform  plan died at that moment.   We are sitting here today with a failing healthcare system that is  going to continue to fail. ObamaCare is going to continue to fail. It  is not getting any better. It is getting worse.   Look, our bill wasn't perfect, Mr. Speaker, but at least we did  something in the House to address the problem. I am not saying this  bill is perfect, the CHOICE Act for financial services, but we are  doing something to address the problem that consumers are demanding,  where they can have more choice and more access to funds to buy a home  or start a small business. We are doing something about it, and the  Senate is doing nothing. They don't pass anything.   In fact, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills in this Chamber.  All 12 are sitting over there in the Senate, waiting for someone to  act.   I think the first thing they should do is bring up the military  funding bill. We are in November already. In December, next month,  funding runs out. We have passed our appropriations bills. The Senate  is doing nothing on appropriations bills.   They should bring that military bill to the floor of the Senate,  right now, and have a vote. It passed this Chamber with a strong,  bipartisan majority. Funding the military is not a partisan issue.  There are votes, I believe, in the Senate and the House to fund the  military.   But if the 48 Democrat Senators want to filibuster, abuse their  power, abuse this filibuster tradition, which was mentioned is not in  the Constitution, it is simply a courtesy extended to the minority  party; if they want to continue to abuse that power, the American  people should see them, ruthlessly, politically, try to shut down the  military, and then try to blame the President or blame the House when  they won't pass anything.   They should pass a military appropriations bill that helps fund our  troops. We will reconcile the differences and send it to the  President's desk. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how the process is  supposed to work. That is what kept our democratic republican form of  government, constitutional form of government, with democratic  elections, the rule of law, a republican constitution; that is what has  kept our country, to this point, functional and working well, having  that bipartisan, bicameral process.   What is currently happening is really a travesty to this process,  where it is being abused by the Senate. They have all these bills over  there. It is high time for them to take action, pass  [[Page H8434]]  something, pass the best product they can on this issue, and let's go  to conference committee and reconcile the differences.                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible on the  CHOICE Act, on whatever provisions they want to. We are trying to  repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Another part of that,  the fiduciary rule, has really hurt consumers. These are other parts of  the CHOICE Act that need action. The American people need and expect  relief.
