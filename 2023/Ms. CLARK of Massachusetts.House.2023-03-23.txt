 Mr. Speaker, when President Obama signed  the Affordable Care Act, he told those gathered at the White House: ``I  am signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother, who argued  with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final  days.''   In the 13 years since, the ACA has transformed healthcare in America,  safeguarding the dignity of the sick, the security of families, and the  health of us all.   Perhaps nobody has benefited more from the ACA than women. Before the  ACA, being a woman was a preexisting condition. Insurance companies  were free to deny coverage for no reason other than being pregnant.  Today, that kind of discrimination is a relic of the past. Today, women  no longer have to pay more than men for insurance.   Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago, 90 percent of market plans offered no  maternity benefits. Today, they are offered by every single market plan  in this country.   Thanks to the ACA, every insurance plan empowers women to take  control of their health: birth control, annual well-women exams, breast  and cervical cancer screenings, breastfeeding support, maternal  depression, and much more.    What did Republicans have to say about this victory? One called it  ``the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress.''  Another called it ``downright evil.''   They voted more than 50 times to repeal the ACA. They did everything  in their power to put politics over the health of the American people.  Thankfully, they failed every single time.   For 13 years, Democrats have proudly defended the ACA. Under  President Biden, we haven't just held our ground. We have expanded  access to quality, affordable health coverage.   With our American Rescue Plan and with our Inflation Reduction Act,  we built on the life-changing, lifesaving success of the ACA. Now, a  record 16.3 million Americans are using the ACA marketplace to gain the  security and peace of mind that comes with quality health insurance.   As we celebrate all that has been achieved, I am grateful to those  who made it possible. I am thankful for the leadership of President  Obama and President Biden. I am thankful for the strength and unity of  the House Democratic Caucus. I am thankful for the millions of  Americans who have made their voices heard--voting, writing, calling,  and marching to defend the Affordable Care Act.   Our job is to lift up those voices, to put people over politics. I  invite our Republican colleagues to reflect on the progress of the last  13 years and to work with us to defend that progress and strengthen and  secure it for the next generation.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  Virginia for yielding, and I include in the Record a letter from the  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.    Support the Rights of All Students and Parents Support H. Res. 219,                               Oppose H.R. 5         Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of The Leadership       Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by       its diverse membership of more than 230 national       organizations to promote and protect the civil and human       rights of all persons in the United States, and the 228       undersigned organizations, we urge you to support the rights       and inclusion of all students and parents in our public       school system by supporting H.Res. 219, the Bill of Rights       for Students and Parents, and opposing H.R. 5, the Parents       Bill of Rights Act. As the civil and human rights community,       we have fought for more than 100 years for the rights of all       students and parents to attend and be fully included in well-      resourced public schools that prepare them for their futures.       The Bill of Rights for Students and Parents sets forth a       vision respecting and honoring the dignity and worth of every       child--a vision supported by the overwhelming majority of       parents in the country. In contrast, H.R. 5 seeks to       undermine the relationship between parents and teachers, to       facilitate book banning, and to make our most marginalized       children less safe.        During this time in which proponents of discrimination and       exclusion are creating  [[Page H1354]]       policies and legislation to harm students and undermine the       learning environment for everyone, support for developing       supportive, inclusive, safe, and responsive public schools       could not be more important. In a recent national survey, 80       percent or more of parents said that it was very or extremely       important that their child be honest, ethical, hardworking,       helpful to those in need, and accepting of people who are       different from them. It is these parental values that are       reflected in H.Res. 219. No matter our color, background, or       zip code, we want our kids to have an education that imparts       honesty about who we are, integrity in how we treat others,       and courage to do what's right.        Similarly, 80 percent of parents want to protect the       ability of young people to have access to books from which       they can learn about and understand different perspectives       and help them grow into adults who can think for themselves.       H.Res. 219 recognizes this near-universal view that       censorship and book banning ``undermine the education of all       students, take choices away from all students and their       families, and limit the opportunities of parents, families,       and children to access an education and think critically       about the world around them.''        H.R. 5 seeks to create detrimental harm to our most       marginalized children, erase the complicated and difficult       history of our Nation, and damage parent and teacher       relationships. Instead of promoting the values and priorities       that the overwhelming majority of parents from all       backgrounds and neighborhoods share, the bill would undermine       important public health and child well-being data by       effectively eliminating anonymous surveys of students; would       harm those most vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth who are unable to       come out to even their own parents by forcibly outing them,       would embolden a small group of activists who are using book       bans to selectively stamp out the perspectives of Black       people, LGBTQ+ people, and other historically marginalized       groups, and would bog schools down with reporting and       commenting requirements that bear no relationship to proven       parent and family engagement practices.        We ask that you strongly support H.Res. 219, strongly       oppose H.R. 5, and reject attacks on the rights of all       students and parents to attend and be fully included in well-      resourced public schools that prepare them for their futures.       If you have any questions, please reach out to Liz King,       senior program director at The Leadership Conference on Civil       and Human Rights.

Mr. Chairman, I am the proud mom of  three. Altogether, I have 36 cumulative school years under my belt, and  I served on a school board for 6 of those fighting for parents and for  kids.   I speak from experience when I call on this Chamber to oppose the  GOP's politics over parents act. Once again, the majority is showing us  how out of touch they are with American families. They are obsessed  with wokeism, even as they struggle to define what that even means, but  let me tell you, parents in this country are wide awake.   They wake up every day and do the best they can to provide for their  families. They wake up and they want great schools where every single  child can learn and excel. Parents want affordable childcare. They know  that is the beginning of a great education. Right now parents are  spending nearly a quarter of their family budget on childcare and that  is when they can find it at all.   Congress had a chance to cut those costs for families. Every single  House  [[Page H1355]]  Republican voted no. That is politics over parents. Parents know that  building a better future means teaching our country's history. They  know we have to address our teacher shortage, but demonizing educators,  banning books like ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' that is politics over  parents.   Parents know that taking care of a sick child shouldn't cost them  their paychecks. They should not have to send that child to school sick  because they don't have paid leave. The United States remains one of  the only developed countries in the world without paid family leave.  Every single House Republican voted against this basic benefit. That is  politics over parents.   Moms and dads want schools and communities to be safe. They do not  want their children shot while they are in school. Just yesterday,  Denver families faced the horror of yet another school shooting. House  Republicans refuse to enact commonsense reforms. Why? Politics over  parents.   How about something as basic as feeding our children? Nope. House  Republicans voted against the child tax credit. They voted to slash  food stamps and eliminate free school lunches. Once again, politics  over parents.   Then there is the shameless hypocrisy of talking about parents'  rights as the GOP strips away American's rights to decide if and when  they are going to have children.   At every turn, House Republicans have undermined the rights, freedom,  and well-being of our Nation's families. Let's say ``yes'' to parents  and ``no'' to this shameful bill.                                time  1500
