 Madam Speaker, on behalf of Congressman Crow,  Congressman Neguse, and myself, I rise today to recognize and honor  Richard ``Dick'' Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado from 1975 to  1987.   Governor Lamm was a tremendous leader and public servant for our  great State of Colorado. He passed away on July 29, 2021. As a three- term Governor, he was one of the longest-serving Governors in Colorado  history.   Governor Lamm was born in Wisconsin and moved to Denver in 1962. He  served as a State representative from 1966 to 1974, where he rose to  the position of assistant minority leader. During that time, he  sponsored and helped pass several pieces of noteworthy legislation,  including the Nation's first abortion law in 1967, ensuring women  access to critical healthcare, including abortion services in cases of  rape or incest.   In 1987, he began his first term as Governor of Colorado and went on  to serve for 12 years, earning support from people across the State  with his no-nonsense attitude and strong commitment to equality,  education, and the environment.   Before holding office, Governor Lamm served as a first lieutenant in  the United States Army and worked as an attorney and a certified public  accountant. After leaving office, he coordinated and co-directed the  University of Denver Institute for Public Policy Studies.   Above all else, Dick Lamm was a devoted husband and loving father. He  stayed active in politics and kept up with Colorado news until his  death. While Colorado has been blessed with many great leaders  throughout its history, few rise to the caliber and reputation of Dick  Lamm.                            ____________________
