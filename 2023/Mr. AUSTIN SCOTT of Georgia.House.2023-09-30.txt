 Mr. Speaker, before I speak to the issue  of Ukraine, I thought I might read the American citizens the 27th  Amendment to the Constitution. ``No law, varying the compensation for  the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect,  until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.''   If you are watching this--I am sorry that you don't have something  better to do on a Saturday--but you need to know who is telling you the  truth and who is not telling you the truth.   Recently, you heard my colleague from Connecticut tell you that the  Republican bill has a pay raise for Members of Congress. It is simply  not true. And if it did, it would be unconstitutional. If the Senate  bill changes the compensation for Members of Congress then it, too, is  unconstitutional.   Again, the 27th Amendment word for word: ``No law, varying the  compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives,  shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have  intervened.'' They are simply grasping at straws. They have intended to  shut down the government from the start.   With regard to Ukraine funding, I am on the Armed Services Committee,  I also happen to be on the Intelligence Committee, and I support the  mission in Ukraine. It is not a U.S.-led mission. It is a mission that  the United States is participating in, and this continuing resolution  will not do anything to hinder what the United States is doing with  regard to Ukraine.   We need to vote for this continuing resolution. We need to keep the  United States Government open. We need to keep the DOD funded and our  soldiers funded, and disregard totally what you are hearing from the  other side. They are grasping at straws, making excuses, and telling  flat-out lies about Member compensation as an excuse to vote against  this piece of legislation.   Let's keep the government open. Vote for this bill.
