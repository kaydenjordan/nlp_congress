 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise this evening to recognize the 50- year anniversary of Vincennes University Jasper Campus.   Vincennes University was founded in 1801 as part of the Northwest  Territory back then that would later become the State of Indiana. For  over 200 years, Vincennes University has been a premier institution of  higher learning for those seeking knowledge in manufacturing,  logistics, aviation, and other important fields of study.   In 1970, when I was a mere junior in high school, this university  expanded and established a new campus in my hometown.   With open enrollment and concentrating on jobs with fields where  there were employee shortages, Vincennes University Jasper Campus is  providing opportunities for all Hoosiers to add new skills to their  resume that will ultimately lead to good-paying jobs, mostly right  there in Indiana.   Notably, with their partnership with Purdue University, this campus  provides low-income students or those in need of remedial coursework  with a stepping stone to one of the Nation's top engineering schools.   I have to admit, VU Jasper Campus holds a special place in my heart.  At the company I founded in the early eighties, we use this as an  excellent source of recruiting people into our own company who  generally come there fully skilled, ready to go, and generally end up  sticking with the job, which is great.   As a Jasper native, I have seen firsthand what an asset this campus  has been to our community and the economic benefit it has added to  Dubois and surrounding counties.   We are lucky to have VU in Jasper, and I am happy to be here on the  floor of the U.S. Senate to celebrate with them on their golden  anniversary.   I yield the floor.
