 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator Inhofe  to discuss the fiscal year 2020 national defense authorization bill. I  want to begin by thanking Senator Inhofe for his leadership and  bipartisanship throughout the drafting of this bill.   Like you, Senator, I was living through the draft period, but when  you join the Army at 17, you don't worry about the draft at 18, but we  share that in common also.   The Armed Services Committee, as the chairman indicated, held a  series of very thoughtful hearings that greatly informed the shaping of  this bill. During last month's markup of the bill, we had a day of good  discussion and debate, and the bill was voted out of the committee by a  strong bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. I hope we can now have an equally  productive consideration of this bill on the floor. I know Senator  Inhofe and I are interested in having votes on amendments, including as  many cleared amendments as possible.   I believe this bill contains many provisions that will benefit the  Department and our servicemembers. There are a few areas I want to  highlight, and then I look forward to turning to the consideration of  amendments.   Several months ago--again, as the chairman indicated--this committee  became acutely aware of a crisis in quality and safety of privatized  military housing. After many weeks of visiting these houses, talking  with the affected families, and holding two hearings, the committee  included 32 separate provisions in this bill, addressing housing  concerns. Several provisions address the need for increasing  transparency, providing better controls on incentive payments to  companies, requiring standardized leases and satisfaction surveys, and  creating a discrete resolution process.   In some instances, the Department has already begun implementing some  of the provisions, such as instituting a Tenant Bill of Rights.   Privatized housing is still a long way from where it needs to be in  terms of providing quality homes for our military families, but this  bill will begin to hold private companies accountable and ensure that  the military services have new tools and capabilities to exercise  oversight so we can all honor our commitment to our warfighters and to  their families.   The bill includes a number of other provisions that support the  quality of life for our military personnel, including a 3.1-percent pay  raise, $40 million in supplemental impact aid for federally impacted  local school districts, and $10 million in impact aid for severely  disabled military children.   Unfortunately, the bill does not authorize additional funding to  support pay raises for the Department's civilian workforce, as the  administration proposed a pay freeze for the Federal Government  civilian workforce for 2020.   I hope that as we move through this bill and the appropriations bill,  we can rectify this error. The gap between the military pay raise and  civilian pay raise has never been greater than what the administration  has proposed in this year's budget. This is a shortsighted measure that  will ultimately harm our national security.   We cannot hope to recruit and retain highly qualified individuals  into the civil service and our military departments if salaries do not  keep pace with the private sector or inflation. The Department's  civilian workforce is a critical component of the total force and  across the government a vital component to our national defense and  national security.                          Sexual Assault Prevention    Mr. President, the committee continues to enhance sexual assault  prevention response efforts in the military. Over the years, we have  enacted more than 100 provisions to address sexual assault. This year,  we require the GAO to examine all sexual assault provisions enacted  since 2003 to help us determine how they have been implemented and if  they are making a difference.   This year's bill pays particular attention to prevention of sexual  assault. It requires a comprehensive policy to improve education,  training, empower and enhance the role of noncommissioned officers in  the prevention of sexual assault, promote healthy relationships by  addressing behaviors across the continuum of harm related to sexual  assault, and foster the social courage to promote interventions.   This provision also addresses alcohol abuse, which is commonly  associated with sexual assault.   Although the issue of sexual assault is a national problem--not just  a military problem--we remain committed to ensuring the military is at  the forefront of combating this scourge.   If the problem of sexual assault in the military is not adequately  addressed, it will continue to undermine good order and discipline in  our Armed Forces.   In the area of acquisition reform, the bill continues to improve the  Pentagon's ability to build and buy the technologies and systems it  needs to protect our national security while responsibly spending  taxpayer money. For example, the bill mandates that the Defense  Department continue to streamline acquisition and contracting  processes, including through the use of small, focused teams, in  accordance with the recommendations of the GAO.   The bill also seeks to ensure that the Defense Department is aware of  the state of its industrial base and has better knowledge of the  contractors with whom it works. The bill includes a provision that  directs the Department to establish processes by which it can determine  the actual ownership of the companies with which it signs contracts. We  have seen instances where Chinese and Russian interests are the actual  owners of some of the companies in our defense supply chain, raising  grave concerns with the security and reliability of those contractors.  We need to take steps to make sure that industrial base is secure.   The bill also strengthens the Department's ability to secure fair  prices and good value from its contractors. The bill directs the  Department to ensure that contractors supply accurate information on  the price of goods, technologies, and services, and to report instances  where contractors are not providing required pricing information. It  also directs the Department to engage the academic community in order  to develop more streamlined and data-driven methods to determine fair  and reasonable pricing.  [[Page S3835]]    In the area of science and technology, I am pleased that the bill  authorizes increases in funding for critical technology areas like  cyber security, undersea warfare, and manufacturing.   The bill also directs the Department to develop a coordinated  research program in emerging biotechnologies. Every day, we learn about  new advances in biotechnology, ranging from gene editing to high-speed  vaccine development and even cloning. We need to make sure the Defense  Department has robust and informed research efforts in these areas, as  well as initiatives to monitor the potential threats to our forces and  the public that may emerge as a result of these technologies.   In addition, the bill includes multiple provisions related to the 5G  wireless competition--a competition that the United States and its  allies and partners cannot afford to lose as 5G becomes the foundation  for the next set of world-changing technological advances that will  power the global economy. Driverless cars, the internet of things,  advanced manufacturing, smart cities, and telemedicine are just a  sample of what will depend on high-speed, high-capacity, and low- latency wireless networks. We must have a national and indeed  international strategy to secure these networks and electronics supply  chains, and this bill sets out the role the Defense Department should  play in that effort.   This year's bill also encourages the Department to continue its  engagement with the university community, whose work and basic research  generate the innovations that drive our economic growth and bolster our  national security. We must promote U.S. university research in both the  Defense Department and civilian agencies, protect the innovations that  result from that work, and set up mechanisms to welcome the best and  brightest technical minds to stay in our Nation after their academic  studies in order to benefit from their contributions in these important  fields, which have ramifications for our economy and our national  security.   I am turning now to some other areas.   This bill supports the Army of today, as well as ensures that our  soldiers are well prepared for the challenges of tomorrow. The bill  also authorizes funds for critical legacy platforms that the Army must  rely upon until new systems are fielded in the future, including  upgrades to the M1 Abrams tank and Stryker platform. The bill supports  many Army modernization objectives, including long-range precision  fires, next-generation combat vehicles, and the Army's Future Vertical  Lift Program. The bill also seeks to fill some capability gaps in the  Army by authorizing additional funding for hypersonic weapons  development and increased investments in Army artillery systems.   In the area of ship construction, the bill approves the continued  construction of two Virginia-class submarines in fiscal year 2020 and  authorizes advance procurement for a third boat in fiscal year 2023.  The bill also authorizes an additional $522 million to make sure that  both attack submarines planned in fiscal year 2020 are built with the  Virginia Payload Module.   Regarding other Navy ship construction programs, the bill ensures  responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars. It expands the cost cap  for the Ford-class aircraft carrier program to cover the recently  signed contract for a two-carrier buy. This language will ensure that  the Navy and the contractor actually deliver on the cost savings  promised when the two-ship deal was signed. The bill also tightens the  cost cap on the Ford-class carriers since the design for the Ford-class  should be stable for the carriers built after the lead ship, the USS  Gerald R. Ford.   In addition, the bill requires the Secretary of the Navy to designate  a senior technical authority for each class of naval vessels. This  senior technical authority would be a professional engineer in the Navy  Sea Systems Command who could counterbalance the input from the  uniformed Navy in pursuing ship acquisition programs.   In the area of strategic systems, the bill continues to support  modernization of all three legs of the nuclear triad: the Columbia- class submarine, the B-21 bomber, and the ground-based strategic  deterrent. All are major acquisition programs that will take decades to  field.   As we move forward, bipartisan support for these programs will remain  essential. If we are to maintain a sea-based deterrent, we must begin  to replace our current fleet of 14 Ohio-class submarines in 2027. The  bill provides funds for advance procurement for the Columbia-class  ballistic missile submarine program and authorizes an additional $125  billion to expand the capabilities of the second- and third-tier  contractors in the submarine industrial base. Ensuring that these  second- and third-tier contractors are ready to expand their production  will be important, indeed critical to keep the Columbia-class program  on track.   Turning to the air leg of the triad, the B-52 bomber was fielded in  1962. While its longevity is impressive, we need to bring its  replacement, the B-21, online, we hope, in the 2030s. The bill also  continues to support the replacement for the cruise missile, which is  our principal stand-off weapon for the B-52 and an important signaling  hedge under the New START treaty.   Turning to the administration's proposal for a Space Force, I would  like to briefly highlight what this bill includes.   In reviewing the administration's proposal, the committee held  numerous briefings on the importance of space to national security and  the protection of our space assets. The committee developed a  bipartisan proposal for a Space Force that minimizes the overhead costs  by keeping the Space Force within the Air Force since this force will  be comprised of about 15,000 Active-Duty members who are almost  exclusively Air Force personnel. I believe this was a reasonable and  cost-effective approach to stand up the Space Force during its first  few years.   I do have concerns about two provisions added during the markup  process, one which makes the Space Force chief a member of the Joint  Chiefs and a second provision that requires the Space Force chief to  report directly to the Secretary of the Air Force. This latter  provision will require an additional staff of up to 2,000 people, with  an annual cost of somewhere between $200 million to $500 million. I am  hopeful that we can address these issues during conference to find the  best way forward to ensure our Nation is adequately organized and  focused on the space mission.   Turning to countering the continued threat posed by ISIS and other  violent extremist groups, the bill extends the Iraq and Syria train- and-equip programs at the requested funding level, while ensuring  appropriate congressional oversight of the use of such funds.  Additionally, the bill begins to normalize security assistance to Iraq  by transitioning funding to enduring authorities.   The bill also includes important authorities to enable more effective  information operations by the Department of Defense to counter  influence activities by violent extremist groups and near-peer  strategic competitors.   In the area of special operations, the bill extends and strengthens  various authorities utilized by our special operations forces and  empowers the Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low- Intensity Conflict to provide advocacy and oversight of special  operations forces.   In addition, the bill ensures adequate congressional oversight of the  activities conducted by the U.S. military, including special operations  forces, by ensuring appropriate access to policy and other documents  that authorize operations overseas.   Having recently returned from Afghanistan, I am pleased the bill  authorizes the administration's full request for funds to support the  ongoing U.S. military efforts as part of Operation Freedom's Sentinel  and Operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan and includes a new  reporting requirement to enhance oversight of the ongoing advisory  mission there.   The bill contains a number of provisions to build capabilities for  our strategic competition with Russia. This includes authorizing full  funding of the budget request for the European Deterrence Initiative,  or the EDI, to support the U.S. military presence in Europe, enhance  multilateral training and exercises, and build partner capacity.  [[Page S3836]]    The bill also authorizes an increase in funding for the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, for a total of $300 million, of which  $100 million is available only for lethal assistance. This sends an  important signal to Russia that its aggression against Ukraine,  including its attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait,  has consequences. The bill also renews an authority to provide security  assistance to the Baltic countries for a joint procurement program.   With regard to Turkey, the committee worked closely with Senators  Lankford, Shaheen, Van Hollen, and Tillis to include a provision that  prohibits the transfer of the F-35 aircraft to Turkey, which can only  be waived if the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the  Secretary of State, can certify to Congress that Turkey has not  accepted delivery of the Russian S-400 air defense system and has  provided reliable assurances that it will not do so in the future. This  sends a strong message to President Erdogan that he will not have both  the Russian S-400 and the F-35 co-located on Turkish soil.   The bill also includes provisions that prioritize defense investments  to deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region, including  adding Pacific Island nations to the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security  Initiative and supporting a multi-domain task force to develop  capabilities and operational concepts to improve our posture in the  region.   To conclude, this bill authorizes $665.7 billion in base funding,  which is roughly $90 billion above the Budget Control Act, or BCA,  caps. I want to applaud the chairman's decision to move about $98  billion of funding the President requested for base requirements in OCO  back into the base budget where it belongs.   The Department needs additional resources, particularly to restore  readiness, to invest in emerging technologies, and to address  unforeseen situations, such as hurricane damage, but as it stands now,  this bill, if fully funded, would trigger sequestration. Until Congress  either repeals the BCA or reaches a new budget agreement, the extra $90  billion is aspirational, but not real money. I think we are creating  difficulties for ourselves and the Department if suddenly this funding  must be stripped out.   Of all the issues we are considering in Congress, the budget  situation is, to my mind, the most critical and urgent one, and I hope  my colleagues are as eager as I am to address this issue.   Again, let me commend Chairman Inhofe for his efforts in getting us  to this point. Let me also thank our staffs, who did a superb job and  continue to do a superb job. Let me thank my colleagues on the  committee, including the Presiding Officer, for their thoughtful,  creative, responsible, and very hard work in getting this bill done.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you and to an open  debate on the floor, voting on the bill, and getting this legislation  passed and moving forward.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that Jeremy Maginot, a Coast Guard  fellow in my office, be granted privileges of the floor for the  remainder of this Congress.   I also ask unanimous consent that another fellow in my office,  Aminata Sy, be granted privileges of the floor until August 2, 2019.
