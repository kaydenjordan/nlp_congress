 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the city of Dover,  NH, on the 400th anniversary of its first settlement.   In 1623, brothers Edward and William Hilton, two fishmongers from  London, sailed up the Piscataqua River and set up their Cochecho  Plantation near Pomeroy Cove. The name of the settlement changed in the  early years, first to Bristol, then to Dover, then to Northam, then  back to Dover. But the settlers remained, which leads many historians  to contend that Dover is the oldest continuously settled city or town  in New Hampshire. It is also among the oldest cities in all of the  United States.   The city of Dover's nickname, The Garrison City, has its roots in  these early years. Its settlers took advantage of the area's abundant  forestlands to fell trees for use in heavily fortified houses called  ``garrisons.'' Made with sturdy logs and slits in the walls for rifles  and muskets, these structures provided protection and a sense of  security in cases of emergency or attack. Most of Dover's garrisons  were destroyed in the late 1600s, but modern day residents and visitors  can see for themselves the intact Damm Garrison at the local Woodman  Museum. It is a symbol of the common threads of resilience, grit, and  solidarity that are woven into the long and proud history of Dover.   The city of Dover has hosted many thriving industries over the past  four centuries, including agriculture and shipbuilding in the 1700s and  brickmaking in the 1800s. Yet anyone who takes a short stroll down  Central Avenue can see the remnants of an industry that catapulted  Dover to national prominence in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Textile  manufacturers used the currents of the Cochecho River to power a  sprawling mill complex that at one time employed over 2,000 workers.  The Cocheco Manufacturing Company, its name the product of a clerical  misspelling on incorporation documents, was one of the leading national  producers of printed cotton and generated millions of yards of textiles  annually. In 1828, it was the site of the first all-women strike in the  United States when hundreds of ``mill girls'' marched off the job and  through city streets in protest of meager wages. The nearby Sawyer  Woolen Mills on the Bellamy  [[Page S2218]]  River also grew into the largest manufacturer of woolens in all of New  Hampshire. Like many textile manufacturing giants of the Northeast,  these enterprises closed their operations in the mid-1900s. Their  expansive brick buildings sat dormant for years; however, city leaders  have worked tirelessly in recent decades to repurpose them for modern  use. They are now home to the Children's Museum of New Hampshire,  restaurants, barbershops, toy stores, candy stores, small businesses,  and apartments. They are once again the focal point of a vibrant  downtown.   Throughout these many changes, challenges, and opportunities, Dover  residents have remained determined to write their own distinct chapters  in our American story. Many notable Granite Staters have called Dover  home, including several Olympic athletes like swimmer Jenny Thompson  and the first woman to be accepted into the bar and run for Governor of  New Hampshire, Marilla Ricker. Many more are responsible for creating  and sustaining a community that embodies the quintessential small town  in New Hampshire, one bound together by nature, history, and--most  important--its people.   My husband is a native of Dover, and we raised our family in the  neighboring town of Madbury. We have always felt so welcomed by the  city and its residents, and we look forward to joining our friends and  neighbors in celebration of the Garrison City's 400th anniversary. I  congratulate the city of Dover on this important milestone and wish the  community all the best in its future endeavors.                            ____________________
