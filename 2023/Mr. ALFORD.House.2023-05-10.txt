 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SHOPP Act.   At its core, the legislation addresses a simple truth: Families  deserve access to nutritious foods in all of its forms.   The SHOPP Act broadens the current produce prescription program,  which, as it stands, limits recipients to the purchase of fresh produce  only.   However, this restriction overlooks a crucial fact: Not all produce  is equally accessible in all areas at all times. Frozen fruits and  veggies can offer a nutritious, convenient, and year-round solution for  families.   This is not about valuing one form of produce over another but about  meeting families where they are in everyday life. It is about giving  families the flexibility to choose the produce that works best for  them, whether it is fresh or frozen.   Research clearly shows that when families have access to a variety of  fruits and veggies, they eat more produce. By diversifying the options  available through GusNIP, the SHOPP Act doesn't just increase access to  nutrition. It also empowers families to make healthier choices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the SHOPP Act and, in  doing so, support health, support well-being, and ensure year-round  nutrition for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for the rules package of H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.   One year ago today I was on the border with Mexico to see firsthand  the deadly, chaotic crisis that this administration has created.   With a wink and a nod, this President has welcomed more than 6  million illegal aliens into our sovereign Nation. This is a human  trafficking nightmare with some 85,000 children unaccounted for  tonight, more than 100,000 of our fellow citizens have been murdered  from fentanyl. Drugs are manufactured in Communist China and smuggled  across our southern border, an open border that has opened business for  the Mexican cartels that are now operating on our side of the border.   All we hear from this administration is lies; lies that their  immigration policy is based on compassion. It is exploitation, not  compassion.   We hear lies that the border is not open and that it is secure.   We hear lies that the Border Patrol uses whips on illegals. Look, I  have been on a horse. I know the difference between a whip and a rein.   Just this past Monday, the White House came out with the biggest lie  of all: that illegal immigration is down more than 90 percent under  Biden.   At this very moment, there are more than 1 million people amassed  near our southern border ready for title 42 to expire and stream across  our border largely unchecked. This administration's solution is to send  1,500 troops, not to push them back, but to push pencils.   If this President and his Secretary of Homeland Security cannot find  the grit to secure the border, we must do it in this Chamber.   Ronald Reagan once said: ``A nation that cannot control its border is  not a nation.''   Today, like Colonel William Barrett Travis, we draw the line in the  sand. We will not lose our Nation. We will not surrender to the drug  cartels. We will not surrender to the lies of this administration, and  we will not surrender America.
