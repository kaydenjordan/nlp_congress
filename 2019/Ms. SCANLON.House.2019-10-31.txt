 Madam Speaker, I take no joy in contemplating the  impeachment of a President because, in contemplating it, we must  acknowledge a threat to our Constitution and the values that bind us  not only as Members of Congress but as Americans.   We have tried to work within traditional means to get to the bottom  of serious allegations of misconduct so that we can deliver the truth  to the American people. Committees have called witnesses and requested  evidence, only to be stonewalled. The President's defenders have tried  to distract the American people by falsely claiming to have been  excluded from the investigation while their stunts and smears have  hindered the constitutional process.   This resolution outlines ground rules for the House as we move  forward, granting the same or greater due process rights to the  President and the minority as they themselves drafted when they were in  the majority. We will have open hearings. They can question witnesses.  They can propose subpoenas. They can present evidence.   I am proud to sponsor this resolution. Our Constitution requires it,  and our democracy depends on it.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague  from the Rules Committee, Ranking Member Cole from Oklahoma, be  permitted to insert the text of the amendment he would have offered had  the House rejected the previous question on H. Res. 660, along with  extraneous material, into the Record immediately prior to the vote on  ordering the previous question on H. Res. 660.
