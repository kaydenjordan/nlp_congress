 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend votes due to  circumstances beyond my control. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 249 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 250.  [[Page H4445]]                                ____________________     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2740.   The Appropriations Committee has held more than 120 hearings this  year on topics ranging from our Nation's defense priorities to the  crisis of unaccompanied children coming to our southern border. We have  now marked up all 12 bills in subcommittee and full committee.   Unfortunately, each bill brought before the committee was written to  an unrealistic top-line funding number--$176 billion above current  budget caps. We still do not have consensus on a budget agreement for  fiscal year 2020, which could lead to sequestration, resulting in  devastating cuts to our military.   Moving these bills as-is is a wasted opportunity because the bills  are far from what the President has requested and will support. Defense  spending does not meet the request, while nondefense spending greatly  exceeds the request and current levels. This could lead to a veto and  another government shutdown, something both agreed would be  devastating.   In addition to these funding concerns, these bills have,  unfortunately, become partisan vehicles, reversing pro-life policies  and risking the safety and security of the American people.   Many provisions in this bill also force a return to policies of the  previous administration and place unnecessary restrictions on Federal  agencies. For example, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education division of this five-bill package includes $100 million to  help people sign up for ObamaCare, forces the administration to send  grants to Planned Parenthood clinics, and blocks pro-life rules from  going into effect.   Similarly, the State and Foreign Operations division prevents  implementation of the President's expanded Mexico City policy. It  provides $479 million to repay United Nations peacekeeping costs, even  though the United Nations has not made the required reforms, and  prohibits funds to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.   For defense, there is no funding for any type of barrier or fence  along the southern border, something badly needed and obvious if you  visit that place.   There are also other harmful reductions. Procurement is $4.8 billion  below the FY 2019 level, and research and development is $2.2 billion  below the request.   These cuts are very concerning and put us in a serious problem when  relating to China and Russia.   The bill also repeals the Authorization for Use of Military Force,  which could jeopardize the Defense Department's ability to conduct  military operations worldwide. It is a bad policy and will force the  DOD to unwind counterterrorism operations overseas if the Congress and  the President cannot agree on a new authorization.   The Energy and Water division only includes half of the requested  funding for our nuclear weapons stockpile. There is also no funding for  a permanent site for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.   I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  make in order an amendment to address immediate needs on our southwest  border.  [[Page H4454]]    The ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. Rogers,  and I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee that,  unfortunately, will not be debated today. This is yet another missed  opportunity to address the humanitarian and security crisis.    There were over 140,000 apprehensions of migrants at the border just  last month, making apprehensions this year alone equivalent to the  population of Atlanta, Georgia. By the end of the fiscal year,  apprehensions could reach 1 million people.   The most troubling statistics are on the number of unaccompanied  children coming to the border. Last week, approximately 2,500 children  and teenagers were sleeping on the ground waiting to be referred to the  Department of Health and Human Services to be connected with family  members and sponsors. HHS expects 100,000 children and teens to be  referred for placement this fiscal year.   Unfortunately, our agencies do not have the resources needed to care  for these children, and, in fact, HHS could run out of money by the end  of this month--run out of money by the end of this month. If we are not  going to address this problem in this bill, we need to come together  and pass a stand-alone bill to meet these needs.   We were all elected to responsibly represent the best interests of  our constituents, and this package falls short. We can't afford to  overfund nondefense programs, underfund defense initiatives, load these  bills with controversial poison pill riders, and ignore the situation  at our southern border. This package does just this, risking both our  economic and our national security.   I know that my colleague and friend, Chairwoman Lowey, has worked  tirelessly to get us to this point today, and she and her subcommittee  chairs included many bipartisan priorities. Unfortunately, on balance,  these bills are partisan measures, and I can't support them in their  current form.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop a bipartisan  budget agreement and to remove controversial language and funding in a  final appropriations package.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this package today,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Mr. Chair, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
