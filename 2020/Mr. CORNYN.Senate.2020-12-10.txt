 Mr. President, as we all know, the clock is ticking down  on coronavirus relief. Both the Senate and the House are set to wrap up  the work of the 116th Congress in just a few days, but we don't appear  to be much closer to a deal now than we were this summer.   Over the last few months, my colleagues and I on this side of the  aisle have attempted to reach an agreement that could gain bipartisan  support. We have proposed a number of targeted packages which have  included funding for the most urgent bipartisan priorities, things like  vaccine development, schools, and the Paycheck Protection Program. We  have tried to pass individual proposals that have had near unanimous  support, like a 1-week extension of unemployment insurance benefits.   At every turn in the runup to the election, our Democratic colleagues  have simply stood in the way. It is not just Republicans' ideas they  have rejected. The administration has repeatedly tried to negotiate  with the Speaker, with the latest attempt being earlier this week.  Oddly enough, our Democratic colleagues have blasted the offer as being  an attempt to obstruct negotiations. This is a parallel universe, where  up is down and down is up, apparently, for our Democratic colleagues.   Only in the Democrats' alternate realty is more compromise an example  of obstruction. Based on everything we have seen so far, it appears  they have no real interest in reaching a deal. And I conclude that only  because they have stood in the way of every attempt so far to come to  an agreement and seem perfectly content to maintain the status quo,  which nobody claims to like, even as the American people continue to  call for additional support.   Almost every Member of Congress has said they want to pass another  relief bill before the end of the year, but as we stand here today, we  are emptyhanded despite the fact that we agree on a majority of what  should be in that package. Republicans and Democrats agree that funding  for schools, vaccines, the Paycheck Protection Program, and assistance  for the hardest hit Americans is desperately needed. But there appear  to be two hangups in the negotiations: liability protections and State  and local aid.   I think it is safe to say, in all fairness to our Democratic friends,  they just don't support liability protections, whether it is for  healthcare workers, hospitals, schools, churches, or nonprofits that  can be hit with a wave of litigation unless we act. And we know on this  side of the aisle Republicans don't support hundreds of billions of  dollars of new money to bail out cities and States that have been  mismanaged for decades.   With neither side willing to budge, Leader McConnell made the only  reasonable suggestion I have heard in light of the stalemate. He said  that setting these two issues aside seems to make sense so we can do  what we can do and include all the things we agree on in the coming  days while we hold off those more controversial pieces until the start  of the next year.   Our friends across the aisle apparently have never heard of the 80-20  rule, and that makes sense, I guess, in this alternate reality where  Nancy Pelosi said that ``nothing is better than something.'' I have  never heard anyone say that before. It is rather shocking to me.   Based on their reception of the long list of proposals so far this  year, I am sure it will come as no surprise that they have basically  rejected any entreaties that we have made. It is clear to me that they  aren't approaching these negotiations by asking what is best for the  330 million people in this country; their concern appears to be what is  best for them politically--certainly in the runup to the election,  where they denied the American people the benefits of another COVID-19  relief bill--or when it comes to liability protection, the trial  lawyers.   Now, I am a recovering lawyer myself. I don't hold a grudge against  lawyers earning a living. But the fact is, we ought to be concerned  about the American people and not lawyers, who, I dare say, are  probably doing pretty well relative to those who aren't getting a  paycheck or are in lockdowns at home.   So our Democratic colleagues have employed the same all-or-nothing  approach that has been their hallmark, and, as the American people have  learned over and over again, it almost always leads to nothing. I mean,  so much of this is so obvious, it seems to me, you almost are  embarrassed to say it, but when your attitude is ``all or nothing,''  you usually end up with nothing. And that is where we are today--no  unemployment benefit extension, no funding for schools, no money for  vaccine distribution, no second draw on the Paycheck Protection  Program. Nothing. Zip. Nada.   Our Democratic colleagues have proven over and over again that either  they don't want to negotiate or they have forgotten how. They aren't  interested in compromise, which is the only way you get things done  here. It sounds like they are more interested in messaging than they  are in actually achieving a result--making a law, something the  President will sign after it passes both Houses.   So our colleagues need to make a decision, and they need to make it  quickly. Are they willing to work with us and send a bill to the  President that includes most of what they would like to see in a relief  bill, if not all, or are they willing to tank everything--funding for  State and local government, vaccines, schools, small businesses,  families who are hurting and anxious and in financial distress? Are  they willing to throw them under the bus if they can't get everything  they want? Again, the choice seems so obvious to me. I am sorry I have  to say it, but it has become obvious that, so far, Democratic  leadership has no interest in resolving these negotiations in a way  that gets them most of what they want without taking the risk that we  end up emptyhanded                            Tribute to Pat Roberts    Mr President, this morning, during the remarks by the senior Senator  from Kansas, I was stuck in the Judiciary Committee, and so I wasn't  able to be here, although I have read and heard reported back to me  some of the best moments of his remarks, and I just wanted to come here  to the floor and say a few words about our friend Pat Roberts as we  prepare to bid him farewell.   Pat has represented the people of Kansas for four decades--16 years  in the House and 24 years here in the Senate--and I bet it seems like a  blink of an eye. During that time, he has established himself as a  national leader--in agriculture in particular--a dependable  [[Page S7396]]  voice for rural Americans, and an unwavering advocate for our Nation's  servicemembers, as you would expect a former marine to be. But he has  also been a source of great comedic relief in a place where people  often take themselves too seriously.   A few years ago, during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, we heard  Pat's cell phone ringing. Much to everyone's enjoyment, it wasn't a  factory-set ring tone; it was the song ``Let It Go'' from the Disney  movie ``Frozen.'' When he was asked if he had seen the stage  adaptation, he equipped: ``I might even be in it.''   Well, his acting chops are clearly not adequate for Broadway, but  there is certainly enough to impress those of us here in this Chamber.  He has a great Marlon Brando impression and a knack for injecting  quotes from the movie ``On the Waterfront'' at the perfect moment. And  we all know that he is a great country music fan, particularly of Ray  Price.   Pat is happy to entertain just about anyone who will listen to his  talent for storytelling, and I know members of my staff have enjoyed  learning about his time in the Marine Corps--at least those PG-rated  moments.   It is fitting that Washington Magazine has given him the title of  ``Funniest Senator,'' a number of times even referring to him as the  ``Senate's Jay Leno.'' You never know what Pat is going to say, but it  is invariably entertaining and always amusing.   As much as we are going to miss his frequent jokes and clever one- liners, we are going to miss his steadfast leadership and friendship  even more--as I said earlier, especially when it comes to his advocacy  on behalf of farmers and ranchers and folks who put the food on our  tables and the clothes on our backs.   Pat has had his hand and his fingerprints on every Agriculture bill  for the last four decades. Those farm bills are tough--trying to marry  up the interests of urban folks and food stamps and things like that  along with the needs of our production agriculture, our farmers and  ranchers. He was the first person to chair the Agriculture Committee in  both the House and the Senate, as well as the first to write and pass a  farm bill in both Chambers. He has been an unrelenting champion for our  Nation's farmers and ranchers and producers, and Texas agriculture has  benefited, too, from his work to remove trade barriers and burdensome  regulations that have threatened their competitiveness or, in some  cases, their survival.   While Pat's accomplishments as chairman of the Agriculture Committee  are among his most celebrated, his remarkable career in public service  has led to a long list of wins for the American people. He has led  efforts to help improve access to quality healthcare for all Americans.  He has helped keep taxes low and improve economic opportunities for  families all across the country. And, of course, he has advocated for  our servicemembers and our veterans. Pat even chaired the Senate  Intelligence Committee for a time, and he helped to identify systemic  problems in the intelligence community and enact critical reforms.   Finally, in a great labor of love, which seems like, I am sure, it  has taken decades to accomplish, a few months ago, Pat was able to see  his decades-long fight come to a satisfying conclusion when the Dwight  David Eisenhower Memorial was completed. This incredible monument to  our 34th President would not have been possible without Pat Roberts. He  has worked on it for the last 20 years, most of it behind the scenes,  and it seems like the perfect culmination of his service in Congress.   While Pat's sense of humor and devotion to public service are often  on public display, members of our Senate community have also come to  know of the size of his heart. He has got a big one. When a former  member of Pat's staff unexpectedly passed away this last year, he was  there to comfort the family and friends and share wonderful stories  about Chris in a speech at his memorial service, because when you work  for Pat Roberts--or I should say with Pat Roberts--you are not just a  cog in a policymaking or legislative machine; you are family.   You would be hard-pressed to find a better friend to Kansans, a more  devoted ally for our farmers and ranchers, a bigger K-State fan, or a  more loved Member of the Senate than our friend Pat Roberts. There is  no question we will miss him and the countless laughs he has provided  over the years, but I know he is eager to spend more time in greener  pastures with his wonderful wife Franki. Pat has earned a well-deserved  retirement, and I know he is looking forward to spending more time with  his and Franki's children and growing number of grandchildren.   Pat, we wish you well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Alexander  substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay  before the Senate the message to accompany S. 1342.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1342) entitled       ``An Act to require the Under Secretary for Oceans and       Atmosphere to update periodically the environmental       sensitivity index products of the National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Administration for each coastal area of the Great       Lakes, and for other purposes.'', do pass with an amendment.                               Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment,  and I ask unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 333, S. 1310.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn; that the Wicker- Cardin substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; and that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill,  as amended.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon table.    Mr. President, I am glad to be here on the floor of the  Senate with my friend Senator Bob Menendez asking that the U.S. Senate  advance legislation to establish a National Museum of the American  Latino.   As a proud Texan, I am fortunate to have grown up in a State steeped  in the contributions of Hispanics and Latinos. Approximately 40 percent  of our population is composed of Latinos in Texas, but they are not  monolithic by any stretch of the imagination, which is why we need a  museum to tell their stories.   There are the Tejanos, whose roots in the Lone Star State predate our  statehood or even Texas independence, as well as those who have  emigrated from other States or countries and have chosen to call Texas  home more recently.   From the brave soldiers who fought in the Texas Revolution to the  civil rights activists like Cesar Chavez, cultural icons like Selena,  and leaders of all types in our communities, generations of Latino  Americans have shaped our country as it is today. But, as I suggested a  moment ago, many Americans simply aren't aware of the vast  contributions made by these men and women who have come before us, and  one critical way we can right this wrong is by providing a home for  their stories in the Nation's Capital.   I have heard somebody suggest that we don't need a separate museum  for different racial groups and ethnic groups or the like, but this is  far more important than that because the story of American Latinos is  the story of America itself. Many people simply aren't familiar with  the vast contributions they have made.   This particular effort has been underway for more than 25 years.  Nothing happens very quickly, particularly when it comes to  establishing a new museum like this, but we are just two steps away,  and I hope the Senate can take one big step this afternoon by passing  this bipartisan legislation and sending it to the President's desk for  his signature.   I know there are some of our colleagues who have concerns about the  museum's location, and I can assure them that Congress will have a  voice in the site of this museum. But before construction can begin,  congressional committees will be consulted on site selection as laid  out in the bill and I believe the colloquy that will be made a part of  this record.   The Smithsonian Board of Regents, which will select the site, is  chaired by the Supreme Court Chief Justice and comprises multiple  Members of Congress, including three sitting Senators and the Vice  President. The Congress will also need to appropriate funds to  supplement the private fundraising that will help finance this museum.  The appropriation requirement will be a de facto ratification or  rejection of the site selected by the Smithsonian Board of Regents. So  there is going to be a lot of input in that decision. We are not making  that decision here today. And I believe there need to be open lines of  communication between Members of Congress and the Smithsonian Board of  Regents as they undertake this significant project.   It has been estimated that if we pass this bill today, the doors to a  new museum will not open for at least a decade, so I am eager to get  the process moving.   The National Museum of the American Latino will honor and preserve  the stories of Latinos throughout American history so generations can  view a more accurate and more complete history of the contributions  made by these great Americans, and I hope the Senate will advance this  critical legislation today    Thank you to the senior Senator from Kansas for his  leadership over the years and his attention to this bill. I also thank  the chairman for holding a hearing and passing this important bill out  of his committee.   I know some of our colleagues have concerns about the museum  location,  [[Page S7418]]  and I can assure them, Congress will have a voice in the site of the  museum. Before construction can begin, congressional committees will be  consulted on site selection, as detailed in the bill.   The Smithsonian board of regents, which will select the site, is  chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts and comprises multiple  members of Congress, including three sitting Senators, as well as the  Vice President.   Congress will also need to appropriate funds, a de facto ratification  or rejection of the site selected by the Smithsonian board of regents.   I intend there will be open lines of communication between members of  Congress and the Smithsonian board of regents as they undertake this  significant project.   It has been estimated if we pass this bill today, the doors to a new  museum would not open for at least a decade and more likely not until  2034--so I am eager to get the process moving.
