 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my  constituent and extraordinary Federal employee, Ms. Barbara Rogers of  Chevy Chase, MD, who is retiring from Federal service.   For nearly 20 years, Barbara has worked for the U.S. Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention's, CDC, Washington office, advising  Agency leadership on critical policy issues, including environmental  health and public health preparedness. A graduate of the George  Washington University Law School, Barbara prosecuted environmental  enforcement cases at the U.S. Attorney's Office and served for 8 years  as counsel to committees of both the U.S. Senate and the House of  Representatives. She brought this invaluable experience to the Agency  for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, ATSDR, a Federal public  health Agency that protects communities from the harmful health effects  related to exposure to natural and manmade hazardous substances. When  ATSDR joined CDC's Washington office in 2002, Barbara took on CDC's  environmental portfolio in Washington, DC, and helped shape CDC's  rapidly growing preparedness work in the era following the attacks of  September 11.   Barbara has served as a CDC liaison to Congress, educating  policymakers and staff to better understand the Agency on a variety of  important matters, including in response to congressional oversight on  CDC's laboratories and, more recently, on COVID-19. Barbara's widely  sought sage advice and diplomatic skills, combined with a powerful  intellect and attention to detail, have been a critical asset to CDC in  the Agency's interactions with GAO and Congress.   With Barbara's retirement, her CDC colleagues will miss her warm  friendship and wonderful sense of humor. CDC will lose a public servant  with a moral and ethical grounding, who has been a fierce advocate for  CDC and public health.  [[Page S1873]]    I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Barbara Rogers for her  outstanding service to our country and extend to her our very best  wishes for an enjoyable and fulfilling retirement.                            ____________________
