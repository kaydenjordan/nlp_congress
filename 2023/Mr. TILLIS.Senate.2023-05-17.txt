 Mr. President, I want to just speak briefly on Senator  Budd and how thrilled I am to have him as a colleague in the U.S.  Senate.   I think, if you heard his speech, he mentioned our State motto,  ``esse quam videri'': ``to be rather than to seem.''   What you saw here was a rational, reasonable, respectful Member of  the Senate. I observed that for years when he was in Congress. Ted Budd  and I met back in 2013. I watched him serve the State of North Carolina  before he was elected to Congress. I admired the way he carried himself  when he was in the House. I have been thrilled to see how well he has  hit the ground running here in the Senate.   But I will tell you, much like my campaigns--they are not necessarily  easy in North Carolina, and, truthfully, Ted was running in a primary.  I had two friends running in a primary. The way he conducted himself  there was also very rational, very reasonable, very respectful. That is  why I think he is a U.S. Senator today.   That is the second reason. The primary reason he is a U.S. Senator  today relates to a lady named Amy Kate, her son, and two daughters.   Now, if it wasn't in violation of the rules, I would look up in the  Gallery and thank Amy Kate and her family directly, but that is a  violation of the rules, Amy Kate, so I won't do that.   But I just want to let everybody know in North Carolina, you have  picked a great partner for me to have in the U.S. Senate.
