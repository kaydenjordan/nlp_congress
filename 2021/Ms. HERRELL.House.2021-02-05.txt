 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor New Mexico State  Police Officer Darian Jarrott.   Officer Jarrott was shot and killed yesterday, February 4, after he  stopped a vehicle while assisting with a Homeland Security  investigation. He was 28 years old and leaves behind three children and  a fourth on the way.   Officer Jarrott joined the State police in 2015, after beginning his  career as a transportation inspector with the New Mexico Department of  Public Safety.   He served his community with honor and distinction, and he was known  among his colleagues to always have a smile on his face, no matter how  tough a situation was.   Officer Jarrott was someone who wanted to help people, someone who  wanted to do the right thing and was loved by his community. We need  more officers like him.   We owe so much to Officer Jarrott and so many others who answer the  call to duty and make the ultimate sacrifice.   His death reminds us of the debt we owe the brave men and women who  stand in the gap to protect us from evil. My prayers are with Officer  Jarrott's family.                            ____________________
