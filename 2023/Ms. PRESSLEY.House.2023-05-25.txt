 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the hundreds  of thousands of people in the Massachusetts Seventh District: the  single mom in Randolph who depends on SNAP to feed her babies, the  disabled veteran in Chelsea who relies on SSDI, and families in Roxbury  struggling to pay rent and their mortgages.   My colleagues across the aisle say that they care about seniors,  veterans, and children and families, but in the words of James Baldwin:  ``I can't believe what you say because I see what you do.''   The Republicans continue to govern in a way that is clueless,  callous, with great contempt, and I would say godless because faith  without works is dead.   Republicans want us to make an impossible choice, extreme and drastic  cuts in lifesaving programs or catastrophic default on our debt, both  of which would impact our most vulnerable.   This is a manufactured crisis. That is a false choice.   Republicans don't have even an ounce of compassion.   Democrats want to change and save lives. Republicans want to play  with yours, and the American people are currently in limbo because of  it.   Stop playing with people's lives. This is not a game. Pass a clean  debt ceiling increase.                            ____________________
