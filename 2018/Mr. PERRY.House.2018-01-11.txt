 Mr. Speaker, servicemembers in the combat zone depend on  702 to keep them safe. 702 must continue to gather information on  foreign terrorists to keep us and servicemembers safe. However,  Americans in uniform serve to preserve an ideal that the Constitution  protects the rights of Americans.   The bill, unamended, enshrines in law the abuse of the Fourth  Amendment rights of American citizens, and it just cannot happen. This  is not only about criminal prosecution but about political persecution.   Mr. Speaker, that abuse and the associated persecution is unfolding  on the front pages and on TV right before us today. Don't lower the bar  any further. Vote to preserve the rights of American citizens. Vote for  this amendment.                                time  1045
