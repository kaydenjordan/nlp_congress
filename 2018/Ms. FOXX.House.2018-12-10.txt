 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Charlie Odell Lovette of  Wilkes County in North Carolina's Fifth District. Recently, Mr. Lovette  was posthumously inducted into the Wilkes County Agriculture Hall of  Fame and 3 miles of Highway NC-16 North were officially renamed in his  honor.   In addition to being a pioneer of the U.S. poultry industry, Mr.  Lovette was an active leader in the community and advocated for the  construction of what is now his namesake, C.O. Lovette Highway,  connecting Wilkesboro to Millers Creek. Although he passed away in  1978, Mr. Lovette's legacy is fondly remembered and livelihoods  continue to thrive along trails he blazed.   Charlie Lovette's life is a shining example of the American Dream  that North Carolinians remain proud of and hopeful for. At the young  age of 14, Lovette left home to drive trucks for his uncle,  distributing farm products in the foothills and mountains of Wilkes. In  the summers, he put his farming skills to use.   At age 19, he returned to public school to improve his skills to be  able to turn his work experiences into a business of his own. Starting  with a horse-drawn wagon to sell apples and working at R.J. Reynolds  Tobacco, Mr. Lovette was able to acquire necessary startup capital to  contribute to the foundation of the modern poultry industry. He bought  the first truck in his enterprise in 1924 and developed a weekly  schedule of buying barnyard chickens, butter, eggs, hams, dried apples,  honey, and other produce from country stores to sell in Charlotte and  Winston-Salem. His business provided a market for local farms to sell  and trade their products to produce family farm income.   This same year, Mr. Lovette married the love of his life, Ruth  Bumgarner. Ruth deserves just as much credit as her husband for being a  steadfast pillar of support in his business endeavors and encouraging  him to succeed.   During this time, chicken production progressed from barnyard  chickens to hothouse chickens, and Lovette was an early adopter of this  farming innovation. In 1928, he built one of the first hothouse chicken  houses on his farm, with capacity for 250 birds. A portion of that  chicken house is now on display at the Wilkes Heritage Museum.   Hothouse chicken farming increased rapidly in western Wilkes in the  1930s and 1940s. During World War II, processing plants were built in  the major cities on the East Coast to supply the war effort, and live  chickens were delivered to these plants from Wilkes by Mr. Lovette's  trucks.   In 1946, Mr. Lovette sold his live chicken business to his oldest  son, C. Fred Lovette. However, Charlie continued to run a smaller farm- raised food products business and started Lovette Egg Company in North  Wilkesboro with his partner, J.C. Bumgarner.   Fifteen years later, Fred Lovette consolidated all the chicken and  egg operations to form Holly Farms Poultry Industries. During the  1970s, Holly Farms Poultry Industries became the largest chicken  company in the world, with chicken operations in North Carolina,  Virginia, Maryland, and Texas. Additionally, it was the first chicken  brand nationally distributed in the United States.   Not only was Mr. Lovette a smart businessman with a strong work  ethic, he was also known for his good character. If profits were higher  than expected, he passed on extra earnings to his suppliers. He was an  adored father of seven who, alongside Ruth, instilled values of faith  into the Lovette family, and he was an active member of Pleasant Home  Baptist Church. Charlie and Ruth were a team in every endeavor and  extended their business success not just to their children, but also to  their siblings and many nieces and nephews who lived on the farm and  worked at Lovette Poultry Company.    The Wilkes farming community has been the beneficiary of Mr.  Lovette's courage to take risks and his determination to succeed. In  1989, Holly Farms was acquired by Tyson Foods, and in Wilkes, the  industry still generates more than $300 million in gross annual  revenue, employs 3,300 people, and supports 200 family farms.  [[Page H9772]]    With a lot of hard work and limited means, Mr. Lovette became a  pioneer of the poultry industry, and his legacy is enshrined in the  Wilkes community. He is an example for us all of the endless  possibilities in our country and what the seeds of big dreams, with the  support and collaboration of family and community, can grow into.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Krisann Pearce, who will leave  the Education and the Workforce Committee at the end of this Congress  after many years of outstanding service.   Krisann began her career as a teacher. She brought those lessons with  her to Capitol Hill, where she began her work in education policy on  the staff of her home State Senator, Nancy Kassebaum.   While she has thrived in other opportunities along the way, her main  home has been with us, the best committee in the House, where she has  served as general counsel since 2011.   Krisann has played a major role in every piece of education  legislation over the past two decades. She is also one of a very few  talented professionals whose counsel has informed both education and  workforce policy.   Krisann is renowned for her fierce devotion to students, the  parliamentary process, and her beloved Kansas Jayhawks. We are grateful  to her husband, Evan, and her sons, Carson and Nolan, for all the years  of long days and late nights they have shared Krisann with all of us,  and we wish her the very best.                            ____________________
