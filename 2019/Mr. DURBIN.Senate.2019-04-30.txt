It was a surprise that they even offered me a visa to  journey to that country. In the course of several days, I saw firsthand  what life in Venezuela was like. It was terrible from every aspect-- malnutrition, children fainting in schools, hospitals without the basic  medicines, the return of diseases which had been eradicated decades  before, people on the street emaciated and working day in and day out  in a runaway inflation country. At 11:30 at night, there were queues by  ATM machines where people stood patiently in line for hours to make the  maximum withdrawal from their savings account, which was the money they  needed the next day to take the bus to work. It is a terrible  situation.    In the course of that visit, I met with President Maduro and talked  to him directly about his plans to schedule an election. It was clear  to me this election was rigged. He had intimidated and even jailed his  opponents to make certain that there would be no serious opposition,  and I told him there would be no credibility in that election. It  wouldn't be accepted by countries around the world that he was the  legitimate leader of that country. Yet he persisted and went through  with the election.   During the time that I was there, I had a chance to meet with some of  his political opponents. His tactics against these opponents were  harsh. Leopoldo Lopez, a popular opponent, was put under house arrest  for years. I spoke to him on the telephone and met personally with his  wife, who described the bleak existence he had day to day in the same  house under house arrest by Maduro.   One evening, we had dinner with opposition members of the National  Assembly, and it was held at a secret location, upstairs in a darkened  room, because of their fear of retribution by Maduro and his regime.   These are some pretty brave young men and women who are part of the  opposition to Maduro. I can recall one of them saying to me: If you  come back next year, out of the five of us, two will have been  deported, two will be missing, and one of us will be dead. That is what  happens when you oppose the Maduro regime.   One of those people who were at that dinner meeting with me was named  Juan Guaido. His name became prominent just a few months ago when he  stepped up in an extraordinary show of political courage and declared  himself, under the original Constitution, as the leader of Venezuela-- directly confronting Maduro and his regime. Since then, he has received  a lot of publicity. He went to the border with Colombia and tried to  encourage the Maduro regime to allow transports of food, medicine, and  other humanitarian needs into the country. Maduro refused.   He also made it clear that he was willing to risk his life. I met  here in Washington with his young wife, who had a little baby girl. His  wife had come to the United States to plead his case in the Halls of  Congress. She knew the danger her husband faced. Yet she understood  that he was willing to risk that for the future of Venezuela.   Juan Guaido's effort to become the leader of that country has been  recognized now and acknowledged by leaders  [[Page S2529]]  of countries around the world. The Organization of American States--the  largest organization of Central and South American countries-- acknowledged in a formal vote that Juan Guaido would be the leader of  Venezuela by their calculation. They didn't accept the Maduro election  any more than I did.   In the last several months, there has been increasing tension and  concern as members of Guaido's following were jailed by the Maduro  regime and concern that Guaido himself may be in danger because of this  ongoing situation.   Early this morning, I received a phone call from Ambassador John  Bolton, who works with the President in the White House. He knew of my  interest in Venezuela, and he wanted to alert me that today was a day  that could be historic, a day of reckoning. Guaido and Leopoldo Lopez,  who had been under house arrest, were both appealing directly to the  military leaders in Venezuela, asking those leaders to join their  effort to establish a legitimate government in Venezuela and to have a  free and fair election. We didn't know what was in store. There were no  predictions as to who would prevail in this, and there was a great deal  of danger associated with Guaido's position. Lopez, coming out of house  arrest, is risking his own life in the process. We didn't know what  Maduro's response would be.   In the last several weeks, there have been groups that have come to  the aid and support of the Maduro regime. They include some Cuban  security forces, as well as colectivos and motorcycle gangs that  support the Maduro regime, but most notably the arrival of several  hundred Russian military into Caracas. This, of course, complicates the  situation. There are rumors in the press. We don't know which to  believe and which not to believe, but at this point, there is at least  a question as to whether Maduro was prepared to leave and was  discouraged by the Russians and told to stay. I hope he does leave.   I hope Venezuela can turn the corner. I hope the people of that  country who are leaving Venezuela by the millions to go to countries  like Colombia have an opportunity to see a new life in their country  and to move forward.   I have supported the efforts of the Trump administration against the  Maduro regime in Venezuela with an understanding that they want to move  forward with regime change in that country without the involvement of  U.S. military force. I think it would be a mistake if we did that, to  put in U.S. military force. We are in a situation where the history of  that region is well known. There has been a lot of tension and a lot of  difficulty in the past, and I hope we do not consider that military  possibility. I certainly support their efforts and applaud their  success in bringing the Organization of American States and other  countries to the side of Juan Guaido and Leopoldo Lopez.   I urge Maduro to do the right thing for Venezuela--to avoid  bloodshed, to accept Guaido's amnesty offer, and to step out of the way  of a long-overdue transition and return to democracy.   Until then, I support President Guaido's peaceful effort to advance  the constitutional transition period in which a credible and timely  election can be prepared under his leadership. Mr. Guaido is literally  putting his life on the line for the future of his country. The  Russians and Cubans in Caracas who attempt to prop up Mr. Maduro must  step back and let the Venezuelan people decide their own fate in an  open and free election.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
