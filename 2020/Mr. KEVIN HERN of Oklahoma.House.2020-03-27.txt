 Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that this  bill was delayed in pursuit of certain wasteful provisions that have  nothing to do with the coronavirus.   With that said, I am thankful that the vast majority of this bill  rightly focuses on the needs of Americans. It will save small  businesses in my district, provide much-needed funds to the hospitals  on the front lines of this fight, and provide the safety net for people  who lose their jobs due to no fault of their own.   America is hurting. The American people need us now more than ever.  Thanks to Leader McCarthy and President Trump and the Members involved  for their unrelenting work on this.   To the American people, it is much later than anyone wanted, but help  is on the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote. May God bless us all.
