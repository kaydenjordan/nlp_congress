 Mr. President, today I come to the floor to talk about  the crisis that is occurring at our southern border.   Joe Biden has been President now for about 4 months. In this time,  illegal immigration at the southern border has more than doubled. We  are now on a pace this year--this year alone--for the most illegal  immigration in two decades. The numbers that we see, based on last  month, we are talking about 2 million people coming to America this  year illegally.   It seems to me that, on the first day in office, President Biden  signed Executive orders that flipped on the green light that said: Come  to America. He rolled out the welcome mat, and he sent a clear message  that our borders are open. He shut down construction of the border  wall, a wall that we have actually paid to have done, to be  constructed. I have been there. The parts are lying on the ground and  the workers stopped, on inauguration day, from putting up portions of  the wall to close down the gaps.   He stopped all deportations for 100 days. He brought back the program  known as catch-and-release. And since he took these actions--and I have  talked to the Border Patrol on the ground, and they say the border has  been overwhelmed.   Now, illegal immigrants are coming from all over the world. People  say: Well, it is an issue between Mexico and the United States. The  people coming here are coming from all over the world. At the time I  was there, we heard that over 50 countries have been represented in the  people who have been captured, including Romania, Armenia, Bangladesh.  People are flying to Mexico who can't come to the United States because  of paperwork, who they are, what their intentions may be. They aren't  allowed to get tickets to come to the United States so they fly to  Mexico to come into the United States illegally.   The entire world knows that the border is open because that is the  message sent out by this administration. And that, of course, includes  criminals. Border agents have already arrested 95 convicted sex  offenders. Border agents have arrested 95 convicted sex offenders  coming into the country illegally, and this includes the last number of  months.   And I will tell you, the sex offenders include a man from El Salvador  who was convicted of raping a child in Washington State. We are talking  about people who have been convicted in the United States, who are now  out of the country, coming back in--conviction in Washington State. It  also included a man from El Salvador who was convicted of sexually  abusing a 9-year-old girl. This abuse took place in New York City,  which is a sanctuary city.   This is what happens when our borders are open and the message is  sent out around the world. And for the open borders crowd who like this  sort of thing, some of whom are Members of the Congress of the United  States, this is just collateral damage. It is all part of a political  agenda.   It has been more than 2 months since President Biden put Vice  President Harris in charge of the border. She has found time to make it  to the Canadian border but not time to make it to the border between  the United States and Mexico.   This week, and right now, the Vice President has been on her first  overseas trip in the role as Vice President. She is going to Central  America and to Mexico but not to the border. She has announced new  gifts of American taxpayer dollars given to people from other  countries.   When reporters asked her--and she did; I saw the sitdown interview  and the video of it--if she was going to the border, she actually  laughed. She thought it was a joke. It was very disappointing to see  the Vice President acting in that way. She said: ``I haven't been to  Europe either,'' like it didn't matter. She hadn't been to Europe;  there are a lot of places she hadn't been. The place the American  people know she hasn't been is to the border between Mexico and the  United States.   In reality, she knows. She knows that if she goes to the border--she  knows that if she goes to the border between the United States and  Mexico,  [[Page S4005]]  she knows that the news cameras will go with her. She knows that the  media would broadcast the crisis that they see at the border to the  whole world. She knows that, then, more and more Americans will see  firsthand the truth for themselves. That is why the Vice President is  not going to the border between Mexico and the United States.   The White House refuses to say it is a crisis. They refuse to say  those words. They just want to use the word ``challenge'' instead of  the reality of the crisis that I saw when I was there at the border  with a group of Republican Senators. That is why they are doubling down  on policies that caused the crisis.   Two weeks ago, the President released his budget for the coming year.  It is the biggest budget proposal by any President in American history.  It would nearly double Federal spending over the next decade. Yet the  President's budget for the Department of Homeland Security, the  Department that is supposed to keep our Nation safe, is flatlined. The  President likes to say--and he has said it time and time again. He said  it when he was in the Senate; he said it as Vice President of the  United States; and now he says it as the President. He said: If you  want to know somebody's values, just look at their budget.    Well, we have seen Joe Biden's budget, and we know his values. And  his values are not those of supporting and promoting the security of  our Nation through border security. The President's budget includes  $800 million in aid for Central America. I don't know if Joe Biden  thinks you can bribe people with our own tax dollars to not cross the  border. It is an absolute surrender, and it leaves our borders wide  open.   Our southern border is in crisis, but the crisis isn't limited to the  border itself. President Biden has also tied the hands of our  immigration officials all across America. The Washington Post came out  with a story, and they put it this way. I want to make sure I have it  absolutely accurate so I am going to read it to you.   It says: Under President Biden, ICE--Immigration and Customs  Enforcement--``is an agency on probation.'' This is the Washington  Post. It says:         Biden has placed ICE deportation officers on a leash so       tight that some say their work is being functionally       abolished.    That is the Washington Post on the President of the United States and  what he has done with regard to our borders and our immigration  authorities with his very flatlined budget for the Department of  Homeland Security.   The article goes on, and it says:         ICE carried out fewer than 3,000 deportations last month.       The agency's 6,000 officers currently average one arrest       every two months.    One arrest every 2 months.   Hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens have court orders for  deportation. Yet, despite these enormous numbers, deportations have  never been lower, never been lower. No wonder the crisis is getting  worse.   I heard about it all last week over Memorial Day as I traveled around  the State of Wyoming. People are very concerned about this disregard  for our borders and for the support that our Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers need. So it is no wonder to me that the people of  Wyoming are concerned, and I imagine that people all around the country  are concerned. My colleagues heard it as well, as they traveled their  home States just in the last week.   The border really is one of the top issues that I am asked about  every weekend in Wyoming. I will be heading home again tomorrow night  for the weekend, traveling the State, and I expect to hear more and  more about it this coming weekend. The American people want to keep the  borders secure, and they want to be safe at home.   We know what to do. We know what works. The border agents told  President Biden's transition team before he was inaugurated what we  needed to do to keep the border secure, what works, what wouldn't work.  They say enforce the law, close the loopholes, the loopholes that  encourage illegal immigration. They say finish the wall, the wall that  we have already paid for. And they say bring back the policy known as  ``Remain in Mexico.''   Until we take these basic steps, the crisis is going to continue, the  border is going to remain open, and the American people will continue  to come to us to say there is more that can be done and should be done  and must be done because the American people know that when the border  is not secure, that people of America continue to be at heightened  risk.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about our  economy and link that to the budget that the President has introduced  for our Nation going forward.   On Friday, the Department of Labor published its monthly jobs report.  Just like the April jobs report, the May report is a cause for concern.  There really wasn't any cause for celebration. Yet President Biden did  exactly the same thing that he did in the previous month after that  disappointing jobs report--he declared victory. He gave a speech in  Delaware, and he called it ``historic progress.'' Even the President of  the United States is stretching the language of our Nation right here.   Let's look at the facts.   What is Joe Biden calling ``historic progress''?   Over the last 2 months, about 850,000 fewer people were hired than  the economists had predicted. In the month of May alone, 160,000 people  left the labor force. The percentage of Americans in the labor force  actually went down. Another month, another weak jobs report. It is  disappointing but not surprising. We know why it has slowed down.  President Biden and the Democrats have committed to paying millions of  people more to stay home from work than to go to work. If you pay  people more to not work than to work, that is what you are going to  get. That is what they are being encouraged to do. In fact, I would say  that these people are not being lazy; they are being logical with the  incentives that the Democrats have put in front of them, which is money  in their pockets to stay home from work.   There are 9.3 million jobs that are unfilled right now in the United  States, a record high. As a result, small businesses--and I heard about  it this weekend in Wyoming--are struggling to find people to work  there. They are having a hard time finding people to take jobs. They  have signs up: ``Help Wanted.'' ``We Need You.'' ``Offering  Incentives.'' If people are getting paid more to not work than to work,  that is what they are going to do.   At the same time, prices continue to rise. That is what I heard about  as I was sitting, waiting to have my oil changed. It was a longer line  than usual in Casper, not because we didn't have good workers but  because we didn't have enough of them in a place that changed oil that  had two bays set up but was down to one. They have to do that several  days a week because they don't have the workforce. They can't find the  people to change the oil. So it was a good townhall meeting as we sat  around there, waiting for our oil to be changed, talking to people  about their concerns. That is what we heard about: trouble finding  workers, inflation.   Last week, the White House Press Secretary was asked about high gas  prices--and I had heard about that in Wyoming as we were sitting  around, waiting to get the oil changed: You know, it costs about $15 or  $20 more to fill a tank than it did a year ago. People not only pay  attention to how many dollars and cents it costs for a gallon of gas  but how much it costs to fill the tank and how much less they have to  spend for other things.   The White House Press Secretary said that gas prices aren't very high  if you account for inflation.   If you account for inflation? It is inflation. Gas prices are high  because it  [[Page S4011]]  is what happens when prices go up. That is inflation.   This should be a news flash for America. Inflation is the problem.  The White House Press Secretary didn't seem to see the connection. It  is caused by this administration. Gas prices have gone up about 70  cents a gallon in the last 4 months--since Joe Biden took the oath of  office. It is no surprise when the President, on the day he takes the  oath of office, paints a target on the back of American energy and  pulls the trigger, which makes us more dependent on foreign sources of  energy.   As the senior Senator from Alaska said in an Energy Committee  hearing, we are, at this time in the United States, using more energy  from Russia than we are from her home State of Alaska. That is a  comment on the policies of this administration.   Summer is almost here, and the pandemic is almost over. What is going  to happen with regard to the demand for gasoline? It is going to  continue to go up.   There is a moratorium on the exploration of oil and gas in the United  States, and we are making ourselves more dependent on foreign sources.  What is the President doing? Imposing more taxes on American energy.  Last week, he put more restrictions on the production of energy from  Alaska. Now what does he want to do? Well, we have seen it in the  Finance Committee right here. He wants to impose the increase of taxes  on oil and gas producers. That is going to hurt the people who work in  that industry, and it is going to make all of us pay more at the tank.  This is basic economics. If you restrict the production of American oil  and gas and if you raise the taxes on oil and gas, the prices people  have to pay at the pump--the prices they pay to fill up their  vehicles--are going to go up.   President Biden keeps declaring victory and keeps doubling down on  policies that are slowing down the economy. Two weeks ago, he  introduced his budget request for next year. To me, it is a blueprint  for bankruptcy. He is proposing $6 trillion in Federal spending for  next year. During the pandemic, the country hit about $4 trillion in  annual Federal spending for the first time ever. This was during a  national emergency, and we passed it in a bipartisan way with over 90  votes in the Senate. In five different coronavirus relief bills, we  were able to deal with what needed to be done for our Nation at the  time. The pandemic is behind us, and the President now wants to spend  $2 trillion more than that every year even after the pandemic is over.  This is only the beginning.   The Biden budget doesn't even include some of the most expensive  campaign promises he made when he was running for President. According  to one estimate, the Biden budget is missing about $1.5 trillion that  he had promised to spend. It is not even included in the budget. What  happens with all of this additional spending? Of course, it is going to  cause inflation because more money will be out there to chase the goods  and services that are available.   President Biden also wants to bring back the death tax. This would be  devastating for farmers and ranchers who want to keep their farms in  their families. I heard about it this past weekend in Sheridan, WY,  with the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. As for the families who  have had the ranches or the farms in their families for over 100 years,  we call them centennial families in Wyoming, and we celebrate them  every year. They have all said, if this happens--if the Biden  administration does this with what it wants to do with the death tax-- when Grandma or Grandpa passes, every one of them is going to have to  sell the farm just to pay the taxes. They have been able to keep them  within the families for 100 years. Joe Biden is going to take the ax to  them.   Get this. He wants to hire 87,000 more bureaucrats at the Internal  Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service is the least accountable  and most powerful Agency in the Federal Government. The Biden goal is  to collect $700 billion more from taxpayers. What does he want to do  with the money? Use it for additional socialist spending. We have seen  the list. Under the Biden agenda, working families are going to be  paying more at the pump, more at the grocery store, and they are going  to end up paying more as well through taxes. They are seeing it now.  Our jobs reports, our inflation reports, our gas prices have all been  disappointing to all Americans.   This is a direct result of the policies that are coming out of this  administration and out of this White House. It is time for the  President to stop the attacks on American energy, to stop paying people  more to not work than to work, and to stop this irresponsible spending  spree as outlined in the budget.   We know what works. Let's return to the policies that work, to the  policies that have been giving us the best economy in a half a century.  Just 16 months ago, we had low taxes, reasonable regulations, and more  American energy. The economy was booming until the coronavirus hit. We  need to get back to that again   I yield the floor.
