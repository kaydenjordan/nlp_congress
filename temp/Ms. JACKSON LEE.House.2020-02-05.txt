 Madam Speaker, our emerging Nation sought to be a  bright light for democracy and the rule of law. This afternoon, I sat  in the Senate Chamber and watched the Senate one by one announce the  words guilty or not guilty: Article I, guilty 48, not guilty 52;  Article II, guilty 47, not guilty 53.   I believe the presentation of the Judiciary, Oversight, Intelligence,  and Foreign Affairs Committees was brilliantly presented.   I wondered whether there would be one moment for a profile in  courage, one understanding that the norm of this Nation cannot tolerate  what the Framers were most frightened about, which was the  constitutional crime of abuse of power or having a sovereign nation  interfere with our elections. Yet, there was one in Article I that made  it bipartisan in the guilt, but no one in Article II.   Simply stated, now what is the answer? That this Nation no longer  loves its democracy; does not stand by the rule of law; and, therefore,  the person who remains in office is a king?   I believe, Madam Speaker, that we must raise the Constitution and  fight for justice.                            ____________________
