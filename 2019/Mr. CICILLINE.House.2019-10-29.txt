 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 296, a  resolution introduced by my friend Mr. Schiff to recognize the horror  of the genocide perpetuated against the Armenian people by the Ottoman  Empire between 1913 and 1925, killing 1.5 million martyrs.   There is no question that the Ottoman Empire carried out a systemic  campaign of persecution, forced removal, starvation, and murder against  Armenians, along with other Christian minorities living under Ottoman  rule.   This campaign was documented in realtime by American diplomats and  has been acknowledged in various forms by previous administrations and  Congresses, the last in 1984.   In order to prevent future genocides and mass atrocities, it is vital  that we never forget those that have already occurred. For too long, we  have allowed foreign interests to lobby the United States in favor of  turning the other way and not wholly recognizing the truth of the  Armenian genocide. That ends today.   In Rhode Island, we have a very proud Armenian community that has  demonstrated extraordinary resilience. They deserve for Congress to  acknowledge the history of their people and the truth of the Armenian  genocide. That will happen today.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
