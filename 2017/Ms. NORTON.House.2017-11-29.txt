 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chair and ranking member  of the committee for bringing this bill forward at a time of national  crisis in the workplace on sexual harassment.   When I chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which was  15 years after the statute had been passed, sexual harassment had not  even been defined as a form of workplace discrimination. We held  hearings and so defined it, and the Supreme Court thereafter affirmed  the EEOC guidelines.   Congress, nevertheless, exempted itself until 30 years later when in  1995--prompted by a controversy involving Members of the Congress-- brought Congress under 13 major civil rights and labor laws. But  mysteriously--and I still can't understand why--Congress exempted  itself from the easiest provision, the provision we bring forward today  for posting and training. I will never understand that failure, but we  are trying to move forward today.   There are other needed provisions, and I have introduced a bill to  bring the comprehensive provisions that we now require of the  legislative branch or the private sector forward, and I thank the  Committee on House Administration for continuing to work on these  issues, too.   Congress failed in 1964. Congress failed again in 1995. Now, in 2017,  it is impossible to justify exempting congressional offices and Members  of Congress from the comprehensive provisions Congress now requires of  private employers and Federal agencies. We will never be respected  until we are brought under the same laws as everybody else.   Congressional staff deserve the same civil and antidiscrimination  protections afforded to other Federal employees. It is important that  powerful figures who play an outsized role here in Congress be brought  to the same level as other employers.
