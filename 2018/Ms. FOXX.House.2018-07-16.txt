 Mr. Speaker, our Nation's national parks are a cherished  part of our country's legacy, and it is critical  [[Page H6199]]  that they be preserved for generations to come.   Unfortunately, the National Park Service is facing an insurmountable  backlog of deferred maintenance that is growing more urgent as decades- old agency structures reach the end of their anticipated lifespans.  This is impacting some of our most beloved parks.   The Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia is the  country's second most visited National Park, supporting approximately  15,600 jobs and is a huge economic asset to nearby rural communities.  Deferred maintenance has resulted in the unfortunate deterioration of  its amenities and accessibility.   The National Park Service Legacy Act would establish a National Park  Service Legacy Restoration Fund directly aimed at addressing the  agency's backlog and fixing the issues facing the Blue Ridge Parkway.  As a proud cosponsor of this innovative legislation, I encourage its  vote and final passage in the House this Congress.                            ____________________
