 Madam Speaker, I have a question. What does Oscar the  Grouch from Sesame Street have in common with the republic of Georgia's  oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili? What do they have in common?   Answer: They are both puppets who trash their own home.   Vladimir Putin's puppet has attacked foreign investment in Georgia  and crushed basic human rights.   A company from Texas, Frontera Resources, has been drilling in  Georgia for years and years and years. They have created great jobs in  America and great jobs in Georgia. They have created freedom. That was  until the government took over all of their operations, all of their  equipment. Now, they are drilling zero wells in Georgia.   Of course, the Napoleon of Siberia, Vladimir Putin, is happy to  control Georgia's oil. His puppet, oligarch Ivanishvili, is getting  rich off the backs of the Georgian people.   It is time to wake up. As this photo from Getty shows, the protesters  in Georgia need our support. Join me in raising our voices for freedom  in Georgia.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate amendment to H.R. 550  so that minority voices can be heard on the critical issue of war.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Newhouse,  for yielding. He is from my birth State of Washington, Fort Lewis, the  old Madigan Army Medical Center in 1962. That was a long, long time  ago.   I thank the gentleman for coming to see the Petra Nova project in my  district, the only viable carbon capture project in the whole world.   I thank the gentleman on behalf of the Congressional Western Caucus  for taking the time to see real solutions to real problems.   My bride is a girl from Los Angeles, California--Hollywood. This is a  big time back home for my Nancy: the Screen Actors Guild, the SAG  Awards, which happened last weekend, and before that, the Golden  Globes. The granddaddy of them all, the Oscars, is coming up this  weekend.   If the success of the ESA was a movie, it would get a 0.0 Rotten  Tomatoes score.   It would be a horror story that surpasses Hannibal Lecter, Freddy  Krueger, and Jason. It would be a story of how misused ESA is a threat  to our national security, global freedom, and guarantees more  greenhouse gases plaguing our world.   This story will be set in west Texas and southeast New Mexico. It  stars an unremarkable creature named the dunes sagebrush lizard with  best supporting actor played by a radical, antigrowth environmental  activist.   The lizard lives on top of the Permian Basin, the most powerful force  America has had for peace and clean air in the past two decades. That  happened because of reemergence of American oil and gas as the number  one producer in the entire world. That is because of the hydraulic  fracturing revolution that has swept our Nation and the world.   The Permian Basin is leading the hydraulic fracturing revolution.  Experts expect it to produce, by itself, 8 million barrels of oil per  day in the next 4 years. That is up from its high, a mere 2 million  barrels per day just 10 years ago.   That means, one, American shale play will be a bigger producer of oil  and gas than every country in the world. That means bigger than Saudi  Arabia, bigger than Russia, bigger than OPEC.   Two countries that emit the most greenhouse gases, they are China and  India. Their only natural power source is coal. Right now, as I speak,  megatons of American liquefied natural gas coming from the Permian  Basin, the Bakken shale play in South Dakota, and Marcellus shale play  here out East are going to China and India. Their air will be cleaner  because of American energy.   It is a win-win for the jobs here in America, exporting technology to  our friends for cleaner air and cleaner air in the global context.   You would think the environmental groups would love this, but, sadly,  you would be wrong. For 10 years, people who have never been to the  Permian Basin and can't spell Odessa if I spot them O-D-E-S-S, are  pushing actively to have the dunes sagebrush lizard listed as an  endangered species.   In 2012, they pushed President Barack Obama hard to have that  listing. President Obama said, No, it is unnecessary. The locals are  taking care of the issue by themselves. President Obama was right. The  species is still with us today. But that hasn't stopped these liberals  from using the Endangered Species Act to support OPEC and Russian  energy.   They filed another lawsuit this past summer that is going through the  courts. They know by doing that, they hinder growth because people are  afraid to invest in the place that may have a pop-up endangered species  that is not actually endangered.   These groups follow someone from Hollywood who is not a real person.  His name is Forrest Gump. His motto is: ``Stupid is as stupid does.''   Enough of the stupidity. The ESA must focus on species, not political  [[Page H622]]  dreams: My bill, the Listing Reform Act, H.R. 5585, addresses this  exact problem.   I close by saying something we all know: ``Ye shall know the truth,  and the truth shall set you free.''
