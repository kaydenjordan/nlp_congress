Our Federal courts make decisions every day that affect consumers,  immigrants, small businesses, not to mention our right to equal  treatment, education, and healthcare. As such, our Federal judges must  be serious, fairminded, and nonpartisan. We want women and men on the  Federal bench who will look at the facts of a case, apply the law, and  work hard to reach a just result regardless of who the parties are in  front of them. The Federal bench must reflect our country in all its  diversity of experience and background.   Even though the Constitution gives the President the power to  nominate Federal judges, it also requires the advice and consent of the  Senate, and historically the President consults with home state  Senators when there is a vacancy. As the representatives to our States,  we are better equipped to identify qualified lawyers and judges to  serve on the Federal bench who have done good work and who have good  reputations in our home communities.   We have numerous qualified, nonpartisan individuals working in the  Nevada legal community who would make excellent additions to the Ninth  Circuit. There are a number of amazing Nevada lawyers whom Senator  Cortez Masto and I would have gladly considered supporting for a seat  on this prestigious court. We have litigators, magistrate judges, law  professors, prosecutors, public defenders, and existing district court  judges with stellar reputations from the State, lawyers and judges from  Nevada. They know our State, and they have respected nonpartisan  records. But the White House didn't nominate any of these individuals  for the Ninth Circuit. Instead, the President nominated Lawrence  VanDyke, a Washington, DC, lawyer. He wasn't born in Nevada. He didn't  grow up in Nevada. He didn't go to school in Nevada. He doesn't live in  Nevada now.   Mr. VanDyke, a Montana native who ran for office there and also  worked in Texas, came to Nevada for a job a few years ago, in 2015.  When the person he worked for lost a political race in 2018, Mr.  VanDyke quickly sold the house he briefly owned in Nevada and moved to  Virginia to work in Washington, DC, and as of last week, by his own  admission, he hasn't even been back to Nevada since then.   He is a DC lawyer and a failed political candidate from Montana who  shares this White House's extreme political views. They are imposing  him on Nevada despite the fact that we have so many qualified people in  our own State who enjoy broad support across the political spectrum.   Nevada has a vibrant community, and we take pride in knowing each  other, respecting each other, and most importantly, putting partisan  politics aside when it comes to working together for the betterment of  our State. So if someone is a good judge or lawyer, if they are honest  and they have a good reputation professionally, if they  [[Page S6352]]  are civil in court and have a respectful demeanor, you will usually  hear the same things about that person from everyone.   These are the types of people who should be Federal judges: people  who treat everyone fairly and with respect, who are smart, who are  fair, and who follow the facts to get a just result.   After reviewing Mr. VanDyke's record and meeting with him privately  and watching his testimony before the Judiciary Committee yesterday, I  have arrived at the determination that Mr. VanDyke does not fit that  mold.   Mr. VanDyke spent a lot of time in our meeting talking about how the  role of a Federal judge is simply to apply the law and not to try to  change it. His record clearly shows otherwise.   How do we know this? Because before coming to Nevada, Mr. VanDyke  worked for the Montana attorney general. Many of his emails from that  time are public. They show he used that government office, where his  job was to defend the laws of Montana--instead, what he chose to do is  advance his own personal ideological agenda, even when it was against  his State's interests. At least in one instance, he signed the State of  Montana onto a brief without even bothering to read it.   Among the briefs Mr. VanDyke signed in his home State of Montana  during his tenure as solicitor general was one asking the Supreme Court  to strike down Roe v. Wade and all of the reproductive cases that  followed Roe. When it comes to a woman's right to make her decisions  about her own body, Mr. VanDyke's views and actions are far outside the  mainstream, and they are far out of step with the views of the people  of Nevada.   I am also concerned about the comments Mr. VanDyke has made about  LGBTQ Americans. In 2004, Mr. VanDyke wrote that there is ``ample  reason for concern that same-sex marriage will hurt families, and  consequentially children and society.''   The LGBTQ community is at a critical point in its fight for equality.  This term, the Supreme Court is considering whether employers in the  United States can fire an individual merely for being gay or  transgender. When the next case on LGBTQ rights comes up for judicial  consideration, it could come before Lawrence VanDyke.   If that isn't enough, here is one more thing to consider. The  American Bar Association has, by a substantial majority, rated Mr.  VanDyke as unqualified. For a lifetime appointment, we should always  strive for a candidate who is very qualified. No, they gave us Lawrence  VanDyke, who was rated ``not qualified.''   Why did the ABA make this determination? Well, I will let the ABA's  words speak for themselves. Based on interviews with 60 individuals who  have worked with Mr. VanDyke over the years, including more than 40  lawyers and over a dozen judges, this is what the ABA said.         Mr. VanDyke's past work is offset by the assessments of       interviewees that Mr. VanDyke is . . . lazy, an ideologue,       and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including       procedural rules. There was a theme that the nominee lacks       humility, has an ``entitlement'' temperament, does not have       an open mind, and does not always have a commitment to being       candid and truthful.    Surely you agree, no matter who is in the White House or who controls  the Senate, you would want the Federal judges in your States to come  from and reflect your communities. You would want to trust these judges  to be fair to your constituents and not use cases to advance their own  ideological agenda, and you would want your judges to be, at a minimum,  qualified to serve on the bench.   I oppose the nomination of Mr. VanDyke, and if it is withdrawn or  voted down, I will be ready that day to work with this White House on  finding nominees from Nevada who are qualified and fair and  nonpartisan. The people of my home State of Nevada, particularly today,  on Nevada Day, deserve nothing less.   I yield the floor.
