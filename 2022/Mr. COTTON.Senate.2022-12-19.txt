 Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  recognize Lt. Col. Jeffrey ``Slander'' Entine, who has worked in my  Senate office for the past year as a defense fellow. Lieutenant Colonel  Entine is a patriot who has served our country nobly and made it a  safer and better place. It has truly been a pleasure to have him in my  office.   Lieutenant Colonel Entine graduated from Florida State University in  2006. After graduation, he commissioned as a second lieutenant and set  off for pilot training in Mississippi. Lieutenant Colonel Entine stood  out early during pilot training. Not only was he the distinguished  graduate of his class, but he was also the best rated student pilot  with the highest academic grade in his class.   Later, Lieutenant Colonel Entine deployed for 6 months to Kandahar  Air Base, Afghanistan, flying F-16s. He flew 63 combat missions, earned  three Air Medals, and was named the outstanding performer of the 480th  Expeditionary Fighter Squadron's deployment.   He then went through the crucible of Weapons School, which forges  promising airmen into leaders and tactical experts. Again, he  distinguished himself in this challenging environment. When Lieutenant  Colonel Entine graduated from Weapons School in December 2016, he  became the chief of weapons and tactics in the 55th Fighter Squadron at  Shaw Air Force Base. Shortly after arriving, he overhauled the base's  training program. His boss said the new plan was ``the best he's ever  seen'' and rated him first out of the 27 company-grade officers in the  squadron.   In October 2017, Lieutenant Colonel Entine shipped off to Afghanistan  again--this time to Bagram Airfield, not far from Kabul. He deployed as  the wing weapons officer, where he advised the operations group  commander and wing commander on tactics. He also worked with special  operations forces conducting raids across the country. On one such raid  in April 2018, Lieutenant Colonel Entine coordinated with two  formations of F-16s, two AC-130s, three MQ-9 drones, and a ground  controller who was on his very first combat mission during a day-long  firefight with ISIS-K fighters. Lieutenant Colonel Entine employed  weapons six times during the battle, three times within danger-close  distances, and twice dropped bombs just 30 meters from friendly troops.  Thanks to his heroic efforts, no Americans died, three were safely  evacuated, and scores of enemy fighters were killed. And that was just  one combat sortie out of the more than  [[Page S7309]]  70 he flew during a 180-plus-day deployment. Lieutenant Colonel Entine  received the Air Medal with C device, a medal just beneath the  Distinguished Flying Cross, for his courageous exploits that day. The  Air Force Association also awarded him the Lieutenant General Clare  Chennault award in 2018 as a ``most outstanding aerial tactician.''   After 10 years on the frontlines, Lieutenant Colonel Entine moved to  Florida, where he served in an operational test squadron. While there,  he invented a method to use air-to-ground laser- guided rockets to  shoot down cruise missiles. In December 2019, Lieutenant Colonel Entine  proved the concept by shooting down a target drone over the Gulf of  Mexico using an air-to-ground rocket. Lieutenant Colonel Entine and his  team later recognized that the Air Force and Navy's premier air-to-air  missile, the AMRAAM, could reach ranges much longer than advertised,  prompting the Air Force to launch its longest-ever air-to-air missile  test in May of 2021.   Unsurprisingly, given his tireless tinkering and work ethic,  Lieutenant Colonel Entine's performance reports remained stellar. He  left Eglin as top-rated major out of 158 and headed to Washington, DC,  to represent the Air Force in Congress as a defense fellow.   While serving in my office, Lieutenant Colonel Entine solidified his  position as a key member of my team. He quickly became a trusted  adviser, especially concerning my duties as the AirLand Subcommittee  Ranking Member on the Armed Services Committee. A true visionary,  Lieutenant Colonel Entine led my initiative on a rated officer  retention amendment which was incorporated into the FY23 NDAA. His  fellow Air Force pilots owe Lieutenant Colonel Entine a debt of  gratitude for his tireless work to provide his service with four  additional retention related authorizations as part of this initiative.  In total, Lieutenant Colonel Entine drafted nearly 70 pieces of  legislation demonstrating an incredible ability to unify staff over  bipartisan policy issues. Lieutenant Colonel Entine undoubtedly proved  his worth as a member of my team, helping notch countless legislative  victories.   Beyond legislation, Lieutenant Colonel Entine demonstrated an  exceptional talent for hearing and nomination preparation and staff  work. His work in this arena was distinct from any fellow we have had  previously and, I suspect, that we will have ever again. This type of  preparation is one of the most crucial functions of my staff, and  Lieutenant Colonel Entine distinguished himself as an invaluable member  of the team. Our office greatly benefited from his talents and keen  insights. He attended over 58 Senate Armed Services Committee Hearings  and staffed over 60 engagements.   Furthermore, Lieutenant Colonel Entine represented me on multiple  staff delegations, conducting much needed oversight and research on my  behalf. On his trip to Honolulu, HI, to visit INDOPACOM, Lieutenant  Colonel Entine was a key interlocutor, ensuring that my personal staff  was well prepared to engage in technical discussions regarding the  needs of the Air Force. His insights have helped shape my policy  objectives for years to come. Lieutenant Colonel Entine also  participated in a Naval Embark, a critical component of our oversight  agenda related to my duties on the Seapower Subcommittee of the Armed  Services Committee. I also remain grateful for the sacrifices of  Lieutenant Colonel Entine's family, as he spent time away from home,  many hours, and late nights to ensure this crucial work was completed.  Lieutenant Colonel Entine has had a remarkable career and he has a  promising future ahead. He is exactly the kind of man and servicemember  that our military needs in leadership. For these reasons and more, I  was honored to have Lieutenant Colonel Entine in my office this year.  Lieutenant Colonel Entine Slander thank you for your service to  Arkansas and to the United States of America.                            ____________________
