 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have nothing  but warm feelings, respect, and gratitude for the noble service that my  colleagues from Alaska and Iowa and South Carolina and Indiana have  demonstrated in their loyalty to their country, serving in their  respective branches in the U.S. military, and nothing but respect for  the service that they have dedicated to the United States as U.S.  Senators.   I have nothing but respect for the brave men and women who have for  two and a half centuries donned the uniform in defense of their fellow  beings so that they might live in comfort and peace, while they offer  up their last full measure of devotion, day after day.   I have nothing but respect for what they are trying to do in the  sense that I know that they want the military to be all that it needs  to be in order to protect the American people.   I certainly do share the concern that they express. But to the extent  we ever put our armed services personnel in jeopardy because of  political disputes, that is not ideal. We don't want to ever sacrifice  military readiness because of a political battle, and it is because of  that, and not in spite of it, that I am here tonight.   I want to be clear. The particular strategy deployed here is not  mine. It is that of a dear friend and colleague who is here with me  tonight. It is not my strategy. It is his. And it is because it is his  that I am here to defend him in that, notwithstanding the fact that it  is not the particular tactic that I would have chosen. He has chosen a  tactic that is legitimate and that he has every right to deploy under  the rules of the Senate--rules that go back nearly two and a half  centuries in order to protect the individual rights of each Senator.   These have deep meaning under our constitutional system. In the U.S.  Senate, we operate differently than they do in the House.   First of all, we have this role. In the words of the minority leader,  we are in the personnel business, in addition to being in the business  of passing legislation. Being in the personnel business means that we  have got to review people as they come up for Senate confirmation.   We are also different in that every State is represented equally. In  fact, the only change that you cannot constitutionally make to the  Constitution by means of a constitutional amendment is that principle.  You cannot amend the Constitution to alter the principle of equal  representation among the States. And it is that very principle that is  reflected in these Senate rules and always has been. Why? Because it is  important to make sure that every State does have full representation-- that one isn't represented more than another.   The people of Alabama have elected my friend and colleague, the  senior Senator from Alabama, to represent them. That is why they have  these rights. That is why they are important to defend.   So notwithstanding the fact that any of us might have chosen a  different tactic or different strategy to go about this, this is his  right, and it is a right that I will defend to my last breath for the  simple reason that it is his right to do it, and he is right to do it.   Let me explain what I mean by that.   The reason we are even here having this discussion is because we have  some individuals who serve in the Pentagon, in the Department of  Defense, who have lost sight of which is the branch of government in  which they serve. We want them to be able, ready, willing at a moment's  notice to do everything they need to do in order to defend this great  Nation--the greatest civilization the world has ever known. To that  end, their job is to serve in an executive capacity, not in a  legislative capacity. These are not mere abstractions; these are  fundamental, bedrock principles of our system of government.   Two independent provisions of the Constitution make this clear.   Article I, section I, clause 1--the very first operative provision of  the entire Constitution--says that all legislative powers herein  granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall  consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.   Article I, section VII of the Constitution makes this point doubly  clear: that you cannot, may not, will not, must not ever pass a law,  change a law that is a Federal law in our system unless you have a few  things happen. You  [[Page S5563]]  have to have passage in the House and passage in the Senate. Most of  the time, it doesn't matter in which order; it just has to be the same  legislative text. That text must then be transmitted to the President-- or presented, as we call it--for signature, veto, or acquiescence. If  the President signs it or acquiesces, it becomes law. If the President  vetoes it, it is returned to our respective Chambers, and it will not  become law unless two-thirds of the Members of both Houses of Congress  choose to overturn that veto.   Here is why this matters: We have had in place since 1984 a set of  laws--laws that had been amended in 1996 and then again in 2003--that  today are codified in 10 U.S.C., section 1093. Those laws make clear  that you cannot use Department of Defense funds or Department of  Defense facilities or property for abortions. You cannot do that. You  cannot do that in the absence of rape, incest, or when the life of the  mother is in jeopardy unless the abortion happens.   This, in turn, reflects a very simple and very longlasting truth  among the American people, which is the American people come at the  abortion issue from a wide variety of perspectives. There are some who  believe that life begins at conception and that anything from that  moment forward cannot be justified. There are others who believe that,  until the baby is actually born and takes its first breath, the baby  has no legally cognizable, protectable rights. There are some who would  take that even further. I find it difficult to accept that some feel  that way, but some really do.   Even though Americans find themselves at very different positions  along this ideological spectrum specifically related to the issue of  abortion, there is one point that unites Americans overwhelmingly and I  mean to the tune of three out of four. Something in the range of about  75 percent of Americans agree on one thing--one thing--when it comes to  abortion: You should not, must not ever use Federal taxpayer funds for  abortion.   Why? Well, pro-life Americans, I think, find this explanation  obvious. They don't like abortion anyway, so they don't want government  funding. But it appears that about half the people who are not pro- life, who believe in some policies that recognize that somebody ought  to have the ability to get an abortion--about half of them, it turns  out, believe that we still shouldn't use Federal funds to do that  because a lot of Americans are uncomfortable with that, and it is with  good reason.   These policies have been around for a really long time and with good  reason. Even though overall preferences, strategies, beliefs, public  opinions about abortion have changed from time to time, this one has  remained overwhelmingly against the use of public funds.   So it was surprising and alarming to my friend Senator Tuberville  when, about a year ago, he started hearing rumors--rumors to the effect  that the Pentagon would begin using Federal funds to facilitate  abortions. He went and did as any faithful member of the Senate Armed  Services Committee would: He met with Secretary of Defense Lloyd  Austin, and he said: Look, I don't know whether these rumors are true,  but if they are true, I find them alarming, and if they turn out to be  true, I will have no choice as a member of the Senate Armed Services  Committee but to make sure that there are consequences to you if you  take this lawless act.    He had good reason to point this out. Look, the only reason for that  policy, the only fathomable reason, is to circumvent the plain purpose,  intent, effect of 10 U.S.C., section 1093. That is the only reason it  is there, and they have written it ever so craftily so as to be able to  have a colorable argument. I think it is an argument that flies in the  face of the stated purpose, intent, effect of this Federal statute, 10  U.S.C., section 1093. It is so that they could argue: Well, we are not  using it to perform the abortion; we are just using it to fly people to  get the abortion, and then we are using it to pay for 3 weeks of paid  leave time for anyone who has gone to get the abortion. We are going to  pay their travel, their room and board, and everything else. We will  pay for everything else around the abortion, but because we are not  paying for the abortion itself, we are in the clear.   Now, Senator Tuberville recognized something very important: that the  sole purpose of this policy would be to circumvent Federal law and to  make it difficult to impossible to challenge it in a court of law. I  will get back to that in a moment. So he did something right then and  there--something that, whether you agree with the tactic used or not,  you have to find admirable. He has taken the bull by the horns. He  utilized the resources at his disposal, which is what any Division I  champion football coach would do.   He did it, and he said: OK. If you do this, that is fine. I suppose-- well, it is not fine, but, you know, it is your prerogative to do that.  But if you do that, I am going to exercise my prerogatives as a  Senator, and my prerogatives as a Senator are such that I can require  you to take the long way, the long road, the long and more difficult  path instead of the shorter path that we nearly always use when we are  confirming flag officer military personnel--that is, generals and  admirals as well as political appointees--within the Department of  Defense.   Now, let's understand something about a ``hold.'' A ``hold'' is not  an inexorable block. It is not damning these people to Senate  confirmation hell. It doesn't have that power. That is above his pay  grade--all of ours. What he is doing is saying: There is the fast path,  and there is the slow path. We always use the fast path, but that  requires the acquiescence, the agreement, the unanimous consent of all  100 of us. If you don't do that, I, Senator Tuberville, will make you  take the slow path.   Secretary Austin is a decorated war hero. Secretary Austin has been  around for a long time. He knows the Senate. He knows the Pentagon  well. He knew the risks. He chose to play chicken. He chose to look a  U.S. Senator in the eye and say: Thank you. I will take that under  advisement.   And, in a cowardly moment, he decided to arrogate to himself power  that does not belong to him because the Constitution of the United  States doesn't give it to him because you can't legislate from the E- ring of the Pentagon. No matter how strongly he feels, no matter how  compelling his urge to facilitate the performance of abortion using  Federal funds contrary to public opinion, contrary to Federal law, he  does not have that power. Shame on him. It is to his everlasting shame  that he would arrogate to himself that power and then have the audacity  to blame Senator Tuberville for the slowdown that he himself knowingly,  willfully, shamefully created.   So we now get back to this point that is impacting military  readiness, that is creating an inconvenience for the flag officers who  have been nominated. We are hearing now that it is even affecting  people at a level below the flag officers. Now, that is curious because  Senator Tuberville has never imposed holds--none of these holds have  applied with regard to anybody below a flag officer level--general,  admiral, one star, two star, three star, four star, or political  appointee DOD-wide. Never. They haven't. So I really don't know where  that argument is coming from. Perhaps they are saying it has a  spillover effect downstream. Maybe that is the case. If that is the  case, then I hope they will be clear in making that argument because  otherwise that argument is just false; it is just not true. In any  event, he is not stopping them. He is not stopping one of them. He is  saying: You just have to take the slow path.    So let's be clear here. There are exactly two ways--two ways--that,  regardless of Senator Tuberville's holds, regardless of whether he ever  budges an inch, we can take care of this. Approach 1 could happen  tonight. I guess it is technically morning. What is it? It is 12:56 or  so a.m., so we will say this morning.   Right now, President Biden, if you are watching TV, pay attention. I  am going to give you a really easy recipe to follow. You can do this  even at 1 a.m. President Biden, if you are not awake, you really should  be watching this because this is compelling television.   If you are staffing President Biden tonight, you might go wake him  up. I think he will really enjoy this. I think he will enjoy it a lot.  It is much easier to do than riding a bike, and you are not going to  fall over while doing it.   All you have to do is suspend your Godless, lawless abortion travel  policy.  [[Page S5564]]  Just suspend it right now. If this is affecting military readiness, so  be it. End it. End it tonight. You have a duty to do that.   Lloyd Austin, you can do it, too. Suspend your abortion travel  policy.   Now, look, I know you guys feel really passionately about abortion. I  know that for whatever reason, you have lost your freaking minds ever  since that fateful day in June of 2022 when the Supreme Court of the  United States ended a nearly half-century-long judicial hegemony over  the issue of abortion. It ended that because, well, it turns out the  Constitution doesn't say anything about abortion, and by saying nothing  about abortion, it leaves the issue of abortion to elected lawmakers,  not to nine lawyers dressed in robes. Most of the time, that means they  leave the issue of abortion to State lawmakers, not Federal ones,  because most of the time, it is not our role anyway.   I know, President Biden and Secretary Austin, you have been really  upset about that. Why? Because, well, for a long time, the Supreme  Court of the United States on this issue that is so important to you-- why, I will never understand, but I understand that you are mad because  the Supreme Court, for that long period of time, was acting as your  superlegislature that was willing to do your bidding and that of your  party's. Your infanticidal ambitions were facilitated by this  superlegislature across the street.   The only problem is, they didn't have any authority to do that--none.  It cannot be found. So when they abandoned it, the day they abandoned  it, President Biden announced all sorts of ambitious, whole-of- government approaches to effectively nullify a ruling of the Supreme  Court of the United States--a ruling of the Supreme Court of the United  States that is legally, constitutionally unimpeachable.   From that moment forward, you declared your own little jihad on the  Dobbs ruling and on the Supreme Court. You have been trying to  delegitimize Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Barrett, Chief  Justice Roberts, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Gorsuch ever since  then. You have threatened, through members of your party and through  your appointment of this silly Commission you created, to pack the  Supreme Court of the United States notwithstanding the fact that you,  President Biden, stood on this very Senate floor decades ago and said  correctly that it was a boneheaded idea when Franklin D. Roosevelt last  threatened to pack the Supreme Court of the United States in 1937. It  is a boneheaded idea today. You have been doing that.   Meanwhile, you try to do everything you can to make the lives of  those Justices hell.   You have completely ignored 18 U.S.C., section 1507--a law that has  been violated again and again and again outside the homes of the six  Supreme Court Justices who had the courage and who had the appropriate  jurisprudential temperament to recognize that abortion is not made  theirs anywhere in the Constitution.   You have ignored the fact that people come to their homes to protest,  that they come to the homes of these Justices to protest against them,  disturbing them on vacation and when they are at home with their  families; ignored the fact that people are showing up to the homes of  these Justices not just to disturb their peace but to send a signal  loudly and clearly, unmistakably, over and over and over again, that  says: We know where you sleep. We know where your children lay their  heads at night.   Yet, President Biden, you do nothing to enforce that.   Your Attorney General has instructed Federal law enforcement  personnel, effectively, to stand down, ignore these violations. Shame  on you, President Biden.   Look, I get that. Oh, that is in your little empire. You are the head  of Article II. You are the head of the executive branch. If you don't  want to enforce the law, we can't make you, just like we can't make you  enforce the border as 8 million illegal immigrants have come across the  border, carrying with them enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman,  and child in America. And many of them have died, to the tune of  hundreds of thousands. We can't make you enforce the law because you  are the head of the executive branch. The head of the executive branch  enforces the law--or it is supposed to. We can't make you do that.   But do you know what we can do? We can defend our own prerogative to  make the law. Sure, once the law is made, you get to enforce it or  decide not to. You shouldn't--and shame on you for not--but you get to  decide that. You cannot make the law. You cannot rewrite the law. And  shame on you, President Biden, for blaming this man. This man who is  just trying to stand up for the law and for the unborn, you are blaming  him for our supposed lack of military readiness.   I can't believe anybody buys this crap--I really can't--let alone  anyone from the same party as Senator Tuberville.   We have all been elected on pro-life stances. Now, I understand, not  everybody is going to share the same strategy. Not every one of us  would choose this same approach. I didn't. But you are blaming the  wrong guy.   There is an empty chair here--two of them, in fact; two empty chairs  occupied by two executive branch individuals: Secretary Lloyd Austin  and President Joe Biden, who could end this tonight, but they refuse to  do so. That is avenue No. 1 for which we could end this.   Avenue No. 2, we could do as Senator Tuberville told Secretary Austin  we would do from the very outset; that is, we could confirm them the  slow way. We went 40 consecutive days and nights--kind of Biblical,  really, if you think about it--without a single vote in August. We are  about to go 10 or 11 more consecutive days and nights without a single  vote.   We have gone days even when we were in session, where we will cast  maybe one or two votes, at the most, and sometimes none. There are ways  in which you can tee these people up.   You know the rules, Senator Schumer. You know how to call these  people up. You know how to tee these up for a vote. Yet we are down  here tonight--all of us Republicans.   When we talk about military readiness, why on Earth are we not aiming  our remarks at President Biden or at Secretary Austin? Why on Earth are  we not directing them at Senator Schumer? They all have the ability to  end this. With Schumer, it would take longer. It would require more of  an investment of time on our part, sure. Why are we not directing our  arrows at them? Why are they going to Tuberville instead? I don't get  it.   As to the suggestion made by one of my colleagues--my friend,  distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from South Carolina--that  this ought to be resolved in court; that courts of law are where we  argue legal disputes; that most nearly all legal disputes should be  resolved there, that is just wrong. That is just dead wrong.   The fact is, as any lawyer, any member of the bar, any officer of the  court knows, most legal disputes never make it to court. There are a  lot of reasons for this. Some of them involve expensive litigation.  Some of them involve jurisprudential standards that don't always permit  a legal challenge to be brought. Among other things, you have to  establish what is called Article III standing. You have got to show an  injury, in fact, squarely traceable to the conduct of the defendant  that is capable of being redressed by a court of competent  jurisdiction.   Many cases, many disputes arise in a context in which it would be  difficult, if not impossible, to find someone with Article III standing  who is even allowed to challenge these things in Federal court.   I, respectfully, submit that it is like a needle in a haystack, in a  haystack on a distant planet, a really, really difficult case in which  to even imagine, even fathom someone with Article III standing who  could do it.   Senator Graham referred to some legal experts, legal scholars whom I  respect and admire, who have been looking into this. I have looked at  their written work product, and it is excellent, but even they  acknowledged it is not at all clear you could even find anyone with  standing.   This is exactly the kind of case that needs to be argued, that needs  to be settled not in the courts of law because it can't; it must be  resolved here, here in the branch of government that is charged with  making the law and that is also charged with overseeing the  [[Page S5565]]  branches of government that execute, implement, and enforce the law-- the executive branch. That is our job. This is where it has to be done.   So, look, if you want to give the farm away, if you want to say we  are just going to leave it alone, that is fine. But let's not kid  ourselves. No court is coming to the rescue. It is not going to work.  You are not going to find anyone with standing, I can almost guarantee  you. And even if you can find somebody with standing, they have crafted  this thing so deliberately, so maliciously, so carefully as to make it  nearly impossible for anyone who even could establish standing--which  they can't--to succeed on the merits because at the end of the day,  they will look at them, and they will say: Gosh, shucks, we didn't do  that. We didn't perform any abortions. All we did is we just, you know,  drove the people to the State or flew the people to the State where  they are going to get the abortion, and then we paid for their motel,  their room, board, lodging, gave them 3 weeks of per diem in order to  do it. No, we didn't do any of that.   So by a rigid, textual analysis, which probably would be the one that  would prevail in a court of law, you would lose.   Even if you could find somebody with Article III standing--which you  can't; you are not going to find that--what remedy is there?   If we are we are going to allow the laws that our branch of  government has made, if we are going to allow that law or the law in  general to be an ask, then, fine, let it go. But let's not kid  ourselves. This isn't getting fixed in a court of law. We have got the  remedy here.   Whether you agree with Senator Tuberville's initial decision to do it  this way or not, don't spit on me and tell me it is raining. Don't walk  in here and tell me there is another solution. Don't walk in here and  tell me that courts of law are where all legal disputes have to be  resolved when you know darn well a lot of them can't, and this one sure  as heck won't be.   It saddens me deeply that this many brave men and women have been  delayed. It troubles me deeply to consider the many families whose  lives have been disrupted by this. But I respectfully submit, with all  the passion I am capable of communicating at 1:10 in the morning, at a  bare minimum, you are wrong to just blame him. I don't think you should  be blaming him at all.   Secretary Austin and President Biden, you set in motion a sequence of  events that you knew darn well would culminate in this very thing. You  knew darn well that you would use this as an opportunity for  demagoguery. That is not cool.   I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we live in a  great country. It is a country that has thrived precisely because we  have sought, since the moment of our founding, to live under the rule  of law; that when we make a law, we do our best to follow it.   It doesn't always work that smoothly. I know the process of making  law and enforcing law and interpreting the law can be messy. People  have strong opinions about what the law ought to be, how it ought to be  enforced, what the law means. But, you know, we have been at our best  when we accept the fundamental premise that although the task may be  difficult and although people might reach different conclusions  regarding what the law should be, how the law ought to be enforced, and  how it ought to be interpreted, that there is a right answer.   We might not all agree on what the right answer is, but if we agree  that there is a right answer and it is our obligation to find it and  then defend it once we have found it, we are going to be better off.   One of the things that differentiated our form of government from  that of our mother country is the twin set of structural protections in  the Constitution that separate and divide power. Our Founding Fathers  understood, through sad experience, that it is the nature and  disposition of almost all men and women everywhere, as soon as they get  a little authority, a little power, that they will begin to exercise  what we call unrighteous dominion; that is, they have a tendency to  abuse their power. They have a tendency to become tyrants, petty or  grand. To that end, they understood something about human nature. They  understood what Madison described in Federalist No. 51; that if men  were angels, we would have no need of government. If we had access to  angels to govern us, we wouldn't need rules, we wouldn't need  constraints around government power. But, alas, we are not angels. We  don't have access to angels. Angels are not to be found among us,  certainly not in the E-Ring of the Pentagon, certainly not in the White  House today. They are no angels, neither are we. But we have rules.   To that end, our Founding Fathers sought to subdivide power, to slice  it and dice it. In short, they separated out power along two axes,  establishing these two fundamental structural protections that really  have helped foster the development of the greatest civilization the  world has ever known.   The first of these structural protections operates on a vertical  axis. We call that Federalism. It says that most power in our system of  government doesn't belong in Washington, DC. It doesn't belong at the  national level. It belongs at the State and local level where most of  the power is reserved.   It says that only a few powers designated as Federal, as national, by  the Constitution will be lodged within the Federal Government. Among  those powers, just a few basic national authorities: the power to  regulate trade or commerce between the States, with foreign nations,  and with the Indian Tribes; the power to come up with a uniform system  of weights and measures, a uniform system of immigration and  nationality laws; the power to develop courts inferior to the Supreme  Court of the United States, a system of bankruptcy laws and bankruptcy  courts; the power to declare war, to establish an army and a navy and  to regulate the militia, what we today call the National Guard.   And there is my favorite power, too often referred to as the power to  grant letters of marque and reprisal. Marque, in this context, is  spelled m-a-r-q-u-e. The letter of marque and reprisal, to put it  succinctly, is basically a hall pass issued by Congress in the name of  the United States that allows the person possessing it to engage in  state-sponsored acts of piracy on the high seas. In short, you get to  be a pirate.   Each of these powers are relatively minor. All of them together are  still relatively minor compared to the bulk of the power reserved to  the State and  [[Page S5566]]  local governments around the country. To the extent that we have  respected those limits, those distinctions between State and Federal  power, we have benefited materially as a country.   Tragically, over the last 86 years, we have deviated from that, and  that has caused problems. It has spilled over and helped erode not just  the vertical protection we call Federalism but also the horizontal  protection we call separation of powers. And I will turn to that now.   Under the principle of separation of powers within the Federal  Government, the Founding Fathers set up three distinct branches. One  branch, the legislative branch headed by Congress, consisting of a  House and Senate, would make the laws. Subdivided between these two  branches, these two Chambers of the legislative branch--because they  knew that it would be more difficult to abuse the power if you split it  up more, so they did--another branch, the executive branch, headed by  an elected President, whose job it is to enforce the laws--or it is, at  least, supposed to be; and a third branch headed by the Supreme Court  and including such inferior courts as Congress might choose to ordain  and establish from time to time, whose job it is to interpret the laws.   Now, between these three powers--let's face it--they are not really  equal branches. They are coordinate branches, but they are not equal in  their power. By far, the most dangerous branch is the branch that we  inhabit and is the branch in which we serve, in which we find ourselves  this fine evening, because the power to make law is the most dangerous  power in government. And it is for that very reason, Mr. President, the  Founding Fathers wouldn't entrust that to anyone other than the branch  of government most accountable to the people at the most regular  intervals--because it is dangerous.   The other two branches, if you think about it, really exercise powers  that are derivative of ours in one way or the other. The laws that the  executive enforces must first be passed by us. The laws the judicial  branch interprets must first be passed by us. That is why it is so  important that we safeguard this, that we make sure that no one else  from outside the legislative branch of government seizes that power.  Why? Because they are not accountable to the people at the most regular  intervals.   You can fire every Member of the House of Representatives every 2  years. Their voters have the chance to do that with all of them every 2  years. From the Speaker of the House to the most junior Member, they  can all be fired by their constituents every 2 years.   A third of us in this Chamber can be fired every 2 years. My  constituents opted not to do that last year. I had the chance, and they  decided to keep me for another 6 years, and I am grateful for that.   But we are all accountable. That same accountability does not apply  in the executive branch. It sure as heck doesn't apply in the judicial  branch. It is one of many reasons why you can't legislate from the E- Ring of the Pentagon. You cannot make a new law, you cannot change  existing law from the executive branch.   Now, I know. I know. I know. We have gotten lazy. We have gotten lazy  because since April 12, 1937, a day which should live in infamy in  American history but a day that is seldom even mentioned, much less  studied in grade school, intermediate school, high school, college,  even most law schools, is the day the Supreme Court messed it all up,  really leading to the erosion of both the vertical protection we call  Federalism and the horizontal protection we call separation of powers.    April 12, 1937--that was the day when the Supreme Court of the United  States, by a vote of 5 to 4 in a case called National Labor Relations  Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, reinterpreted one  provision of the Constitution--article I, section 8, clause 3--the  Commerce Clause, to mean something different, something different than  it had ever meant. Ever. It had always meant, prior to that time, that  Congress had the power to regulate a couple of things: No. 1,  interstate commercial transactions.   Person A lives in Virginia, wants to sell tobacco to person B living  in Maryland. That interstate commercial transaction can't adequately be  covered by the laws of either Virginia or Maryland, so Federal law has  the ability to cover it--interstate commercial transactions. Secondly,  channels or instrumentalities of interstate commerce: interstate  airways, airwaves, waterways, and so forth, because, there again, the  laws of no State are sufficient to cover that interstate event-- something carrying something else or someone else across interstate  lines.   Prior to that time, that is all the Commerce Clause meant. On April  12, 1937, the Supreme Court amended the Constitution, amended it  without going through the article V amendment process, a process that  is deliberately difficult. Why? Well, because that is the whole darn  point of having a Constitution, is to make it difficult to change. Some  of our laws must not be easy to change.   So the Supreme Court amended the Constitution, gave themselves power  that was not theirs to redefine it, to include any power that, when  measured in the aggregate, though, carried out intrastate--not part of  an interstate commercial transaction, not part of a channel or  instrumentality of interstate commerce, in the aggregate, had a  substantial effect on interstate commerce.   What does that mean? Well, that is all legalese for Congress can  regulate just about anything it wants. If it can dream it, it can  regulate it, as long as it uses the right words.   Since April 12, 1937, the Supreme Court has invalidated exactly two  laws--only two laws--as outside Congress's Commerce Clause power--one  involving provisions of the Gun-Free School Zones Act in a 1995  decision called the United States v. Lopez and another case involving a  few provisions of the Violence Against Women Act in the year 2000 in a  case called United States v. Morris. There is a third case that  arguably makes the list but, ultimately, gets cut from that list--NFIB  v. Sebelius--which the Supreme Court decided in 2012, concluding that  the ObamaCare individual mandate was, in fact, in violation of, in  excess of Congress's Commerce Clause authority but then went on to  rewrite the same statute--not once, but twice--in order to save it from  an otherwise inevitable finding of unconstitutionality. So that one  doesn't count.   So because since pretty much everything has been part of our  legislative prerogative, Congress has choked on its own power. Members  of Congress couldn't handle that much power. Members of Congress didn't  want to go to all the work of all that power. So Members of Congress  started delegating out the lawmaking powers to other branches of  government. In short, we have gotten lazy, we have gotten sloppy; and  it has inured to the everlasting detriment of the American people, who  find themselves subject to a Byzantine labyrinth of Federal regulations  that cost the American economy between $2 and $3 trillion a year to  comply with.   Those compliance costs are borne not by big, wealthy, blue-chip  corporations or some guy that you imagine wearing a double-breasted  suit and a monocle like Mr. Peanut. No; they are borne by hard-working  Americans who pay higher prices on goods and services and everything  they buy, and they pay for it also with diminished wages, unemployment,  and underemployment.   These things are not free, you see. You mess with Federalism, you  destroy Federal separation of powers.   Incidentally, you know how this decision was arrived at? Well,  Associate Justice Owen Roberts panicked. He got scared because  President Franklin D. Roosevelt threatened to pack the Supreme Court of  the United States with as many as 15 Justices. Justice Owen Roberts,  looking outside the case, looking beyond the law, decided to just  rewrite the Constitution rather than run the risk of Court packing.  Shameful, really, but it led to where we are now.   I keep in my office two stacks of documents behind my desk. One stack  is short. It is a few inches tall. It consists of the laws passed by  Congress during the previous year. It is usually a few hundred to a few  thousand pages long. It stands about that high. The other stack of  documents, during any given year, will come to a mass of about a 13- foot-tall stack. I keep them in three adjacent bookcases. These are in  bound  [[Page S5567]]  volumes, double-sided, very small print, very thin pages. Last year's  Federal Register.    The current year's Federal Register--our current Federal Register, by  the end of this year, will have reached about 100,000 pages. These  pages contain law--new law, law that, if not complied with, can land  you in prison, can get you fined, can get you banned from this or that  Federal program. It can deprive you of life, liberty, property just the  same as any law passed by Congress, only it is not a law passed by  Congress.   It is reminiscent of Federalist No. 62 in which James Madison, rather  eerily and with great prescience, warned it will be of little avail to  the American people that their laws may be written by men of their own  choosing if those laws be so voluminous, complex, and ever-changing  that they can't be read and understood by the American people, if they  can't know from one day to the next what the law is today and what it  will be tomorrow.   Those words still echo in our ears today when we see not only are  those laws so voluminous and ever-changing and complex that we can't  read and understand the law, know what it means and says from one day  to the next; they are not even written by men and women of our own  choosing.   That is why it matters, that this document written back in 1787 still  matters. We have all sworn an oath to uphold it. And what it means is  you can't legislate from the E-Ring of the Pentagon. You can't make a  law, you can't change an existing Federal law from the executive branch  of government, unless you are the President of the United States and  your sole role in lawmaking is signing, vetoing, or acquiescing to a  law duly passed by the House and the Senate. You can't make a law; you  can't change a law--not from the E-Ring of the Pentagon, not from the  Oval Office, not from any quarter of any part of this town or this  great land or this entire world outside of this Chamber and the Chamber  just down the hall from us. That is why it matters.   So, yeah, this is about life. Yeah, this is also about the military.  But we swore an oath to that Constitution. We swore an oath that we  will make the law; we will not delegate that law to somebody else; we  are not going to let somebody else make the law--especially a law that  is destructive of life, liberty, and property, as that is, ultimately,  the sole purpose of government: to protect life, liberty, and property.   Quite ironically, the bigger, the more out-of-control, the more  unrestrained, the more unaccountable any government becomes, it is  inevitably the consequence of that government that it becomes  destructive of life, liberty, and property. That is how we got to where  we are here, where a branch of government not entitled to make the law  has made law and has made law to facilitate the taking of unborn human  life.   My colleagues who are here tonight, whom I love and respect, are  blaming the wrong culprit. It is not Tommy Tuberville. It is Joe Biden,  Lloyd Austin, and Chuck Schumer. Let's keep that blame where it  belongs. Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this can be  remedied in court. It can't. It won't. We all know that.   We are going to stand up for the unborn who cannot speak for  themselves. We are going to have to do it. If we are going to prevent  somebody else from making law when it is not their prerogative, it has  to be us.   Mr. President, I object.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    I have got a question relative to that. Will the gentleman  yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Mr. President, the late Associate Justice Oliver Wendell  Holmes, Jr., used to say: There is a point of contact in every case. He  defined that point of contact as the place where the boy got his finger  caught in the machinery.   Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin got his finger caught in the  machinery. Hence, defining the point of contact in this case, in this  dispute, when he decided to circumvent the plain intent and effect of  10 U.S.C. 1093, plainly prohibiting the use of DOD funds to perform  abortions. He did that with clear intent to avoid the impact of the law  while purporting to comply with it. He did so shamefully.   I appreciate my colleagues Senator Ernst and Senator Sullivan for  their service to our country. Their service, along with that of  Senators Graham and Young, who were with us earlier tonight, is  admirable, as is their service in the U.S. Senate.   The service to our country exhibited by Senator Tuberville is no less  to be commended, no less to be admired. I, frankly, resent the  suggestion, to the extent anyone is making it, that he is any less  qualified to make these arguments simply because of the fact that he  hasn't worn that uniform. He has every bit the right to do that. I do  appreciate the comments made by my colleague Senator Ernst moments ago  to the effect that this is, in fact, President Biden's fault; this is,  in fact, Secretary Lloyd Austin's fault; that this is, in fact, Senator  Chuck Schumer's fault. I appreciate that.   Nonetheless, the majority of the remarks that we have heard tonight,  this morning, have not suggested in any way, shape, or form that the  true call to action really is being directed to President Biden, to  Secretary Austin, or to Senator Schumer.   We have been asked the question over and over again: Why punish the  innocent? Indeed, why punish the innocent? Do you know who is innocent?  Babies. Do you know who doesn't have a voice in the Senate? Babies. Do  you know who can't speak for themselves? Babies.   You know, a baby doesn't have a name. A baby doesn't have a military  rank. A baby doesn't have a professional career upon which to rely,  upon which he or she can have people rallying around the baby in  defense of that baby's life. It is one of the many reasons why Congress  saw fit to adopt 10 U.S.C section 1039: to make sure that the Federal  Government didn't contribute to this. The U.S. Department of Defense is  supposed to kill America's enemies, not her babies.   Regardless of how you feel about pro-life issues, you have got to  accept the fact that Americans, by a margin of three out of four, are  not willing to tolerate the expenditure of U.S. taxpayer funds for  abortions. This isn't honorable; this isn't noble.   And, no, you cannot conflate this. You can't distract from it. You  can't obfuscate the barbarism inherent in this policy simply by  referring to the illustrious resumes, to the amazing job qualifications  of one-, two-, three-, and four-star Generals.   It doesn't fix the problem, not even for an instant. It begs the  question: How many future Generals, how many future Admirals are going  to be aborted by this policy, by the Pentagon itself?   Who can't go out and hold a press conference? Well, we are told  tonight it is the one-, two-, three-, four-star Admirals and Generals.  Babies also can't do that.   My colleagues posited over and over again tonight in a way that I  found, frankly, very offensive, that we are somehow afraid to have the  credentials of these military men and women read from the Senate floor.  If they think that they read us wrong, 180 degrees wrong, we are not  afraid of that, not for an instant. Our quarrel is not with them. Our  quarrel is with those who would circumvent the law in order to kill  children.   Any society that sacrifices babies for the convenience of adults is  in for a rough ride. I resent, also, the fact that some on the Senate  floor tonight have implicitly challenged our patriotism, our gratitude  for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, or marines, even our national  security, because we stand behind one man's effort to protect the  unborn who can't speak for themselves, who can't fight for themselves,  who don't have a name or a military rank to secure their position in  life.   We have been told over and over again that these one-, two-, three-,  and four-star Generals and Admirals are being punished for something  they had nothing to do with. Here again, the same can be said of the  babies whose will be snuffed out with the assistance of U.S. taxpayer  dollars.   We are told over and over again about how pro-life these speakers  are. And I don't doubt that they are, but one minute they are uttering  those words, and the very next minute they are accusing Senator  Tuberville of jeopardizing our national security or not caring about  the families of these individuals.   I am sorry. That is not fair, nor is it helpful for them to dismiss  it or passive aggressively suggest: Well, we just have to deal with  this. We just have to find a solution. Well, then find one.   Look, I get it. They don't love the tactic he has chosen. It is not  the one I chose, not the one they chose. But it is what he has chosen.  If they are going to passively aggressively tell him that he has to  find another solution to protect the unborn, then they had darned well  better direct him to one. But they haven't. The closest they have come  is to suggest litigation.    Litigation is of no avail. There is not any plausible existing human  who has article III standing to challenge this. And, moreover, even if  we could find one--which we can't--this is the kind of insult to the  law, the kind of violation of the law, the kind of effort to circumvent  the law that is not likely to prevail in the courts. It is almost  certainly doomed to it.   So, no, litigation doesn't solve the problem. That is, moreover, just  punting to the judicial branch of government something that is a  distinctively legislative task. That doesn't do it for me.   The fact that they say over and over again, ``There has got to be a  better way,'' if there is one, then help him find it. But don't just  tell him he is wrong for standing up for this without giving him a  plausible path in a different direction.  [[Page S5579]]    Let me outline just a couple of different paths that I think we could  pursue--and I would like their help in getting them. I would like to  know whether they would be willing to join with us. Why not have  Republican Senators say, We are not going to pass the National Defense  Authorization Act unless we fix this issue? Why not have them sign up  and say, We as Republicans either aren't going to do that, we are not  going give another dime to nonmilitary aid to Ukraine or to Gaza or who  knows whatever else, unless they fix this problem in statute or unless  the Pentagon and the White House withdraw its abortion travel funding  policy?   Those are just a couple of ideas. Those are actually productive  ideas. And I would love to know whether they would be willing to join  the fight in that, whether they would be willing to help us get 41  signatures on a letter committing to do one of those things. Did they  offer that tonight? No. They just continue to pay lip service to the  notion that this is Joe Biden's and Lloyd Austin's fault and Chuck  Schumer's fault, but all the time they are pointing the finger to Tommy  Tuberville. That is not fair. We owe him better than that. We who  campaign on the banner of pro-life owe Tommy Tuberville more than that.  We owe the unborn of this country more than that. We can do better. But  to do better, we have to actually act.   I am glad that one man in this body is willing to stand up for the  unborn, and it is an honor and privilege for me to stand with him.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk, and  I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, but in order to place the  bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
