 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Cortez Masto is to the  House managers:         The President's counsel has claimed that the President was       unfairly excluded from House impeachment processes. Can you       describe the due process President Trump received during       House proceedings compared to previous presidents? Did       President Trump take advantage of any opportunities to have       his counsel participate?    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, and to Senators, thank you  so much for that question.   Let me make this plain. The President is not the victim here. The  victim in this case is the American people. President Trump was invited  to attend and participate in all of the Judiciary Committee hearings.  He could have had Mr. Cipollone, Mr. Sekulow, or any of the other  attorneys who have joined at the counsel table participate throughout  the Judiciary Committee proceedings in the House. They could have  attended all of the Judiciary hearings, and imagine this--cross-examine  witnesses, raise objections, present evidence favorable to the  President, if they had any to present, and they could have requested to  have President Trump's own witnesses called.   But President Trump refused to participate. He wrote to the House,  and I quote: ``If you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we  can have a fair trial in the Senate. . . .''   In every event, President Trump was asked, and indeed legally  required, to provide evidence during the Intelligence Committee  investigation, but he refused, as we have already said over and over  again, to produce any documents or allow witnesses to testify. We thank  God for the 17 public servants who came forward in spite of the  President's efforts to obstruct.   In addition, Republican Members in Congress had an equal opportunity  to ask questions during the depositions and the hearings in both the  Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee hearings. Republican Members  called three witnesses during the Intelligence Committee's hearings and  an additional witness during the Judiciary Committee hearing.   Of course, a House impeachment inquiry is not a full-blown criminal  trial. We do know that. But this is a trial, and, obviously, the  President is being afforded every due process right during these  proceedings.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.
