 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my dear friend,  Dr. Harold Black. The University of Georgia, his alma mater, recently  announced it will name a new residence hall in his honor.   He was the first Black student to enroll in the university's Terry  College of Business, graduating with a bachelor of business  administration in economics. He completed his education by earning his  master of the arts and Ph.D. in economics from Ohio State University.   Dr. Black then led an accomplished career working for financial  institutions. He served as Deputy Director of the Department of  Economic Research and Analysis in the United States Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, Director and Chairman of the Nashville  branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and consulted for  several major banking corporations.   Dr. Black later used his public and private sector experience to  teach finance in the higher education system. Following tenures at  several universities, Dr. Black eventually settled at my alma mater,  the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.   Dr. Black shared his knowledge with students in the Haslam College of  Business for 24 years until his retirement in 2011. Throughout his  career, Dr. Black published his financial research in outlets like the  American Economic Review, the Journal of Banking and Finance, and the  Journal of Monetary Economics. He received many awards for his teaching  and research. Dr. Black continues to write, publishing a weekly column  in my favorite newspaper, the Knoxville Focus.   Congratulations on your recent recognition from the University of  Georgia, Dr. Black. Our community is proud of your achievements, and I  for one enjoy reading your views on economics, and for making it so  even a person of my intelligence level can understand what you are  saying. I really appreciate it.              Honoring Petty Officer Second Class Chris Al-Brett     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Petty Officer Second Class  Chris Al-Brett as Tennessee's Second District's Veteran of the Month.   Chris enrolled in avionics school at the Naval Air Technical Training  Center in Millington, Tennessee, in 1969. Later that year, he reported  to Attack Squadron 174 based at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, which  defended the beaches of Northeast Florida against a potential communist  invasion.   He worked on an A-7 Corsair 2 Light Attack Bomber. Chris later  transferred to Attack Squadron 176 in Virginia. In 1972, he embarked  aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt for a mission  in the Mediterranean Sea. After serving overseas, Chris was honorably  discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1974.   In 2015, Chris joined the Captain Bill Robinson Chapter 1078 of the  Vietnam Veterans of America. He became the chapter's public information  officer, and the chapter received the Vietnam Veterans of America's  2017 Chapter of the Year award thanks in part to his leadership.   In December 2020, Chris joined the United Veterans Council of East  Tennessee's Board of Directors as its public information officer. He  was recently elected as the board's president, a position he will  assume this year.   Mr. Speaker, we thank Chris for his service to our country and to his  fellow veterans. I wish him the very best at the start of his new  position.                            ____________________
