 Madam Speaker, June is Gun Violence Awareness Month, a  time for extra reflection on the immeasurable cost of lives lost and  destroyed in senseless shootings. And it is another chance to demand  that Congress act to stop the bloodshed.   Once more, last Friday, a gunman attacked a local government building  in Virginia Beach, killing 12 and wounding many more.   This was the 150th mass shooting in America since the start of the  year, on the 151st day of the year. Let that sink in: 150 days, 151  mass shootings. Enough is enough.   But it is not just mass shootings. This past weekend, in Chicago  alone, at least 52 people were shot, and eight people died. Enough is  enough.   It is long past time for the Congress to take concrete action to  reduce gun violence. As a House, we did that this year, passing H.R. 8,  a bipartisan universal background check bill, but it has been more than  100 days since we sent that legislation to the Senate and, still, no  vote.   How many more shootings, how many more lives lost, before Leader  McConnell ends the obstruction and allows a vote on this commonsense  bill? Congress is not powerless. Congress has the ability to save  lives. Let's act now.                            ____________________
