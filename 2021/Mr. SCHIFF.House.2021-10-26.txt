 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Equal Healthcare  for All Act. Federal law protects against discrimination in housing,  schooling, and employment.   But equitable access to healthcare remains broadly unprotected, the  consequences of which are deadly: for Black women who are more likely  to die during childbirth, for Hispanic individuals who suffer from  higher rates of chronic diseases, for LGBTQ individuals who postpone  medical treatment for fear of discrimination.   For the first time in our Nation's history, my bill would make  equitable healthcare a protected civil right. And it will be another  important step towards breaking down the barriers of discrimination in  our country.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Dwayne Hall, a community leader and  good friend, for his efforts to conceptualize and advance this bill.  The importance of those efforts cannot be understated.                            ____________________
