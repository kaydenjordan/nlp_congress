 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. O'Halleran for yielding and for  his leadership on this important issue.   Sexual abuse is abhorrent. It is particularly abhorrent when it is  conducted by an individual in a position of authority: a coach, a  trainer, a teacher.   The community of Mesa, Arizona, which Mr. Biggs and I represent, was  rocked by a tragic event in which a young athlete was abused for at  least 3 years before receiving help. Had he or other young athletes  experiencing similar nightmares had access to resources and support,  perhaps the nightmare could have ended sooner, perhaps it could have  been prevented.   Our bipartisan amendment is simple. It builds on a very good  bipartisan bill by requiring governing bodies to list dedicated  information and resources for victims and families on official  websites.   No individual should suffer from sexual abuse. No family should go  without support when they are in need.   I thank the two gentlemen, my friends from Arizona, Mr. O'Halleran  and Mr. Biggs, for cosponsoring this amendment. I urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on our amendment and to support the underlying bill.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
