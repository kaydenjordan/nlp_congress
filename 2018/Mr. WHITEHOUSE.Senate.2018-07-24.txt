 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.    Mr. President, I am here for the now 214th time to  urge that we wake up to the effects of carbon pollution on the Earth's  oceans, atmosphere, and climate.   One obstacle to action on the threat that we face from climate  change, however, is the manufactured doubt that so often surrounds this  issue. We find this manufactured doubt a fossil fuel industry product-- just as oil and gas are fossil fuel industry products--flowing even  from the editorial page of one of our Nation's leading publications,  the Wall Street Journal. Whenever the issue is harmful industrial  pollutants, the Wall Street Journal's editorial page has a long record  of misleading its readers, denying the legitimate science, and even  ignoring its own news reporting, all to shill for the polluting  industries.   A pattern of science denial repeats itself in the editorial pages of  the Wall Street Journal on environmental issues--issues such as acid  rain and depletion of the ozone layer and now, and for years, climate  change. This editorial page has persistently published editorials  against taking action to prevent manmade climate change.   In June 1993, the editors wrote that there is ``growing evidence that  global warming just isn't happening.''   In September 1999, the editorial page reported that ``serious  scientists'' call global warming ``one of the greatest hoaxes of all  time.'' If that is what they are saying, I suspect that what those  scientists are serious about is the money they get from the fossil fuel  industry.   In June 2005, the page asserted that the link between fossil fuels  and global warming had ``become even more doubtful.'' This was June  2005, and the Wall Street Journal editorial page was questioning  whether there is a link between fossil fuels and global warming?   Even more recently, a December 2011 editorial said that the global  warming debate requires what the page called ``more definitive  evidence.'' I guess having essentially all the serious scientists in  the world lined up on this is not serious enough.   In October 2013, the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal  warned that in addressing climate change, ``interventions make the  world poorer than it would otherwise be.'' I guess if the world of  Exxon shareholders is your world, then it does make it poorer, but in  any real world, that just ain't so.   You would think that as the evidence mounted over the past several  decades, the Wall Street Journal editorial page would have at some  point woken up and begun to publish editorials based on real science  and data. To put it mildly, that has not been the case. Instead, the  editorial page has doubled down on climate denial.   Just last month, the Journal published a piece titled ``The Sea is  Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change.'' This piece is riddled with  readily fact-checked scientific errors, and it ignores all the  legitimate science on climate change and sea level rise. Not  surprisingly, the author of this article, Fred Singer, is a notorious  and longstanding climate denier who has for years been affiliated with  or funded by the Heritage Foundation, the Heartland Institute, the Cato  Institute, and others. He has been funded by a rogues' gallery of  climate denial front groups that have themselves been funded by  ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers' network.   Dr. Michael Mann and Dr. Andrea Dutton--both actual legitimate  climate scientists--wrote a response to the Wall Street Journal. Their  article, titled simply ``Water's Rising Because It's Getting Warmer,''  directly addresses the factual problems with Singer's piece.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed  in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   In response to Singer's claim that ice sheets are getting bigger, the  actual climate scientists wrote:         No, ice is not accumulating on Earth--it is melting. No,       Antarctica isn't too cold for melting--warming oceans are       eroding the ice from beneath, destabilizing the ice sheet.       And no, legitimate scientific conclusions are not reached in       op-ed pieces, but through careful peer-reviewed research.    Climate denial, by the way, tends to avoid peer review like the  plague. It goes straight to FOX News, straight to hearings, and  straight to the talk shows, because there it gets the audience it wants  without having to face the rigor it would not survive.   Singer also erroneously claims that sea levels are not rising due to  warming temperatures. In response, Drs. Mann and Dutton explain:         That research shows that sea levels are rising and human-      caused climate change is the cause. Don't take our word for       it; help yourself to the mountain of scientific literature       showing as much. When water warms, it expands. When ice       warms, it melts. To deny these facts is not just to deny       climate change. It is to deny basic physics.    But in the spirit of climate denial, there is very little that these  denialists won't say.   The Trump administration's own ``Climate Science Special Report,''  issued by the Trump administration, found that ``it is virtually  certain that sea level rise this century and beyond will pose a growing  challenge to coastal communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems.'' The  ``Climate Science Special Report'' will serve as the scientific  backbone for the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which is due later  this year. The authors list is a who's who of top university  scientists--many from universities in the home States of Senators here  in this body--and experts from NOAA, the EPA, NASA, our National Labs,  and the National Science Foundation. By the way, those NASA people have  a rover driving around on Mars. They may know a little something about  science. The report is backed by the Departments of Agriculture,  Defense, Energy, Commerce, Interior, and State--in all, 13 Federal  Agencies and Departments. Or you can believe the editorial page of the  Wall Street Journal and its phony baloney fossil fuel-funded  scientists.   The Journal actually continued its climate denial spree in June,  publishing another piece titled ``Thirty Years On, How Well Do Global  Warming Predictions Stand Up?'' In this one, Patrick Michaels and Ryan  Maue argue that Dr. James Hansen's 1988 climate change warnings were  overestimated.   Well, let's start by pulling the curtain back on these two characters  who wrote the piece. You will quickly see that they are, to put it  politely, aligned with the fossil fuel industry. Patrick Michaels is a  senior fellow at the Koch-founded and Koch-funded Cato Institute.  Michaels at one point admitted that 40 percent of his funding came from  the fossil fuel industry. His  [[Page S5261]]  coauthor also joined the Koch-funded Cato Institute last year.   Believe it or not, yes, the fossil fuel industry still pays for this  nonsense even as fossil fuel CEOs claim to recognize: Climate science  is real, and we support a carbon fee. That, of course, being the latest  chapter in the fossil fuel industry's long and ongoing campaign of  fraud--now pretending that they support a carbon fee, when all of their  political apparatus is dedicated to opposing the very result they claim  to seek.   Thirty years ago, Hansen's testimony outlined three scenarios.  Remember, this was 1988. The first scenario was a business-as-usual  projection with accelerating emissions, yielding 1.5 degrees Celsius  warming by 2017. The second scenario showed drastic emissions cuts,  yielding 0.4 degrees Celsius warming by 2017. Hansen proposed a middle  scenario of continued but not accelerating emissions, resulting in 0.84  degrees Celsius warming by 2017. In his testimony, Dr. Hansen stated  that the middle scenario was the most likely.   Michaels and Maue claim that the scenario with the least amount of  warming turned out to be correct, and therefore Hansen was wrong, and  therefore climate models can't predict climate change. Unfortunately  for them, the facts are otherwise.   Hansen's analysis projected that global surface air temperatures  would increase by approximately 0.84 degrees Celsius between 1988 and  2017 in his middle scenario, the one he said was most likely. Once you  account for the effects of a slight cooling that resulted from the  success of the Montreal Protocol in phasing out chlorofluorocarbons,  Hansen's projected warming is 0.6 to 0.7 degrees Celsius by 2017.    That, in blue, is the adjusted Hansen projection. I don't think you  can fault him for not predicting the Montreal Protocol that happened  after his prediction. It is fair to adjust his prediction for the  Montreal Protocol and the effect of reduced chlorofluorocarbons. Once  you do that, it shows that observed temperature in red tracks pretty  darned well with his projections.   If that were my work, I would be pretty proud of it. Here it is 30  years later, and we are off by a gap that my finger can cover on the  graph.   Michaels and Maue did not bother to mention that Hansen also  predicted which parts of the globe would warm more quickly than others.  Thirty years ago, he calculated the Arctic would warm faster, and there  would be more warming over landmasses than over the oceans. All of  these things are happening. Even Hansen's early climate models were  accurate and reliable. And global warming is proceeding, just as the  scientists have warned.   As the Wall Street Journal editorial page continues to publish its  fossil fuel-funded nonsense--stuff that is written by pseudoscientists,  funded by the industry with a massive conflict of interest about this  question--it has been 30 years since the warnings of Hansen. Despite  all of the evidence that has piled up, consistent with his warnings,  despite the regular litany of current events driven by climate change  now, Congress has been taking no action. We have been stilled by the  forces of the fossil fuel industry.   The real irony here is that the Wall Street Journal claims to be the  news source for businesses and financial investors. Off the editorial  page, out in the real world of business and finance, real decisions are  being made by real executives, backed by real money.   Are they buying what the Wall Street Journal editorial page is  selling? No. No, indeed. They are telling their clients and their  companies: You must take climate change seriously, and you must take  carbon pricing seriously.   In the real world, businesses are demanding better climate policies  and investors are demanding better reporting of climate risk. The giant  investment firm BlackRock led a group of major investors and broke the  back of ExxonMobil's opposition to answering to its shareholders about  climate change. They are demanding this. Many companies are even  setting their own internal price on carbon to account for the real- world costs of climate change. The business community and the  investment community are acting because they know climate change is  real, is affecting their prognosis for their companies, and carbon  pricing is a key part of the solution.   Increasingly, economists and financial regulators warn that we are  actually hurtling toward an economic disruption--that we need to  prepare for a possible crash of what they call the carbon bubble. This  carbon bubble collapses when fossil fuel reserves, now claimed as  assets by the fossil fuel companies, turn out to be useless as  renewable energy sources grow more competitive, and those useless  assets become what are called stranded assets. How much gets stranded?   A publication by economists in the journal Nature estimated the  following impacts in a 2-degree Celsius world: ``stranded assets . . .  around 82 percent of global coal reserves, 49 percent of global gas  reserves, and 33 percent of global oil reserves.''   Imagine that--82 percent of global coal reserves gone, wiped off the  balance sheets; 49 percent of global gas reserves gone, wiped off the  balance sheets; and 33 percent of global oil reserves gone, wiped off  the balance sheets because they are no longer economically producible.   Is this nuts? Even the Bank of England in an official statement has  warned that investments in fossil fuels and related technologies may  ``take a huge hit.''   At some point, there has to be a grownup in the room. The fossil fuel  industry, obviously, is not capable of being that grownup. They still  pay for denial and obstruction. The Wall Street Journal's editorial  page is obviously no use. That page is still yapping on the industry's  leash.   There is some good news. This week, two House Republicans, at long  last, introduced a bill that would put a price on carbon emissions. But  we still await one Republican in the Senate, just one--anyone who will  face up to this problem, who will stand up for science, who will  acknowledge what their own home State's universities are teaching and  take some real action. Climate denial is a dangerous and ultimately  doomed game, and the Wall Street Journal editorial page should know  better.   It is time to wake up.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 Water's Rising Because It's Getting Warmer         May 22, 2018.--Would the Journal run the op-ed ``Objects       Are Falling, but Not Because of Gravity''? That's pretty       similar to climate contrarian Fred Singer saying The Sea Is       Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change'' (op-ed, May 16).        No, ice is not accumulating on Earth--it is melting. No,       Antarctica isn't too cold for melting--warming oceans are       eroding the ice from beneath, destabilizing the ice sheet.       And no, legitimate scientific conclusions are not reached in       op-ed pieces, but through careful peer-reviewed research.        That research shows that sea levels are rising and human-      caused climate change is the cause. Don't take our word for       it; help yourself to the mountain of scientific literature       showing as much. When water warms, it expands. When ice       warms, it melts. To deny these facts is not just to deny       climate change. It is to deny basic physics.        New York City experienced an additional 25 square miles of       flooding from the approximately one foot of sea-level rise       that has occurred due to human-caused warming. Without       concerted efforts to reduce carbon emissions, it could       experience as much as eight feet by the end of the century--      permanently inundating most of Wall Street.      Asst.

Mann,        Penn State University, University Park, Pa.                                   ____         Fred Singer leaves out any real evidence to refute research       attributing the measured sea-level rise almost exactly to the       measured thermal expansion of seawater and glacier melt.                                Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.),      Newport, RI.                                   ____         Our emissions will continue shaping how much seas rise in       the coming decades. Taking this threat lightly endangers       hundreds of communities in the U.S. and world-wide, and       wastes the dwindling time we have to reduce our risk by       cutting carbon emissions and investing in resilience. Since       1900, global sea level has risen by seven to eight inches.       Sea-level rise has brought more frequent flooding to dozens       of coastal communities, including Atlantic City, N.J. and       Charleston, S.C., where the number of floods has quadrupled       since 1970. The pace of sea-level rise has recently doubled.  [[Page S5262]]         Mr. Singer acknowledges there's ``good data showing sea       levels are in fact rising at an accelerating rate,'' yet       makes the unscientific claim that this is disconnected from       rising global-warming emissions and temperatures. The risks       are clear. Sea-level rise projections for 2100 range from one       foot to more than eight feet--far greater than the six inches       Mr. Singer claims. Swiftly reducing our global-warming       emissions would give us the best chance to minimize sea-level       rise, but our current emissions trajectory makes achieving       the range's low end more unlikely each day.

A Feb. 13 paper notes:       ``Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth's       atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which       causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water       expands, and this 'thermal expansion' of the ocean has       contributed about half of the 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) of       global mean sea-level rise we've seen over the last 25 years       . . . Second, melting land ice flows into the ocean, also       increasing sea level across the globe.''                                                   Wendy Fleischer,      Brooklyn, NY.                                   ____         Melting ice is not the only thing that can raise the sea       level. Note the eruption of hundreds of undersea volcanoes in       the oceans and what they deposit. All of the rivers of the       world flush millions of acre feet of mud and silt into the       sea floor daily. During an undersea earthquake a tectonic       plate could override another, affecting a thousand miles of       sea floor, displacing a great deal of water and raising the       sea level.
