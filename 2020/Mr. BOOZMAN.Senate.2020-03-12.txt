 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to honor Hot Springs Police  Officer First Class Brent Scrimshire, who was killed in the line of  duty on Tuesday, March 10.   A native of Malvern, AR, Brent Scrimshire graduated from Malvern High  School and Henderson State University.   Officer Scrimshire was an exemplary member of law enforcement. He had  served on the Hot Springs police force for a number of years and was  recognized as the department's Employee of the Quarter just recently in  acknowledgment of his unique dedication, work ethic, and  professionalism.   Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also named him the  Southwest Region Officer of the Year in 2016, which, according to media  reports, he earned in part because of his lifesaving action when he  helped to control the bleeding of a stabbing victim.   ``Scrim'' was known for treating his brothers in blue, as well as  those he encountered while doing his job, with kindness and dignity. He  also enjoyed being outdoors, hunting and fishing.   Officer Scrimshire deeply loved his wife and two children, who are  now left behind to go through life without the devoted husband and dad  they adored.   Our hearts break for them, the rest of his family and friends, and  his entire family at the Hot Springs Police Department. His death is a  tragic reminder of the risks our law enforcement officials face each  time they put on the uniform.   I send my deepest condolences to Officer Scrimshire's loved ones. We  honor his service and his sacrifice and pray all those fortunate enough  to have known him will find comfort in his legacy and in the outpouring  of love and support from so many.   On behalf of all Arkansans, we celebrate Officer Scrimshire's life  and example of courageous, willing, and selfless public service. May he  rest in peace.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
