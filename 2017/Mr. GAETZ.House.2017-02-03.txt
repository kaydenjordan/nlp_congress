 I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the danger that is currently  posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.   Iran and its fundamentalist government pose the gravest threat to  global peace, stability in the Middle East, and Israel's existence.   Iran continues to extend its dangerous hegemony through the region in  places such as Lebanon, by arming and training Hezbollah; in Gaza, by  arming Hamas; in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.  [[Page H967]]    Iran's taking hostage of U.S. sailors and its continued ballistic  missile tests and death threats to Israel highlights Iran's evil  intentions and the need for the United States to play a leading role in  rolling back Iran's growing influence and its push to destabilize the  Middle East and the world. These issues have been exacerbated by the  irresponsible and catastrophic nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1.    It is obvious to anyone that the $150 billion given to Iran will be  used to fund more terror and further Iran's destructive ambitions. In  addition, the nuclear deal legitimizes Iran's ability to enrich uranium  and functionally ensures Iran's path to a nuclear weapon within 10  years. The deal is structured to mask Iran's inevitable noncompliance.   As a member of the Florida Legislature, I had supported Florida's  Iran divestment. As a Member of Congress, I very much look forward to  reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act.   I am extremely proud of President Trump and his administration for  enacting appropriate sanctions against Iranian officials who have been  engaged in the most recent destructive and destabilizing nuclear tests.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Americans, Israelis, and all citizens of  the world who aspire to peace continue to be harmed by the reckless and  irresponsible foreign policy of the past President's administration.  Former President Obama believed in a policy of appeasement toward Iran.  This is not dissimilar to the policies of appeasement that Neville  Chamberlain used when confronting the threats of Nazi Germany. But if  President Obama was America's Neville Chamberlain, perhaps his time has  given rise to Donald Trump and the opportunity to be America's Winston  Churchill.   I support President Trump's efforts to send a message to Iran that  ballistic missile testing will not be tolerated. Iran only understands  strength. For the last 8 years, they have seen from this country far  too much weakness and far too much willingness to accept their  destructive role in the world.   Mr. Speaker, the way Iran operates is through a series of franchises  for terror. Whether that is Hamas or Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen,  we see time and time again Iran acting as a neo-Persian, neo-Ottoman  Empire. That cannot be tolerated in a peaceful world. It cannot be  tolerated in the most dangerous neighborhood on Earth. It underscores  the purpose of Americans speaking with resolve and with strength in  condemning the most recent ballistic missile tests and in standing with  our greatest ally, Israel.   It was shameful that, in the waning hours of the Obama  administration, President Obama was willing to allow the United Nations  to take action against Israel while continuing its furtherance of  appeasement toward some of the most dangerous countries on the planet  Earth who do not share our values or our interests.   So I am glad to see an American reset, a resurgent America again  speaking to the great values that have functioned as a beacon of hope  for the world for generations. That is what we must return to, and that  is what President Trump is doing today. I applaud his administration. I  applaud his Secretary of the Treasury for stepping forward and  advancing these needed sanctions.   I am hopeful that this Congress will continue to take action to show  support for President Trump in this endeavor, but we must also  recognize that this is but a first step. So much damage has been done  to the cause of peace for the last 8 years under President Obama, and  we have much work to do in this Congress, whether it is rebuilding and  restoring our military so that we can be a force for peace, whether it  is making sure that our allies know that we will stand with them, or  whether it is making sure that our adversaries know that we are very  serious and there will be serious consequences for their bad behavior.   I am proud of this America that we are working toward together. I am  proud of these policies.   The gentleman from Texas may now wish to speak to the importance of  Americans speaking with a voice of clarity for peace, prosperity, and  strength throughout the Middle East and the world.    I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.   Isn't it refreshing to have a President of the United States who is  willing to do, in office, precisely the things he said he would do on  the campaign trail, notably, putting the interests of Americans and the  security of Americans first in a world that even former Secretary of  State George Shultz said is more dangerous and perilous today than the  highest tensions of the Cold War?                                time  1215    So to specifically answer the gentleman's question, I am grateful  that President Trump is prioritizing the security of Americans. My hope  is that in the 115th Congress, we will work with the President, with  his administration to ensure that, as we continue to mature these  policies and advance them, we do them in a way that is easily  understandable for those enforcing them and for the American people,  and that it sends a message to the world that America continues to be  the most generous country on the planet when it comes to welcoming  individuals who share our values and who aspire to be productive and  prosperous and inclusive.   What we have no tolerance for are those who would want to come to the  United States of America not to be part of the American experience, but  to destroy it. Too often that has not just been the fear that we have  felt from some who have been embedded by Daesh within refugees, but it  is exactly what is preached by the Government of Iran.   How silly of the United States to think that we would give hundreds  of billions of dollars to a nation that calls America the Great Satan,  that seeks to wipe Israel off of planet Earth, and believe that that  money will be used for peaceful purposes. It won't. Iran's desires for  expanded hegemony are not to stabilize the Middle East, they are  expressly to destabilize the Middle East. This regime in Iran will  never share America's values, so America should not be funding the very  destructive behavior that has done so much to harm the lives of so many  people.   The gentleman from Texas brings up a great point. If we hadn't  endured the  [[Page H968]]  policies of appeasement for the last 8 years, if America hadn't  withdrawn from the world stage so suddenly, then perhaps we would not  have the conditions in the Middle East that have made life so difficult  for people that they have wanted so badly to be refugees to Europe and  to the United States. We should want countries to succeed that are  willing to be stable and inclusive, but those who are our sworn  enemies, those who do not share our values should receive no quarter  from the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I have the great honor to serve on the House Committee  on Armed Services. We received briefings this week, thanks to Chairman  Thornberry, from General Petraeus and other national security experts.  They reinforced the fact that the world is dangerous as a consequence  of American withdrawal. I am grateful that the 115th Congress will  stand with President Trump in his agenda to rebuild our military, to  rebuild our standing, and to make very clear to the world that we will  be with you if you want peace. But if you aspire to spread terror,  there is no role for you on the global stage, and we will not do the  things to elevate those terrible regimes to any place of prominence.   This is a great time for revival and renewal in this country, and as  Americans do more to rebuild the country internally and grow our  economy and achieve more prosperity with lower and fairer taxes, with a  regulatory climate that is more acceptable for a prosperous country, we  also have to keep an eye on the world and our position on the global  stage. I think that it is refreshing that that is a time of revival and  restoration of American prominence, because the world is a safer place  when America is the strongest country in the world. President Trump's  actions today to create sanctions against those who have been directly  involved in ballistic missile tests send a clear message: We will stand  with our allies, and we will stand against the enemies of peace.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is from  Texas. I am from Florida. Both of our States have seen many of the  negative economic consequences of illegal immigration, but my question  relates to the negative national security consequences that result from  illegal immigration.    We are receiving more reports that ISIS, Daesh, other Islamic  fundamentalists are exploiting America's weakness on our southern  border with Mexico for their own economic gain, as well as to smuggle  people into the United States who may function as lone wolves or even  as a part of a coordinated terrorist attack against Americans.   So I would hope that the gentleman would speak to the  interconnectivity between the need for strong border security and a  wall on our southern border with Mexico and the risks posed by Islamic  fundamentalism.
