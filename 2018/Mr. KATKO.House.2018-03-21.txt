 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against domestic  violence and sexual abuse.   Domestic violence affects people from all backgrounds. Regardless of  race, religion, and socioeconomic background, domestic abuse touches  all aspects of our community.   According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly  20 people per minute are assaulted by an intimate partner. We must work  together to stop this.   Central New York is home to Vera House, a wonderful organization that  works to prevent and respond to domestic and sexual violence. This  month, it kicked off its 24th annual White Ribbon Campaign in central  New York. This campaign raises awareness for the need to put an end to  domestic violence and sexual abuse.   Throughout the duration of the White Ribbon Campaign, thousands of  central New Yorkers, such as myself, will be wearing a white ribbon or  a white wristband to stand in solidarity against abuse.   I urge my House colleagues to join me in wearing a white ribbon to  demonstrate a personal pledge to work towards preventing violence  against men, women, and children.                            ____________________
