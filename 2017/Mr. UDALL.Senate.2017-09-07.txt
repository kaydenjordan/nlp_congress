 Mr. President, thank you for your recognition. I am  honored to come here today and follow Senator Leahy and Senator Kaine  and their speeches on DACA. I have also watched over the last couple of  days, and I think almost every Democratic Senator has been down to the  floor to speak with passion about this issue. I am just so proud of our  caucus and our Members who have stood up and called the President on  this issue.   Today, I stand with millions of Americans protesting the President's  heartless decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program known as DACA. This inhumane and cruel decision threatens the  hopes and aspirations of our country's young Dreamers, and there is no  doubt it will harm the economy. I call on all Members of Congress-- especially the Republican leadership--to act now and to act swiftly to  keep families together and allow these kids to realize their huge  potential by making DACA the law of the land. That is what we need to  do, make DACA the law of the land. If the President will not do the  right thing, then Congress must take action and Congress must do this.   Democrats, Republicans, and Independents across New Mexico and  throughout our country agree that Dreamers deserve to live and work in  the United States. According to a Morning Consult-Politico poll  released this week, 76 percent support allowing them to stay--76  percent Democrats, Republicans, Independents. What a big number.   Most Americans agree that our Nation benefits from the contribution  immigrants make in our communities and our economy. They believe our  government should honor its promise to Dreamers. Many of these young  people came here as small children and have not known any other  country.   Take Roxana. Roxana came to Santa Fe, NM, when she was 1 year old.  She is now 22. She registered with DACA as soon as she could. She  completed the paperwork, paid the fee, and she has complied with all of  the requirements. She now works as a medical assistant with La Familia  Medical Center in Santa Fe. La Familia is a great healthcare clinic. It  provides excellent medical care to everyone in Santa Fe, including many  immigrants and low-income patients.   Roxana loves her work at La Familia, and she loves being able to help  her fellow immigrants. Roxana had plans to go to nursing school, but  the President's action to end DACA jeopardizes those plans and puts  them on hold. In Roxana's words, ``Santa Fe, NM, is my home. It's where  I know people. It's where I've lived. It's where I've gone to school.  It's where I've grown up. It's my life. It's something that is mine but  doesn't truly belong to me.''   Those are her words. We must give Roxana and the hundreds of  thousands of Dreamers what should truly belong to them.    Dreamers more than pull their economic weight in our country; 97  percent are employed or are in school or do both. They work in Fortune  500 companies and public schools. They labor on farms and dairies. They  create businesses, volunteer in our communities, pay taxes, and pay  into Social Security and Medicare. Why would we choose to kick some of  our most talented and most productive workers out of the country? Why  kick some of our best and brightest young people out of this country?   Ending DACA would cause chaos for employers. Forcing these motivated  young people out of work could cost us 700,000 jobs--as many as 30,000  a month. That adds up to $460.3 billion in economic output over the  next 10 years. Medicare and Social Security contributions could drop by  $24.6 billion over the same period of time.   One of those young people who contributes in New Mexico is Brandon.  Brandon came with his mother from Mexico to the United States when he  [[Page S5042]]  was 2 years old. Brandon goes to college and studies every day to be an  architect, and he makes straight A's. He holds down a job to help  support his family with medical bills and volunteers in his community.  Brandon is grateful for the DACA Program that has given him the  opportunity to work and pay taxes. Yes, he is grateful to pay taxes.   This President continues to divide our country like no other  President we have known. Every day it is clear that his values are not  in line with ours. I increasingly believe he is not fit to lead this  great Nation.   His campaign began with anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric. He  accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists and criminals, and his  bigoted words have never stopped. He called for a wall along the entire  border with Mexico--a wall that would cost billions of tax dollars and  which border communities don't want. He called for a ban on Muslim  refugees--turning our backs on people who are fighting terrorism and  who value the freedoms that we have here in the United States. He  tacitly accepted the support of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and bigots  in Charlottesville. He pardoned a law enforcement officer who  terrorized the Latino community in Maricopa County, AZ, with  unconstitutional raids and who forced detainees into inhumane living  situations. Joe Arpaio is not a ``good guy'' as President Trump called  him. Joe Arpaio is the criminal.   This President doesn't seem to value--let alone embody--the  principles that America stands for, and now he wants to kick out of the  country young people who do value this country--like Carlos.   Carlos was brought to New Mexico from Mexico when he was less than 1  year old. New Mexico is the only home he has known. Because of Carlos's  immigration status, his opportunities were limited. He couldn't play  sports in school, couldn't go on field trips, even though he pledged  allegiance to the United States with his classmates.   Carlos registered with DACA 2 years ago and, in his words, he was  given wings. He is a full-time student at New Mexico State University,  studying to be a mechanical engineer. He volunteers as a firefighter.  He works as a server at a local restaurant. He began a drive to help  Hurricane Harvey victims. Carlos says:         We as DREAMers have proven ourselves to be worthy of being       here in the United States.    There are 800,000 young people like Roxana, Brandon, and Carlos  hoping to do their part to make our country strong. By any measure,  DACA has been a huge success. We already have the outlines of a program  that works for America. We in Congress must roll up our sleeves and  make this program the law of the land, and we must make sure that  America truly does belong to Roxana and all of our Dreamers.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
