 Mr. President, today, as the ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I wish to recognize  America's small business development centers, SBDC, and the vital role  this national business assistance and counseling network plays in  supporting economic development, job creation, and success at our Main  Street small businesses.   The mission of the nationwide SBDC network is to help America's  entrepreneurs realize the dream of businessownership and assist  existing small businesses in adapting to the changing marketplace and  compete in the global economy.   SBDCs are hosted by universities, colleges, and State economic  development agencies and funded in part by our Small Business  Administration. There are nearly 1,000 SBDC service centers and 4,000  SBDC consultants available to provide free and low-cost business  consulting and training to help entrepreneurs write a business plan,  access capital, market their products, and recover when a disaster  strikes.   SBDCs offer a great return on investment for taxpayers. It is  estimated that SBDC small business clients create a new job every 5  minutes and a new business every 30 minutes and generate $100,000 in  capital every 10 minutes. Job growth for SBDC clients is more than 14  times higher than job growth for an average business.   Last year, the Maryland SBDC at the University of Maryland in College  Park assisted almost 8,000 businesses, counseled 2,200 entrepreneurs,  and helped train nearly 5,700 businessowners. Small business services  provided by the Maryland SBDC led to the creation of 208 businesses and  1,251 jobs and access to $49 million in capital.  [[Page S1874]]    Behind the statistics are real Marylanders who realized their small  business dream with the help of an SBDC consultant, like a women-owned  restaurant in Baltimore called Flavor.   In 2015, Julia and Vanna Belton went to their local SBDC office for  help securing a business loan. After months of tinkering with their  business plan and adjusting their loan paperwork, their SBDC consultant  guided Julia and Vanna to approval on an $800,000 SBA loan they used to  purchase and renovate a building for their restaurant.   Today, the restaurant has $1.2 million in revenue and 30 full and  part-time employees. Last year, they were named Maryland's ``2017  Women-owned Business of the Year.''   Flavor is just one of the millions of small businesses and  entrepreneurs who have been touched by America's Small business  development centers over the last 35 years. I ask my colleagues to join  me in recognizing the dedicated men and women of America's small  business development center network and to thank them for their  commitment to the small businesses that drive the American economy.   Thank you.                            ____________________
