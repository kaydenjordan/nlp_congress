 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to oppose the  Healthy Texas Women Medicaid waiver program, which is nothing more than  a reckless attack on reproductive rights.   The ironically titled Healthy Texas Women program blocks Medicaid  beneficiaries from getting care at providers that offer abortion  services, like Planned Parenthood. This does nothing to expand access  to family planning care. It will harm low-income women who rely on  Medicaid for their healthcare.   When Texas excluded Planned Parenthood from State funding 7 years  ago, 45,000 fewer women accessed care. We cannot stand for that. This  waiver program will hurt women of color the most, who already  experience health disparities and barriers to access.   Mr. Speaker, I will not stop fighting to protect a woman's right to  make her own decisions about her healthcare, and I urge the Congress to  do the same.                            ____________________
