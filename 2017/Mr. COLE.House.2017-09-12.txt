 Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 504, as the  designee of Mr. Frelinghuysen, I offer amendments en bloc No. 4.    Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.  DeLauro), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education approved this list of  amendments last week, along with myself, and was looking forward to  discussing them and others with all of us here today.   Unfortunately, the gentlewoman is not able to be here this week due  to the death of her beloved mother, Luisa DeLauro, who passed away over  the weekend at the age of 103.  [[Page H7276]]    The gentlewoman from Connecticut and I have something in common on  this point: neither of us would likely be a Member of this body today  were it not for the inspiration and role model of our mothers, both of  whom were actively involved in local politics.   Like my own late mother, Helen Cole, who served in the Oklahoma House  and Senate and as mayor of our home town of Moore, Oklahoma, Luisa  DeLauro served 35 years as a member of the New Haven, Connecticut,  Board of Aldermen, the longest tenure in the city's history. She served  with six different mayors and dedicated her time to improving the lives  of seniors and the working poor.   Her daughter has most certainly followed in her footsteps, bringing  her passion, dedication, and tirelessness for these same causes to the  Halls of Congress.   We are sorry the gentlewoman cannot be with us today. We know she is  honoring her mother and her mother's legacy, and making her mother  proud of her work here.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Denham), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), my friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by saying how much I,  frankly, appreciate the gentleman's amendment.   Many programs in this bill, frankly, were eliminated or substantially  reduced to stay within the allocation, which, as I know my good friend  knows, was $5 billion below the FY 2017 enacted level. Some other  programs, including job training programs for youth, were reduced by  relatively modest amounts, again, to stay within the allocation. The  total amount in the bill for youth job training grants is $832 million,  a reduction over last year of just 4.5 percent.   While I support the job training grants and programs in question, I  oppose the amendment out of concern that the offset to the Department  of Labor's administration account will be too hard to absorb, including  the administrative reductions already included in the bill.   I will commit to my friend that we will try to work with him through  the process and see if there is some way that we can get these funds  restored going forward.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking my friend for the  amendment, quite frankly. And while I understand and share many of the  gentleman's concerns, most of the accounts that this amendment reduces  have already been reduced in the bill. The allocations we are working  on required us to find efficiencies and savings wherever possible.   I believe that cutting the administrative accounts in this amendment  by another 10 percent would unnecessarily increase the risk of  significant disruption of services, and oversight responsibility the  agencies in this bill are charged with.   While I oppose the amendment for these reasons, I want to pledge to  my friend that I will continue to work with him and others to identify  specific areas where additional efficiencies and savings can be  realized. And I know my friend also feels strongly about entitlement  reform, where the real money is, and I look forward to working with him  on that as well.   But in the meantime, Mr. Chairman, I must urge the rejection of the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend, the distinguished ranking member of  the full Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by saying how much I regret-- I know my friend regrets that our good friend wasn't here to offer her  amendment here this evening, and I appreciate my good friend from  Wisconsin stepping up and doing that. He is a very valued member of  this subcommittee, and one who contributes mightily to its  deliberations.   I certainly understand the concern of some with the relatively modest  reductions in this bill at labor enforcement agencies at the Department  of Labor. It has been the subcommittee's policy for many years to  protect workers' health and safety by increasing funding for compliance  assistance, and reducing enforcement activities. That is exactly what  this bill actually does.   I appreciate that the subcommittee has had to reduce funding for many  programs in the bill to work within its allocation. My concern with  this amendment is the substantial offset of the department management  funds at the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education.   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I  agree that worker safety is one of the  [[Page H7281]]  Department of Labor's most important functions. I think, however, we  just disagree on the most effective ways the Federal Government can  help with that effort. This bill actually increases compliance  assistance programs at the OSHA to do just that, so I will oppose the  gentleman's amendment which would offset the increases to OSHA  enforcement by reducing critical compliance assistance efforts that  many of our Members strongly support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment, and  I certainty support the Women's Bureau at the Department of Labor.   Many programs in this bill were eliminated or substantially reduced  to stay within our allocation. In contrast, the Women's Bureau was  reduced by a relatively modest $1 million. The administration budget  request proposed reducing the Women's Bureau by $8.5 million, clearly a  reduction the committee did not agree with in the bill.   I understand the importance of many of these programs, and these are  some of the difficult decisions that have to be made to fund bipartisan  priorities in this bill like increases in funding to the NIH and to  TRIO and yet still stay within our allocation. I expect and hope that  as the process moves forward and we negotiate a bipartisan funding  agreement, we will have further discussions regarding the funding of  the Women's Bureau.   Mr. Chairman, I regret having to oppose the gentlewoman's amendment  at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I do  not object to it.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment has no net impact  on the funding of the bill, so I do not oppose the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from New York, representing  the gentlewoman from New Mexico, raises a very important point.   The amendment offered is for an increase to a workforce training  program. Our committee understands the value of this program, which is  why we did not accept the administration's budget request which  actually terminated the program. We were able to fund it, though, below  last year's level.   Our committee received an allocation that was lower than fiscal year  2017, and as I have explained several times before and doubtless will  again, we had to make some very tough decisions. I do pledge to work  with the gentlewoman as we work toward the fiscal year 2018 final bill.  At this time, though, I must oppose the amendment and urge its  rejection.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, frankly, there is considerable merit to the  amendment the gentlewoman is suggesting.   The amendment offered is for an increase to the workforce training  program. Our committee understands the value of this program, which is  why we did not accept the administration's budget request, which  terminated the program. We were able to fund it, though, below last  year's level. However, I will certainly commit to my friend that we  will work with her as we go through the process toward the final bill,  and hopefully we can find a way to increase this at a later time.   At this time, however, Mr. Chairman, I must oppose the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend for his amendment.  I wish I could support it, quite frankly, because I very much support  Healthy Start and very much appreciate his support for that program.  [[Page H7284]]    As the gentleman knows, again, our subcommittee received an  allocation below last year's level. As a result, we did not have the  ability to increase funding for some programs, this one included.   The gentleman's amendment offsets the increase with a reduction in  the resources for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry  out his responsibilities. A reduction of this size would hinder the  Secretary's ability to administer the program effectively. For this  reason, I oppose the amendment.   I want to assure my friend, as we work our way through this process,  I am going to try and work with him to see if we can find a way to  actually increase those funds, but at this point, we simply don't have  them available.   For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have considerable sympathy with my friend's  concerns. Frankly, I think he has certainly every right to be concerned  about a hospital in his district. I certainly agree with an effort to  put additional funding for the opioid epidemic, for pediatric cancer,  and for Alzheimer's disease. These are all critical issues facing our  country.   Nevertheless, I must oppose the amendment. The bill actually includes  $126 million within the CDC for surveillance and prevention of opioid  misuse, which continues the large increase provided in fiscal year  2017. The bill also provides a $1.1 billion increase for the National  Institutes of Health, which includes a targeted increase of $400  million for research on Alzheimer's disease, as well as increases for  each institute center, including the National  [[Page H7285]]  Cancer Institute, to support vital research on disease such as  pediatric cancer.   Furthermore, the bill also continues to provide funds authorized in  the 21st Century Cures Act, including $300 million for the Cancer  Moonshot, and $500 million for opioid abuse.   Finally, the reduction of funding at CMS proposed by my friend would  weaken the agency's ability to properly manage and administer Medicare  and Medicaid. So for that reason, I must oppose my friend's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman for working  with us on this, and I want to assure that we will work with her. I  appreciate her concern for the Community Services Block Grant program.  As my good friend from New York knows, that program was actually zeroed  out in the administration's budget. We replaced $600 million of $715  million, but it clearly is an important program to many Members on both  sides of the aisle, has a superb reputation, and we are going to do  everything that we possibly can to build upon that and get back to at  least the fiscal year 2017 level.   The gentlewoman's leadership in this is greatly appreciated, and we  look forward to working with her as we go forward.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I wish to advise my friend we certainly  intend to accept his amendment, and I look forward to working with him  as we go forward on the bill. I think there are some other areas where  we can increase funding, as well, that would fit with my friend's  objective.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern. She  is a very valuable member of the subcommittee. This is an area in which  she not only has considerable passion, but considerable expertise.  However, as the gentlewoman also knows, we have an allocation well  below last year's level, and we had to make, again, a difficult  decision.   Reduction of this magnitude of the Health and Human Services'  administrative functions would eliminate the core funding for the  Secretary's office completely, and for that reason I would oppose the  amendment.   However, I want the gentlewoman and, certainly, our good mutual  friend from Connecticut whom she is representing tonight to know that,  as we work with our colleagues in the Senate on a bill to reach the  President's desk, I intend to work on these issues with her and with my  friends on both sides of the aisle to address the concerns that she  raised in her remarks.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.  [[Page H7287]]    Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Olson) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 3354) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior,  environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2018, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman and want to begin by  acknowledging that my very good friend is the recognized expert in this  House on all matters related to mental health and has probably done  more on behalf of this cause than anybody in this Chamber in very many  years. So it is with great reluctance that I opposed this particular  amendment, earlier, when we actually accepted.   But the amendment increases funding for programs currently funded at  $15 million, the same as last year. As my friend knows, our committee  actually received an allocation that was lower than last year, and we  had limited resources to provide increases.   But in recognition of the importance of the Assisted Outpatient  Treatment Program, my committee maintained funding for the program at  its current levels.   I want to assure my friend, I intend to work with him during the  process as we negotiate with the Senate. I would expect we probably  will have a different allocation. We may be able to revisit this issue,  and I would hope that we can, and certainly will, work with my friend.   But at this time, I simply must oppose the amendment so we can stay  within our current allocation.   Madam Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Chair, I don't rise to oppose. I just wanted to  commend my friend for bringing this issue and highlighting it. We think  it is very important.   We wanted to note that we support what he is trying to do. We  certainly accept the amendment, and we look forward to working with him  through the process to help achieve the objectives that he stated.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Simpson) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mitchell, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern for  programs that support vulnerable seniors. Frankly, my committee has  provided increases for these programs in prior years because, like her,  we understand how valuable and important they are to keeping seniors  independent in their homes.   As the gentlewoman knows, our subcommittee received an allocation  below last year's level, and we were not in a position to provide  another year of increases to these programs. The amendment reduces the  administration funds available to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services. A reduction of this magnitude would significantly hinder the  Secretary's ability to administer the agency.   For this reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concern. He  raises, I think, a genuinely important issue.   Our committee understands the value of the Behavioral Health  Workforce Education and Training program, which is why we did not  accept the administration's budget request which actually canceled the  program.   Our committee, as my friend knows, received an allocation that was  lower than fiscal year 2017, so we had to make some tough decisions. I  want my friend to know we will work with him going forward and see if  we can arrive at a solution that he finds more satisfactory in the  final bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for the amendment and  for working with our good friend who couldn't be here tonight to make  sure that this issue that I know she cares deeply about and I know my  friend cares deeply about is raised.   I tell the gentlewoman that I will continue work with her as we move  forward in the appropriations process this year. I hope we can reach an  agreement, particularly in this area.   I understand the gentlelady's frustration with finding a large enough  offset to accommodate the increase she proposes. However, her amendment  would actually reduce resources for the Department of Education by  nearly a quarter. I think this would jeopardize the Department's  ability to administer the very program she seeks to increase.   So I will reluctantly oppose the amendment at this time. I believe  the offset within the Department of Education administrative account is  just simply too much.   Again, I want to reiterate to my friend that I look forward to  working with her as we go forward and perhaps receiving a different  allocation under a House-Senate agreement in the future.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.  [[Page H7294]]     Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Chairman, having yielded to people on both sides of the  debate, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman, quite  sincerely, for his amendment. And again, as I will oft repeat tonight,  as the gentleman knows, we had to cut $5 billion from this bill, and we  had to make some genuinely tough choices.   In this case, we accepted the President's recommended funding level  for magnet schools, and we were also able to increase charter schools,  though not by as much as the President requested. Charter schools have  demonstrated effectiveness in providing a real choice in quality  education for millions of students around the country.   If we have a change in our allocation in conference, I will gladly  take another look at the magnet school program to evaluate additional  funding there. I think my friend makes a very good case on their  behalf; however, at this time, simply because of reasons of allocation,  I will oppose the amendment because the offset reduces charter school  grants, which I strongly support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I disagree with my friend about charter schools.  Actually, charter schools have provided enormous opportunity for  children of every race, every ethnic background. They have been  particularly effective, I think, in minority areas, so I reject any  suggestion that the decisions we made had anything to do with race or  racism or that the charter school movement is involved in that. I just  don't think that is the case.   But I do agree in the importance of magnet schools, and if we get a  different allocation, we are going to sit down and work with our  friends to see  [[Page H7295]]  if we can also make some progress in that area. But at this time, I am  going to continue to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to assure my friend I certainly don't take the  amendment as an attack on charter schools any more than I accept the  idea that, by funding charter schools, we are involved in promoting  racial segregation. That is not what we are trying to do here. We have  a genuine debate over the best vehicles to go forward.   I happen to think both these vehicles are good vehicles. I have seen  what the charter school movement, frankly, has meant in New Orleans,  what it has meant in this city, the opportunities that it has opened to  thousands and thousands of students of all racial backgrounds.   And the administration, as my friend knows, has put a particular  emphasis here. And while we increase funding, we are not anywhere close  to what the administration wanted to do. So I want to reiterate to my  friend from Connecticut that we intend to work with him if we have an  allocation change where we can find some additional resources, because  I think he makes a very good point, and I very much value the  contributions that magnet schools also have made to try to improve  educational outcomes across the spectrum for our students.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking my friend from  Minnesota for the amendment. I am a big fan of career and technical  education, and, frankly, along with the State of Ohio, Oklahoma  probably has the most robust and strongest career technical education  program of any State in the country. It is actually something we fund  ourselves, for the most part. I would recommend other people do the  same.   I am also, you know, frankly, as my friend knows, dealing with a cut  of $5 billion from the bill. In this case, the gentleman seeks to cut  TRIO funding to pay for his amendment. In my opinion, it is totally  misguided.   Since the TRIO program began, it has produced over 5 million college  graduates, and those college graduates were almost exclusively from  families where no one had ever had the opportunity to go.   This is a proven successful program. It has helped literally millions  of first generations of college students, so I strongly support TRIO  and will not support cuts in this program; so I, therefore, oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It has been a good and robust debate, but I don't think it has been a  particularly partisan debate. As a matter of fact, I see people on both  sides of the aisle that actually have both solutions. My friend, Mr.  Scott, may have the best solution of all: let's plus-up both of these  programs because they both do a lot of good.   But, in this case, I don't think you make one the enemy of the other.  I have seen TRIO programs work, and I have seen how many jobs they  produce. We are not serving anywhere close to the population eligible  for TRIO. Somewhere less than 10 percent of the eligible students  actually take advantage of the program.   Again, my State invests very heavily, probably more heavily than most  other States that I would suggest do the same thing Ohio and Oklahoma  have done. And these programs which my friend rightly champions, I have  seen people actually raise their own taxes so they could have a career  or technical institute.   So I think there is merit to both of these approaches. But I do also  think 5 million college graduates from people who did not have the  chance to go is something this country ought to think about. The  statistics tell us each of those graduates in a lifetime earn $1  million more than they would have. I promise you, the Federal  Government will get its share of that million dollars.   This is a program that has paid for itself over and over again.  Perhaps as we go forward, we can find other ways to help both of these  programs capitalize on their potential.   So while I agree with the objective my friend is trying to achieve, I  don't agree in achieving it at the expense of TRIO or GEAR UP.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin is a good  friend. We serve on the Budget Committee together, and, frankly, I know  how sincere his concern about the issues that he lays out is. I know  how hard he fought on that committee, and oftentimes we were unlikely  allies in a number of places.                                time  2015    So I know this is a passion and a sincere commitment. I remind my  friend, he knows I know he would have preferred more, but this bill is  $5 billion less than it was last year. He certainly had some success,  and success that I agree with, but in this particular case, if I  understand the gentleman's amendment correctly, it would basically cut  education administration by $43 million, a roughly 10 percent cut  across the board in the administrative areas.   Or is it just a 2 percent cut in everything?    I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Okay. But substantial reductions, and in programs that have  already been cut. So for that reason, I would oppose my friend's  additional cuts, but I would hope to work with him going forward in  something that I know he knows is a far greater driver of our debt, and  that is entitlement reform. That is where the money is.   We end up fighting every year over discretionary accounts that are  relatively minor compared to the behemoths of Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, and the other so-called mandatory programs. They  are only mandatory because Congress doesn't have the courage to pick up  the law and actually deal with them. So I am going to work with my  friend in that area because I know he is sincere.   In this case, I feel compelled to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), a member of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to begin by thanking my friend. We are  classmates, we are friends, and we have served on the Budget Committee  together. So I know the commitment to fiscal responsibility is serious  and continuing and real. I particularly want to thank her for her kind  words about the work of the committee in recent years because we  genuinely have tried to continuously lower the amounts of money.   My friend makes a very good point about the dangers we face in terms  of a skyrocketing national debt, but as my friend suggests, we have  already cut this more than 1 percent. I am not suggesting there aren't  areas that can be cut additionally. There probably are. But as an  appropriator, we prefer to look at things individually, one at a time,  because there are always areas that could be plussed-up as well.   I don't think anybody here really wants to cut money, even 1 percent,  from cancer funding or Alzheimer's research or Pell grants or programs  that we think actually help folks have an educational choice, like  charter schools, and yet that is always the impact of an across-the- board cut. You cut things that need to be cut, for sure, but you also  cut some things that probably shouldn't be.   So we would prefer to continue the approach that my friend has  singled out and said that seems to work well, and we will do that, and  I know she will be helpful in that.   I also know my friend knows that the real drivers of our debt,  frankly, are Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, all entitlement  programs, our mandatory spending programs. And that is where folks on  both sides of the aisle, I think, need to get very, very serious, and  the administration. Because we are never going to get to a balanced  budget that I know my friend wants to achieve and I want to achieve  until we put 70 percent of all spending, which is the entitlement  spending, on the table for serious examination to be dealt with.   I don't oppose the goals of my friend. I just have a different method  of trying to achieve them. So far, in the last 3 years, we have been  able to do that. We are going to continue to try and do that going  forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), who is my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to, again, thank my good friend for,  as he always does, raising important issues, and I appreciate his  bringing attention to the mental health of children.   The amendment offered--and this is an important point I think many  Members in this body don't think about--is actually for a newly  authorized program that has not received funding in the past, and our  committee actually has a smaller allocation than it had last year. I  think most of the public doesn't realize it, and it is sort of helpful,  frankly, for my friend to advance this amendment. Just because  something moves through an authorizing committee doesn't mean any money  comes with it.   Now, in some cases--my friend worked on the Cures bill--they sent  money with portions of that on the opioid initiatives, some additional  money at NIH, and, of course, every penny of that has moved in. They  found a way to fund it. But we can end up in a situation where you just  simply pile on authorizations and send us less money and think we will  somehow work it out. Sometimes we do. That is why we have been able to  steadily increase funding at NIH, steadily increase funding for  programs like TRIO and GEAR UP, and steadily increase money for charter  schools. There are some areas we have been able to do that, but we  can't do it everyplace.   I want to tell my friend that, while I oppose the amendment, I am  certainly going to work with him. Actually, I asked him not too long  ago to give me the one thing that is the most important thing, and he  mentioned the lack of trained and qualified personnel, that we could  have a lot of programs, but until we had a bigger pool of people  capable of rendering the services, then we simply are going to be  moving from program to program. I think that was a very good point, and  it is why I accepted my friend's amendment for $10 million to begin to  do that. That is another area. I think we have to pick a few pressure  points here.   I agree with what my friend is offering here in terms of the need for  emphasis. We just simply have to work harder either getting the funds  or finding other places to take the funds from.   So while I oppose the amendment, I want to be very clear that I  intend to work with my friend going forward.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), who is my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I agree with my friend on the  basic point, but this, too, is a program that was authorized with no  funding.   The things we got funding for in the 21st Century Cures Act, we  funded to the penny. Frankly, things we didn't get funding for, we  still authorized.   This is one of those cases where, again, the cause is worthy, and we  are willing to work with the gentleman--and we will certainly continue  to do that--but a lot of these things that my friend just mentioned are  from programs that were authorized by non-appropriations committees. We  don't create the programs.   That is where my friends, frankly, on the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Ways and Means Committee need to spend some time.  They need to spend some time deauthorizing certain programs that  continue.   Again, I will work with my friend if our allocation changes or we can  find additional savings. But I can't willy-nilly, particularly when we  have already cut these administrative programs, partly in the en bloc  amendment, to fund some of the very things, including my friend's  amendment, that we felt were very worthy. We will look at this.   The other thing that I would hope we could do is work with our  friends on the other side of the aisle. I will just tell you, from a  conference standpoint, when you go to a conference with a program that  has been authorized but not funded, it is extremely difficult to get  the other body to join in with you. That is just the reality.   Every decision involves taking something away. It is always easy to  call something administration or nonvital. That is what it looks like  in the phrase. That may or may not be what it is in the program. So it  is just a more difficult exercise than I think most folks understand.   My friend's point is still the right one. One of the reasons I look  very carefully at this one is because I see it as a multiplier, in  terms of the professional shortage of people that we have that my  friend has pointed to.   Mr. Chairman, again, I reluctantly oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding and for his  excellent work in this area.   Yes, we would look forward to that. Frankly, we have pretty regular  exchanges with a lot of the committees under our jurisdiction where  they have done the hard work of authorizing an investigation. That can  be used to guide appropriations.   So I look forward to working with my friend to make sure we can  eliminate the type of abuses that he is talking about and redirect  funds where they need to go for the care of patients.   I thank my friend for his work and his kind words, and I certainly  pledge that I will work with him going forward, as I have in the past.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment, and I  know the sincerity of his view on the issue.   This amendment, in my view, mirrors, to some degree, the last  administration's regulation on so-called Fair Play and Safe Workplaces,  also known as a blacklisting rule, which has recently been withdrawn.   There are existing requirements for reporting and addressing  violations of labor laws by Federal contractors. Indeed, hundreds of  companies every year are barred from doing business with the Federal  Government.   While bad actors certainly should face consequences, I believe  blanket prohibitions circumvent proper administrative review under the  existing procedures. Agencies already have many requirements related to  the award of Federal contracts, and imposing a new across-the-board  requirement, in my view, is not the right approach to address this  issue.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I urge its rejection.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Gibbs) having assumed the chair, Mr. Arrington, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
