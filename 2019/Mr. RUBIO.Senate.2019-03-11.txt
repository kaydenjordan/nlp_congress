 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit.  Today, it is my distinct pleasure to name Miami Tour Company as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2002, Miami Tour Company has quickly become a premier  provider of tours and activities in south Florida. Husband and wife,  Gus and Michelle Moore, founded the company based on the principle of  providing the best customer experience possible. Gus and Michelle met  while working at a restaurant and bonded over a shared passion for  making sure that visitors to their home State have a great experience.  After serving thousands of hungry patrons and learning how to make  visitors to Miami as happy as possible, Gus and Michelle decided to  start a business. With their combined knowledge of the area and a knack  for anticipating their customer's needs, a tour company was the perfect  fit. With their savings from working at the restaurant, the couple  [[Page S1760]]  bought a tour bus, and the Miami Tour Company was born.   Seventeen years later, Miami Tour Company has grown to transport  35,000 passengers annually and have served more than 600,000 clientele.  Their fleet now includes motorcoaches, mini-buses, vans, SUVs, shuttle  buses, and boat tours. The company's local guides run day tours through  Key West, Orlando, the Everglades, and Miami Beach. They have also  instituted a GPS-guided system in their tour buses that triggers high- quality digital voice recordings at locations of interest, making them  the only tour company in Florida to offer this technology. To expand  their customer base, the company has begun offering the recordings in  Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, French, Italian, German, and Russian,  allowing visitors from around the world to enjoy the attractions that  Florida has to offer.   On top of providing enjoyable and informative tours, Miami Tour  Company gives back to their community. They guide local elementary  students on free historical bus tours throughout Miami and offer  students free eco-tourism trips to the Everglades. They also give back  to their community by providing complimentary travel charters for  activities for the children and families of Sophia's Hope. In addition,  they donate portions of their proceeds to the Miami Beach Holocaust  Memorial and the Miami Beach Botanical Gardens. Miami Tour Company has  been a true small business success story. Their dedication to  hospitality has been recognized with an A-plus rating from the Better  Business Bureau and a Certificate of Excellence from online reviewers.   Gus and Michelle's commitment to an exceptional customer experience  represents the standard of hospitality with which Florida small  businesses are known for. Companies like Miami Tour Company are one of  the many reasons that visitors enjoy south Florida and keep coming  back. I would like to congratulate Gus, Michelle, and all of the  employees at Miami Tour Company for being named the Senate Small  Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to  watching their continued growth and success.                            ____________________
