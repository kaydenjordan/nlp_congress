 Mr. President, 10 years ago today, CPL Benjamin Kopp's  spirit departed from this world, but he remains with us in far more  than memory.   Ben was raised in Minnesota, where his mother described him as a  boy's boy. He played in the dirt with toy trucks and revered his great- grandfather, a decorated veteran from World War II.   Then came 9/11, which changed Ben's life forever, just as it changed  the lives of so many Americans. Ben was only 13--little more than a  boy--but on that day of tragedy, he felt the call of duty to his  country. Moreover, he sensed a rendezvous with destiny. Remembering his  great-grandfather, the heroic veteran, Ben enlisted in the U.S. Army at  the age of 18, shipping off for basic training at Fort Benning not long  after his high school graduation. There, he grew into a man and an Army  Ranger. He was assigned to fight with the Army's famed 75th Ranger  Regiment.   He served two deployments in Iraq and then went to Afghanistan in  2009. There, Ben and his buddies were exposed to heavy combat, as  Rangers usually are. On June 10, 2009, they were engaged in an hours- long, intense firefight with Taliban insurgents in Helmand Province.  Ben was leading a machine gun crew, providing suppressive fire for a  group of Rangers amid enemy onslaught. Ben exposed himself and was shot  behind the knee right in an artery. He was evacuated from the  battlefield and placed in an induced coma.   Despite the surgeon's best efforts, Ben never recovered from the loss  of blood and cardiac arrest he had suffered. Eight days later, on July  18, 2009, at the age of only 21, at Walter Reed Medical Center, Ben  Kopp returned home to the Lord. Yet Ben is with us still. The heart of  this Ranger beats on even today. Let me explain.   Before deploying, Ben did a lot of paperwork, as all soldiers do. On  one form, he checked the box to be an organ donor. Where it asked which  organs he wished to donate, he simply wrote ``any that are needed.'' In  death, as in life, Ben lived up to the Ranger creed. He shouldered more  than his share of the task, ``one-hundred-percent and then some.'' So  just 2 days after Ben's heart stopped beating, it beat anew in the  chest of Judy Meikle, an Illinois woman who waited 7 months just to get  on the organ donation list. ``How can you have a better heart,'' Judy  said as she recovered. ``I have the heart of a 21-year-old Army Ranger  war hero beating in me.''   Ultimately, scores of people came to benefit from the sacrifice of  this young soldier in Minnesota from his very blood and bones. Four  lives were saved, all told, because Ben gave his all, his very body,  for their sake. Ben departed 10 years ago, but his legacy lives on in  the patients whose lives he touched and through the brave work of his  mother, Jill, who has devoted her life to veterans' causes. This year,  she organized the second annual Freedom Walk to the Wall and challenged  America to walk 1 million miles in honor of our fallen heroes.    The tragedy of Ben's loss has touched Jill in unexpected ways as  well. She has remained close with the Army Rangers who served alongside  Ben and even with those who had never met him. Just recently, two  freshly minted Rangers from Minnesota reached out to speak with Jill.  You could say that she lost her son but gained a family of Rangers.   In Genesis, it is written that the Lord God created Eve in the rib of  Adam, the first man. When God brought her to Adam, He said, ``This is  now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.'' That mysterious passage  takes on new meaning when we reflect on stories like Ben's.   Thanks to his willing sacrifice, Ben connected with scores of his  countrymen in one of the most intimate ways imaginable. For all time,  they will remain bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh. Rangers lead  the way. That is what new Rangers learn at Fort Benning. In life and in  death, CPL Ben Kopp led the way, and his story will inspire us for many  years to come, for, indeed, he is with us still.   I yield the floor.
