 Madam Speaker, in our first 200 days in this  Congress, we have passed an incredible amount of legislation to root  out corruption, protect healthcare, and combat the opioid epidemic.   Unfortunately, most of it, though, has died in the legislative  graveyard of the Senate at the hands of Mitch McConnell.   Now, there have been rare moments, like the 9/11 Victim Compensation  Fund, where we have managed to do the right thing.   But as we prepare to go back for a month of work outside of these  Chambers, I ask one simple question: Where is our infrastructure bill?  Because my constituents at home are sick and tired of their commute;  sick and tired of their bridges and their roads that are falling apart.   So I put this question to each and every Member of the House,  leadership in both parties, and the President himself.   Let's get the job done. Let's pass a real infrastructure bill.   And you know what? If the Republicans do not want to play ball, if  they don't even want to sit at the table with us, then let's pass  something out of this Chamber and put a very simple question to the  Senate, a very simple question to the President of the United States:  Whose side are you on?   Are you on the side of the lobbyists, the corporate PACs, the  wealthiest amongst us?   Or are you finally on the side of the hardworking Americans that you  try to speak to every few years during election season?                            ____________________
