 Too often, Mr. Speaker, we skip over the fundamental  principle and precept and driver of the Second Amendment, so let's  reaffirm our faith here.   Our Founders were determined to fight against their own government  for our freedom and independence. They stated unequivocally that when  there was a train of abuses and usurpations, and the citizens were  reduced to absolute despotism, it was our right and our duty to throw  off that government.   We wouldn't have these United States, we wouldn't be here today,  without this sacred Second Amendment. Every law-abiding citizen in  America must be able to meet evil with equal or greater force, whether  it is a violent criminal, a crazed killer, or a coercive government.   Mr. Speaker, we must reject this attempt to trample the Constitution,  to violate the spirit of what those Founders wrote into that sacred  document, and disarm our citizens.
