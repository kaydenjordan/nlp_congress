 Mr. Speaker, New Jersey's 10th Congressional District is  the home of the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the largest port  on the East Coast; Newark Liberty International Airport; Amtrak's  Boston-to-D.C. line, the center of that line; I-95; and Route 78 going  west in this great Nation. Transportation infrastructure drives my  district's economic growth and the economy of States throughout the  Northeast.   The White House and congressional Republicans have spent the past  year promising to rebuild America's infrastructure, but all the  American people have gotten is a raw deal that would sell off America's  infrastructure to Wall Street and leave Main Street to fill in all the  potholes.   The people who live in my district deserve a better deal than they  are getting under this majority and this administration.   My Democratic colleagues and I have a real plan to rebuild America.  It is five times as big as the puny proposal by the White House.  Democrats want to create 16 million new good-paying jobs, build  bridges, clear roads, broadband, schools, water infrastructure, energy  grids, and transit. That is what my constituents and the American  people deserve.                            ____________________
