 Mr. Speaker, we know the President doesn't like to read,  but I think perhaps his acting chief of staff did.   There was something called the Maginot Line the French built between  World War I and World War II, an impenetrable defense against the  German invasion. Unfortunately, the Germans went around it.   Here we are in the 21st century. The President wants $5.7 billion to  build a wall along part of the Mexican border. Now, his own acting  chief of staff, when he was a Member of Congress and perhaps speaking  more freely, said:         You go under, you go around, you go through. What they need       is more manpower and more technology.    That is Mick Mulvaney, well, saying something different now, I guess,  because he wants to keep his job. But the point is, he had an honest  opinion then, and that is the way it will work.   Here are a few things:   You can go over walls and fences--oh, by the way, we just had a  demonstration today that the steel slats the President now wants can be  cut with a handsaw.   Tunnels, drugs come through that way and people are smuggled in that  way.   Oh, they are using the squad copters. You can buy those pretty  cheap--oh, and then some more primitive device over here.   But, actually, the flood of drugs coming into the United States comes  in right here, legal border crossings.   A couple of problems with that right now:   First off, the people who are manning the border crossings aren't  getting paid.   Secondly, they don't have enough technology or the capability of  inspecting more than 10 percent of the vehicles that come through. So  for the cartels: ``Hey, what the heck. We just lost a semi.'' What do  they care? Pocket change. ``Couple of hundred thousand  [[Page H366]]  bucks, million bucks--whatever. We don't care.'' They just try all the  time.   And we don't have the defenses we need. We could invest there, but,  no, the President wants the wall.   Now, there is another way that drugs are coming into this country.  Last year, the Coast Guard intercepted $5.6 billion--sound familiar?  $5.6 billion, almost as much as the President wants for the wall--worth  of illegal drugs being shipped via the ocean into the United States.   The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified 2 years ago, they are  only intercepting 20 percent of the known shipments because their  medium endurance cutters are half a century old. They don't have enough  helicopters. They don't have enough air support. They don't have enough  fast-pursuit boats.   But, no, we are going to invest in a stupid static way. They can go  around it in the oceans. They can go around it in the desert. They can  go under it. They can go over it.   And the people who are really doing the job, like the Coast Guard,  guess what. They are not getting paid either. The first line of  defense, Customs and Border Protection--not being paid. The Coast  Guard--not being paid.   There is a very long list of Federal employees who are critical to  national security who are not being paid today and don't have the tools  they need. But the President wants to invest in a stupid static wall  because they promised one.   And, oh, by the way, Mexico is going to pay for it, which, of course,  they aren't.   You know, yesterday the tip sheet from the Coast Guard support group,  the Trump administration, had helpful tips for coasties: you could hold  a garage sale; you could perhaps dog walk; you could register as a  mystery shopper.   They actually posted this for people who are the first line of  defense in the United States of America, instead of saying: ``Put them  back to work and pay them, pay them for defending America.''   Now, the President says he can relate to this. He understands. Yes,  when he was in business, he stiffed a whole lot of people, and he is  stiffing 800,000 Federal employees right now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, why are we here today? We are here today  because the President is down on the border and he wants to build,  along part of the border, a wall, a Maginot Line, if you would have it.  The French thought that they could keep the Germans out by building a  fortified wall and fortifications along part of their border. The  Germans went around it.   Well, if the drugs were coming over the border illegally, they would  go around it. But that is not where they are coming. They are coming  through the ports of entry, where we don't have enough personnel, who,  by the way, aren't getting paid today, and where we don't have the  technology we need to find the humans and the drugs that are being  smuggled through in tractor trailers and other vehicles across the  border.   If you want to invest in border security, that is a place to invest  in border security.   Now, the President promised us a grand infrastructure plan. Little  did we know it was going to be a partial wall along the Mexican border  that he felt so strongly about that he would shut down the government.   We have the busiest, most complex aviation system in the world. It is  the safest in the world. Today, 14,000 air traffic controllers are  working without pay. They all got checks today--I just got a copy of  one--for $0. So they are still processing their checks, but the check  is for $0.   Then we have 3,300 aviation inspectors who are furloughed. They are  not essential. We are allowing the airline industry and all the  aircraft maintenance facilities and everything else to self-regulate.  No one is looking over their shoulder. ``Oh, don't worry about it. No  problems.'' Right.   Then, of course, there are a few other issues that this bill would  deal with. We have a $100 billion backlog to bring existing transit,  which is inadequate for today's needs, up to a state of good repair.  This is delaying dealing with that problem more and more into the  future.   We have 56,000 bridges on the national highway system that need  substantial repair or replacement. Well, guess what? That is not going  forward today either.   Last year, we wasted 3.1 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel  idling in traffic. A lot of concern about climate change--well, on this  side of the aisle, not on that side of the aisle. They don't believe in  it. I don't know, maybe the gentleman from Florida does; they are kind  of going underwater.   But we aren't giving people the options they need to get out of their  cars, to be more efficient with transit.   Wastewater, the Federal Government used to partner with communities  to deal with wastewater. We are not doing that anymore.   So are we going to rebuild America? Are we going to deliver on the  President's promise of something other than a stupid, wasteful,  ineffective wall?   How about shutting down the government because Congress won't provide  the funding we need to rebuild our infrastructure? That would be,  perhaps, a better cause for this President.   I urge Members to vote for this, reopen the government, fund  transportation and infrastructure, and fund our air traffic controllers  who are keeping us safe.
