 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act. This critical piece of  legislation rolls back onerous Obama-era regulations on the financial  services industry  [[Page H4729]]  that are strangling small businesses and hurting hardworking American  taxpayers.   As I held roundtables across West Virginia, I heard from small- business owners and job creators that Obama-era regulations make it  harder for community banks to make loans to small businesses and first- time home buyers.   The Financial CHOICE Act will remove stifling Federal regulations  from out-of-touch Washington bureaucrats and return financial  decisionmaking to you, the individual consumers and to the small  community banks.   I know that President Trump is committed to supporting the reforms in  the Financial CHOICE Act, and I look forward to continuing to work with  our President to grow our economy and bring much-needed relief to West  Virginia consumers and small-business owners.   I want to thank Chairman Hensarling and my colleagues on the  Financial Services Committee for their leadership on this important  legislation.
