The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6013         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Migratory Bird Framework and       Hunting Opportunities for Veterans Act''.       SEC. 2. FEDERAL CLOSING DATE FOR HUNTING OF DUCKS,                     MERGANSERS, AND COOTS.         Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 704)       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Federal Framework Closing Date for Hunting of Ducks,       Mergansers, and Coots.--        ``(1) In general.--In promulgating regulations under       subsection (a) relating to the Federal framework for outside       dates within which the States may select seasons for       migratory bird hunting, except as provided in paragraph (2),       the Secretary shall, with respect to the hunting season for       ducks, mergansers, and coots--        ``(A) adopt the recommendation of each respective flyway       council (as defined in section 20.152 of title 50, Code of       Federal Regulations) for the Federal framework if considered       by the Secretary to be consistent with science-based and       sustainable adaptive harvest management, but the framework       closing date shall be January 31 of each year; and        ``(B) allow the States to establish the closing date for       the hunting season in accordance with the Federal framework.        ``(2) Special duck hunting days for youths, veterans, and       active military personnel.--        ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the closing date under       paragraph (1) and subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the       Secretary shall allow States to select 2 days for youths and       2 days for veterans (as defined in section 101 of title 38,       United States Code), and members of the Armed Forces on       active duty, including members of the National Guard and       Reserves on active duty (other than for training), to hunt       ducks, mergansers, and coots. Such days shall be treated as       an addition to the regular hunting season lengths selected by       the States.        ``(B) Requirements.--In selecting days under subparagraph       (A), a State shall ensure that--        ``(i) the days selected--  [[Page H8854]]         ``(I) do not fall within the regular hunting season for       ducks, mergansers, and coots;        ``(II) with regard to youth days, are on a weekend, holiday       or other day in which schools are not in session; and        ``(III) are not more than 14 days before or after the       hunting season for duck, mergansers, and coots; and         ``(ii) the total number of days in a hunting season for       ducks, mergansers and coots, including any days selected       under subparagraph (A), is not more than 107 days.        ``(C) Limitation.--A State may combine the 2 days allowed       for youths with the 2 days allowed for veterans and members       of the Armed Forces on active duty under subparagraph (A),       but in no circumstance may a State have more than a total of       4 additional days added to its regular hunting season for any       purpose.        ``(3) Regulations.--The Secretary shall promulgate       regulations in accordance with this subsection for the       Federal framework for migratory bird hunting for the 2019-      2020 hunting season and each hunting season thereafter.''.          Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to amend the       Migratory Bird Treaty Act to establish January 31 of each       year as the Federal framework closing date for the duck       hunting season and to establish special duck hunting days for       youths, veterans, and active military personnel, and for       other purposes.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6013, the Migratory Bird Framework and Hunting  Opportunities for Veterans Act, accomplishes two goals. First, it  provides certainty to States by setting a specific Federal framework  closing date for duck hunting. Second, it provides States the option to  establish special duck hunting days for youth, veterans, and members of  the Armed Forces.   In addition to the Department of the Interior, I want to thank Ducks  Unlimited, Vista Outdoors, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation,  and Will Primos among others for their work on and support of this  important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6299) to modify the process of the Secretary of the Interior  for examining certain mining claims on Federal lands in Storey County,  Nevada, to facilitate certain pinyon-juniper-related projects in  Lincoln County, Nevada, to modify the boundaries of certain wilderness  areas in the State of Nevada, to fully implement the White Pine County  Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act, and for other purposes,  as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6299, introduced by Congressman  Amodei of Nevada, provides commonsense improvements and technical  corrections to existing laws that will spur economic development and  ensure better land management in several Nevada counties, including  Storey, Clark, Lincoln, and White Pine. The provisions included in this  bill represent strong collaboration with State and local elected  officials and have been supported by the entire Nevada congressional  delegation.   I want to thank Chairman Gowdy for his cooperation in getting this  bill scheduled for consideration and simply conclude by saying this is  a good bill. It is going to enhance sound land management and provide  significant public benefit to the people of these Nevada communities. I  want to thank and commend Congressman Amodei for his fine work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I am prepared to  close when the gentleman is finished.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On September 5, 2018, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered favorably reported H.R. 6299, the       Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of 2018. This       bill was additionally referred to the Committee on Oversight       and Government Reform.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform to be discharged from further consideration       of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority       Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction       over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform represented on the conference committee. Finally, I       would be pleased to include this letter and your response in       the bill report and in the Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to       further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                     Rob Bishop,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, September 20, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       6299, the Nevada Lands Bill Technical Corrections Act of       2018. As you know, certain provisions of the bill fall within       the jurisdiction of Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform.        As a result of your having consulted with me concerning the       provisions of H.R. 6299 that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction, I agree to forgo consideration of the bill, so       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I       agree that forgoing formal consideration of the bill will not       prejudice the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform       with respect to any future jurisdictional claim, and I       appreciate your agreement to support appointment of members       of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as       conferees in any House-Senate conference on this or related       legislation. In addition, I request the Committee be       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so we may address any remaining issues within       our jurisdiction.        Finally, I request you include your letter and this       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural       Resources, as well as in the Congressional Record during       consideration of the bill on the floor.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6687) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to manage the  Point  [[Page H8857]]  Reyes National Seashore in the State of California consistent with  Congress' longstanding intent to maintain working dairies and ranches  on agricultural property as part of the seashore's unique historic,  cultural, scenic and natural values, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6687         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY IN POINT REYES                     NATIONAL SEASHORE.         Public Law 87-657 (16 U.S.C. 459c, et seq.) is amended as       follows:        (1) In section 5(b) (16 U.S.C. 459c-5(b))--        (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``As used in'' and       inserting the following:        ``(1) As used in'';        (B) by striking ``The term `agricultural property' as       used'' and inserting the following:        ``(2) The term `agricultural property' as used'';        (C) by striking ``means lands which were in regular use''       and inserting ``means--        ``(A) lands under agricultural lease or permit as of       September 1, 2018, or lands that were in regular use''; and        (D) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and        ``(B) on the northern district of the Golden Gate National       Recreation Area, lands under agricultural lease or permit as       of September 1, 2018, or lands that were in regular use for,       or were being converted to, agricultural, ranching, or       dairying purposes as of May 1, 1978, together with       residential and other structures relat ed to the above uses       of the property that were in existence or under construction       as of May 1, 1978.''.        (2) In section 5 (16 U.S.C. 459c-5)--        (A) by inserting before subsection (a) the following:        ``(a) The Secretary shall manage agricultural property       consistent with Congress' long-standing intent that working       dairies and ranches continue to be authorized to operate on       agricultural property as part of the seashore's unique       historic, cultural, scenic and natural values.''; and        (B) by redesignating subsequent subsections accordingly.        (3) In section 6 (16 U.S.C. 459c-6), by adding at the end       the following:        ``(c)(1) In areas of agricultural property where Tule Elk       present conflicts with working ranches or dairies, the       Secretary shall manage the Tule Elk for separation from the       working ranches or dairies. To minimize the conflicts and       prevent establishment of new Tule Elk herds on agricultural       property, the Secretary may work with Indian Tribes       interested in the following:        ``(A) Partnering with the Secretary in the relocation and       reestablishment of Tule Elk on Tribal lands.        ``(B) Participating in hunting Tule Elk on a subsistence or       ceremonial basis.        ``(C) Other partnerships and activities that the Secretary       determines are suitable and feasible for this purpose.        ``(2) Nothing in this subsection reduces or diminishes the       authority of the Secretary to use other existing authorities       or management tools to separate Tule Elk from agricultural       property.''.        (4) By adding at the end, the following:        ``Sec. 10.

Nothing in this Act requires the Secretary to issue       leases and special use permits of 20 years in circumstances       where there is no willing lessee, or to a previous lessee who       has abandoned or discontinued ranching.''.          Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to direct the       Secretary of the Interior to manage the Point Reyes National       Seashore in the State of California consistently with       Congress' long-standing intent to continue to authorize       working dairies and ranches on agricultural property as part       of the seashore's unique historic, cultural, scenic and       natural values, and for other purposes.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this bill on behalf of its  author, Mr. Huffman, and its cosponsor, Chairman Bishop. Chairman  Bishop has also asked that I commend my colleague from California for  his work and collaboration on this measure.   Representative Huffman worked to forge consensus with diverse local  stakeholders on a complicated issue. When we found local solutions that  the local people agree is the answer, as has been done here, we should  do everything we can on both sides of the aisle to advance the solution  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5420) to authorize the acquisition of land for addition to  the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in the State  of New York, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5420         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FDR Historic Preservation       Act''.       SEC. 2. HOME OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE.         (a) Land Acquisition.--The Secretary of the Interior is       authorized to acquire by donation, purchase from a willing       seller using donated funds, or exchange, the approximately 89       acres of land identified as the ``Morgan Property'' and       generally depicted on the map titled ``Home of Franklin D.       Roosevelt National Historic Site, Proposed Park Addition'',       numbered 384/138,461 and dated May 2017.        (b) Availability of Map.--The map referred to in subsection       (a) shall be available for public inspection in the       appropriate offices of the National Park Service.        (c) Boundary Adjustment; Administration.--Upon acquisition       of the land referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of       the Interior shall--        (1) adjust the boundary of the Home of Franklin D.       Roosevelt National Historic Site to reflect the acquisition;       and        (2) administer such land as part of the Home of Franklin D.       Roosevelt National Historic Site in accordance with       applicable laws.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H8859]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5420, by Congressman Faso of New York, would allow  89 acres to be added to the historic site that was Franklin Roosevelt's  lifelong home and birthplace in Hyde Park, New York, which was  designated as a National Historic Site in 1944. The land is currently  owned by the Scenic Hudson Land Trust, and they would like to deed it  to the National Park Service.   The addition would provide important context for visitors and better  connectivity to the Hyde Park Trail that links the FDR National  Historic Site to the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site to the  north.   The addition would not require any outlay of Federal funds. The  transfer would be by donation, exchange, or purchase, using donated  funds only.   I would like to commend Congressman Faso for sponsorship of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to remind the  ranking member that the transfer of this land would be by donation,  exchange, or purchase, using donated funds only. No Federal funds are  involved from the LWCF or anywhere else.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that  a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is  not present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6599) to modify the application of temporary limited  appointment regulations to the National Park Service, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6599         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF TEMPORARY LIMITED APPOINTMENT                     REGULATIONS TO THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.         With respect to the National Park Service, for purposes of       carrying out section 316.401 of subpart D of part 316 of       title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (relating to temporary       limited appointments)--        (1) the term ``major subdivision'' in paragraph (1) of       subsection (c) of such section shall be defined by the       Director of the National Park Service; and        (2) the requirement in such paragraph that a position be in       the same local commuting area shall not apply.       SEC. 2. SUNSET.         The modification authority provided by section 1 and any       such modification shall expire on the date that is one year       after the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, recently, the Office of Personnel Management questioned  how the National Park Service rehired temporary seasonal employees. The  NPS did not agree with OPM's interpretation of the relevant regulation  but, nonetheless, complied.   OPM's directive caused confusion for Park Service hiring managers and  threatened the ability of parks to open and operate as normal this past  summer. Additionally, many temporary seasonal employees were  unexpectedly left without a job.   H.R. 6599 addresses this issue and allows the Park Service to  continue its longstanding practices in hiring its essential seasonal  employees for 1 year while Congress acts to address the issue  systemically.   Congressman Steve Knight of California has brought us this measure,  and I would like to commend him for his leadership on the issue.  Americans across the country are going to benefit from this work. I  would like to thank him for his cooperation, allowing this to go  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, September 24, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On September 5, 2018, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered favorably reported H.R. 6599, to       modify the application of temporary limited appointment       regulations to the National Park Service, and for other       purposes. While this bill was not originally referred to the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I believe your       Committee has a valid jurisdictional interest in the measure.        I ask that you not seek a sequential referral of the bill       so that it may be considered by the House of Representatives       this week. This action in no way affects your jurisdiction       over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform represented on the conference committee. Finally, I       would be pleased to include this letter and your response in       the bill report and in the Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to       further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                     Rob Bishop,                                                           Chairman,                                    Committee on Natural Resources.  [[Page H8860]]                                          ____          House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, September 24, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 6599, a bill to modify the application of temporary       limited appointment regulations to the National Park Service,       and for other purposes. As a result of your having consulted       with me concerning the bill, the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform will not seek a sequential referral and       agrees to forego formal action on the bill.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing a request for a sequential       referral of H.R. 6599 at this time we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation. I appreciate your agreement to support       appointment of members of the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform as conferees in any House-Senate conference       on this or related legislation. In addition, I request the       Committee be consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining       issues within our jurisdiction.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the bill report filed by the       Committee on Natural Resources, as well as in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration, to       memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5585) to extend the authorization for the Cape Cod National  Seashore Advisory Commission.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5585         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CAPE COD NATIONAL SEASHORE ADVISORY COMMISSION.         Effective September 26, 2018, section 8(a) of Public Law       87-126 (16 U.S.C. 459b-7(a)) is amended in the second       sentence by striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2028''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5585 extends authorization of the  Cape Cod National Seashore Advisory Commission until 2028. The  commission provides valuable feedback to the Cape Cod National  Seashore, which helps to promote sound park management, improve public  access, and ensure that the National Park Service is a good neighbor to  the surrounding communities.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the measure and am prepared to  close when my colleague is finished. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 46) to authorize the Secretary of the  Interior to conduct a special resource study of Fort Ontario in the  State of New York, with a Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the  Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration  of the resolution (H. Res. 418) urging the Secretary of the Interior to  recognize the cultural significance of Rib Mountain by adding it to the  National Register of Historic Places, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    I have an amendment to the text at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Natural Resources be discharged from further consideration  of the resolution (H. Res. 460) requesting the Secretary of the  Interior to recognize the rich history of the logging industry and the  importance of lumberjack sports by adding the Lumberjack Bowl to the  National Register of Historic Places, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    I have an amendment to the text at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with  the reading.
