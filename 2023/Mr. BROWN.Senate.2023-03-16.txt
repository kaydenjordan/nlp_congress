 Mr. President, I, first, want to compliment the President  pro tempore of the Senate and her leadership here for now 30-plus years  and her courage.   She saw January more up close than most of us did. I say to the  Senator: I believe you were with your husband in your office and heard  those sounds and, I assume, had those fears. I appreciate your courage  then and how you have talked about it in specific terms. Your  genuineness really matters. So thank you for that.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand there are three bills at the  desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned to convene for  a pro forma session, with no business being conducted, at 8:45 a.m. on  Friday, March 17, and when the Senate adjourns on Friday, it stand  adjourned until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, March 21; that, on Tuesday,  following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired,  the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two  leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and morning business  be closed; that following the conclusion of morning business, the  Senate resume consideration of the motion  [[Page S836]]  to proceed to Calendar No. 25, S. 316, postcloture; further, that the  postcloture debate time on the motion to proceed be considered expired  at 5:30 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order, following the remarks of Senator Cantwell.
