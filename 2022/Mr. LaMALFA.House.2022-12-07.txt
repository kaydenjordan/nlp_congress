 Throughout California there are tens of thousands of  residents who lost their homes, their belongings, and, for some, even  their loved ones due to wildfires.   In 2020, the fire victims trust was established to compensate  survivors of the 2015 Butte, the 2017 North Bay, and the 2018 Camp  fires with a total of $13.5 billion of settlement award money.   Survivors have waited years for compensation to rebuild their lives,  and they have long awaited these funds. Instead, to add insult, many of  them are facing immense tax burdens and navigating the uncertainty of  our ambiguous tax code trying to find concrete answers of how much they  may or may not owe the Government in taxes.   We should not force survivors to pay Federal taxes on compensation  they would otherwise use to rebuild their lives, and we certainly  should not be forcing them to pay taxes on funds that are going to the  lawyers involved as well.   Congressman   Mike Thompson and I have introduced H.R. 7305 to  correct this injustice. I am urging all my colleagues in the House to  support this bipartisan legislation and bring much-needed financial  reprieve to these wildfire survivors.   They shouldn't have to live with this uncertainty over their heads.  This needs to be passed by the end of this year.                            ____________________
