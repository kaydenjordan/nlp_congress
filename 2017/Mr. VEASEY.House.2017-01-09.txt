 Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome you to tonight's  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour that will examine the  negative impact of President-elect Trump's nominations for the position  of U.S. Attorney General, Secretary of Education, and Secretary of  Health and Human Services.  [[Page H221]]    Let's be honest here, the 2016 Presidential election showed us both  the worst and the best of American politics. The most disturbing  development of the election season, of course, was the President- elect's campaign that was an ``us versus them'' type of campaign that  really divided the Nation. It was really sad for people to see that on  display.   On November 9, after winning the Presidency, the President-elect  tweeted: ``Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man  and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as  never before.''   But will he keep his promise of doing all that he can to repair our  divided nation? So far he has been very disappointing. And when you  look at the nominations of Senator Sessions, Betsy DeVos, and Tom Price  to key positions in his administration, it seems like he has forgotten,  that he has forgotten and ignored our Nation's dark history of  oppression, particularly to the African American community.                                time  1930    The President-elect's nominees represent everything that the  Congressional Black Caucus has vehemently fought against. As a caucus,  we fought to ensure that the African American community is empowered  with the tools it needs to achieve the American Dream. Mr. Trump's  Cabinet nominations are set to push the dream back so far out of reach  for millions and millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, we have a list of Members that would like to speak  tonight.   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the dean of the  United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Conyers very much for his words  as the dean of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters).   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  encourage opposition to the nomination of Jeff Sessions to the Attorney  General's Office by this President-elect.   We have been asked and we are constantly asked: Are you saying he is  a racist? He defined himself. He defined himself long ago when he was  denied a Federal judgeship in 1986 after having been appointed by  Ronald Reagan. He was denied because his colleagues said they heard him  use the N-word.   Also, it was very well documented that after two of the members of  the KKK killed an African American man, he said: Oh, I thought the KKK  was okay until I learned they smoked marijuana. This is the same man  that said, again, that the NAACP and the SCLC were un-American, that  they were communist inspired, and it goes on and on and on. And it is  not whether or not we are calling him or we think of him as a racist;  he defined himself in that manner. He was denied the appointment to the  Federal judgeship, including by Republicans who voted against him.   So here we have a man who is going to be considered for the Attorney  General's Office where we have the Civil Rights Division. Should we be  worried about that? You bet your bottom dollar we should be worried  about that. Not only has he defined himself as a racist, but this is a  throwback. This is a man who is a setback. This is a man who does not  agree with his colleagues on criminal justice reform. This is a man who  loves mandatory minimum sentences. This is a man who does not want the  Justice Department to work with local police departments who are in  trouble, like what happened in Ferguson. This is a man who is against  voting rights. This is a man who has shown himself to be against women.  This is a man who does not support the LGBT community. Why would we  want him to have this very important, prestigious position as the  Attorney General overseeing civil rights? I don't think so.   I advise everybody who is listening and all of our colleagues to  support him not being appointed to that position and to get the word  over to the Senators that they should not support him, they should not  vote for him.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Maxine Waters).   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Maxine Waters).   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Maxine Waters).   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson) for his timely comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  my fellow Texan from Houston.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Veasey for his  leadership. Let also thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,  Mr. Richmond, for his leadership.   Before I start, let me offer my appreciation to law enforcement  officers across America--this is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day--and  join my colleague, Val Demings, particularly acknowledging the sadness  in Orlando today in the loss of two law enforcement officers in the  line of duty.   I rise today for not a personal statement or a statement that has to  do with personality. As the President-elect said of Mr. Sessions, he is  a fine and decent fellow. I have no interest in determining whether  that is true or false. But I do want to hold the President-elect  accountable for the words that he said on election night that he  pledged to the Nation that he would be a President for all Americans.  That pledge, I believe, will ring hollow for tens upon tens of millions  of Americans with the nomination of the Secretary of Education, who is  against public schools, the nomination of the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, who has no plan for health care, and, finally, the  nomination for Attorney General.   Rather than select someone who is championing and protecting, rather  than opposing and undermining the precious right to vote, the  constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform,  and the support for reform of the Nation's immigration system, it is  quite the contrary in the nomination of Senator Sessions--a person who  opposed Shelby County v. Holder in terms of the basis of trying to  constructively support voting rights, an individual who is hostile to  comprehensive immigration reform, and certainly someone who has  constantly not sought to fix, but has sought to undermine.   So, for example, as a U.S. attorney, he was the first prosecutor in  the country to bring charges against civil rights activists of voter  fraud. But, Mr. Speaker, listen to this: he didn't just bring charges;  he had 29 counts of voter fraud that resulted in civil rights activists  facing 100 years in prison.   He has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of voting  restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort to  undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act, and he did nothing  to reconstruct the Voting Rights Act and restore section 5 when tens  upon tens of Members of Congress worked diligently to try to fix the  Shelby case.   He criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for challenging State  election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight voter fraud.  Evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent, with 31  confirmed cases out of more than a billion ballots cast.   Senator Sessions fought to continue practices that harm schools  predominantly attended by African American students. He led the fight  to uphold the State of Alabama's inequitable school funding mechanism  after it had been deemed unconstitutional by the Alabama Circuit Court.   Finally, in the State of Alabama, nearly a quarter of African  American students attend what is called apartheid, or what can be  called apartheid schools, meaning the school's White population is less  than 1 percent.   Now we understand that the Senator has taken credit for desegregation  efforts in the State of Alabama. There is no evidence of his  participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then-Attorney General Sessions.                                time  1945    I would say to you as I close, we who are vulnerable look to the  Department of Justice as the solid rock of justice for the Nation.  Whether we are immigrant, whether we are a woman who is trying to fight  against violence, whether we need civil rights, whether we are LGBT,  whether we are those who are seeking religious freedom or freedom of  expression, the Department of Justice is a solid rock of justice for  this Nation.   With that in mind, I believe that this nominee, who now stands with  the criteria evidenced by the record, stands not prepared, not fit to  hold this position of the Attorney General of the United States--a  sacred position of law and justice.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the  Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise  today to express my views regarding the President-Elect's nomination of  U.S. Senator Jefferson Beauregard ``Jeff'' Sessions III of Alabama to  be the next Attorney General of the United States.   On Election Night the President-Elect pledged to the nation that he  would be a president to all Americans.   That pledge will ring hollow to tens of millions of Americans in  light of his announced intention to nominate one of the U.S. Senate's  most far-right members, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to be the next  Attorney General of the United States.   Perhaps nothing would do more to reassure the American people that  the President-Elect is committed to unifying the nation than the  nomination and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a  record of championing and protecting, rather than opposing and  undermining, the precious right to vote; the constitutionally  guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for  reform of the nation's immigration system so that it is fair and  humane.   The nomination of Alabama Senator Sessions as Attorney General does  not inspire the necessary confidence.   As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous  Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator  Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage  to voting rights caused by that decision.   He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   He is one of the Senate's most hostile opponents of comprehensive  immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and  incendiary immigration policy advocated by the President-Elect during  the campaign.   And his record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the  nation's criminal justice system is virtually non-existent.   In 1986, ten years before Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate,  he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of  documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and  voting rights, and to equal justice.   And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white  nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront.   As a U.S. attorney, Senator Sessions was the first federal prosecutor  in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists for  voter fraud.   Senator Sessions charged the group with 29 counts of voter fraud,  facing over 100 years in prison.   Senator Sessions has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of  voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort  to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act.   Senator Sessions has spoken out against the Voting Rights Act,  calling it ``a piece of intrusive legislation.''   Senator Sessions criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for  challenging state election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight  voter fraud.   However, evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent,  with 31 confirmed cases out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.   As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Senator Sessions fought  to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by  African-American students.   Senator Sessions led the fight to uphold the state of Alabama's  inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed  unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court.   In the state of Alabama nearly a quarter of African-American students  attend apartheid schools, meaning the school's white population is less  than one percent.   Although Senator Sessions has publically taken credit for  desegregation efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of  his participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then Attorney General Sessions.  [[Page H223]]    I call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to subject the nomination  to the most comprehensive, searching, and withering examination.   The United States has been blessed to have been served as Attorney  General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson, Robert Kennedy,  Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach, Eric Holder, and  Edward H. Levi.   The duty of the U.S. Attorney General is to lead the Department of  Justice in protecting and expanding the civil rights of all Americans  and the pursuit of equal justice for all, not to turn back the clock on  hard won rights and liberties.   No senator should vote to confirm the nomination of Jeff Sessions as  U.S. Attorney General if there is the slightest doubt that he possesses  the character, qualities, integrity, and commitment to justice and  equality needed to lead a department, the headquarters building of  which is named for Robert F. Kennedy, one of the nation's greatest and  most indefatigable champions of civil rights and equal justice for all.    I thank very much Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from California, Ms.  Barbara Lee.    I thank very much Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from California, Ms.  Barbara Lee.    I thank very much Representative Lee. I really appreciate  the gentlewoman's remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to someone who, over the last 20 years, has  been in nearly every battle in the United States Congress when it comes  to the issue of civil rights. He is Representative Bobby Scott of  Virginia.    I thank Mr. Scott of Virginia very much.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 32 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I next yield to the lone voice in the State  of  [[Page H224]]  Wisconsin, someone who is always speaking out on these issues not just  for her district, but for the many people around her State who want  that voice from the CBC: Ms. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin.    I thank Representative Moore. I appreciate the  gentlewoman's comments and I thank her for mentioning some of the  issues with voter ID in Wisconsin, which may have tilted the election  results in that State.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my good friend from Brooklyn in the  Empire State, Representative Yvette Clarke.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank Mr. Veasey for his leadership this  evening. I thank our chairman, Cedric Richmond, for his vision and his  timeliness in bringing this to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of the Ninth  Congressional District of New York in opposition to Donald Trump's  nominee for the position of Attorney General of the United States,  Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. I stand with my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus as we raise our voices on behalf of the  millions of Americans who depend on this caucus to speak as the  conscience of the Congress--speaking truth to power.   Mr. Speaker, I struggle to understand how Senator Sessions can even  be considered to lead the Department of Justice when time and time  again throughout his political career he has actively opposed the  mission and purpose for which the Department of Justice was created.  For the better part of my life--at least a half a century--the  Department of Justice has assumed a position of leadership in the fight  for the civil rights of African Americans who seek the uninhibited  right to vote, for young women who seek protection against sexual  assault on college campuses, for disabled individuals who fight for  equitable access to basic services, and for immigrants who aspire to  pursue their visions of the American Dream.   The nomination of Senator Sessions does not support the legacy of  progress that has been made under the auspices of the modern-day  Department of Justice. As a young prosecutor, he directed racial slurs  at his African American colleagues. Senator Sessions spoke highly of  the Ku Klux Klan. He actively targeted and persecuted activists like  Mr. Albert Turner--one of Dr. Martin Luther King's advisers--for simply  trying to register disenfranchised voters.                                time  2000    When he became Attorney General of Alabama, Senator Sessions, a  product of segregated education, worked tirelessly to prevent  predominantly African American public schools from accessing an equal  share of resources that had been long denied to Black students.   As a Member of the Senate, Senator Sessions has been an outspoken  opponent of criminal justice reforms that many of his Republican  colleagues support. He is a leader in the effort to define undocumented  Americans as ``the other'' and forcibly separating families in the  United States.   The women and men who lead the Department of Justice are called upon  to pursue justice; but with such a documented history of hostility  toward the most vulnerable populations--people of color, women,  disabled individuals, and immigrant families--we cannot expect Senator  Sessions to pursue justice on their behalf.   I absolutely and unequivocally oppose the nomination of Senator  Sessions. He has demonstrated his disdain for the most basic of human  principles: equality, justice, and fairness. These principles represent  the promise of our Constitution. The Senate considering and confirming  Mr. Sessions would break that very promise.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the CBC today asking the Senate of the  United States to uphold the virtues of the Constitution and reject this  divisive nomination.    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remind Members that we  have 3 minutes per Member left of speaking time. I wanted to just  remind Members of that so everyone will have an opportunity to speak on  this very important matter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Payne), my classmate and a voice from the New York area.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Payne), my classmate and a voice from the New York area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty), my classmate from the Buckeye State, representing the  Columbus, Ohio, area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, the  Empire State, (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, the  Empire State, (Mr. Jeffries).    I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams).    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman).   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have  spoken this evening.   As I have said, I would have liked to have spent this transition  period working with the President-elect on ways to solve our Nation's  issues. I would have liked to have been reassured that, despite  disparaging and divisive rhetoric, his actions would have worked to  unite us all. Instead, we are battling against a nominee who has  already been deemed unfit for a Federal judgeship. So what can possibly  make him fit to serve as our Nation's top law enforcement officer?   The definition of justice is the quality of being just, impartial, or  fair. Synonyms include equity, objectivity, and neutrality. Senator  Sessions has built a reputation and a voting record that does not align  with justice. I do not wish to relitigate the past, and while it cannot  be ignored, we don't have to look too far back to identify Senator  Sessions' priorities. In 2006, he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act.  In 2013, he supported the Supreme Court decision to strike key  provisions of that law.    Following being denied a Federal judgeship, Senator Sessions  cosponsored legislation to honor Rosa Parks with a Congressional Gold  Medal while also voting against legislation in 2009 to extend Federal  hate crime protections against people targeted because of their sexual  orientation. Further, he has been the ringleader to immigration reform.   How can we in good faith recommend, nominate, or confirm a person to  a post that is solely responsible for protecting the civil rights of  all Americans, including those who are vulnerable, disadvantaged, and  discriminated against?   This administration is continuing to ask us to put aside our  intellect and to trust their intentions. I refuse. This administration  would like us to support a man who, throughout his career, has  determined the rights of those who look like me, like constituents I  serve, as inferior. I refuse, and I ask the Senators to please consider  this as they listen to whether or not this gentleman deserves to be  confirmed.   Mr. Speaker, as I've said before, I would have liked to have spent  the transition period working with the President-Elect, Trump, on ways  to solve our Nation's issues.   I would have liked to have been reassured that despite disparaging  and divisive campaign rhetoric--President-Elect Trump's actions would  work to unite us all.   Yet, instead we're here battling against the nominee for the 84th  attorney general of the United States who was already rejected as a  federal judge.   His disqualification was rooted in allegations that he called a black  attorney ``boy'' and his suggestions that a white lawyer working for  black clients was a race traitor.   Not only that but Senator Sessions found humor in his only issue with  the Ku Klux Klan was their drug use, and accused civil rights groups as  being ``un-American'' organizations trying to ``force civil rights down  the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.''   So what could possibly make him fit to serve as our Nation's top law  enforcement officer at the Department of Justice?   The definition of justice is the quality of being just, impartial, or  fair.   Synonyms for justice include equity, objectivity and neutrality.   Senator Sessions has built a reputation and, most importantly, a  voting record that does not align with that definition.   I do not wish to re-litigate the past as I would not want to be  judged on my actions and thoughts of 30 years ago. However, Senator  Sessions' growth and commitment to inclusivity--even 30 years later-- remains to be seen.   Following being denied a federal judgeship, in the early 90s, Senator  Sessions co-sponsored legislation to honor Rosa Parks with the  Congressional Gold Medal, while also voting against 2009 legislation  that extended federal hate crime protections to people targeted because  of their sexual orientation or gender identity.   While in 2006 he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act, just years  later in 2013 he supported the Supreme Court's decision to strike key  provisions of the law.  [[Page H227]]    Furthermore, he has been the ringleader of opposition for immigration  reform.   How can we in good faith recommend, nominate, or confirm this person  to the post that is solely responsible for protecting the civil  liberties of all Americans--including those who are vulnerable,  disadvantaged, and discriminated against.   This administration is continually asking us to put aside our  intellect and to trust their intention. I refuse.   This administration would like us to support a man who throughout his  career has determined the rights of those who look like me and the  constituents I serve are inferior. I refuse.   This administration would like us to sit idly by as Donald Trump  tries to overwhelm us into tacit submission to his dangerous agenda. I  refuse.   A Trump-Sessions Department of Justice would be not only an attack on  our civil rights and equality; it would be an insult to the  intelligence of the American people.    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for organizing  this hour today.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because I believe that confirming  Jeff Sessions as Attorney General for the United States would  jeopardize the progress we have made for equal rights and against  discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who  has criticized the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and believes that this  landmark law, which provides all Americans with the right to cast a  ballot for candidates in our democratic process, is intrusive. It is an  affront to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm a nominee who views an  old advertisement calling for the death penalty of people who are later  exonerated as a mark of conservatism.   Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who  was previously rejected as a choice for a Federal judgeship to lead a  Department that, in part, vets future Federal judges. It is an affront  to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm someone who does not believe  in justice for all to lead the Department of Justice.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this nominee would not act in the best  interest of all Americans, regardless of color, gender, country of  origin, sexual orientation, or economic status. Mr. Speaker, it is my  fervent hope that the Senate of the United States will deny the  confirmation of this nominee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, President-elect  Donald Trump's cabinet nominations are nothing short of alarming. With  the United States Senate expected to begin nomination hearings this  week, we need to ensure that Congress follows a fair and thorough  vetting process as we evaluate the suitability of these individuals to  fill the various cabinet positions.   One source of concern is the process by which Republicans in Congress  are choosing to conduct these nominations. The recent Republican effort  to rush the nominees through the process does not invite confidence in  our ability to properly consider each individual on their merits.  Walter Shaub, Jr., Director of the Office of Government Ethics, raised  his concerns of this very fact given that his office is charged with  conducting ethics screening reviews of the nominees. The aggressive  hearing schedule to consider these nominees is unprecedented and has  placed an undue burden on the Office of Government Ethics (OCE) and its  ability to conduct thorough ethics reviews. These ethics reviews are  essential to the process and help us to identify potential conflicts of  interest or other ethical considerations before we confirm these  individuals to serve in public office. Director Shaub has stated that  it is unprecedented for the Senate to conduct a confirmation hearing  before the ethics review process has concluded. This is simply  unacceptable and undermines the democratic process.   The nominees themselves are also cause for concern. Namely, I believe  that the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General of  the U.S. Department of Justice threatens the best interests and safety  of the American people. Senator Sessions has served in the United  States Senate for twenty years, during which his record on civil rights  and other national issues was questionable at best. For example, he  voted several times against the reauthorization of the Violence Against  Women Act, which aimed to hold offenders of violence against women  accountable for their actions. He has also taken a very clear position  against rights for the LGBT community, which would deny these Americans  basic human rights. His positions on criminal justice and government  reforms are also disturbing.   Mr. Speaker, I have serious concerns about the means by which my  Republican colleagues are approaching the nomination process this  Congress. If we are to properly evaluate the qualifications and the  ethical suitability of these nominees, we must conduct an exhaustive  examination of each nominee based on their merits--not on their  politics. The Republicans are failing to uphold these basic principles  through their recent actions. In the name of protecting the American  people and doing what is best for our country, I urge my Republican  colleagues to return to normal order and delay these nomination  hearings until OCE can conclude its ethics reviews of the nominees.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Comer). Members are reminded to refrain  from engaging in personalities against Members of the Senate and the  President-elect.                            ____________________
