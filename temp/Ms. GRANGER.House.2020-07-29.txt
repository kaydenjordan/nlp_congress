 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 7027. As the country  navigates the ongoing reality of the coronavirus pandemic, childcare is  one of the most important issues we have to resolve. Congress must  put childcare solutions in place to help working families address their  needs, but this bill before us is not the answer.    This bill would appropriate $50 billion for the childcare industry-- more than its entire annual revenue. Overly burdensome and complicated  application requirements would accompany those funds. This means  providers would spend their time on applications and reporting  requirements rather than caring for the children and keeping them safe.  The bill creates unnecessary confusion by requiring providers to follow  CDC guidance and that of their State and local governments even when  those requirements may conflict.   The Committee on Appropriations has had no hearings or markups to  consider this bill. There has been no input from the minority, and  there is no opportunity today for amendments. Unfortunately, the  majority has yet again used this crisis as an opportunity to push  through partisan policy proposals instead of working together to  address the very real challenges we face. We can and we must do better  than the bills we are considering today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 7327.   American parents want and need reliable and safe childcare options  for their children while they are at work. Access to childcare is  especially important for those on the front lines addressing the  coronavirus. Providers face many new challenges during this pandemic as  they seek to understand new regulations and provide a healthy  environment for the children in their care.   Unfortunately, instead of helping American families and childcare  providers, this bill misses the mark. The bill includes an increase of  more than $7 billion in childcare funds, even though we know the CARES  Act funding still has not been made to some providers who need it.   There are also no safeguards to accompany the changes that are made  to the child and dependent care tax credit. We saw with the rollout of  the Paycheck Protection Program just how important it is to ensure  programs are targeted and tailored to help those who need it most.   Finally, programs for children have had a long history of bipartisan  support, so I am disappointed to see that end today. We need to take a  step back and ensure that any bill we pass addresses the problem  without creating more bureaucratic red tape for the childcare industry.   We must support parents and childcare providers so that they can get  our economy up and running again. Instead of passing partisan bills  made behind closed doors, we should be working together with the  administration on a proposal that can be signed into law.
