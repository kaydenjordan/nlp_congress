 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 912, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6617) making further continuing appropriations for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Further Additional  Extending Government Funding Act, which continues funding for Federal  programs and services through March 11. I would have preferred to come  before the House to pass a fiscal 2022 omnibus, but I believe we are  very close to an agreement and I am eager to move this process forward.  I have every expectation  [[Page H1053]]  that we can finalize a framework in short order and then work together  to fill in the details and enact an omnibus.   The American people deserve the certainty that comes with full-year  funding bills. The transformative investments an omnibus provides will  help create good-paying jobs and grow opportunity for the middle class.  An omnibus will expand access to childcare, strengthen our public  schools, make college more affordable, bolster job training, and help  small businesses access the capital they need to thrive. And it will  rebuild our public healthcare systems after the devastation of the  pandemic.                                time  1545    An omnibus bill will confront the climate crisis by supporting  environmental protection, land conservation, and clean energy  development. It will protect our national security and restore  America's place in the world.   An omnibus is the only way to unlock the full potential of the  transformative funding in the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act, accelerating the rebuilding of our Nation's crumbling roads,  bridges, water systems, and other critical transportation  infrastructure.   Of great importance to the people we represent, an omnibus would  enact Community Project Funding that both Republicans and Democrats  requested for their districts, with strong community support. From  rebuilding local health and transportation infrastructure, helping  veterans to find jobs, supporting small businesses, and expanding  educational opportunities, these investments will revitalize our  communities and strengthen them for years to come.   Once we have a framework, I am confident that appropriators will work  with great intensity to fill in the details so that we can enact an  agreement that is worthy of the American people.   To provide the time to get that done, the Further Additional  Extending Government Funding Act continues government funding at  current levels through March 11.   This legislation is straightforward and includes minimal anomalies,  the most notable of which is $350 million in direly needed new funding  to address water contamination from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage  Facility in Hawaii.   No one wins from additional continuing resolutions, which is why,  after we pass this extension, we will finalize an omnibus that will  deliver for our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Defense.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the chair of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Hawaii (Mr. Case), who is a member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first let me join Ranking Member Granger in expressing  my condolences at the unexpected passing of Appropriations Committee  staff member Dave Raser over the weekend.   Not an hour ago--to my colleague and ranking member--I spoke with his  father and expressed our condolences and our thoughts and prayers being  with him and assured them that they are not alone and that they have a  family here that mourns with them for the loss of Dave.   The gentlewoman from Texas so aptly described him and the promise for  his future.   Our thoughts and our prayers are with him, with his family, with his  sister, Emily, with whom, as my friend mentioned, he was very, very  close, and his friends and his co-workers.   Again, I join Ranking Member Granger's sadness at this great loss for  our committee.   Mr. Speaker, regarding the legislation before us, the American people  need a government funding agreement to support working families, expand  access to childcare, education, and job training. We need to be  supporting small businesses. We need to rebuild our public health and  transportation infrastructure, confront the climate crisis, provide  care and benefits for our veterans, and protect our national security.  That is what we need to be about.   Let us pass this continuing resolution. Let us complete an omnibus  and let us get the job done for the good people whom we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
