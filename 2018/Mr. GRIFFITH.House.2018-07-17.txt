 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I  appreciate Chairman Calvert's support as well, and the appropriators'  hard work on this.   This was created by Hal Rogers. It is fascinating because what  happens is that people say they want us to transition the economy in  central Appalachia. This is one of the ways to do that, and it actually  saves money.   We have a project in my district that we are close to getting  finalized on this, where it would cost $6.7 million to clean up a site,  if we did it the normal way. With this program, which we wish to  continue, it will only cost the government about 2.5, $2.6 million, and  we end up with a site that can be used again for economic development  and jobs in Appalachia.
