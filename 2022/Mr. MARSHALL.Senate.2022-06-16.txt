 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize the life of Mr. Veryl Switzer of Nicodemus, KS.   I stand before you today to mourn the loss of a Kansas State  University great, Veryl Switzer. While many may know of Veryl through  his football career, his legacy and impact on the University extend far  past the gridiron. He  [[Page S3002]]  came to Manhattan, KS, on a football scholarship in 1950 and would go  on to be one of the most well-rounded players in the history of the  program. An All-American from 1951 to 1953, Veryl led the team in  practically every statistical category on offense and, to this day,  still ranks in the top 10 for many punt-return categories. Veryl's  athletic achievements were not limited to the football field, as he was  the Big Seven Indoor Long Jump champion in 1952. Following an  illustrious career for the Wildcats, Veryl would be selected by the  Green Bay Packers with the fourth overall pick in the 1954 NFL Draft.   Veryl led the NFL in punt return average during his rookie season,  but would step away from the Green Bay Packers after just 24 games to  serve in the U.S. Air Force. After his time in the military, Veryl  played two more seasons of professional football in Canada. He would  then go on to work for the Chicago Board of Education for 10 years  before making his way back to Kansas State University. Once back at K- State, Veryl developed the first university wide student-minority  program, where many campus groups such as the Black Student Union,  Ebony Theater, and United Black Voices still exist due to his efforts.  A member of both the K-State athletics hall of fame and the football  team's ring of honor, Veryl's legacy will continue to live on through  the hearts and minds of his family, friends, and K-State fans across  the country.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the wonderful life  and career of Mr. Veryl Switzer. A true inspiration to the State of  Kansas, fighting ever fighting for a Wildcat victory.                            ____________________
