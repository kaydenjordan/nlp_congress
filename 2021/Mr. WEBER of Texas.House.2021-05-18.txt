 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  victims of the heinous attack on Santa Fe High School on this day back  in 2018.   Three years ago, Santa Fe, Texas, a salt-of-the-earth town in my  district, was confronted with an incomprehensible evil. Instead of  revisiting those horrendous acts of violence, today I rise to honor the  lives that were tragically cut short:   15-year-old Aaron Kyle McLeod;   15-year-old Angelique Ramirez;   14-year-old Kimberly Vaughan;   63-year-old Cynthia Tisdale;   17-year-old Sabika Sheikh;   17-year-old Jared Black;   16-year-old Shana Fisher;   64-year-old Glenda Ann Perkins;   15-year-old Christian Riley Garcia; and   17-year-old Christopher Stone, who was adventurous, understanding,  and easy to talk to.   Both Christopher and Christian have received medals of honor for the  deed they did.   Madam Speaker, it was a solemn day.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
