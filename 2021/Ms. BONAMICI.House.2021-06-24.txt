 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 13, a  resolution to repeal a harmful rule from the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission that threatens to delay or potentially deny  justice for individuals who face workplace discrimination.   As chair of the Education and Labor Committee's Civil Rights and  Human Services Subcommittee, I am pleased to co-lead the House  companion to this resolution because far too many workers still  experience workplace discrimination. The Civil Rights Act helps workers  seek redress by directing the EEOC to engage in conciliation, which  provides an opportunity for settlement before going to court.   But the EEOC's new rule added burdensome requirements, and it gives  employers unfair advantages in the conciliation process. Under the  rule, the EEOC discloses confidential information, analysis, and even  the identities of workers to employers, increasing the likelihood of  retaliation.   By passing this resolution, we can direct the EEOC to revert to its  prior practices, which were upheld by the Supreme Court.   Madam Speaker, I want to note that in the Mach Mining decision from  the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, the Court held that ``Every aspect of  the Title VII's conciliation provision smacks of flexibility. To begin  with, the EEOC need only to `endeavor' to conciliate a claim, without  having to devote a set amount of time or resources to that project.''   We can direct the EEOC to revert to those prior practices that were  upheld and that better support the needs of workers.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for his leadership, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
