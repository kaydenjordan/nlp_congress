 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Health Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           Access to Primary Care          Dr. Lee Gross, of Florida testified last       year at this Committee's fifth hearing on the cost of health       care. He told us that, after seven years as a primary care       doctor, he had an epiphany: too many government mandates and       insurance companies were getting between doctors and patients       and making primary care more expensive than it needed to be.        So in 2010, Dr. Gross created one of the first Direct       Primary Care practices. Instead of working with insurance       companies and government programs, Dr. Gross' patients pay       him a flat monthly fee directly: $60 a month per adult, $25 a       month for one child, and $10 a month for each additional       child.        Dr. Gross is one of more than 300,000 primary care doctors       in the United States who most of us go to see for day-to-day       medical care--receiving vaccines like the flu shot, annual       physicals, and help managing chronic conditions, like       diabetes. It is also our entry point to coordinate additional       medical care, if, for example, we need to get our hip       replaced or an MRI to diagnose a problem.        We heard from Dr. Brent James of the National Academies of       Medicine at our second hearing that between 30 and 50 percent       of what we spend on health care is unnecessary. I have asked       for specific suggestions on what the federal government can       do to lower the cost of health care for American families,       and this year, I am committed to passing legislation based on       that input to create better outcomes and better experiences       at a lower cost.        Dr. Gross' practice is one of about a thousand similar       clinics in the United States, and is a good example of how a       primary care doctor can help reduce costs. The first way Dr.       Gross does this is by helping with his patients' wellness.       For $60 a month, Dr. Gross can do EKGs and cortisone       injections, manage chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma,  [[Page S2429]]       and hypertension, and remove minor skin cancers right in his       office.        Second, by keeping you out of the emergency room. For $60 a       month, patients have unlimited office visits, and they can       also email, text, call and use an app to contact his office--      anytime, day or night. So for example, if you have stomach       pains at 11 pm, you could text Dr. Gross, who knows that it       might just be a side effect of a new medicine he prescribed       you.        And third, primary care is patients' access point to more       advanced care. When Dr. Gross refers people for additional       care, he is able to provide cost and quality information       about the different options, so his patients can choose the       best option.        For example, one of his patients with rheumatoid arthritis       was quoted $1,800 for blood work, but Dr. Gross was able to       find a laboratory to offer the blood tests for under $100.       This echoes what Adam Boehler, who leads the Center for       Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, recently told me. He       estimated that primary care is only 3-7 percent of health       care spending but affects as much as half of all health care       spending. And as Dr. Roizen of the Cleveland Clinic has said       before this Committee, regular visits to your primary care       doctor, along with keeping your immunizations up to date and       maintaining at least four measures of good health, such as a       healthy body mass index and blood pressure, will help you       avoid chronic disease about 80 percent of the time.        This is important because, according to Dr. Roizen, over 84       percent of all health care spending is on chronic conditions       like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. I believe we can       empower primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, and       physicians assistants to go even a step further.        At our fourth hearing, we heard about how the cost of       health care is in a black box--patients have no idea how much       a particular treatment or test will end up costing. Even if       information on the cost and quality of health care is easily       accessible, patients still have trouble comparing different       health care options.        For example, earlier this year, hospitals began to post       their prices online, as required by the Centers for Medicare       and Medicaid Services, but to the average consumer, this       information has proved to be incomprehensible.        And while the data may be incomprehensible today, it is a       ripe opportunity for innovation from private companies, like       Health Care Bluebook, a Tennessee company that testified a       hearing last fall, and non-profit organizations to arrange       the data so primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, and       physicians assistants can help their patients have better       outcomes and better experiences at lower costs.        There are other ways to lower health care costs through       expanded access to primary care. Dr. Gross' direct primary       care clinic is one example. Another is community health       centers, which we talked about at our last hearing and that       are where 27 million Americans go for their primary care. And       employers are increasingly taking an active role in their       employees' health and in the cost of health care.        One of our new committee members, Senator Braun, was an       employer of a thousand people and was aggressive about       helping his employees reduce health care costs. Like primary       care doctors, more good data could help employers like       Senator Braun more effectively lower health care costs.       Employers are also employing a doctor on-site so employees       don't have to take time off of work to see a primary care       doctor.        On-site primary care makes it easier to keep employees       healthy by helping to manage a chronic condition or get a       referral to a specialist. Today, I am interested in hearing       more about specific recommendations to improve access to       affordable primary care.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Access to Care: Health Centers and Providers in Underserved Communities          This is the first hearing of the new       Congress so let me take a few minutes to talk about what we       hope to accomplishment these next two years.        Number one, reducing health care costs. And number two,       making sure a college degree is worth students' time and       money.        On health care costs, this Committee has held five hearings       on reducing the cost of health care. Testimony from Dr. Brent       James, a member of the National Academy of Medicine, said       that up to half of health care spending is unnecessary.        That startled me and it should startle the American people.       That is a massive burden on American families, businesses,       and state and federal budgets.        I sent a letter to health experts, including the witnesses       at our five hearings, asking for specific recommendations to       reduce health care costs. I'd like to encourage anyone with a       specific recommendation to submit your comment by March 1 to       [emailÂ protected].        A second priority is updating the Higher Education Act to       ensure that the expense of a college education is worth it       for students. The last time we seriously addressed higher       education was in 2007. A lot has happened since then.        In 2007, there was no iPhone. A micro-blogging company       named Twitter had just gained its own separate platform and       started to scale globally. And Amazon released something       called Kindle. In a new book, New York Times columnist Tom       Friedman puts his finger on the year 2007 as ``the       technological inflection point.'' So we need to take a look       at this federal support for higher education that affects 20       million students and 6000 universities, colleges, and       technical institutions. And our goal includes simplifying the       federal aid application; a fairer way for students to repay       their loans; and a new system of accountability for colleges.        I will be working on these priorities with Ranking Member       Patty Murray, with members of the HELP Committee, and other       Senators interested reaching a result on lowering health care       costs and updating the Higher Education Act.        We hope to complete our work on both of these things in the       first six months of this year.        And in addition, in these next few months, we need to       reauthorize the Older Americans Act, which supports the       organization and delivery of social and nutrition services to       older adults and their caregivers and reauthorize the Child       Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, important legislation       that funds major grant programs that provide a social       services response to issues of child abuse and neglect.        And today's topic--extending federal funding for community       health centers, as well as four other federal health       programs, which are all set to expire at the end of this       fiscal year.        Community health centers actually fit into a larger topic       of great interest to this Committee, which is primary care.       There are more than 300,000 primary care doctors in the       United States, according to the American Medical Association.       This is the doctor that most of us go to see for day-to-day       medical care--an annual physical, flu vaccine, or help       managing a chronic condition like diabetes. It is our access       point to additional medical care, and can refer us to       specialists, if, for example, we need to get our hip replaced       or a MRI.        Adam Boehler, who leads the Center for Medicare and       Medicaid Innovation, estimated that primary care is only 2-7       percent of health care spending but could help to impact as       much as half of all health care spending.        We will be having a hearing next week on how primary care       can help control health care costs. Today, we are talking       about a prime example of primary care: 27 million Americans       receive their primary care and other services at community       health centers.        For example, in Tennessee, after Lewis County's only       hospital closed, the closest emergency room for its 12,000       residents was 30 minutes away. The old hospital building was       turned into the Lewis Health Center, a community health       center which operates as something between a clinic and full       hospital.        Lewis Health Center estimates they can deal with about 90       percent of patients that walk in the door. The center has a       full laboratory to run tests, can perform X-rays or give IVs,       and keeps an ambulance ready to take patients to a partnering       hospital if they need more care. Because the Lewis Health       Center is a community health center, they charge patients       based on a sliding scale which means more people have access       to and can afford health care.        Community health centers like Lewis Health Center are one       way American families can have access to affordable health       care close to home. This includes a wide range of health       care, including preventive care, help managing chronic       conditions like asthma or high blood pressure, vaccines, and       prenatal care. There are about 1,400 federally-funded health       centers that provide outpatient care to approximately 27       million people, including 400,000 Tennesseans, at about       12,000 sites across the United States. These other locations       could be a mobile clinic or at a homeless shelter or school.        Community health centers have also been an important part       of combating the opioid crisis that has impacted virtually       every community across the country.        Last year, the Department of Health and Human Services       provided over $350 million in funding specifically to support       community health centers providing care for Americans in need       of substance use disorder or mental health services.        And in 2017, 65,000 Americans received medication-assisted       treatment for substance use disorders at a community health       center. These centers accept private insurance, Medicare and       Medicaid, and charge patients based on a sliding fee scale so       that those who are in need of care receive it, regardless of       ability to pay.        Community health centers also receive federal funding to       help cover their costs. In Fiscal Year 2019, these centers       received $4 billion in mandatory funding and $1.6 billion in       discretionary funding. Congress has to act by the end of       September to make sure community health centers continue to       receive this federal funding and keep their doors open.  [[Page S2430]]         Two weeks ago, Senator Murray and I took the first step by       introducing legislation that will extend funding for       community health centers for five years at $4 billion a year       in mandatory funding.        The legislation also extends funding for four additional       federal health programs set to expire in September: the       Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program;       National Health Service Corps; Special Diabetes Program; and       Special Diabetes Program for Indians.        Today we will hear about how the community health centers       program is working and how to ensure 27 million Americans can       continue to have access to quality health care closer to       their homes and at a more affordable cost.        Community health centers, and hospitals across the country,       rely on a well-trained health care workforce.        Two federally funded workforce programs, which train       doctors and nurses, expire this year.        The first is the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education Program that helps train primary care doctors and       dentists in community-based settings, often at community       health centers.        And second, the National Health Service Corps, which       provides scholarships and loan repayment for health care       professionals who go to work in rural or underserved areas.        More than half of these doctors choose to work at one of       the 12,000 community health centers and affiliated sites       across the country as part of their service requirement.        I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today and       learning more about all three of these programs, and       discussing how we can work together to ensure funding for       these programs is extended so Americans can continue to have       access to affordable health care closer to home.                            ____________________
