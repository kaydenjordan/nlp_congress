 Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished  gentleman from Washington for yielding.   I was pleased to offer an amendment to H.R. 2500 to expand the  liberal consideration standard given by discharge review boards and  boards for the correction of military records to victims of military  sexual trauma, to survivors of intimate partner violence and domestic  abuse.   Members of the Armed Forces who were victims of intimate partner  violence have sometimes received less than honorable discharges because  of behavior caused by their underlying trauma. This discharge status  may exclude them from receiving veterans benefits, including services  to help address their trauma.   Less than honorable discharge statuses are associated with higher  rates of homelessness and suicide. Simply put, these discharge statuses  are retraumatizing, and survivors deserve better.   My amendment would have ensured victims of intimate partner violence  receive the same liberal consideration standard as other victims of  sexual assault in the Armed Forces. All survivors should be believed  and treated with compassion, regardless of the violence they  experienced.   I appreciate the willingness of the House Armed Services Committee  staff to work with my team to try to get this provision included in the  House NDAA. Unfortunately, due to budgetary rules, we were unable to  find a path forward. A provision that mirrors my amendment was included  in the Senate NDAA, thanks to the tremendous leadership of Senators  Gillibrand and Ernst.   Chairman Smith, when the House and Senate conferences our two bills,  will you work with the Senate to see this provision included in the  final conference bill?   I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his  response.
