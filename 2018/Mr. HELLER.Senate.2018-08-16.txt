 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute  and honor to one of the great Nevadans of our lifetime--Senator Paul  Laxalt. Last week, Senator Laxalt passed away at the age of 96, having  forever changed the State of Nevada and this country. The State motto  in Nevada is ``All for our Country,'' and Senator Laxalt exemplified  that principle every day by giving his all through public service for  every Nevadan.   Paul Dominique Laxalt was born on August 2, 1922, and grew up in my  hometown of Carson City, NV. His parents had both emigrated from the  Basque region in Europe and brought their values and traditions to  northern Nevada. Even today, Basque influences, like chorizo, lamb, and  sweetbreads, are still staples of life in northern Nevada.   As the son of a Basque sheepherder, Paul made his mark early in life  by attending Carson High School, playing on the 1938 State championship  basketball team, and as a student body president--which is significant,  and I will share more in a few minutes.   Paul would go on to serve his country in the U.S. Army as a medic  during World War II, and he saw action in the Philippines. After the  war, like many Americans, Paul started a family. He married Jackalyn  Ross in 1946, and they had six children: Gail, Sheila, Michelle, Kevin,  Kathleen, and John Paul.   Paul began his career in public service when he served as a district  attorney for what was then Ormsby County, NV. He then won his first  statewide race, serving as Lieutenant Governor from 1963 to 1967.  During his term, Paul made the decision to run for the U.S. Senate in  1964 and challenged then-Senator Howard Cannon. In one of the closest  races in Nevada history, Paul lost his bid for the Senate by just 48  votes. A result like that could break a lesser man, but Paul picked  himself up and won the Nevada governorship just a few years later.   Under Governor Laxalt, Nevada began growing and turning into the  State we know today. He helped establish the community college system  and the first medical school in Nevada. Under his guidance, Nevada's  gaming industry was transformed, and his vision for our State's future  is now enjoyed by millions of tourists each year who visit Nevada for  our world-class attractions, our services, and our entertainment.   It was during that time that Paul started to become friends with  another famous Governor in neighboring California--Ronald Reagan.  Together, they worked to protect and preserve Lake Tahoe for future  generations. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency--the TRPA--is the  premier bistate compact to save the lake, and in 2020 we will celebrate  its 50th year.   After his work as Governor, Paul decided the time was right to make  another run for the U.S. Senate. This time he won, and he served the  State of Nevada from 1974 to 1987. As a U.S. Senator, he continued his  faithful dedication to his friend Ronald Reagan and served as his  Presidential campaign chairman in 1976, 1980, and 1984. He also served  as general chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to  1987.   Senator Laxalt was famously called ``the first friend'' of President  Reagan's. Together, they helped each other  [[Page S5673]]  set our country down a new path of prosperity and freedom.   Senator Laxalt was a hero and a mentor to me and many others who grew  up in Carson City.   Like Paul, my mother, my children, and I also went to Carson High  School. I played on the basketball team, and my daughter Emmy was the  student body president, following in Senator Laxalt's shoes.   Before my daughter Emmy took office, she reached out to previous  Carson High School student body presidents to ask for their advice.  Senator Laxalt was gracious and told her the following:         When I was elected as student body president, Franklin       Roosevelt was the President of the United States. With World       War II looming on the horizon, my fellow classmates and I had       no idea how dramatically our lives would be altered in the       next few years. Of course, the school itself was much       different. I doubt there were more than 30 students in my       entire class. Until my senior year, all classes--K through       12--were in the same building!    He then said:         I'm not entirely comfortable offering advice, particularly       to someone who knows more than me! I would just tell you to       have fun and enjoy every single day, remember those who       elected you, and always do what you--Emmy Heller--think is       right.    I know Emmy has never forgotten that advice.   Senator Laxalt set a high bar for all us kids who went to Carson High  School but also showed us all the possibilities of what could be  achieved as Nevadans.   When I was sworn in as a freshman Member of the House of  Representatives, Senator Laxalt was there for me on day one. I will  never forget his support and his advice: Always stay close to family,  friends, and your constituents. They will never lead you astray.   Having been a Presidential campaign adviser to President Reagan,  President Bush, and Senator Dole, Senator Laxalt's advice carried great  weight, and I knew I needed to listen to every piece of advice he was  willing to give me.   Senator Laxalt also had a profound impact on many of my colleagues in  the Senate. It didn't matter whether you were a Democrat or Republican,  Senator Laxalt would be your friend. In fact, on my very first day as a  Senator, I remember my colleague Senator Leahy telling me about all of  his work and his fond memories of his friend Senator Laxalt.   Senator Laxalt showed us all what true friendship is. His character  and warmth that he shared with all of us will never be forgotten. I  extend my deepest condolences to Senator Laxalt's wife Carol and to  their entire family. I will miss my friend Senator Laxalt. His  colleagues in the Senate will miss their friend, and the people of  Nevada will miss their friend.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
