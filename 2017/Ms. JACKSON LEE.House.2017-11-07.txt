 Mr. Speaker, there are so many things that the  American people have to deal with, and I think you have heard many of  us offer our sympathy and concern for the tragedy that happened in my  State, and, clearly, one more thing that we don't want to deal with,  the shooting of those people of faith praying on their day of worship,  which is what happened in Texas on Sunday.   So, today, I am introducing H.R. 4268, the Gun Safety Not Sorry Act  of 2017, that addresses a 7-day waiting period for purchases or sales  of semiautomatic firearms, silencers, armor-piercing ammunition, or  large capacity ammunition magazines for purchase or transfer.   And let me respond to those who offered mental health. The data shows  that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other  countries with fewer mass shootings. But it shows that it is estimated  that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to  mental health issues.   Let's not keep giving excuses or blaming people with mental health  issues. I can assure you that is not the problem. As the article in the  New York Times says, it is all about guns--guns, guns, guns.   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4268.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I couldn't have had a wager with a greater Member of Congress. I love  his orange tie. I love him looking at this sign: Beat LA.   All of those players--LA Dodgers and the Houston Astros--had great  character and great sportsmanship.   I love the sandwiches. Let's do it again. Let's see them in 2018 in  the World Series.   Go Astros.
