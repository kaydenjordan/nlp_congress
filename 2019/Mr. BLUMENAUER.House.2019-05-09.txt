 Madam Speaker, it is with great sadness that I note  the passing of Larry Hanley, the international president of the  Amalgamated Transit Union.   He was a big man with a big heart and a passion for transportation-- not just for what it meant for his members; although, he was their  tireless champion. He had a bold vision for what his union meant, to  enrich tens of millions of lives every day for people who use transit  and another hundred million who benefit, even if they don't ride.   He started as a bus driver and rose through the ranks to become not  just the Amalgamated Transit Union president, but one of the finest of  American labor leaders.   We are sad for the loss for Larry's wife, Thelma; his daughter,  Monica; son, Larry, Jr.; and almost 200,000 of his members.   We are grateful for the enormous contributions he made to enrich the  lives of us all.                            ____________________
