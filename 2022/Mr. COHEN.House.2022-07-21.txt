 Madam Speaker, the Republicans are so upset. The reality  is it  [[Page H6938]]  is their Supreme Court and Justice Alito who opened Pandora's box. When  we opened up the box and looked in, we saw there were nesting eggs.  There were all kinds of issues there that were going to come to the  fore.   Clarence Thomas put a spotlight on it. It involved gay marriage and  contraception. It was going to go further than Roe v. Wade. When they  said they were originalists, we didn't realize what they meant by  ``originalist'' was everything origin came from them. They didn't care  about precedent.   Alito said Roe v. Wade was important precedent. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh  said it was precedent that Roe v. Wade was settled. You can't trust the  Supreme Court. They are radicals. They want to overturn privacy rights  for all people in this country.   Freedom is at stake. This bill needs to pass, and the only reason  this bill is properly before this Congress is because of that Supreme  Court that has gone off the radical right.
