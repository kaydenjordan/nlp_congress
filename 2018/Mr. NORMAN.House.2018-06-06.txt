 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to announce to  the 115th session of Congress that Lancaster County Sheriff Barry Faile  was named the 2018 Sheriff of the Year by the South Carolina Sheriffs  Association. This honor was bestowed on Sheriff Faile by his peers  representing 46 counties.   He began his career in law enforcement 29 years ago where he began as  a patrol deputy in 1989 and moved through the ranks of every department  until 2009 when he was elected sheriff.   Under the leadership of Sheriff Faile, the accomplishments include:  national accreditation of his office; implementation of body cameras;  Neighborhood Crime Watch programs grown from 12 neighborhoods to 37 in  2 years; and creation of the first Crowd Control Unit in 2017.   In 2011, Sheriff Faile led the agency through a gang investigation  resulting in one of the first grand jury indictments by the State  Attorney's office of 15 local gang members, along with the arrest of  local members of the Hells Angels as part of a statewide crackdown.   His commitment to the local Lancaster community includes serving as a  board member of Springs Memorial Hospital, the Rotary Breakfast Club,  and the USC Lancaster Educational Foundation.   He is currently the president of the South Carolina Sheriffs  Association. Sheriff Faile is only the third person in our area to win  this prestigious award.                            ____________________
