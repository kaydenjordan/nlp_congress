 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the recently  passed Inflation Reduction Act and the massive financial relief it will  bring to hardworking American families.   The Inflation Reduction Act is monumental. It is historic. It will do  several things, including: lower prescription drug prices; lower the  cost of healthcare for millions; lower energy costs; and lower the  deficit and reducing inflation.   On top of this, President Biden recently went a step further in  helping Americans by announcing his remarkable student loan relief  program. This is huge for many young Americans.   It is simple. House Democrats and President Biden are producing  results for the American people because together, we are putting people  over politics.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to celebrating these key victories at the  White House this afternoon alongside the President and following these  remarks I will be going straight over there.                            ____________________
