 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as Congress debates another extension of  the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF.   While TANF remains a vital program to millions of Americans, and I  support an extension, I am disappointed in my colleagues across the  aisle for not taking the opportunity to discuss much-needed reforms to  TANF, which are long overdue. In fact, since the program began in 1996,  TANF has had only one true reauthorization and has been simply extended  38 times, including four times in the last 2 years since I have been in  Congress.   Today, we debate another extension until September 30. However,  another extension does not allow us to discuss proposals to reform TANF  to help Americans get jobs needed for an independent and prosperous  life.   Unlike my colleagues, Republicans have put forth such a proposal  called the JOBS for Success Act. The bill expands services to connect  people receiving TANF with tailored skills training and jobs. It also  allows States to fund apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs,  and it expands funding for work-related transportation costs and  childcare. In return, the JOBS for Success Act strengthens  accountability for securing a job and maintaining it.   These commonsense reforms are needed now more than ever. Under our  new Tax Code, our booming economy has more jobs than workers for the  first time in history: 7.5 million job openings versus 5.8 million  unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Now is the  time for people to get the support and training they need to take part  in this historic economic recovery.   Reforming TANF in Congress should be a great first step toward this  goal. I know this because I have seen how reforms to TANF can help  those in need.   In my home State of Kansas, we allowed TANF dollars to go to the JAG  program, which helps at-risk high school students graduate and get a  successful career path. In Kansas, JAG has a 91 percent graduation rate  and 80 percent employment rate, both above the national average for JAG  students.   This one statewide reform is an example of the potential that exists  if we come together to look at potential national reforms to TANF and  to help families in need and give them the support they need.                                time  1545    Unfortunately, it appears that my colleagues across the aisle are  okay with simply kicking the TANF can down the road for the 39th time  without discussing the JOBS for Success Act or offering any sort of  reform proposal.   As we debate this extension bill, I continue to call on my colleagues  to work with us on reforming TANF and developing a full reauthorization  bill, not just continuing to kick the can down the road.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
