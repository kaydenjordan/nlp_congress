 Madam President, I rise to talk about the continuing  challenge that our agricultural communities face across this country.   Just a couple of weeks ago, I came to the floor and cited a Wall  Street Journal article with the headline: ``The Next American Farm Bust  Is Upon Us.'' Living in eastern Colorado, in a purely 100 percent  agricultural community, I understand that when there is a downturn in  the ag economy, it does not affect businesses on Main Street later that  week or later that month; it affects them that very same day. He is not  just somebody who is going in to buy a bag of seed or somebody who is  going to the local implement dealer to buy a tractor. He is somebody  who decides he is not going to be able to buy that pair of blue jeans  that he thought he would or that piece of equipment he needed to help  fix the fence. It means that the entire economy in towns like Yuma, CO,  Burlington, CO, and Dove Creek, CO, are going to suffer enormously.  That is why it is important that we continue the conversation in the  U.S. Senate about what is happening in agriculture across this country.   I recognize that many people, when they think of Colorado, probably  do not think of farms and ranches on the flatlands and prairies. They  probably think more of Kansas for that than they do Colorado. If you  look at Colorado, it is more than just snowcapped peaks; it is  incredible agricultural diversity as well.   According to the 2016 National Agricultural Statistics Survey,  Colorado ranks in the top 10 in production for the following  agriculture commodities: barley, beans, sweet corn, alfalfa, potatoes,  millet, sorghum, sunflowers, wheat, cabbage, cantaloupe, onions,  cattle, lamb, and wool. Colorado is one of the top 10 producers in  those commodities. It is a remarkable list that shows the diversity of  Colorado from the plains to the mountains and the incredible production  levels that we have achieved.   One of the goals I have had in the Senate, of course, is to help make  sure that we have the right policies to support our farmers and  ranchers throughout Colorado who are producing everything from barley  to potatoes. I want to make sure that we work to add even more crops to  this list of the top 10 in order to strengthen the agricultural  industry in Colorado.   As I mentioned a few weeks ago when I came to the floor to talk about  that crisis, the Wall Street Journal article highlighted a story from a  farmer in Kansas. I recently talked to a farmer in eastern Colorado who  is getting paid $3.21 for a bushel of corn, but to pay the bills, his  break-even point on that bushel of corn--the amount of money that it  took to make that corn bushel--was $3.92 cents. So he was getting paid  $3.21, and it cost him $3.92. That is not the right side of an equation  to be on if you are in business and, particularly, if you are hoping to  pass that business on to future generations.   I think it is important that the Senate talk about commodity prices  and that we talk about the impact that increased Federal regulations  have had which make it more difficult for that farmer to survive, that  have driven up the cost of doing business, that have driven up the cost  that you need to be paid per bushel of corn so that you can help make  ends meet.   I talk about barriers to exports and limited financing options. Those  are four things that we have to lay out--commodity prices--and deal  with. We have to make sure that we are decreasing the number of Federal  regulations. We have to make sure that we remove barriers to export and  allow agriculture to export. We have to make sure that we are removing  any obstacles to the financing that a farmer or a rancher may have,  particularly if the economy continues to deteriorate in our  countryside, and we have to make sure that we have certainty in ag  policy and certainty in regulations. The farm bill conversations  continue. Let's make sure that we provide the certainty to our ag  communities that they deserve and, quite frankly, demand.   According to the 2017 Colorado Business Economic Outlook--and this is  an incredible statistic--net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be  down almost 80 percent since the records that were set in 2011. By 80  percent, net farm and ranch incomes are projected to be down. An 80  percent drop in just a few years is devastating for rural communities.  I believe the exact numbers in Colorado are something like going from  $1.8 billion in farm income to a little over $300 million in farm  income just over a matter of a few years.   While we have done a good job of addressing regulatory concerns, we  have to make sure that we are doing a good job of addressing continued  trade opportunities in this country as well. Corn and wheat prices are  hitting 10-year lows. The price is so low that it costs farmers more to  produce the crop, as I mentioned, than it is worth on the market. You  do not have to be an economist to figure out that that is not going to  let you stay in business for much longer.    Simply put, we have a lot of people who are worried in Colorado and  across this country for agriculture and our rural communities, which  are dependent on their farms and ranches. The Presiding Officer is from  the great State of Iowa--a leader in this country when it comes to  agriculture. Whether you live in the Eastern Plains of Colorado or in  the great State of Iowa, the fact is we have to provide that leadership  on a global stage to make sure that our ag communities survive and  thrive.   Earlier this year, I sent a letter to the Colorado Farm Bureau that  solicited feedback on what Congress and the Federal Government could do  to support Colorado agriculture. In their response, I received a number  of recommendations from the Colorado Farm Bureau and a number of  organizations that they reached out to to respond to my request and my  question.   On the list, of course, was regulatory reform--one of the four  pillars that we have to address in order to have successful agriculture  in this country. Their concern is that overregulation creates  uncertainty in regulations like the waters of the United States and the  BLM 2.0 rules.   The good news is that, with regard to both of these rules, we have  been able to roll them back. According to the Colorado Farm Bureau, the  waters of the United States regulation threatened to add additional  regulatory compliance requirements to thousands of stream miles and  thousands of acres of agricultural land.   To put that in layman's terms, it basically would have said: Hey,  you, the Federal Government, you are in charge of every molecule of  water.   That is not good for agriculture. Thankfully, the administration has  said: No, we are going to stop that, and we are going to repeal it.  Courts across this country had actually put in stays.   The Presiding Officer from the great State of Iowa--our colleague,  Joni Ernst--was a leader when it came to stopping the waters of the  United States regulation. Luckily, we have seen that regulation being  stopped in its tracks.   In Colorado, two-thirds of waterways were identified as what is known  as  [[Page S2069]]  ``intermittent flow.'' That means that they do not have water in them  year round, that, part of the year, they are dry. Yet they would have  been subject to a regulation known as the waters of the United States,  even though they did not have water in them. That is the absurdity of  the Federal Government. So I am glad that we are able to start rolling  back these regulations.   At the same time, the Bureau of Land Management had started a process  known as its BLM 2.0 rulemaking process, which is a rule that they had  issued that they thought would deal with complex permitting issues and  land use decisions. Unfortunately, what this rule would have done  instead is take away access to thousands of acres of Federal land that  were used for grazing. Even more disturbing, it would have given  somebody in downtown New York City just as much say over the land in  Moffat County, CO, as a Moffat County commissioner--somebody who lives  there--amongst various agencies in the Federal Government that oversee  thousands of acres of public lands. That, too, was overturned by the  U.S. Senate.   In fact, if you look at the total number of regulations that the  administration and that the U.S. Congress has been able to overturn, we  are approaching $60 billion worth of regulatory relief that we have  been able to give to the American people; $60 billion worth of  regulations have been taken off the backs of hard-working Americans and  has allowed them to do their jobs easier, allowed them to make ends  meet easier, allowed them to breathe easier when it comes to job  creation and job opportunity.   I am very glad that we saw the BLM 2.0 rule repealed, which gives our  people in Colorado a little bit more of a chance to have a say in what  happens in their front yards and their backyards. Of course, the waters  of the United States has to continue to be something that we stop as we  move forward.   There are other positive steps we should take to give our producers  additional regulatory certainty. I know there is more that we can do,  and I hope to hear from our Nation's farmers and ranchers and our  farmers and ranchers in Colorado on how Congress and the Federal  Government can help.   So I use this opportunity to make an appeal to people across the  country in order to hear from farmers and ranchers, whether you are in  the Eastern Plains of Colorado or on the Western Slope of Colorado or  in the great State of Iowa or Kansas or anywhere in between and outside  the State of Colorado--inside and outside--of the things that we can be  doing, such as with trade policy, regulatory policy, financial services  opportunities, making sure we have farm bill programs that are working.  Back in my office, we want to hear about these ideas and about thoughts  moving forward on these important issues so that we can have an  agricultural community that thrives and so that we can make sure that,  when we talk about bringing generations of farmers and ranchers back to  the farm and the ranch, we will get their ideas on how best to do that.   This week, I will be sending letters to the Colorado Agriculture  Council, which is made up of organizations across the agricultural  spectrum in Colorado, as well as to Don Brown, who is the commissioner  of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, on what else Congress and  the Federal Government can do to help support this industry. Also,  there is Julie McCaleb, the Colorado Agriculture Council chair.   Basically, I will be writing: Hey, whether it is regulations or  legislation, it is important that the administration and Congress  understand the impact their policies will have on agriculture. I look  forward to hearing from you, your member organizations, and farmers and  ranchers throughout the State on how we can work together to ensure  Colorado agriculture continues to be effectively represented in  Washington.   We will be sending this letter, of course, to Commissioner Don Brown.  Commissioner Brown is from my hometown. He is a corn farmer and a  cattleman. He is somebody who understands firsthand the hard work and  challenges that go into making ends meet in agriculture. He also  understands the suffering that we are seeing in the farmland right now  and that some people may be at their wits' end in terms of trying to  deal with their financial struggles.   We will be sending these letters out. I encourage people--farmers,  ranchers, and leaders in counties--to contact my office and give us  their ideas on how we can turn this ``could be coming'' crisis around  so that we can actually start improving and growing agriculture again  and so that we can make sure that we lead Colorado's diverse  agricultural economy into a better state than it is today--in a better  place than it is today--in terms of the economy.   Here, in the Senate, I believe that same bipartisan support exists  for all of us to be reaching out to our communities and making sure  that we hear from the heartland of America what we can do to help  struggling farmers and ranchers.   I thank the Senator for her leadership in agriculture.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I come to the floor once again today to  talk about the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme  Court.   In the 235 years of our Nation's history with the Constitution, there  has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  Justice. What I mean by that is this: No Supreme Court nominee has ever  been rejected by a partisan filibuster on the floor of the Senate. Now,  sure, we can argue about the 1968 bipartisan attempt to make sure that  then-Associate Justice Abe Fortas wasn't elevated to the Chief Justice  position.   What this Chamber is facing today isn't a question of whether we will  abide by the Biden rule. The Biden rule, of course, was when Joe Biden  said: During the last term of the outgoing President, when the office  is up for election, we are not going to confirm any nominees. This  isn't an argument over whether Chuck Schumer was right when Senator  Chuck Schumer said: Heck, over the last couple of years of the Bush  administration, we are not going to allow a Justice to be confirmed.   That is not what we are arguing about today. We are arguing about  whether a brilliant legal mind, a judge who has proven incredible legal  temperament over the last several months since his nomination, a judge  who has agreed 97 percent of the time with the majority decisions of  the court, should receive an up-or-down vote.   Have no doubt that this is a historic opportunity for this Chamber to  come together to prove that we believe in that 230-year precedent of  confirming Supreme Court Justices. This is an opportunity we have to  come together on a judge who just 11 years ago was confirmed  unanimously by voice vote. There was no opposition 11 years ago to  Judge Gorsuch when he was confirmed to be placed on the Tenth Circuit  Court, which is based in Denver. Now, the Denver-based court, the Tenth  Circuit Court, covers about 20 percent of our Nation's land mass. It is  a huge, huge area. This is a court that deals with public lands cases.  This is a court that deals with water issues, complex public lands  issues, and Tribal issues. This is a judge who has been a part of 2,700  opinions, voting 97 percent of the time with the majority of the court.   Now, the majority of the court aren't all George W. Bush or George  H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan nominees. The nominees in the Tenth Circuit  Court are bipartisan justices. It is filled with Democratic and  Republican appointees. That is the Tenth Circuit Court, with whom Judge  Gorsuch has worked. Judge Gorsuch has been somebody known as a feeder  judge. A feeder judge is somebody that the Supreme Court--when they are  looking to select clerks to help the Justices do their work--looks to,  like Judge Gorsuch, to provide them with law clerks to help them at the  Supreme Court. They do that because he is an incredible and outstanding  jurist, somebody who has the respect on both sides of the aisle,  Republican and Democrat. That is why he is a feeder judge. That is why  he was confirmed 11 years ago by a bipartisan body of Senators.   In the last couple of weeks, we have seen days' worth of hearings  where each Senator has been able to speak for an hour or so,  questioning Judge Gorsuch, days' worth of hearings where the American  people witnessed as Judge Gorsuch laid out his legal philosophy and his  temperament, and where he displayed the even temperament we need on a  Supreme Court--the kind of temperament that not only is able to work  with colleagues but understand complex legal cases. And 11 years ago  his confirmation was so noncontroversial that when it came to his  confirmation, Senator Lindsey Graham was the only one who showed up. He  was the only one at the confirmation hearing. That is how  noncontroversial it was. What a difference a court makes.   Now, let's talk about some of the Senators who supported him, or at  least didn't object to him, 11 years ago. Then, Minority Leader Chuck  Schumer didn't oppose Judge Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit Court. Senator  Leahy, a member of the Judiciary Committee, did not object to Judge  Gorsuch. Senator Feinstein, another member of the Judiciary Committee,  didn't oppose Neil Gorsuch. Senator Durbin, the minority whip, did not  oppose Judge Neil Gorsuch 11 years ago. Senator Cantwell, Senator  Carper, Senator Menendez, Senator Murray--none of them opposed Judge  Gorsuch's confirmation to the Tenth Circuit Court. Senator Nelson,  Senator Reed, Senator Stabenow, Senator Wyden--all of them here today.  None of them objected to Neil Gorsuch.   It is even more than that. Then-Senator Barack Obama did not object  to Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Then-Senator Hillary Clinton didn't  object to Judge Gorsuch's nomination. Then-Senator Joe Biden helped  pass his confirmation, his appointment, and made sure it cleared on a  voice vote.   To hear the partisan bickering here is extremely disappointing and  disingenuous. So I hope this Chamber will do what we do best in this  country, and that is to come together on issues of doing our job of  confirming a Supreme Court Justice after spending the past several  months complaining that the Supreme Court wasn't filled.   This judge should receive bipartisan support, as he did 11 years ago.  I guess the question has to be asked of people who are now opposing  Judge Gorsuch today, who either supported or did not object to him 11  years ago: Did they not do their work 11 years ago? Did they not  realize he was a bad judge? Or has the time of politics changed? Or are  we just dealing with a President whom they have decided they don't want  to have a Supreme Court Justice from? I guess that is what has perhaps  changed the most over the past 11 years, because there is not really a  narrative we can point to for a reason of why they should oppose him,  other  [[Page S2079]]  than people just deciding that the politics of the now require it, and  that is incredibly disappointing.   If we look at Judge Gorsuch's statements, he talks about Justice  Scalia's vision of the good and faithful judge. I think it is a worthy  one that we focus on because of what it means to Judge Gorsuch--soon to  be Justice Gorsuch--to be a good and faithful judge:         It seems to me that the separation of legislative and       judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the       Constitution. Neither is it just about ensuring that two       institutions with basically identical functions are balanced       one against the other.        To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were       distinct by nature and their separation was among the most       important liberty-protecting devices of constitutional       design, an independent right of the people essential to the       preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the       Constitution and its amendments.        Now consider . . . if we allowed the judge to act like a       legislature. Unconstrained by the bicameralism and       presentment hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only       his own vote, or those of just a few colleagues, to revise       the law willy-nilly in accordance with his preferences and       the task of legislating would become a relatively simple       thing.        Notice, too, how hard it would be to revise this so-easily-      made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world       or to fix mistakes. Unable to throw judges out of office in       regular elections, you'd have to wait for them to die before       you'd have any chance of change. And even then you'd find       change difficult, for courts cannot so easily undo their       errors given the weight they afford precedent.        Notice finally how little voice the people would be left in       a government where life-appointed judges are free to       legislate alongside elected representatives.        The very idea of self-government would seem to wither to       the point of pointlessness.        Indeed, it seems that for reasons just like these Hamilton       explained that ``liberty can have nothing to fear from the       judiciary alone,'' but that it ``ha[s] everything to fear       from [the] union'' of the judicial and legislative powers. .       . .    That is the explanation that Judge Gorsuch has given to Justice  Scalia's good and faithful judge--a judge who believes that the  judicial branch is the guardian of the Constitution to take a decision  or a question before them to the place the law leads them to, not to  the place where politics sends them or politics demands them or  personal opinions and beliefs dictate.   We have heard Judge Gorsuch say he believes that a judge who  personally believes or agrees with every opinion he reaches is probably  a bad judge. It is because Judge Gorsuch knows that once you put on the  robe, you don't follow your personal opinion. You follow the law. That  is the guarding of the Constitution that the Federalist Papers talked  about.   So that is the kind of nominee we are dealing with--a nominee who  understands the separation of powers and who understands the role of  the judiciary, the role of the legislative branch, and the role of the  executive. In fact, he believes that the executive branch has been  empowered too greatly and that we should once again have separate but  equal branches of government balanced in power.   I think that is a good judge to place on the Court--a judge who is  clearly mainstream, a judge who clearly has the temperament to work  with colleagues to make our country proud.   Certainly as a fourth-generation Coloradan, I am very excited Judge  Gorsuch has been nominated by the President. In addition to the  bipartisan support Judge Gorsuch received here 11 years ago, he also  has tremendous bipartisan support back home in Colorado. In fact, I  have a letter here from Jim Lyons, who was a personal friend and lawyer  for President Bill Clinton. It is a letter to Senator Grassley,  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated February 7, 2017.         I write this letter in strong support of the nomination and       confirmation of Neil Gorsuch for Associate Justice of the       Supreme Court.    He ends his letter with this:         Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy and deep regard for the       Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked       with him and seen first-hand his commitment to basic       principles. Above all, his independence, fairness and       impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-      earned reputation.    The former Governor of Colorado, Democrat Bill Ritter, supports the  confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch.   Eleven years ago, then-Senator Ken Salazar spoke very highly of his  temperament, saying in 2006 that Judge Gorsuch met the ``very high  test'' required of someone to be a ``great judge'' and that he has  ``demonstrated a dedication to fairness, impartiality, precedent and  avoidance of judicial activism--from both the left and the right.''   The Denver Post editorial board, which came out in support of Hillary  Clinton, argued for Neil Gorsuch's nomination, saying: ``A justice who  does his best to interpret the Constitution or statute and apply the  law of the land without prejudice could go far to restore faith in the  highest court of the land.''   Neal Katyal, former personnel in the Obama administration, stated his  support for Neil Gorsuch: ``I am confident Neil Gorsuch will live up to  that promise'' to ``administer justice without respect to persons, and  do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''   The Washington Post editorial board, many others in Colorado's legal  community, including the former cochair of the Host Committee of the  Democratic National Convention in 2008, support the confirmation of  Neil Gorsuch. This is not a partisan judicial appointment; this is a  judge who has strong bipartisan support from the people who know him  best.   I hope we can live up to that high, noble intention of our  Constitution, the purpose of the Senate, to make sure we are confirming  somebody to do a lifetime service for this country in a way that  respects our Constitution and the people of this country.   I hope that over the next several days as we debate the nomination,  we will move away from this cliff of changing two centuries' worth of  precedent in this body and instead come together in a way that befits  the best nature of our country.   Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to speak and come to  the floor.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.
