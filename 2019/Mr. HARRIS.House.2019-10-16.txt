 Mr. Speaker, it seems when I came to work this week, I  was coming to work in Moscow, or Beijing, or Pyongyang, or Havana; not  in the Capital of the free world where we treasure fairness. Because  what are we doing? We are holding kangaroo courts; Star Chamber,  Soviet-style secret trials that are used to depose political opponents.  That is what is going on.   Mr. Speaker, I went back to my district. I had three townhalls in the  last 4 days. I come from a district who voted for this President and  wants a chance to vote for him again in 12 months. They asked me: Where  is the evidence against this President?   So I went downstairs today to try to find it. I went down to the  SCIF, and as you heard from the gentleman from Texas, we were told that  I could not read the testimony of Mr. Volker. It was refused.   I asked: Who refused it? They wouldn't tell me.   I asked to go into the hearing today. They have a hearing today. They  said to a Member of Congress: You can't go.   I said: Who refused? They wouldn't tell me.   So, Mr. Speaker, it appears that someone has made a decision, with no  rhyme or reason, of who gets invited to these things. We have got to  stop this. What are they hiding?   Mr. Speaker, I support the censure resolution. Open up the windows.                            ____________________
