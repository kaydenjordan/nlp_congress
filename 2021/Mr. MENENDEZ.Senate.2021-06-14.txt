Link 16 provides aircrews with enhanced situational       awareness and the ability to exchange target information to       Command and Control (C2) assets via Tactical Digital       Information Link-Joint (TADIL-J). Link 16 can provide a range       of combat information in near-real time to U.S. and allies'       combat aircraft and C2 centers. The AH-64E uses the Harris       Small Tactical Terminal (SIT) KOR-24A to provide Airborne and       Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal       (SALT) capability. The SIT is the latest generation of small,       two-channel, Link 16 and VHF /UHF radio terminals. While in       flight, the SIT provides simultaneous communication, voice or       data, on two key waveforms.        d. The AN/APR-39 Radar Warning Receiver Signal Detecting       Set is a system that provides warning of a radar directed air       defense threat and allows appropriate countermeasures. This       is the 1553 databus compatible configuration.        e. The AN/AVR-2B Laser Warning Set is a passive laser       warning system that receives, processes and displays threat       information resulting from aircraft illumination by lasers on       the aircraft's multi-functional display.        f. The AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) detects       energy emitted by threat missile in-flight, evaluates       potential false alarm emitters in the environment, declares       validity of threat and selects appropriate counter-measures       for defeat. The CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit       (ECU), Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Sequencer       and Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD).        g. The AH-64E uses two EAGLE+MMR embedded GPS/Inertial       navigation systems with Multi-Mode Receiver. The EAGLE+MMR is       a self-contained, all-attitude navigation system with       embedded GPS receiver, controlled via MIL-STD-1553B       controller, providing output navigation and GPS timing data       to support ADS-B out and other platform systems. The EAGLE's       EGI unit houses a 24 channel GPS receiver which is capable of       operating in either Standard Positioning Service (SPS) C/A-      code (non-encrypted) or Precise Positioning Service (PPS) Y-      code (encrypted). The Eagle+ MMR is pending aircraft testing       and air worthiness rating (AWR) approval, with flight tests       anticipated to start in April 2021. AWR approval is expected       prior to the proposed sale to Australia.        h. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/      PNVS) provides day, night, limited adverse weather target       information, as well as night navigation capabilities. The       PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-earth       flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS       provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection,       recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics       (DVO), television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       sighting systems that may be used singularly or in       combinations.        i. The AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency Interferometer       (M-RFI) is an updated version of the passive radar detection       and direction finding system. It utilizes a detachable UDM on       the M-RFI processor, which contains the Radar Frequency (RF)       threat library.        j. The AN/APG-78 Longbow Fire Control Radar (FCR) with       Radar Electronics Unit (REU) is an active, low-probability of       intercept, millimeter wave radar. The active radar is       combined with a passive Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI)       mounted on top of the helicopter mast. The FCR Ground       Targeting Mode detects, locates, classifies and prioritizes       stationary or moving armored vehicles, tanks and mobile air       defense systems as well as hovering helicopters, helicopters,       and fixed wing aircraft in normal flight. If desired, the       radar data can be used to refer targets to the regular       electro-optical Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation       Sight (MTADS).        k. The Manned-Unmanned Teaming X (MUM-Tx) data link system       provides cross-  [[Page S4516]]       platform communication and teaming between Apache, unmanned       aerial systems (UAS), and other interoperable aircraft and       ground platforms. It provides the ability to display real-      time UAS sensor information and MTADs full motion video feeds       across MUM-T equipped platforms and ground stations.        l. The M299 Missile Launcher, commonly known as the Longbow       Hellfire Launcher (LBHL), is a four rail launcher designed to       carry the complete family of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.        m. The AGM-114R Hellfire is a semi-active laser guided       missile with a multi-purpose warhead that can engage and       defeat both high and heavily armored targets, personnel,       bunkers, caves and urban structures.        n. The Hellfire M36E9 Captive Air Training Missile (CATM)       is a flight-training missile that consists of a functional       guidance section coupled to an inert missile bus. It       functions like a tactical missile during captive carry on the       aircraft, absent launch capability, making it suitable for       training the aircrew in simulated Hellfire missile target       acquisition and lock.        o. The M261 2.75 Inch Rocket Launcher is a nineteen tube,       three zone rocket launcher utilized on heavy attack aircraft.       It is used to fire the Hydra 70 2.75 inch rocket, an       unguided, fin-stabilized air-to-ground rocket that utilizes a       variety of warhead and fuze combinations to achieve a range       of effects.        p. The AGR-20A Advanced Precision Kill Weapons System       (APKWS) is a conversion of the 2.75 inch Hydra 70 rocket       which adds a laser guidance kit to enable precision       targeting.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Government of       Australia can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Australia.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
