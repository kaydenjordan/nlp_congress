 Mr. Speaker, I will cover two or three different  subjects today, a little different than we typically come and we walk  through some of the economic data and the concept of I believe the  greatest threat to our society is not telling the truth about the scale  of the unfunded liabilities, the promises we have made and the fact of  the matter that there is no mathematical way we keep those promises.   I have the blessing of being here in Congress. I have been here 9  years, and I have grown to just this intense frustration that we do  math through a partisan lens.   We have a family saying: The math always wins; the math always  eventually wins. So why is it so hard in this place to actually tell  the truth, to own a calculator and say: Here is what is going to  happen; here are our demographics, but here are also the good things  that are working?   Another thing I actually got from my father years ago is: Figure out  what works, and do more of that; figure out what doesn't work, and do  less of that.   So think about this.   Over the Christmas break, I did lots and lots of reading and was  absolutely just furious and frustrated with a number of columns that I  came across talking about the 2-year anniversary of tax reform where we  rewrote much of the tax code to grow the U.S. economy, and we had some  of the, I will call them, the smartest--at least, the most well-known-- economist commentators on the left side trashing the tax reform.   Except, you will notice, if any of you pull up those articles--if you  are willing to--go back and look at the fact they use almost no math in  them. There are no numbers: We just didn't like this. We thought they  should have done this.   Having the blessing of being on the Committee on Ways and Means,  having the blessing of having worked on the tax reform, I do understand  much of what the corporate portion of tax reform was based on: the  Obama administration's recommendations and modeling to make us  competitive in the world again.   But, once again, we work in a place where, if I walk into the room  and I am a conservative and I say the sky is blue, instantly, there is  this knee-jerk reaction from my brothers and sisters  [[Page H54]]  on the other side--and, please, understand, we are sinners, too--who  say, no, it is not.   The math is the math.   So just for the fun of it, I pulled up a number of the headlines from  2 years ago when we were working on tax reform, when we had just  finished tax reform. Liberal columnist after liberal columnist  basically spoke of Armageddon, spoke that the world is going to fall  apart, said this is going to crush and hurt people.   Mr. Speaker, understand, the last 2 years have been some of the most  remarkable progress in modern U.S. history for the working poor.   We come behind these microphones and we pretend we care about the  poor, particularly the working poor. Do you understand what is  happening in the math? Because the math will always win, and the math  is the truth.   When we did tax reform a couple years ago, did you think we would  live in a country with more jobs than workers, where the bottom 10  percent of workers, income-wise--what we refer to as the working poor-- would have wages growing more than two times the mean and, in some  quarters, almost four times the mean in wages?   I know the math gets a little confusing, but it is important. You  can't walk around here and say you care about the poor, particularly  the working poor, and then not have some little joy in your heart about  what has gone on the last 2 years, particularly this last year.   Remember, last year, a woman with no partner in the house had a 7.6  percent growth in wages. We are seeing remarkable growth in wages for  the very folks who have been most dispossessed over the previous  decade. And, yes, I will have a chart that actually shows that.   Why is the truth off your calculator seen through partisan lenses?  Why can't we just take a breath and say, hey, something really is  working. Was it tax reform? Was it some of the things done regulatory- wise?   Because, remember, if you go back just a couple years ago--and I have  sat on the Joint Economic Committee now for a few years--we were being  told, with the headwinds of our demographics, we were in for  stagnation. Do you remember 4 years ago? 5 years ago? 3 years ago? That  was the new normal.   Do we get an apology from the folks who wrote these headlines that  had been so dramatically wrong?   Let's just walk through some of the tax reform data so we are  actually living in the reality of the math, and there is a simple point  I want to make.   2017 fiscal year, so the end of the fiscal year, and then during that  time we were working on tax reform, do you know what the growth and  receipts were for this country? They were 1 percent. They were 1  percent--functionally, not even at inflation. We were falling behind.  And this is under the old tax code that the writers of those headlines  were functionally defending.   Do you know what tax receipts--we don't call it revenues; we call it  receipts--were at the end of last fiscal year, the one we ended at the  end of September? We grew slightly more than 4 percent in our receipts.   Now, we still have a spending problem around here. We have a  tremendous demographics problem. That is one of the other things we  never tell the truth about is the substantial portion of our spending  is actually driven by our demographics, which isn't Republican or  Democratic.   We are getting older very quickly as a society. But, once again, are  we able to get up in front of our groups at home or fellow Members of  Congress and not see the math through partisan lenses, because the math  is the math.   Our birthrates have collapsed as a society. Remember, we had only 12  States last year, in really good economic times, that actually had  growth in their birthrates, and some of those were just by a couple  hundred.   We need to tell the truth about the math.   And I have been coming behind this microphone almost every week we  are here saying there is a unified theory of, if you do the things that  are necessary in tax reform, as we are talking about right now, and do  the things necessary in immigration, do the things in labor force  participation, encouragement, if you do the things in adoption of  technology that crashes the price of healthcare, if you do these things  and bring them all together, we can make the math work where we do not  get crushed, as a nation, by our debt.   But we can't even do simple things by agreeing upon it. We can't even  agree when the math actually says it worked. We still have to spin it  through partisan lenses.   So the chart next to me is just very, very, very simple. It is `17,  `18, `19 receipts--not revenues, receipts. Do you notice something?   Remember, the columnists before, the economists, my brothers and  sisters on the left were telling us revenues are going to crash, it is  the Armageddon, this is the Apocalypse--except for one small problem:  We have had some of the fastest growing revenues we have had in modern  times.   The math is the math.   And, look, I have been there. I have been one of those who believe  something. You get the data, and you have to swallow and say: I was  wrong.   Except this place is incapable of stepping up and saying: Hey,  something is working. Maybe we should figure out what is working and  find a way to do more of it.   Because, once again, this has been some of the most remarkable wage  growth for our brothers and sisters, particularly in the lower  quartiles. I hate that terminology, but if you want to designate the  working poor, we have had more movement.   And there are a couple modelers out there--I don't know if the  numbers will be real--looking at the 2019 fiscal year and saying that  might be the first year where wage and equality actually stayed flat or  didn't grow or maybe even shrank because those at the lower income  spectrum have had the fastest growing wage movement. Why can't we take  some joy in that and work on it?   The fact of the matter is the math is the math. So a simple point:  2017.   One more time, 2017, the fiscal year before tax reform, 1 percent  growth in revenues, receipts; last fiscal year, over 4 percent growth  under the new tax code.   How is that possible?   It turns out it is, and it was possible in a really joyous way  because people were working.   If you take a step back and think of so many of the programs we have  as the safety net to help our brothers and sisters when they are in  hard times, there should have been dramatically less demand on those  programs because so many people were working.   If you look at the BLS numbers, Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers,  the numbers that have moved back into the labor force were now--what?-- over 63 percent labor force participation. I can show you an economic  paper from 3 or 4 years ago saying we were never going to get close to  that again until we get through the baby boomers.   Something is working.   We are seeing numbers where hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of  thousands of people are coming back into the labor force who were not  even looking. Why isn't this joyful?   Look, let me relay a simple experience.   The Phoenix area, we have a homeless campus. I have been, on and off,  involved with it for many, many years. I believe we do something very,  very well. We do a concentration of services with many churches and  charities: Over here, dental work; over here, you get your ID; over  here, there is like 24-hour-a-day AA meetings and here are some bunk  beds for those; over here, St. Joseph the Worker that will help  individuals get work, the Catholic charity. And they have a situation  where they have a stack of job opportunities because there is such a  labor shortage in the Phoenix market.   I am very pleased we just worked out a deal, or they worked out a  deal, with Lyft to help deal with the transition barrier of getting  these individuals to work.   But shouldn't there be joy in this body and our society that there is  such a labor shortage that businesses and organizations are taking  chances on the folks we used to just completely write off?                                time  1800    Remember, it was only a couple of years ago, we would give speeches  around here; if you hadn't finished high school, if you hadn't  developed certain skills you were going to be part of the permanent  underclass. We were writing  [[Page H55]]  you off. We were walking away from you as a society.   And guess what happened?   Something happened, whether it be the Tax Code or other things that  we have done that there is such a demand for their labor, for their  work, and their wages are going up faster than any other quartile.   You can't come behind these microphones and give speeches about how  you care, and then not actually take a step back and say, something is  working. How do we do more of it?   So let's actually take a look at the reality of the math of the last  couple of decades. The red line are the high-income earners. The blue  line are those in the 25 percent or lower quartile. So let's call it  the bottom-25-percent quartile.   And I know this geeks out, but let's go to about 2010 and over. And  you see through 2010, 2015, about 2016, higher-income earners were  winning the battle. Huge separation. They were making money, while that  lower population that we were walking away from, that didn't have the  high school education, didn't have the higher skill set, their wages  were crashing.   And then something happened over here. That's about the time of tax  reform. Do you notice the separation?   It turns out their labor became valuable, became something in demand,  became something that employers had to pay more for. Isn't that what we  were trying to accomplish? It is in the math.   So it frustrates me that you will come across these articles that  completely demagogue tax reform; refuse to actually use the math; and  then not embrace the fact that it has been one of the most remarkable  couple of years in modern history in the United States of the working  poor starting to see their wages move forward, move up, their labor  having value in our society again.   Look, for many of us, we truly believe economic growth is moral. It  helps families; it helps individuals; it helps self-worth. It produces  opportunity.   Yet, we seem to completely turn the discussion of the things that  create that economic growth into a partisan battle, a partisan malaise.  And it breaks my heart, because the chart I just put up, this is the  greatest threat not only to my 4-year-old daughter, but I believe to  every American.   Do you understand what is coming at us?   This is a 30-year chart. It is not inflation-adjusted. But the math  is true and honest because it is done by an outside group that is  nonpartisan.   If I strip Social Security and Medicare out of the 30-year number--we  have $23 trillion in the bank. If you pull Social Security and mostly,  it is mostly Medicare, back in, the promise, these are earned promises  that we have a moral obligation to keep, we are $103 trillion in debt.  This is over the next 30 years.   Isn't that an incredible moral obligation for this body to tell the  truth on? Because these sorts of numbers, you can take every dime of  the rich and you don't get anywhere near it. You can cut the benefits,  and you still don't get--you cannot deal with these numbers and not  crash the U.S. economy and crash the world economy by doing so.   Our office, and a handful of others, we have been trying to make the  argument: tax reform, grow the economy. Incentives to be in the labor  force, grow the economy. Legalize technology that can crash the price  of healthcare because so much of this Medicare here, that is the  massive driver of the debt.   We can have disruptions. Do you realize almost 30 percent of that  Medicare spending is just going to be diabetes? So investment in  diabetes research is a smart investment.   But also, so are other technologies. The thing you can blow into that  instantly tells you you have the flu, and allowing it, that technology,  to be part of how you keep yourself healthy.   But the reality here is, there is no magic bullet. You have got to  grow the economy. And we have demonstrated the growth in these 24  months since we did tax reform it is working. One of the pillars is  working. How do we build off of it? Because you don't try to make major  policy changes in a time of economic stress. Do it in a time when you  actually have economic stability and build off of it, because this is  the greatest threat to our society. It is demographics. It is not  Republican or Democrat.   It is baby boomers. There are 74 million of us who were born in an  18-year period. We earned our benefits. The problem is--what is it? For  the Medicare spending, we will put in, what? $150,000. We are going to  take out close to $500,000. Now multiply that difference by 74 million.  These are the issues that should be driving every bit of policy.   The simple way is to give this a thought experiment: the next 5  years, just the growth--next 5 years, just the growth of Social  Security, Medicare, and the other healthcare entitlements, just the  growth, equals the entire Defense Department spending.   So if you start to do that math, you could functionally get rid of  every portion of discretionary spending except defense, and you buy  yourself 5 years.   I know this is uncomfortable. It is very hard to go home and talk to  constituents that, on the Republican side, we can take care of waste  and fraud. On the Democrat side, we can tax rich people more. That math  is completely fraudulent.   Why is it so hard to pull out a calculator?   I accept we work substantially in a math-free zone, but when we do  math, don't see it through the lenses of partisanship. It is math.   So, look, I wanted to do a little cheerleading for my home. I am  blessed to be from Arizona. We have worked really hard to be friendly  to those who are willing to come to our state and open up new  businesses. We have worked really hard to limit the bureaucracy. We  have worked really hard to make it easy, as a State, for you to file  paperwork online, to do these things efficiently, and our State has  benefited.    We are functioning at the very top of economic growth, population  growth. There have actually even been quarters in the last couple of  years where we have also had the fastest wage growth.   But it is a demonstration that many, many Americans are making  economic decisions, packing up their lives in a lot of parts of the  country and moving to places like Arizona. I think we are number three  in total growth. And when you consider we are only a State of about  7.25 million people, when you add, you know, when you do the per  population growth, we are at the very top.   Arizona, we should be very, very proud. We have been very  disciplined. We have built good infrastructure. We have managed our  water supplies. Power, electrical power is abundant. And we have been  friendly to those willing to bring businesses because they create jobs,  they create opportunities. They create growth in wages.   Now, it looks like the rest of the country is starting to see the  headlines. So a community I grew up around, Scottsdale, I believe, just  got rated number one for being able to find a job. Much of the rest of  the community, incredibly well.   But think of some of the--I am trying to build an argument here that  if economic growth is moral, then you see headlines like this, where  when we do surveys about food insecurity, food insecurity is the lowest  in a decade because of that economic growth, because of those folks  that we were writing off just a couple of years ago who now, their  labor is in demand, their wages are up, and we start to see headlines  like ``Food Insecurity At a Decade Low in Arizona.''   Why is it so hard to understand doing smart tax policy, doing so many  other smart economic policies truly are the path to helping our  brothers and sisters who have less?   We always start and end with this chart. If we care about what is  actually going on, if Congress intends to keep the promises to  Americans for their Social Security and Medicare, if we believe it is a  moral obligation of our society to keep that promise, then you need to  deal with the reality that the unfunded liabilities are monstrous.   There is a path, but it is not a path of paying off the debt. It is  basically a path of, I believe, in our model in our office, staying  about 95 percent debt to GDP, so we don't blow up and get through the  demographic bubble that is those of us who are baby boomers. But we  have to do everything. You have to have that and legalize technology  that crashes the price of so  [[Page H56]]  many things, makes the environment cleaner, makes healthcare much more  affordable and available. Employment, we have to do everything for  those who are older, to encourage them to participate in the labor  force. Add some ``spiffs,'' add some benefits.   How do we get millennial men that are still dramatically  underperforming in showing up in the labor force?   About a year ago, we had an amazing breakthrough, mathematically- wise, millennial females entering the workforce.   Every policy that moves through here we should test; does this  benefit economic growth?   When we work on immigration policy, are we doing a talent-based  immigration system, where we don't care about your religion, your  gender, or who you cuddle with or anything like that? We care about the  economic vitality you bring to our society.   How do we encourage family formation?   Think of that. This one article here talks about only 12 States  actually had positive birth rates over the previous year.   I know we get caught up in today's shiny object; you know, whether it  is the we hate the President side of this room, or we feel we are stuck  defending. And we are completely missing what is going to end up  driving all public policy in the next couple of years, and that is the  fact that we are going to be crushed by our debt.   There is a path. My fear is this current Congress, are we actually  capable of doing complex policy, lots of complex policy on every issue,  and seeing it as a unified theory to maximize economic vitality so we  actually have the receipts, so we keep the promises that we go home and  tell our constituents we are working for? But, yet, then we come here  and we deny basic math.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
