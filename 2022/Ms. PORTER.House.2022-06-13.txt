 Madam Speaker, over 300,000 mail carriers serve our  communities, delivering for us 7 days a week. Unfortunately, these  dedicated public servants have increasingly become targets for  criminals.   Criminals will steal a carrier's mailbox key and then use that stolen  key to steal mail and packages. Between 2018 and 2021, robberies of  mail carriers more than tripled, and robberies involving a gun  quadrupled.   Until 2020, postal police officers patrolled our neighborhoods to  protect letter carriers and deter mail theft, but in August 2020, right  before the Presidential election, the Trump administration ordered the  postal police to stop patrols and limited them to guarding post  offices.   This policy needs to change immediately. Our mail carriers are at  risk, and they deserve the protection of the law enforcement officers  employed by the post office.                            ____________________
