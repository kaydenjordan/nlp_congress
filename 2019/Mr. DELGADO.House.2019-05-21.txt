 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join in celebrating the  66th Congress.   100 years ago today, in 1919, this House voted to pass the 19th  Amendment to grant women the right to vote. I rise today to celebrate  the women's suffrage movement and the women who, at the time, were seen  as revolutionary for demanding a voice, a representation in our  democracy.   Today, we applaud the women who organized in upstate New York, in  Seneca Falls, who marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, and who lifted  their voices across this country to demand ``votes for women.''   As we prepare to celebrate a century of women's suffrage, let us  acknowledge the tireless work of women to demand the right to vote and  the women, including Ulster County's own Sojourner Truth, who  recognized that suffrage still denied treatment under the law for all.   Today, I am proud to celebrate the tireless work of women to demand  the right to vote and the men who stood on the right side of history by  voting to pass the 19th Amendment.   Their work set the stage for the historic 116th Congress, full of  trailblazing women, and firsts in their own right.                            ____________________
