 Mr. Speaker, the President's fake national emergency is  an end run around this Congress' power of the purse and an offense to  the Constitution.   As the Committee on Appropriations chair, I am outraged that this  President has canceled $3.6 billion in military construction projects  to pay for a wasteful wall.   I want to repeat: $3.6 billion in military construction projects to  pay for a wasteful wall.   The President chose his wall over our national security and the needs  of our servicemembers and their families.   Congressional Democrats have repeatedly made clear, including in our  appropriations bills, that we will not give this President a blank  check by backfilling these projects.   Terminating the President's fake national emergency declaration is  the only way to restore the 127 projects whose funding the President  stole. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
