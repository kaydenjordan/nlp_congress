 Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to honor a  constituent, a friend, and a beloved member of our community, Henri  Termeer. Henri was a resident of my hometown in Massachusetts and the  retired CEO of Genzyme, the biotech firm credited with launching the  Boston biotech revolution that now leads the globe.   Henri has been described as the epitome of a renaissance man, and he  embodied the nexus of business, culture, and civic responsibility. He  also left a lasting imprint on those he loved. His 16-year-old  daughter, Adriana, referred to him as the giving tree because of the  seemingly endless energy he devoted to the causes he believed in and  the lives he touched.   At dinner the night he passed away, Henri said to his guests: We are  getting older and running out of runway here. We need new leaders now.   Mr. Speaker, we would all do well to aspire to be the kind of  thoughtful, passionate, and impactful leader Henri was. He saved  countless lives, yet he was known for his modesty. Henri was one of the  kindest men I have ever known, and we will miss him.  [[Page H4575]]                                ____________________
