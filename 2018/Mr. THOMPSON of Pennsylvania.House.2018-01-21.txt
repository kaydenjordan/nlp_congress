 Mr. Speaker, we must reopen the  government.   I find it troubling that a majority of the Senate Democrats have  chosen to severely jeopardize our military readiness, shut down central  government operations, and eliminate healthcare coverage for low-income  children, all while setting an arbitrary deadline to address the DACA  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I know that we must achieve comprehensive immigration  reform, which includes providing certainty on the status of those  brought here as children, but a government shutdown is not the way to  achieve that public policy.   We must continue to work towards a bipartisan agreement to protect  the fate of the DREAMers and to ensure our borders are secure for the  safety of all Americans.   In accordance with the law, my Bellefonte and Titusville district  offices will be closed, and many of my staff members are furloughed for  the duration of any budget impasse. I will remain here in Washington  working to get this impasse resolved.   It is my hope that cooler heads will prevail and we can quickly find  a resolution to reopen the Federal Government.   All Americans deserve better.                            ____________________
