 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Jordan, Chairman Green,  and Chairman McCaul for their leadership and contributions to the bill  that we see before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I will comment briefly on my experience and what I saw  at the border at the invitation of members of the Judiciary Committee.  I was able to kind of see, I think, two very diverse parts of the  border.   First and foremost, in McAllen, Texas, where we spent a couple of  days and had an opportunity not only to talk to border agents  themselves, but also sat through a full presentation by Homeland  Security, one of the things that struck me, and I think is very  pertinent to what we are discussing today, is every time I asked a  border agent or every time I spoke with someone from Homeland Security,  I would say: What can we do as Members of Congress?   There are a lot of times you go on these trips and there are tours,  and you feel like when you are done, it is overwhelming, and you really  want to know how we can have an impact.   What made an impression on me was every person I spoke to said title  42. I don't think you could find somebody, probably at the times when I  was at the border, who could really describe what title 42 meant or  what the impact would be.   Guess what? Those agents knew. They knew what it meant. They knew it  would be an unbelievable unleashing of many different factions of  people that were immigrating for any number of reasons across the  border, and they knew it was going to overwhelm them.   As we stand here today and debate this bill, when you are watching it  on TV right now, quite honestly, it is overwhelming. You can see the  masses of people that are gathering.   Mr. Speaker, I will, once again, thank Chairman Jordan, Chairman  Green, and Chairman McCaul for putting all this together.
