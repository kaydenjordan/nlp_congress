 Mr. President, I could not improve upon what has already  been said about the work on this important bill. Senator Capito has  articulated much more eloquently than I all of the priorities that are  important in the bill.   I am just going to add my thanks to Chairman Carper and to Ranking  Member Capito and, of course, to subcommittee Chairman Cardin as well.  It has been a great team effort, as is, I think, illustrated in the  final product and the overwhelming vote. Let's keep the team together.  And let's just pass a really big, important WRDA bill.   And I emphasize again, we did this through regular order, colleagues.  We stayed on the 2-year schedule, colleagues. And when we work  together, we can do good work for the people we serve.   With that, I urge a strong vote.
