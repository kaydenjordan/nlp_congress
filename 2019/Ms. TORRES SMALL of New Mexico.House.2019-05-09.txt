 Madam Speaker, I rise to call  attention to the challenges rural communities face to access basic  healthcare.   In New Mexico, I have seen, firsthand, health challenges these areas  face. They include expectant mothers who have to drive for hours, often  across State lines, for every single prenatal appointment.   They include veterans who have to get on the bus in the middle of the  night for a doctor's appointment in Albuquerque the next day.   It includes teenagers in crisis facing a long waiting list for a  much-needed mental health appointment.   And it includes rural and community hospitals on the verge of closing  their doors. This is what rural America faces.   Even with these hardships, we are often the first to be forgotten  when legislators and healthcare experts discuss healthcare quality,  access, and affordability.   So as Congress begins discussing how to decrease the cost of  healthcare insurance, to lower the cost of prescription drugs, to  provide mental healthcare, and protect millions of Americans with  preexisting conditions, I urge consideration of the pressure points  that rural communities face. That is how we deliver better healthcare  access to all our constituents.                            ____________________
