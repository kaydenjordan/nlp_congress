 Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize an  American veteran and true Nevadan Richard Ziebarth, who recently passed  away at the age of 58.   Widely known as ``Zman,'' Mr Ziebarth spent close to 26 years in the  U.S. Air Force as a fighter pilot and squadron commander, where he  achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was stationed at Nellis Air  Force Base in Las Vegas in 2003 and retired from the military in 2007.  He served his country all over the world in South Korea, England, and  at the Pentagon.   Mr. Ziebarth's leadership did not stop after his military service. He  was an active member of his community, the Canyon Ridge Christian  Church, and chairman of the church's board of elders.   He graduated from Point Loma Nazarene University in 1981 with a  bachelor's in computer science and business. He also graduated from  Averett College with an MBA and received a doctorate of strategic  leadership from Regent University. Mr. Ziebarth started a business  called Integrity Leadership that helped employers determine the best  fit for employees within their companies.   Mr. Ziebarth also worked as director of operations for Remote Imagery  Technology, Inc., RITI, which provides operational support to  Department of Defense contracts.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I know that Mr. Ziebarth's service in  uniform and to the community, will not be forgotten. My thoughts and  prayers go out to his family, especially his best friend and wife of 36  years, Beth, his children, and the rest of his family and friends who  loved and cared for him deeply.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Catholic  War Veterans of America's Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 in Las Vegas, NV,  and Dennis DeGree, Post 1947 first vice commander and Vegas native.   Post 1947 exemplifies their motto of ``For God, country, and home.''  The group works tirelessly to help veterans, their families, homeless  veterans, and active duty personnel. I am deeply appreciative of these  veteran members' sacrifices and service, as well as the group's efforts  to support Nevadans who have answered our Nation's call.   Founded in 2006, Post 1947 is Nevada's first Catholic War Veterans of  America post and one of 215 posts across the country. The organization  offers a number of critical initiatives to the veteran and Las Vegas  communities.   The group's youth programs include poster and essay contests, letter  writing and get-well cards for hospitalized veterans, and the Eugene T.  Roark Memorial Junior ROTC Scholarship Program. Additionally, Post 1947  maintains and operates a food pantry, participates in homeless stand- downs, and educates and assists veterans, their families, widows, and  orphans in obtaining VA medical care and benefits.   At the 82nd Annual Convention of the Catholic War Veterans held in  St. Louis, MO, Post 1947 of Las Vegas was awarded Most Outstanding Post  of 2017 out of 215 posts. This award was given to the post by the  national department for best overall programs provided to all veterans  regardless of religious ethnicity. Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 has won  this award 8 of the past 10 years.   Post 1947 was recognized because of a successful veteran service  organization program they implemented called the National Veterans  Service Office. Since opening in 2013, the National Veterans Service  Office has been successful in obtaining over $10 million in awards to  veterans. Remarkably, Our Lady of Peace Post 1947 has been named the  Most Outstanding Welfare Program 9 of the past 10 years by the national  department.   Post 1947's major achievements do not end there. Dennis DeGree, first  vice commander of the group, was deservedly named Most Outstanding  Catholic War Veteran of 2017 by the National Catholic War Veterans. Mr.  DeGree received the award ``for being the individual who, in the  opinion of the National Department, has contributed most to the  betterment of the CWV.''   It is clear that Post 1947's contributions have made Las Vegas a  better place for Nevada's warriors and their families. As a lifelong  Nevadan and the senior U.S. Senator for the Silver State, I am honored  to recognize both Post 1947 and Dennis DeGree for lending a hand to  those who have made sacrifices in the name of this great  country.                            ____________________
