 Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  speak also about the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This  is S. 4.   Listening to my friend from Virginia here describe some of the  history that he and his family have been through, again, this is an  important part of the discussion and debate when we talk about one of  the very cornerstones of our identity as an extraordinary nation, this  principle of democracy and freedom and fair and open elections.   The majority leader filed cloture on the motion to proceed on Monday  evening, and despite some very real reservations that I have--and it is  fair to talk about those reservations--I will be among those who vote  to begin debate on this measure when we have this vote in a few minutes  here. I will do so because I strongly support and I believe that  Congress should enact a bipartisan reauthorization of the Voting Rights  Act. We have done that. Congress has done that five times since 1965,  typically--typically--by an overwhelming margin here in the Senate.   It has been about 15 years now since our last amendment to the Voting  Rights Act, and I think it is fair to say that 15 years after passage,  it is probably timely and necessary to look at updates.   In order to do that, I think that what we have to do is we have to  step back from the partisanship. We have to step back from the  politicization that is driving this conversation. I think we should be  able to agree to meaningful improvements that will help ensure that all  of our elections are free, they are fair, and they are accessible to  all Americans.   Now, those who follow this issue know that it is probably no great  surprise that I am involved in this discussion here today. I have been  the lead Republican cosponsor of the voting rights reauthorization now  for the last 6 years. I have worked with my friend from Vermont,  Senator Leahy, as well as with Senator Durbin, Senator Manchin, and  others to shape a framework that will allow us to make some progress on  some very real and legitimate issues.   At this point, I feel that we have got a good foundation to help  provide access to the ballot that is equal, again, for all Americans  and free from any form of discrimination. We should all be able to  support legislation to assure just that much--that much--because  nothing, as my friend from Virginia has said, is more fundamental than  the right to vote.   We have all heard that story of Benjamin Franklin being asked at the  end of the Constitutional Convention about the type of government that  the Framers had designed. His response, at least according to some  sources, was, ``A republic if you can keep it.''   I recognize that one of the surest ways to lose our Republic is to  allow the public trust in our elections to erode, and I fear that that  is where we are--that that trust, that faith, in our own elections is  eroding.   I have engaged in voting rights legislation because I want us to  continue to reduce those barriers to Americans' ability to voting,  whether it is geographic, whether it is logistical--and we certainly  know about that in Alaska--whether it is partisan or some other form. I  think we recognize that we have come a long way from the 1960s--I  would, certainly, hope so--but I think we need to acknowledge that we  can continue to build on that through reasonable and well-considered  legislation.   The voting rights legislation that I support is not this sweeping  overhaul that would take power away from the States in order to  federalize the election process. There was a bill earlier on the floor  this year, and I voted against that. I didn't like that very detailed,  prescriptive approach that, I felt, was moving us toward a  federalization.   Instead, the legislation that I support would provide greater  transparency for Federal elections so that voters are fully informed,  so that they know about the changes in voting procedures. It would  protect voters from discrimination in all of its forms and continue to  knock down the barriers that we know, in many places, still exist.   It would provide protections for voters, for election workers, and  polling places to discourage the efforts to interfere, to intimidate,  or to physically harm them.   It would provide for voting materials in relevant areas to be  translated in our Native languages. This is very important for us back  home in Alaska.   It would require States that have historically been found to  discriminate against minority voters to, once again, preclear their  changes in their voting laws, and it would uphold the many, many good  practices and procedures that we have in States like Alaska, rather  than burdening them with new mandates that aren't designed for a place,  again, like Alaska where, geographically, logistically, it just might  simply not work.   That is the kind of legislation that I can support, but I need to be  clear here. That is not the description of S.  [[Page S7699]]  4, the bill that is being brought up for debate. I don't support S. 4  as it was written and as it was introduced. What I can support in its  place and as a starting point is the substitute amendment that the  majority has agreed to lay down should the Senate agree to begin  debate. That substitute amendment contains more than a dozen  significant changes that my team and I have been working with others to  negotiate.   So the question, I think, needs to be asked: Is that enough? And I  say: No, it is not enough. Even with those changes, I still have  concerns, and I know that many of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle have concerns. Substantive changes will be needed before this  measure is ready to pass the Senate.   So, if this procedural vote fails today, where do I think we go next?  We have to go back. We have to consider this legislation through  regular order, through the committee process.   In the meantime, I mentioned just the politicization, the  partisanship that we have seen with these issues. I think: Let's stop  the show votes. Let's give ourselves the space to work cooperatively  across the aisle to reach the level of consensus that I think is  important. It is important for this issue, and it is important for this  country.   The goal here should be to avoid a partisan bill, not to take failing  votes over and over for political gain. It really doesn't get us  anywhere. It gets us on record. It allows you to weaponize, if you  will, a critically important issue. It doesn't go anywhere. It doesn't  serve anyone. It, ultimately, accomplishes nothing. Our only real  option here is to figure out how we are working together on this. Our  goal should be to match what we did in 2006 when the last  reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act passed the Senate 98 to 0.   Wouldn't that be a goal for us all? Wouldn't that send a signal to  people across this country--from Alaska to Maine--to have faith in our  electoral process, in our elections?   Now, some may be wondering why, as a Republican, I am willing to put  my name next to this legislation, pretty publicly, and acknowledge that  it is not where I want the bill to be right now. But at this point, I  think, if we can step back from the political exercise, I think we can  do good. I think we need to do good. I believe that those of us who  want to find common ground need to be part of the process. We need to  be willing to get in, mix it up, and work it out, instead of sitting  back on the sidelines and saying: I just don't like your product, and I  am not going to offer anything else. I just don't like your product.   So let's get in the arena. Given my role as vice chairman of the  Indian Affairs Committee, I believe that I have an obligation to help  resolve some of the longstanding issues that face our Native peoples in  Alaska and around the country.   Finally, I believe it is simply dangerous to let voting rights become  a wholly partisan issue, where our divisions just fester and take root  in an area that is so central to our system of government.   So the vote in front of us today is procedural in nature on whether  to open debate. It is not on final passage or anything close to it.  There are even things in the substitute text that I, frankly, don't  support and others that I have not been able to fully evaluate. But I  also recognize that the framework within the John R. Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act is the most viable that we have, and it is the  best starting point at which to legislate. So I will vote to begin this  debate in the hopes that this is a step forward, not a step backward,  as we are seeking a bipartisan accord.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor to  recognize an Alaskan who I have come to know over  [[Page S7716]]  the years through his compelling correspondence. Bill Stokes is an  artist, a man of deep thought and many talents. Among his many traits  and skills, he does incredible woodworking and water systems, and he is  an author and a poet. In honor of Veterans Day, Bill has asked me to  submit two of his poems to the Congressional Record.   The first poem is entitled ``Tears.''       I have pondered long and hard for more than fifty years.      And it is my belief that the two most important gifts you             will ever know are life and freedom because the price             of both is a Mother's tears.      Both require an entire lifetime of hard hard work.      And you cannot, dare not, avoid and shirk.      Birth is the hardest work a mother will ever do.      And freedom also requires an excruciatingly painful birth             with unending protection from both me and you.      Make no mistake that freedom comes at great cost of life.      Because tyrants are as thieves that are totally committed to             stealing your freedom with a bloody knife.      The description is exactly real.      Because if you don't aggressively protect your freedom, the             knife you will feel.      Freedom absolutely requires an honest government with a             standing army of those unafraid to die.      To ensure that every future generation has the ability to             follow its dreams to the far edge of the sky.      Falling in battle is clearly the Soldier's lot.      But that is how the freedom you enjoy is bought.      Those fallen in battle cannot ever become nameless and lost.      And regardless of culture or clime, a national day of             remembrance, ensures that every warrior's name is with             honor, remembered, that they paid for your freedom's             cost.      I have pondered long and hard for more than fifty years.      And it is my belief that the two most important gifts you             will ever know are life and freedom because the price             of both is a Mother's tears.    The second poem is called ``Son.''       As I walked by a young man was standing in front of his home             wearing his desert camouflage waiting for his ride and             as I walked up to him he cradled his gun.      And I couldn't help myself from asking ``What's your name             son?''      I did not understand why he stood there alone when I heard             his mother's wails of despair as she cried.      And his father's voice cracking as he tried to comfort her             from the house somewhere inside.      His eyes were red from his own tears as he to his family he             had said his goodbye.      And everyone knowing full well that this might be the last             time they see him alive from fighting in a war he did             not contrive.      I told him that as a father and a vet.      How proud I was and his name was indelible in my mind and I             would never forget.      As I only came this way every month or so I would look and             see.      That upon his return if he tied a bright red ribbon on a             branch of the front yard tree.      Before I left I came to full attention and saluted him with             all the honor he was due.      And with a calm determination looking straight into my eyes,             he returned the salute understanding exactly what we             both already knew.      I made many trips walking by that house looking for a ribbon             to let me know he was back.      And just about a year later there was a ribbon tied to the             tree but it wasn't red, it was black.      As I walked by a young man standing in front of his home             wearing his desert camouflage waiting for his ride and             as I walked up to him he cradled his gun.      And I couldn't help myself from asking ``What's your name             son?''    Thank you, Bill, for your incredible tribute to our veterans, just as  we prepare to mark Veterans Day in 2021 and honor the sacrifices they  make on our behalf.                            ____________________
