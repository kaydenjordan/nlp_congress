 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Neeley Family Distillery of Sparta, KY as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Today, I honor a business deeply rooted in Kentucky history. Founded  in 2015, the Neeley Family Distillery bares a history far older than  their date of official registration. The Neeley family has been  distilling and bootlegging illegally in the mountains of Eastern  Kentucky for 11 generations, with James Neeley distilling the first  batch of Neeley family whiskey on American soil in 1740. James Neeley  came to the New World with a mastery passed down to him by his Irish  forefathers. Ten generations later, James' descendant and lead  distiller Royce Neeley uses many of these same skills to craft fine  Kentucky Bourbon.   Though his single-barrel bourbon earned him a gold medal from the  2020 World Spirits Competition, Royce is just as famous for his  moonshine. Royce's great grandfather Leonard Neeley developed the  moonshine over 100 years ago, by adding sugar to the original family  recipe for rye whiskey. This concoction was so popular in the days of  underground bootlegging that it led a vicious and at times violent  rivalry with another local bootlegging family. Artifacts from this  trialing era are all on display at the Neeley Family Distillery in  Sparta, including the pistol Royce's great-grandfather used to shoot  another moonshiner. Though the Neeley family business is no longer  under threat of the law or mob rivals, Royce proudly bears that history  in the creation of all of the distillery's products.   Carrying the torch that his forefather lit long ago, Royce brought  the Neeley family name to the legal production of bourbon for the first  time in 2015. Starting out as a young entrepreneur with a wealth of  expertise, he steadily grew his business in the years to come. However  it was not until 5 years later that Royce switched gears and entered  into a new kind of production. Faced with gross shortages of essential  products during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Neeley  Family Distillery joined forces with other Kentucky distillers to  produce nearly 125,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. Together, the  distilleries donated the much needed product to frontline workers  across the Commonwealth. Fulfilling this desperate need required  immediate retooling of their facilities, sourcing of necessary  products, and totally shutting down their production of bourbon. The  COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that an industry, once spurned by  authorities during the days of Prohibition, could rise to be great  stewards of their community during times of hardship and duress.   The Neeley Family Distillery has since returned to their regular  production of Kentucky's iconic spirit, though they remain ready to  answer the call of their community. Realizing the extent of destruction  their western neighbors sustained in the 2021 tornados, the Neeley  Family Distillery again joined forces with the Kentucky Distillers  Association, as well as the Bourbon Crusader, to organize a benefit  auction in support of relief efforts. This once-in-a-lifetime bourbon  auction led to a $3.4 million check benefiting the State's Western  Kentucky Tornado Relief Fund. In their 7 years of operation, this small  business has not only earned top ranking awards on the quality of their  product, they have earned themselves a record for serving their  community during times of adversity.   Small businesses like the Neeley Family Distillery are the lifeblood  of towns across Kentucky, and the rich history of bourbon and its times  of legal and illegal production is an intricate detail in the fabric of  our State. The Neeley family proudly honors that history by continuing  the tradition of fine Kentucky craftsmanship and looking out for one's  neighbor. Congratulations to the Neeley family and the entire  distillery team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to  watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
