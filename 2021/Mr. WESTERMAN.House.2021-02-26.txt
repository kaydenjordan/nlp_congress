 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in opposition to this package of en bloc amendments,  which is bad for our environment, kills jobs, locks up more lands, and  does nothing to reduce our dependence on hostile foreign nations for  critical minerals.   One of the amendments in this package is a feasibility study for the  Great Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area. Now, the Great Dismal Swamp  may technically be located on the Virginia-North Carolina border, but  House Democrats attempting to ram through dozens of amendments  completely unrelated to the underlying bill, without going through  regular order, sure makes it seem like the Great Dismal Swamp is  actually located right here in Washington, D.C.   Much like the underlying bill, many of these amendments have not gone  through regular order, are not supported by local stakeholders, and do  not have the support of the Members whose districts are directly  impacted.   One such amendment creates the Ice Age National Scenic Trail as a  unit of the National Park Service in Wisconsin. This amendment was  offered without the consultation of my colleague on the Natural  Resources Committee, Representative Tiffany, and does not have his  support. Unlike other trail designation bills that have passed the  House by voice vote in previous Congresses, this amendment lacks basic  protections to ensure these trails do not have unintended consequences  for neighboring communities.   Similarly, the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument Boundary Expansion  Act ignores the will and voices of local stakeholders. The Arizona  State Land Department expressed concerns to the committee regarding the  cooperative agreement language of this amendment and shared that they  have encountered numerous problems with these types of agreements in  the past. These are exactly the types of concerns that should be vetted  through the committee process with testimony from local stakeholders  and the affected agencies.   I would like to briefly discuss one amendment offered by my friend  and colleague, Representative Panetta from California, that would  simply reinforce the status quo policy of forest management in  wilderness areas.   I have worked with Representative Panetta on forest management  policies in the past, particularly on the wildland-urban interface. I  know his heart. I know he has the right intent and wants to do the  right thing. But I also know that he is greatly restricted by his own  conference on forestry management issues.   While I appreciate his intent, over the past 10 years, we have had  nearly seven million acres of wilderness and wilderness study areas  burn up in catastrophic wildfires. Land managers and wilderness areas  must rely on century-old techniques, like handsaws and shovels when  millions of acres of forest are in desperate need of treatment.   Mr. Speaker, 1910 called and it wants its forest management policy  back.   Clearly, the status quo isn't working and unfortunately, his  amendment won't actually allow for proper forest management and won't  stop this bill from hurting our environment.   Michael Jordan once wisely advised: ``If you do the work you get  rewarded. There are no shortcuts in life.''   House Democrats are looking to take the shortcut with this amendment  package and the underlying bill. Unfortunately, our economy and  environment will have to bear the consequences of these misguided  policy decisions.   I would strongly urge my colleagues to oppose these amendments, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to focus on wilderness  areas. I know it sounds great to have a wilderness area. I have enjoyed  spending time myself in wilderness areas, and forestry and wilderness  areas are very important to me. Mr. Speaker, I have a degree in  forestry, and I have actually been licensed to practice forestry, taken  exams to do that. I can tell you, Republicans, Democrats, and  independents alike, we all, I think, can appreciate a healthy forest  because we know that it provides clean air, it provides clean water, it  provides wildlife habitat, and it also provides great places for us to  do recreation.   There are certain places where we need wilderness areas, but there  are certain places where we do not need wilderness areas. Seven million  acres of wilderness area went up in wildfire in the last 10 years. I  would love to be able to take my colleagues out to the forest. They say  a picture is worth a thousand words, but I can promise you, actually  being in the forest tells a much bigger picture, a much better story.   I would love to go to an area that has been properly managed and then  go to a wilderness area that hasn't been managed and be able to make  the case that although we can pass these bills and create wilderness  areas right now that aren't going to affect us, because it takes a long  time for a forest to grow and it takes a long time for a forest to  degrade, but our children and our grandchildren are going to suffer the  consequences of us locking these lands up and making them subject to  catastrophic wildfire in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I understand the sentimental value, the emotional value,  in wanting to make more wilderness areas. But I wish we would have a  long-term look and think about the impact that this is going to have on  the future. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Colorado's love for the  outdoors. I appreciate his passion to do what is right.   He mentioned the provisions in the Wilderness Act to address insects,  disease, and wildfire. Mr. Speaker, that is a Band-Aid. That is what  you do after the fact.   What we are proposing is proactive forest management so that you  don't have the insects, the disease, and the wildfires. An ounce of  prevention is definitely worth a pound of cure.   I would challenge my colleagues to enjoy those scenes and those  vistas. I encourage them to take pictures so they can show their  children and grandchildren what they looked like before they locked  them away in a wilderness area.   Mr. Speaker, this random assortment of amendments does nothing but  make a bad bill three times worse. The only difference is that instead  of having a package of eight bills that haven't been through regular  order that will harm our environment and that will kill jobs in rural  communities, we now have a package of 23 bills that haven't been  through regular order, will harm the environment, and will kill jobs in  rural communities.   No amendment in this package reduces our dependence on hostile  foreign nations or critical minerals, improves our supply chains, or  bolsters American energy security. No amendment in this package changes  how we currently treat forest and wilderness areas with century-old  technology like handsaws and shovels. No amendment in this  [[Page H748]]  package creates new jobs or bolsters our economic growth.   What does this package do? It just adds more wilderness, more wild  and scenic river designations, and more provisions that haven't gone  through regular order and do not have the support of Members of  Congress directly impacted by those amendments.   Needless to say, this isn't how we should be managing our resources,  and it isn't how we should be legislating in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this package of  en bloc amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his  tireless work on doing what is right for the environment. I use that  word ``environment,'' and not the word ``climate,'' because I want  people to understand that those two things are different.   Climate is very narrowly focused. Climate is an issue that has made  carbon, a necessary element, arch enemy number one. Republicans are  about a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment. We are concerned not  just about carbon in the atmosphere, but we are concerned about forest  health, about air quality, about water quality, about wildlife habitat,  about having great places for recreation.   Mr. Speaker, nobody wants to mine inside the Grand Canyon. Nobody is  mining inside the Grand Canyon. Nobody ever will mine inside the Grand  Canyon. We have already got the Grand Canyon National Park that  establishes those boundaries, and these mineral withdrawals are far  outside of the actual Grand Canyon.    Mr. Speaker, we want a clean environment. We want a healthy  environment. We are all for cleaner technology, but that cleaner  technology takes certain things. It takes minerals and elements. It  takes research and development. It takes using all of the energy  sources that we have.   Why can't we talk about creating more next-generation nuclear power?   It has zero carbon. If your concern is about climate, your concern is  about carbon. And nuclear energy doesn't emit carbon.   Why not put hydroelectric plants on existing dams?   We don't have to build new dams. We can add 12,000 megawatts of  clean, carbon-free hydropower on existing dams. We can use the natural  resources that we have and develop cleaner ways to use them.   As we develop more electrical components and devices that, again, run  on carbon-free energy, unless that energy is produced from carbon  sources, but we have to have a stable and reliable supply of energy,  and we can't have that without developing these resources.   I appreciate the gentleman's concern about not locking up these  resources and doing a study to make sure that when we lock them up, we  are not locking away our future, we are not taking away the ability for  this country to produce our own energy supply, that we are not further  relying on a foreign supply chain that is controlled by Communist  parties.   Mr. Speaker, we are blessed with a resource-rich country, but we are  right now at the mercy of foreign suppliers, especially China, to meet  our mineral needs. Resources like lithium, cobalt, gallium, and dozens  more will be needed in the billions of pounds to meet the projected  growth in electric vehicles and other renewable technologies. Even  commodities like copper, which have historically been produced in  surplus, are now falling short of demand.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage supporting the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the en bloc amendments that  would offer important improvements to the underlying bill.   Unfortunately, this en bloc is only a fraction of the amendments  Republicans would have offered if Democrats had held a markup on the  bill in the Natural Resources Committee.   It is egregious that House Democrats rejected every single Republican  recreation and wildfire amendment offered at the Rules Committee. House  Democrats also denied Representative Boebert of Colorado the chance to  offer a single amendment to this legislation, despite the fact that  one-third of all wilderness designations contained in the entire bill  are in her district, and she has never had the chance to even debate  it, as a new Member of Congress.   One amendment that I offered is included in this package, and it  would rectify the fact that Democrats have arbitrarily included tens of  thousands of acres of wilderness designations that have not been  recommended for wilderness or do not meet the basic definition of  wilderness in the Wilderness Act.   If my Democratic colleagues feel so confident that every single acre  in this bill is actually worthy of a wilderness designation, they  should have no problem supporting my simple amendment to reaffirm  proper wilderness characteristics.   Also included in these amendments is a proposal from one of our  freshmen members of the Natural Resources Committee, Representative  Moore from Utah. It will protect the rights of counties to have a say  in local land use by requiring county approval of wilderness  designations.  [[Page H751]]    Representative Stauber also offered a version of this amendment for  mineral withdrawals and several amendments that would exclude  congressional districts represented by Members of Congress who were not  consulted on this legislation and strongly oppose it.   This should not be a difficult hurdle to overcome. In fact, it should  be a desirable outcome for the sponsor of these bills. Forcing land  management decisions upon local communities without their support is a  bad idea.                                time  1000    Another one of our freshman committee members, Representative Herrell  of New Mexico, offered an amendment to remove all potential wilderness  designations in the bill. This bill designates an amount of area  equivalent to the size of President Biden's home State of Delaware, and  it includes only one wilderness study area release. We shouldn't be  adding potential wilderness to this bill without releasing an  equivalent amount of wilderness study area first.   Finally, this package of amendments would improve our American energy  security by ensuring continued development of critical energy  infrastructure, promoting the responsible utilization of domestic  critical minerals, facilitating rights-of-way for utilities, and  protecting jobs in the energy sector. In contrast, the underlying bill  is just an extension of the Biden ban and will hurt rural jobs and our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I wish that Democrats afforded us more than 10 minutes  to consider these amendments that would actually improve our  environment and economy through conservation and multiple use.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge all of my colleagues to strongly support  this en bloc of amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would love to visit the gentleman's  district, take some photos so that we could show future generations  what it looked like before it was locked away in wilderness, and maybe  be able to talk about some of those forest management activities and  how it could help improve the area.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time both sides  have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), who, again, represents one-third of the area  proposed in this wilderness area, to tell the House about how the  people there really feel.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from  the Grand Junction Area Chamber of Commerce. It says that this bill, if  passed, will negatively impact our already fragile economy and  jeopardize our economic recovery.                                                Grand Junction Area,                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                                  February 24, 2021.      Congresswoman Lauren Boebert,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Boebert: On behalf of the 900 small       businesses employing 37,000 people that the Grand Junction       Area Chamber of Commerce represents, I am writing to       encourage you to oppose H.R. 803, a bill that would lock up       public lands in Mesa County and negatively impact our local       economy. Our community's economy is still reliant in part on       the business activity generated by our legacy industries of       agriculture and energy. This bill if passed will negatively       impact our already fragile economy and jeopardize our       economic recovery.        These are lands that are literally in our backyard in Mesa       County yet Congresswoman DeGette continues to ignore us, does       not meet with us, and does not even consider the consequences       of her bill on the hardworking families of our areas.        In addition to opposing H.R. 803 our organization supports       the various amendments you are proposing be added to the bill       that include keeping the BLM Headquarters in Grand Junction       Colorado, requiring that affected counties must approve the       Wilderness Designation and protects grazing and water rights.        We appreciate your efforts to help retain jobs and the       diversity of our local economy by opposing H.R. 803 and       offering amendments to help preserve the livelihood of our       families and our water life.            Sincerely,                                                    Diane Schwenke,                                                     President/CEO.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues that if you want to improve  our environment, if you are worried about job losses in your district,  if you think we should secure our supply chains and improve American  energy independence, if you think our forests need to be properly  managed to avoid catastrophic wildfires, and if you enjoy recreating in  our public lands, you should vote for this amendment package.   The underlying bill is a feel-good bill that hurts our economy and  environment. We won't have to suffer the consequences of that. It will  be our children and our grandchildren who have to live with the fact  that we don't have forests because we burned them all down and we don't  have jobs because we outsourced our domestic mining industry to Russia  and China.   It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that the Democrats didn't want  to put a package this disastrous for our economy and environment  through regular order. They may be able to limit our ability to debate  this package, but there is no hiding the truth: This legislation is a  land grab that devastates the very communities and lands it claims to  support and protect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendments  and oppose the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, this is the second time today I have been  here speaking against highly partisan Democrat wish list bills that  fall under my committee's jurisdiction but never went through a markup.   This so-called rescue plan is to COVID relief what Democrat rhetoric  is to actual bipartisanship and transparency. It is disingenuous. It is  a headline that doesn't match the contents of the story. It has the  credibility of Russian, Chinese, and North Korean virus reporting. It  is as germane to its stated purpose as the metal detectors outside this  Chamber are to our safety.   This bill contains bad policy concocted through a bad process that  will produce bad results. The short-term gratification of Congress  spending tomorrow's lunch money on bailout candy today will be the  burden of millions of Americans students who are still out of school  and being left behind.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``no'' vote and an honest discussion about  the real needs of America.
