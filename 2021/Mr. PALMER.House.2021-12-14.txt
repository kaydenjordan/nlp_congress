 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  leadership. A lot has been said about the Congressional Budget Office  scoring the Build Back Better bill, that it increases the deficit by $3  trillion, putting truth to the lie that the bill is paid for. It is  not.   What the American people need to know is that there is another CBO  report that was released earlier this fall that should be front and  center of this debate over raising the debt limit.   Here is what that report says about the direction America is heading.  According to the CBO, by 2051, America's debt-to-GDP ratio will be over  200 percent. In other words, our debt will be twice the size of our  entire economy.   That CBO report said a growing debt burden would increase the risk of  a fiscal crisis and higher inflation, as well as undermine confidence  in the U.S. dollar, making it more costly to finance public and private  activity in international markets.   The CBO reported that, with growing debt and rising interest rates,  net spending for interest more than triples relative to the size of the  economy.   A New York Times article reported that the CBO warned that such high  debt levels will lift borrowing costs, slow economic output, and raise  the risk of a fiscal crisis.   The Committee for a Responsible Budget warned that the Nation's long- term output was an air raid siren that can be heard for miles. It said  the mounting debt will make it harder to address income inequality and  to make needed infrastructure improvements. Apparently, my Democratic  colleagues are deaf to that siren.   Now my colleagues want to raise the debt limit by another $2.5  trillion so they can continue down the path of reckless spending with  no regard for the consequences for our Nation's future. That is the  wrong path. That is the dangerous path. And that is why every Member  should heed the warnings and vote ``no.''
