 Mr. President, I rise today to take note of the enduring  support by the American people and by this body for the cause of  democracy and human rights in Poland.   It is difficult to acknowledge so much time has passed, but it was 40  years ago this week, on December 13, 1981, that the Soviet-backed  communist government and General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a state  of war in Poland. People called it ``martial law;'' in fact, it was  quite literally a war declared by a government on its own people.   The U.S. Senate, led by the late statesman and Senator from New York,  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, acted quickly to adopt S. Res. 268. On  December 15, on the last day of the first session of the 97th Congress,  this body adopted by vote of 95 to 0, S. Res. 268, ``on the imposition  of martial law in Poland.''   The resolution declared that:         ``it is the clear and unassailable right of the Polish       people collectively to determine their own future''    It also directed that:         ``the President and his Administration should consult       intensively with our allies to develop a concerted and       sustained response to the threat to the democratization       process in Poland.''    By 1989, thanks to continuing support for the people of Poland that  this Senate expressed 40 years ago today, democracy prevailed in  Poland.   Only two Members of today's Senate were present and voting on  December 15, 1981, and I want to express my appreciation, these many  years later, for their support for the resolution: Senator Charles  Grassley of Iowa, then in his very first year in the Senate, and  Senator Patrick Leahy, then already in his second term in the Senate.   The trade union Solidarity had emerged on August 31, 1980, at the  Gdansk Shipyard when the communist government of Poland signed the  agreement allowing for its existence. Lech Walesa and others soon  formed a broad anti-Soviet social movement ranging from people  associated with the Catholic Church to members of the anti-Soviet left.  Polish nationalism, together with pro-American liberalism, played an  important part in the development of Solidarity in the 1980s.  Solidarity advocated nonviolence in its members' activities. In  September 1981, Solidarity's first national congress elected Walesa as  its president and adopted a republican program, the ``Self-governing  Republic''.   The first resolution adopted by Solidarnosc, at its First Congress in  1981, expressed a vision for the world, one based on the principle of  its name. It stated:         The ultimate goal of Solidarity is to create dignified       conditions of life in an economically and politically       sovereign Poland. By this, we mean a life free from poverty,       exploitation, fear and lies, in a democratically and legally       organized society.    By December, the government in Warsaw and its backers in Moscow  decided that they had enough of an assertive civil society. And so  martial law was declared and the repression commenced, 40 years ago  this week.   The terrible repression next door in Belarus today compares, but even  it does not match the brute force of the war against the people of  Poland declared by General Jaruzelski, the simultaneous deployment of  hundreds of thousands of riot police, soldiers, armed vehicles, and  tanks to occupy all workplaces and cities and to crush the resistance  of an entire society organized in independent, self-governing unions.  Yet Solidarity lived.   A democratic movement in Belarus also lives today. It is not  inevitable, however, that it will win, just as it was not inevitable  that Solidarity would win. Much depended on the indomitable will of the  Polish people--and also on the actions of Western democracies.   The first people in the United States to stand up on behalf of the  people of Poland were writers and intellectuals who formed the  Committee in Support  [[Page S9206]]  of Solidarity, including Susan Sontag, Adam Ulam, Czeslaw Milosz, and  others. An energetic young man named Eric Chenowith and wise strategist  named Irena Lasoda soon became familiar faces in the Halls of Congress,  circulating information about the struggle of solidarity and people in  Poland to endure the repression they confronted.   The political force that kept the democratic world focused on support  for the people of Poland then was the American labor movement, led by  its president Lane Kirkland and his secretary-treasurer Tom Donahue.  They immediately established the AFL-CIO's Polish Workers Aid Fund and  put Tom Kahn, the international affairs director of the AFL-CIO, at its  helm. They persisted in making the steady argument, even after December  1981, that in Solidarnosc lay the potential for a new, more democratic,  more just, and more peaceful world.   It was the AFL-CIO, representing 16 million people, that gave voice  and strength to the free trade union Solidarity in the United States.  We forget how many were willing to forsake Solidarity in the period of  martial law. Indeed, only the AFL-CIO, backed by the committee,  pressured President Reagan and his administration to adopt stronger  sanctions in response to the state of war. As importantly, it was the  AFL-CIO that made sure Solidarity was sustained through financial and  material help, some of which was supported by the National Endowment  for Democracy, after its creation in 1984.   Thanks to that support and steadfastness, eventually the government  relented, especially once Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power in the USSR  and began to pull back the support for the repressive policies in  Poland and elsewhere in the Warsaw Pact.   Roundtable Talks between the government and Solidarity-led opposition  led to semi-free elections in June of 1989. In an arrangement that was  similar in some ways to what transpired more recently in Burma,  partially free elections were organized in which a large block of seats  in the legislature were reserved--in the case of Burma for the military  and in the case of Poland, in 1989, for the Communist party and its  allies.   All seats in the newly recreated Senate of Poland were to be elected  democratically, as were 161 seats--35 percent of the total--in Sejm.  The remaining 65 percent of the seats in the Sejm were reserved for the  Polish United Workers' Party--the Communist Party--and its satellite  parties. These seats were still technically elected, but only  government-sponsored candidates were allowed to compete for them. In  addition, all 35 seats elected via the countrywide list were reserved  for the Communist Party's candidates to ensure that the most notable  leaders of the Polish United Workers Party were elected.   But in the June elections, the people of Poland voted so  overwhelmingly for the representatives nominated by Solidarity that the  Communists and the military lost all credibility. By the end of August,  a Solidarity-led coalition government was formed, and in December,  Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected Prime Minister.   Poland has since then developed into such a strong democracy and  economically liberal country that it has led its neighbors into joining  the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It has  become in every sense an ally of the United States. And in the past 2  years, it has again been true to the heritage of Solidarity by  providing safe haven for many political refugees from Belarus and  elsewhere.   While many of us continue to have concerns about some aspects of  Polish Government policy, its treatment of certain media outlets, and  the fate of the rule-of-law in the country, the government of Poland is  a friend with whom we can have honest conversations. Indeed, I am  sitting down later this afternoon with the newly arrived Polish  ambassador to Washington, Marek Magierowsk, to continue these  conversations. This is especially important at this time because Poland  will become the chairman-in-office next month of the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe--the OSCE--and will play a major  role in shaping the OSCE's response to efforts by Russia and others to  undermine the work of the organization and stability in the region.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of S. Res.  268 from the 97th Congress, as adopted on December 15, 1981, be printed  in the Record at this point, along with the announcement of December  15, 1981, of the creation of the Committee in support of Solidarity.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                S. Res. 268         Whereas the American and Polish peoples share a deep and       abiding friendship;        Whereas the imposition of martial law, and the suspension       of workers' rights in Poland on December 13, 1981, constitute       grave abridgements of the human rights and civil liberties of       the Polish people;        Whereas it is the clear and unassailable right of the       Polish people collectively to determine their own future:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that--        (1) the American people desire an early and peaceful and       popularly supported resolution of the issues which have led       to the imposition of martial law in Poland;        (2) the American people deplore the imposition of martial       law in Poland, the suspension of the rights of workers to       organize and peaceably to defend their interests, and the       arrests of leaders of Solidarity; the free trade union;        (3) recent events call into question the suitability of the       further provision of assistance to the government of Poland       except for humanitarian programs;        (4) it is the right of the Polish people to resolve their       own problems without outside interference of any kind;        (5) the support of the American people for continued United       States dealings with the present government of Poland will       relate directly to the degree to which the Polish government       avoids violence and bloodshed, and demonstrate by its actions       its respect for a full and legitimate role for the Solidarity       labor union and its commitment to the continuation of       Poland's reforms;        (6) the President and the Secretary of State should       continue to stress this United States position in all       dealings with Polish officials;        (7) the President and his Administration should consult       intensively with our allies to develop a concerted and       sustained response to the threat to the democratization       process in Poland.                             Committee in Support of Solidarity,                                    New York, NY, December 15, 1981.        We, the Undersigned, Declare: At midnight on December 13,       1981, the Polish army and police raided the offices of the       Independent Trade Union ``Solidarity''; thousands, perhaps       tens of thousands, of people were arrested in their homes.       The Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and First Secretary       of the Polish Communist Party in one person, General       Jaruzelski, declared martial law.        Polish society, in whose overwhelming support Solidarity       has its strength, has exercised the utmost restraint in the       face of countless acts of provocation on the part of the       government. In the sixteen months of its existence,       Solidarity has committed no illegal acts; it has rigorously       respected the Polish constitution and all the forms of       political life accepted in civilized societies. Each and       every voice from Solidarity, even if termed ``radical'' by       the Communist Party or the western media, has been no more       than the exercise of that right to free and open discussion       of national affairs which is guaranteed by the constitution.       The party and the government, on the other hand, have       violated almost every agreement they have signed; they have       also violated the basic right of all citizens to freedom of       expression.        The present events are not the ``internal affairs of       Poland.'' The Soviet Union has been intervening in Polish       internal affairs since 1944. The Junta of General Jaruzelski,       by linking the arrests of Solidarity members to those of       former party officials, is clearly attempting to blame       Solidarity for the thirty-six years of indolent and       devastating communist rule that have brought Poland to       economic collapse. The strikes called by Solidarity have       resulted in the loss of one day's work in sixteen months;       mismanagement and lack of supplies have resulted in the loss       of over twenty work days.        We appeal to every democratic government, and to all those       who believe in the Polish people's right to basic freedoms,       to immediately halt all economic and other transactions with       Poland, until every member of Solidarity is freed.
