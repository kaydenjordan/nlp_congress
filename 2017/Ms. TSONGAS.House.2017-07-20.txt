 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 6, after line 18, insert the following:       SEC. 7. MITIGATION PLAN.         The requirements related to mitigation under section       6403(e) of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009       (Public Law 111-11; 123 Stat. 1180) shall apply to the road       constructed in the road corridor.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment is very straightforward. It restores a bipartisan  provision to the bill, one that was actually approved by Congress and  signed into law by President Obama.   In 2009, Congress approved the King Cove Land Exchange under the  condition that it be found to be in the national interest by the  Secretary of the Interior. After a transparent 4-year review that  included over 70,000 public comments and 130 public meetings, Secretary  Jewell ultimately concluded that it was not in the national interest,  and the land exchange was not approved.   Nevertheless, the legislation that was approved and signed into law  in 2009 with Democratic and Republican support included language that,  should the road be approved, it would have required the State of  Alaska, Federal agencies, and local residents to develop a mitigation  plan for the road so that impacts to migratory birds, wildlife, and  wetlands are minimized.   The land exchange language that was passed by Congress in 2009 is  similar to the legislation that we are considering today, with a few  notable exceptions, including the removal of the section requiring this  environmental mitigation plan.   It is common practice for any new road construction project to  include an environmental mitigation plan, especially a road through  such a sensitive area.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my commonsense amendment to reinsert  this bipartisan language, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to keep in mind  that the lands that this road seeks to cross are Federally protected  public lands. They are managed and protected on behalf of all Americans  to specifically protect wildlife habitat. And, as such, when changes  like this are being debated, all Americans have the right to register  their opinion.   They are also designated wilderness, the highest level of protection  that the American people bestow upon a piece of public land, and we in  Congress are stewards of that mandate.   The road proposed by this legislation could do irreparable harm to  the fragile environment of this wildlife refuge  [[Page H6126]]  if mitigation steps are not taken. As the Department of the Interior  stated in 2013, this area is ``a globally significant landscape that  supports an abundance and diversity of wildlife unique to the refuge  that years of analysis shows us would be irretrievably damaged by  construction and operation of the proposed road.''   The Department also found that construction of the road would lead to  ``significant degradation of irreparable ecological resources that  would not be offset by the protection of other lands to be received  under an exchange.''    My amendment simply reinserts bipartisan language that was approved  by Congress and signed into law by 2009 that will help mitigate some,  but not all, of the negative environmental impacts in the event that  the road is constructed.   Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers, and I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to first remind my  distinguished colleague from Alaska, who I know cares very deeply about  his constituents, that in 2009, he did vote for the omnibus land  package that included the language that I would like to see become part  of the legislation before us today.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It restores bipartisan language  that was passed by Congress and that Congressman Young supported and  signed into law on similar legislation authorizing this land exchange  back in 2009.   The road through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge is expected to have  a significant detrimental impact on lands that are protected for the  benefit of all Americans. This amendment will help mitigate some, but  not all, of these impacts in the event that the road is constructed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts will be  postponed.                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part C of House Report 115-235.
