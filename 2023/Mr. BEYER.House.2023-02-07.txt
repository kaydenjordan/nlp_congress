 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule.   H.J. Res. 24 and H.J. Res. 26 are blatant attempts to undermine D.C.  Home Rule. These resolutions are explicit efforts by Members of  Congress to interfere in local government. They aim to directly  override the D.C. Council and dictate what D.C. residents can and  cannot do on a local level.   I firmly believe that the District of Columbia, like any other  jurisdiction across the country, should be allowed to govern itself. I  am just confused that my Republican friends, who have such a deep  commitment to federalism--federalism, where decisions are best made at  the local level--why they would work to impede the right of 700,000  American citizens to self-govern?   It is critical that we fiercely protect this right on behalf of  citizens living in D.C. We weren't voted to be D.C. City Council  members. D.C. citizens didn't ask for our say in local matters. I trust  my mayor of the city of Alexandria, Justin Wilson, to represent me ably  there, and everyone else respects the people in their hometown, their  home States, to do the same.   I am certainly not here offering to overturn local city council  rulemaking in Kentucky or Georgia or Texas, but I am sure I could find  plenty to disagree with.   We have got to respect the American democratic process and allow the  people of D.C. to govern themselves. If we, as a Congress, value and  respect the principle of local self-governance that makes up the core  of our democracy, it is hypocritical of us to revoke that right for the  citizens of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly join me in opposing  H.J. Res. 24 and H.J. Res. 26.
