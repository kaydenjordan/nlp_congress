 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Giana  Zambelli and Olivia Cameron. These two 9-year-old girls from Bensalem,  Pennsylvania, spend their free time running a local Kool-Aid stand  which they call Kool-Aid for Kenny.   The proceeds from their sales benefit the Kenneth Hopkins Memorial  Scholarship Fund created in 2016, to award students currently pursuing  a career in emergency services.   Mr. Speaker, Ken Hopkins was an emergency medical technician with the  Bucks County Rescue Squad and a volunteer firefighter with the Croydon  Fire Department. He passed away in June 2016, after struggling with  post-traumatic stress disorder from his time serving our community and  saving lives as a first responder.   Mr. Speaker, the selfless acts of Giana and Olivia are truly  inspiring to all of us. Their remarkable work continues to make Ken's  dream a reality in the hopes that others continue to save lives and  help those in need, just as Ken Hopkins did his entire life.   Ken, Giana, and Olivia are an inspiration to our entire community.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 450, I mistakenly voted  ``nay,'' where I meant to vote ``yea.''                   Amendment No. 39 Offered by Mr. Grothman     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment restores critical funding to the  Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General to ensure  the efficiency and effectiveness of DHS operations. Without this  amendment, the OIG will have to reduce its workforce, significantly  impairing its ability to complete its mission that everyone on this  floor can agree is vital to our national security.   Mr. Chairman, these women and men work tirelessly to conduct audits,  inspections, and investigations that combat fraud, waste, and abuse in  one of our Nation's most critical agencies. With over 147 reports, 370  actions recommended, and 836 investigations, DHS OIG has proven to be  not only worthy of every penny, but also a place where dollars spent  turn into dollars saved.   I am proud to be surrounded by colleagues on the House Homeland  Security Committee who join me in supporting the mission of the OIG,  and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment, which is  crucial to our national security.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Higgins).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Donovan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
