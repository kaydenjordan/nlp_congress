 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5086) to require the Director of the National  Science Foundation to develop an I-Corps course to support  commercialization-ready innovation companies, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5086         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innovators to Entrepreneurs       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps       Program (hereinafter referred to as ``I-Corps''), created       administratively by the Foundation in 2011 and statutorily       authorized in the American Innovation and Competitiveness       Act, has succeeded in increasing the commercialization of       Government-funded research.        (2) I-Corps provides valuable entrepreneurial education to       graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other       researchers, providing formal training for scientists and       engineers to pursue careers in business, an increasingly       common path for advanced degree holders.        (3) The I-Corps Teams program is successful in part due to       its focus on providing the specific types of education and       mentoring entrepreneurs need based on the early stage of       their companies, however the program does not provide similar       support to them at later stages.        (4) The success of I-Corps in the very early stages of the       innovation continuum should be expanded upon by offering       additional entrepreneurship training to small businesses as       they advance toward commercialization.        (5) The excellent training made available to grantees of       participating agencies through the I-Corps Program should be       made available to all Federal grantees as well as other       businesses willing to pay the cost of attending such       training.        (6) The success of the I-Corps Program at promoting       entrepreneurship within research institutions and encouraging       research commercialization has been due in part to the       National Science Foundation's efforts to date on building a       national network of science entrepreneurs, including       convening stakeholders, promoting national I-Corps courses,       cataloguing best practices and encourage sharing between       sites and institutions, and developing a mentor network.        (7) As the I-Corps Program continues to grow and expand,       the National Science Foundation should maintain its focus on       networking and information sharing to ensure that innovators       across the country can learn from their peers and remain       competitive.       SEC. 3. EXPANDED PARTICIPATION IN I-CORPS.         Section 601(c)(2) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)(2)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(C) Additional participants.--        ``(i) Eligibility.--The Director, in consultation with       relevant stakeholders, as determined by the Director, which       may include Federal agencies, I-Corps regional nodes,       universities, and public and private entities engaged in       technology transfer or commercialization of technologies,       shall provide an option for participation in an I-Corps Teams       course by--         ``(I) Small Business Innovation Research Program grantees;       and        ``(II) other entities, as determined appropriate by the       Director.         ``(ii) Cost of participation.--The cost of participation by       a Small Business Innovation Research Program grantee in such       course may be provided--         ``(I) through I-Corps Teams grants;        ``(II) through funds awarded to grantees under the Small       Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business       Technology Transfer Program;        ``(III) by the grantor Federal agency of the grantee using       funds set aside for the Small Business Innovation Research       Program under section 9(f)(1) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 638(f)(1));        ``(IV) by the grantor Federal agency of the grantee using       funds set aside for the Small Business Technology Transfer       Program under section 9(n)(1) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 638(n)(1)); or        ``(V) by the participating teams.''.       SEC. 4. I-CORPS COURSE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION-READY                     PARTICIPANTS.         (a) In General.--In carrying out the I-Corps program       described in section 601(c) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)), the Director       shall develop an I-Corps course offered by I-Corps regional       nodes to support commercialization-ready participants. Such       course shall include skills such as attracting investors,       scaling up a company, and building a brand.        (b) Engagement With Relevant Stakeholders.--In developing       the course under subsection (a), the Director may consult       with the heads of such Federal agencies, universities, and       public and private entities as the Director determines to be       appropriate.        (c) Eligible Participants.--The course developed under       subsection (a) shall--        (1) support participants that have completed an I-Corps       Teams course;        (2) support participants that have made the decision to       take an innovation to market.       SEC. 5. REPORT.         Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report containing an evaluation of the       I-Corps program described in section 601(c) of the American       Innovation and Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)).       Such evaluation shall include an assessment of the effects of       I-Corps on--        (1) the commercialization of Federally funded research and       development;        (2) the higher education system; and        (3) regional economies and the national economy.       SEC. 6. FUNDING.         (a) Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020.--Out of amounts otherwise       authorized for the National Science Foundation, there is       authorized to be appropriated a total of $5,000,000 for       fiscal years 2019 and 2020 to carry out the activities       described in section 4 and the amendment made by section 3.        (b) Limitation.--No additional funds are authorized to be       appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by       this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 5086, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act, H.R. 5086.   I thank my friend Daniel Lipinski for introducing the legislation  with me. He is a champion of the time-proven Innovation Corps program,  better known as I-Corps.   This bipartisan piece of legislation is a result of the committee  hearings on the I-Corps program. The Innovation Corps program was  created by the National Science Foundation in 2011 to teach scientists  and engineers how to  [[Page H3490]]  turn their laboratory innovations into successful commercial products  and services.   This program assists scientists and engineers in the development of  their academic research and equips them to bring that research into the  private market. We have witnessed the wonderful successes of this  program in my home State of Florida and across the Nation. H.R. 5086  expands the I-Corps program by creating a new course for  commercialization-ready companies.   Following the completion of an I-Corps team course, individuals are  eligible for this new course which will help them create, market, and  eventually expand their private sector company. Through marketing,  hiring, organizing, and attracting investors, these participants'  success increases dramatically.   The bill breaks down the barriers experienced by current scientists  when attempting to bring their product to market. Additionally, this  bill expands the groups allowed to apply for the I-Corps program and  offers new options for how to initially pay for the course.   Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate my colleagues' support in passing  this commonsense piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Space, Science,  and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Lipinski, Chairman Smith, and the  entire House Science, Space, and Technology Committee for their support  of this legislation. It is a good bill, and it will spur the creation  of new businesses and new jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
