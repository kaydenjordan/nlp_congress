 Madam President, I really want to thank Senator Murphy  for his longstanding commitment to this humanitarian need. We are now  just a Senate vote away from making a major difference in regard to the  humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and every Member of the Senate will now  be on record.   I want Senator Murphy to know that his work has been extremely  important and is well understood. What he is saying I just really want  to underscore; that is, the U.S. military engagement with Saudi Arabia  and its partners is counterproductive, not just to the humanitarian  crisis that exists today in Yemen but to America's national security  interests.   The conflict in Yemen has become a humanitarian nightmare. At this  point our involvement does not advance the interests of the United  States, our partners, or regional stability.   I recognize that we have a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia  and that we have a mutual desire to prevent the expansion of Iranian  influence and terrorist groups that seek to do us harm. However, our  current military support to Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict has  become detrimental to these shared goals and our broader partnership.   The suffering this conflict has caused is beyond measure. More than  22 million people, nearly 75 percent of the population, are at grave  risk. The country has now seen the world's largest cholera outbreak,  which has killed thousands. Hunger and malnutrition are threatening 2  million innocent children under the age of 5. A recent Save the  Children report concluded that some 85,000 children have already died  from starvation since the war began. Morally continuing our military  involvement in this disaster simply should not be an option.   I would also like my colleagues to look beyond our direct support to  the role U.S. arms sales play in worsening the conflict. These sales  cannot come at the expense of human rights, mass atrocities, and  regional destabilization. Saudi Arabia has shown a disregard for  international law by inflicting devastating losses on civilians,  including young children.   It is now well known that the Saudi-led coalition targets civilian  infrastructure vital to Yemen's recovery and reconstruction. In fact, a  recent U.N. report concluded that the coalition's air campaign is the  leading cause of civilian casualties in Yemen, with 61 percent due to  coalition air strikes. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and  Bellingcat have found that U.S. weapons have been used in these  unlawful air strikes. There is evidence that the coalition has used  banned and inherently indiscriminate weapons like white phosphorus and  cluster bombs.   The military conflict has produced staggering human rights abuses.  The AP, international organizations, and a special expert group  established by the U.N. Human Rights Council have found that all  parties in the conflict have committed grave violations of human rights  and the laws of war. Houthi war crimes and abuses are staggering;  however, reports indicate our supposed partners have also engaged in  horrific abuses, including widespread torture and sexual abuse at  coalition-run secret prisons.   For all of these reasons, it is imperative that there is a speedy and  peaceful conclusion to the conflict in Yemen. It is apparent that this  will not come from our military involvement. We must, instead, focus  our efforts on supporting U.N.-led efforts to foster dialogue, a  ceasefire, and humanitarian access.   It is critical to prevent expansion of the Iranian influence and  extremist groups in the region, but our military involvement is not  helping us in that regard. Experts from across the ideological spectrum  agree that the escalation of the conflict has increased Iran's and  extremist groups' influence in Yemen. Our military campaign is  counterproductive to our objective to minimize the influence--and  hopefully eliminate the influence--of Iran and extremist groups.   With all of these considerations in mind, Republicans and Democrats  in the Senate and House of Representatives came together to pass S.J.  Res. 7. For reasons that are still incomprehensible to me, the  President chose to veto this resolution. Oxfam recently responded to  this by stating that ``the people of Yemen and the parties to the  conflict are watching closely and the messages US leaders send have the  power to save lives.''   With a veto, they lose faith in the United States and see the end to  their suffering a little further out of reach. It is not, however, too  late for Congress to do the right thing. By overriding this veto we  assert this body's authority to support peace and human rights while  making America safer and more secure.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to discuss Special  Counsel Robert Mueller's recent report, which is titled ``The Report on  the Investigation into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential  Election.''   The Mueller investigation was authorized to ensure a full and  thorough investigation of the Russian Government's efforts to interfere  in the 2016 Presidential election, as well as any links and/or  coordination between the Russian Government and individuals associated  with the campaign of Donald Trump.   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said, when appointing the  special counsel:         [T]he public interest requires me to place this       investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a       degree of independence from the normal chain of command. . .       . I am confident that [Special Counsel Mueller] will follow       the facts, apply the law, and reach a just result.    I encourage all Americans to read the redacted version of the Mueller  report and draw their own conclusions. The report lays out in stark  detail Russia's attack on our country before and during our 2016  elections.   The special counsel rightly concluded that the Russian Government  interfered in the 2016 Presidential election in a sweeping and  systematic fashion.   In January 2018, I issued a report on behalf of the Democrats on the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee titled ``Putin's Asymmetric Assault  on Democracy in Russia, and Europe: Its Implications on U.S. National  Security.'' That report outlines some of the same tactics used by  Russia and Europe that the Mueller report identifies were used in our  2016 elections. Mr. Putin has waged war against democracy.   The Mueller report concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016  Presidential election principally through two operations. First, a  Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored  Presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged Presidential  candidate Hillary Clinton; second, a Russian intelligence service  conducted computer intrusion operations against entities, employees,  and volunteers working on the Clinton campaign and then released stolen  documents.   The investigation also identified numerous links between the Russian  Government and the Trump campaign. When discussing the Mueller report,  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recently said: ``There was  overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers  and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the  iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections,  promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in  many other countries.''   The Director of National Intelligence testified before the Senate in  January that ``even as Russia faces a weakening economy, the Kremlin is  stepping up its campaign to divide Western political and security  institutions and undermine the post-WWII international order. We expect  Russia will continue to wage its information war against democracies  and to use social media to attempt to divide our societies.'' We expect  that Russia will continue to wage its information war against  democracies and to use social media to attempt to divide our societies.    The special counsel fulfilled his mandate to fully investigate both  criminal acts surrounding the 2016 elections, as well as efforts to  obstruct this critical investigation. Let me be clear that President  Trump has consistently taken steps to deny Russia's involvement in  tampering in our elections, resisted efforts to hold Russia  accountable, besmirched the reputation of the special counsel while  trying to dismiss him or willfully impeding his investigation, and  repeatedly attacked the integrity of our intelligence and law  enforcement Agencies. Despite the President's egregious behavior, the  special counsel's work has resulted in dozens of indictments and  numerous convictions and guilty pleas.   Several legal cases and investigations are still ongoing. Let me  remind my colleagues that while the special counsel has delivered its  final report, there are several ongoing Federal investigations and  criminal trials, including those publicly known in the Southern  District of New York and in Washington, DC.   Congress must now fulfill its oversight obligations under the  Constitution. In order to prevent future attacks on our country and  stem abuses of power, we must review a complete copy of the report as  soon as possible and hear direct testimony from Special Counsel  Mueller.   The Mueller report laid out numerous disturbing episodes where  behavior by President Trump may have constituted obstruction of  justice. The report stated:         ``If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of       the facts that the President clearly did not commit       obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts       and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to       reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the       President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that       prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal       conduct occurred.''    Indeed, the report stated that ``the President's efforts to influence  the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because  the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders  or accede to his requests.''   Congress should therefore closely examine the President's behavior,  keeping in mind the President's obligations to fully execute the laws  and preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. Members of Congress  took an oath as well to support the Constitution before taking office.  The American public now deserves to hear directly from Special Counsel  Robert Mueller through the relevant House and Senate committees.   Congress still has the ability to make a judgment on the obstruction  of justice. Congress must now fulfill its oversight function under the  Constitution and do all we can to prevent future attacks on our country  and to stem abuses of power and corruption.   Congress has an obligation to understand the report fully and respond  in such a way to prevent such attacks from happening in the future.  This should involve prompt and thorough hearings in both the House and  Senate.   Here are some areas where the Senate should consider legislative  action.   First, if an American is approached by a foreign entity about  involvement in an American election, that American should have certain  responsibilities to immediately notify appropriate law enforcement  agencies. I think many of us thought that was probably already the law.   Second, legislation should be considered to protect our elections  from foreign interference by imposing appropriate responsibility on  social media platforms and amending our election  [[Page S2601]]  laws in regard to attribution on advertisements, including through  social media.   Third, the Senate should consider additional sanctions on Russia for  its documented attacks against our 2016 elections.   Congress must continue to take the lead in defending U.S. national  security against continuing Russian aggression against democratic  institutions at home and abroad.   Earlier this year, I joined other Senators in introducing the  Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act of 2019. This  comprehensive legislation seeks to increase economic, political, and  diplomatic pressure on the Russian Federation in response to Russia's  interference in democratic processes abroad, malign influence in Syria,  and aggression against Ukraine.   I am pleased to work with my colleagues on a comprehensive,  bipartisan effort to counter Russia's pervasive attacks on our  electoral systems and cyber infrastructure. I introduced the Election  Systems Integrity Act to better America's election systems so that we  are aware when a foreign national or interest seeks to obtain ownership  or control of election service providers or related infrastructure.   The American people have every reason to be disappointed and alarmed  at the lack of preparedness to defend this Nation. News reports just  last week suggested that former Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen  unsuccessfully tried to elevate the U.S. Government response to the  cyber security threat to the 2020 elections, apparently because  President Trump was not interested in the issue and did not want to  call into further question the legitimacy of his 2016 election victory,  with Russian assistance.   Recently, Jared Kushner inconceivably tried to argue that Russia's  interference amounted to ``a couple of Facebook ads'' and that  congressional and special counsel investigations were ``more harmful''  to the United States than the actual Russian interference.   Congress needs to look very carefully and independently at the 10  episodes that could constitute obstruction of justice by Trump, where  Attorney General Barr ``disagreed with some of the Special Counsel's  legal theories, and felt some of the episodes examined did not amount  to obstruction as a matter of law.''   Remember that President Trump tried to label Special Counsel Muller's  probe as a witch hunt, but Special Counsel Mueller, a well-respected  former FBI Director under both Presidents Bush and Obama, who was  unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the position on two separate  occasions, kept his head down and did his work without fear or favor.   The special counsel's investigation has resulted in, so far, 199  criminal counts, 37 people and entities that have been indicted/charged  as a result of the investigation, 7 guilty pleas, 1 trial conviction,  and 5 people sentenced to prison.   The report is clear that the Trump campaign knew it would benefit  from Russia's illegal activities. ``Several individuals affiliated with  the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their  interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals.'' Mueller's report  states that some corroborating electronic communications were deleted.    One editorial in the Washington Post asked the question: How could  there be obstruction of justice even if there was little evidence to  support the underlying suspicion of Trump campaign coordination with  Russia?   First, Mr. Mueller argued:         ``Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to       protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against       investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into       a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury       to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless       of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.''    More specifically, ``the President had a motive to put the FBI's  Russia investigation behind him,'' Mr. Mueller wrote. ``A thorough FBI  investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President  personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or  that would give rise to personal and political concerns.''   I am quoting directly from the Mueller report.   For the record, the President did not fully cooperate with Special  Counsel Mueller's investigation. The President refused to sit for an  interview. He has taken every opportunity to say that this whole  process was a witch hunt. He has done all he can to undermine the  authority of the special counsel, its investigators, its purpose and,  therefore, its results.   As Special Counsel Mueller noted in his final report:         Beginning in December 2017, the [Special Counsel] sought       for more than a year to interview the President on topics       relevant to both Russian-election interference and       obstruction-of-justice . . . we received the President's       written responses . . . we informed counsel of the       insufficiency of those responses in several respects . . .       Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed       voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for       his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be       inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made       significant progress and had produced substantial evidence       for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially       lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in       finishing our investigation. . . .    So there is no question that the President did not cooperate as Mr.  Mueller had requested.   Special Counsel Mueller noted that he declined to ``make a  traditional prosecutorial judgment'' due to its acceptance of the  Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, opinion  prohibiting the indictment of a sitting President. The special counsel  stated that while the OLC opinion holds that a sitting President may  not be prosecuted, the OLC opinion ``recognizes that a criminal  investigation during the President's term is permissible. The OLC  opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after  he leaves office. . . . Given those considerations, the facts known to  us, and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the  criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual investigation  in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and  documents materials were made available.''   That is ending a quote by the special counsel. Mr. Mueller's report  is a clear directive to Congress to move forward with its own  proceedings.   The criminal process at issue here for a sitting President is  completely separate and independent of both the congressional oversight  power and the congressional impeachment power for high crimes and  misdemeanors. Even if the House decides to begin impeachment  proceedings against the President--and it has the sole power to do so-- and even if the Senate were to convict the President--it has the sole  power to do so--the Constitution provides that ``the Party convicted  shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial,  Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law.''   The report emphasizes the President's constitutional obligation to  faithfully execute the laws under article II, section 3 of the  Constitution, and notes that ``the proper supervision of criminal law  does not demand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt  intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding  financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment.''   Congress should take action and convene oversight hearings on the  Mueller report and the underlying evidence. The report states:         Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that       were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement       investigations, including the Russian-interference and       obstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried       out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought       to use his official power outside of usual channels.        These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special       Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General's       recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the       scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts       with witnesses with the potential to influence their       testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help illuminate       their significance.    That is again quoting from the Mueller report.   These are disturbing and troubling actions by the President. Congress  needs to get to the bottom of what happened and lay bare the facts for  all Americans to see.   The report continues:         The President's efforts to influence the investigation were       mostly unsuccessful, but  [[Page S2602]]       that is largely because the persons who surrounded the       President declined to carry out orders or accede to his       requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which       ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for       lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell Acting Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein that the Special Counsel must be removed, but       was instead prepared to resign over the President's order.       Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's       message to Attorney General Sessions that he should confine       the Russia investigation to future election meddling only.       And McGahn refused to recede from his recollection about       events surrounding the President's direction to have the       Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple       demands that he do so.    That is again quoting from the Mueller report.   The American people can take little comfort in the fact that the  episodes of potential obstruction of justice would have been much worse  had the President's staff actually followed through on his orders. The  misconduct here emanates from the President himself.   The report notes the marked change in the President's behavior--after  the firing of FBI Director Comey--once the President realized that  ``investigators were conducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into  his own conduct . . . The President launched public attacks on the  investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence  adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a  series of targeted efforts to control the investigation.   For instance, the President attempted to remove the special counsel.  He sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit  the investigation. He sought to prevent public disclosure of  information about the June 9, 2016, meeting between Russians and  campaign officials. And he used public forms to attack potential  witnesses who might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses  who declined to cooperate with the government.   The report continues:         The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws       to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office       accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances       and the principle that no person is above the law. . . . In       sum, contrary to the position taken by the President's       counsel, we concluded that, in light of the Supreme Court       precedent governing separation-of-power issues, we have a       valid basis for investigating the conduct at issue in this       report. In our view, the application of the obstruction       statutes would not impermissibly burden the President's       Article II function to supervise prosecutorial conduct or to       remove inferior law enforcement officers.    The report concludes:         The protection of the criminal justice system from corrupt       acts by any person--including the President--accords with the       fundamental principle of our government that ``no person in       this country is so high that he is above the law.''    They cited U.S. v. Lee, Clinton v. Jones, and U.S. v. Nixon.   Congress, through its oversight powers and constitutional  responsibilities, should closely examine, investigate, and take  testimony on the following episodes and events relating to potential  obstruction of justice by President Trump.   The special counsel examined these episodes in great detail and found  supportive documentary and testimonial evidence that raised significant  concerns about potential wrongdoing in a number of cases, including the  Trump campaign's response to reports about Russia's support for Trump;  conduct involving FBI Director Comey and National Security Advisor  Michael Flynn; the President's reaction to the continuing Russia  investigation; the President's termination of Comey and efforts to have  Rosenstein take responsibility; the appointment of special counsel and  efforts to remove him; efforts to curtail the special counsel's  investigation; efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence or  affect witness cooperation or testimony; further efforts to have  Attorney General Sessions take control of the investigation, after  recusal; efforts to have White House Counsel Don McGahn deny that the  President had ordered him to have the special counsel removed; conduct  towards Flynn and Manafort; and conduct involving Michael Cohen. That  is quite a long list.   Congress should now rise to its constitutional responsibility and  conduct vigorous oversight based on the roadmap provided by the Mueller  report, both as to Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential  election and efforts to obstruct justice during the Mueller  investigation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
