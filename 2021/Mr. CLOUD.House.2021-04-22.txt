 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Luis Palau, a  minister and evangelist from Argentina, who eventually called the  United States home.   Luis Palau passed away on March 11, 2021, leaving behind a legacy of  faith, hope, and love.   His work as a passionate representative for Christ, and one of the  most influential international evangelists in history, earned him the  nickname of the ``Billy Graham of Latin America.'' He shared with  Graham the conviction to make disciples of all nations, as Scripture  commands.   His home country of Argentina, much of the Spanish-speaking world,  and the United States came to know and respect him because of his  faithful preaching, evangelism, and work to unite Christians and reach  all peoples of all backgrounds.   With a career that spanned over a half a century, he shared the good  news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with millions of people throughout  television, radio, print, and live events. His platform enabled him to  speak with and influence many political and military leaders.   In spite of all that, he once said: ``I've never thought of myself as  someone special. I'm just a kid from a cow town in Argentina. Yet God  grabbed my heart at a young age and chose to use me to share His good  news.''   One of his favorite Scriptures, which also begins the movie about his  life, is James 4:10, which says: ``Humble yourselves before the Lord,  and He will lift you up.''   It is a good reminder for all of us.   May his family be comforted during this time.                            ____________________
