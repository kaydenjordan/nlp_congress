 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st Century  President Act, a bipartisan bill that I am glad to have authored and  introduced.   Federal law hasn't caught up to where progress in this country is,  specifically when it comes to who a future President can be.   This bill would change Federal law that refers to a President's  spouse. Sections that currently refer to a President's ``wife'' or  ``widow'' would be changed to ``spouse'' in recognition of the fact  that, in the 21st century, the President could either be a woman or a  person from the LGBTQ community.   Without this change to the U.S. Code, for example, the law that makes  it a crime to threaten, kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the  President or the President's family would fail to include a future  female or gay President and their potential spouse.   This change is long overdue. Someday, there could be a President  Kamala Harris, or Elizabeth Warren, or Amy Klobuchar, or Tammy Baldwin,  or Pete Buttigieg, or a President Nikki Haley, or Kristi Noem, or Liz  Cheney.   The words in law matter. It is critically important that Federal law  recognizes that we could one day have a President who is not a man, or  even a straight man, and that they and their families deserve equal  protection under the law.   I am glad that this bill passed the House by voice vote last Congress  and that it has now been voted out of the Judiciary Committee twice on  a voice vote.   I personally thank Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee for  their support of this important bipartisan bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to, once again, support the 21st Century President Act.
