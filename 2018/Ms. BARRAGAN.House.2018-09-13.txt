 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Leana  Wen.   Dr. Wen is the new president of Planned Parenthood. Dr. Wen is an  immigrant. Her family came here from China, and they were granted  political asylum when she was a child. She is a Rhodes Scholar, and she  grew up poor in my congressional district in Compton, California.   She has worked to close the racial health disparities that are  happening in healthcare and to reduce infant mortality. She has been a  voice against cuts to healthcare. And she is a champion for health  clinic funding across the country, to make sure they can continue to  serve low-income families.   I am proud to say that she is a fighter, and I am proud to say that  she grew up in Compton, California.   With that, Dr. Wen, congratulations. I am looking forward to working  with you and Planned Parenthood.                            ____________________
