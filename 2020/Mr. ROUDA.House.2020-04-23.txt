 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  legislation.   But let's be clear: 50,000 of our fellow Americans have already died.  We have 26 million Americans out of work. We have tens of thousands of  small businesses that will not be able to participate in this  legislation because we haven't funded it enough, and we have cities  clearly looking at the prospect of bankruptcy.   So we do have a lot more work to do, and I hope we can continue to  work in a bipartisan fashion, stop the partisan sniping, and do what we  were meant to do here to protect our country.
