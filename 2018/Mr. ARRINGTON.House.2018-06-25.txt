 Mr. Speaker, some of the political rhetoric and  political opportunism is at an all-time high of ridiculous on this  issue of immigration. Let's take a step back and let's think through  this, and let us reason together as Americans.   No American who I have talked to in my district in west Texas or  beyond, has any problem with folks immigrating to this great Nation. We  are a Nation of immigrants. But we are a Nation of laws.   And just like if I took folks out of the unemployment line and took  them to your office and sat them in your office and said, you have got  to hire them, or you are heartless. You don't care about them.   You would look at me like I had three heads, and you would say, they  have got to go through an application process. We have got to vet them.  We need to know that they have the merit to fill the job, that they are  competent, that they have the moral character, that they are qualified.                                time  1215    There is not a single Democrat, if I brought them people from that  unemployment line, who would just hire them on account of my threats of  their being heartless and any other fear tactic. Why would we be any  different with the standards of citizenship in this great Nation? Why?   Most of these kids coming over here are unaccompanied, about 83  percent, and then some with their parents. There has been this recent  uproar about kids coming and being separated from their parents. I  don't like that. I wish it weren't the case. I am prepared to fix it.  That is what we should do in Congress, fix the laws when we find  something that is not working.   This President is just enforcing the laws. We haven't had a President  enforce the laws. We haven't had the respect for the Constitution and  the rule of law in so long that we are outraged that a President would  actually just  [[Page H5585]]  hold people accountable for breaking the law and violating our  sovereignty.   Then there is that little hang-up with the 1997 Flores case, which is  the law of the land that says you can't hold a minor for more than 20  days. That is the law. If you want it changed, then write your  Congressman, call your Congressman, and get him to fix it. Instead of  holding press conferences on the border, why don't you get back to  work, roll up your sleeves, and work across the aisle to solve the  problem.   Remember, most of these kids are coming from a place where they  presumably fear for their lives. Their lives are at risk every day, and  now they are in a country where they get three hot meals, and they get  shelter. They don't have to worry about whether somebody is going to  kill them. I would say that is a great start, for a benevolent country  to do that.   Meanwhile, we have to process folks who don't come to a port of  entry--as is the law of the land--to present yourself as an asylum  seeker. We have the law for that. We have an answer: Present yourself  at a port of entry.   But if you cross the border any other place, then you are going to be  caught now, under this President, arrested, and processed for your  hearing. And if found unlawfully to be here, you will be deported. That  is the way it works. That is the way it ought to work.   Now, international law says that if you are fleeing for your life,  you should stop in the first safe country you come to. That would be  Mexico. That is where they should all be, if they are truly asylum  seekers. If you are truly afraid for your life, you ought to be  grateful that you are safe, that you don't have to worry, that you  trust that the process will work, and that you will be vetted and found  legitimate.   I don't want to separate the parents from their kids. This President  doesn't want to either.   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to get off our duff, do our job, and fix  the problem. Everybody who is running around, taking this opportunity  to fly whatever flag he or she wants to fly on this, let's solve the  problem.   In Texas, illegal immigration costs us $6,000 per illegal immigrant,  $12 billion, over 10 percent of our budget, and $100 billion  nationwide. It is a huge cost: education, healthcare, the list goes on.  We are already insolvent, $21 trillion in debt. We can't afford to make  good on the promises for our kids and grandkids.   What is wrong with this picture?   Mr. Speaker, we have to work together to solve this problem, secure  the border, stop illegal immigration, move to a merit-based immigration  system, and move this country forward as leaders.                            ____________________
