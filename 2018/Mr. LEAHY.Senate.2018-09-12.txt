 Mr. President, American taxpayers are facing an uncertain  time. After rushing to pass an enormously complex, budget-busting tax  bill late last year, Republicans in Congress have set the table for the  upcoming tax season to be a time of serious confusion for the public.  At the center of this sits the IRS, which is in the midst of trying to  modernize its systems, effectively perform its tax collection  functions, and implement this boondoggle of a tax law. Today the Senate  considers a nominee to head the IRS. While I strongly disagree with  most of the tax policy decisions that this administration has made, I  am supporting this nominee because the IRS deserves to have dedicated  leadership at the top.   There is little debate over Mr. Rettig's qualifications for this  position. By all accounts, he has extensive tax law experience and has  worked closely with the IRS in advisory roles over the years. Perhaps,  most importantly, he would ensure that the IRS has full-time leadership  in place, which stands in stark contrast to how the administration has  chosen to run the agency to date. Rather than putting an Acting  Commissioner in place who would serve exclusively in that role, the  administration chose instead to have a political appointee in the  Department of Treasury split his time between his policy role in the  Department and the critical role of leading the IRS. There is no doubt  that this does a disservice to American taxpayers. It also raises  questions about the political independence of the IRS.   I appreciate that many Senators will be opposing this nomination  because of the egregious decision made by the administration in July to  end the reporting of so-called ``dark money'' donors to the IRS. In a  time when Russia has been shown to use these types of organizations to  funnel money as part of an effort to influence our elections, ending  the reporting of donor information raises serious questions about who  this administration is aiming to protect. I was proud to join a letter  led by Senators Klobuchar and Wyden urging the Department of Treasury  to reinstate the reporting requirements.   At the same time, we have seen the impact that the lack of dedicated  leadership and the disastrous budget cuts adopted over the years by  Republicans has had at the IRS. Its website crashed on tax day,  crippling the ability of millions of Americans to file their taxes on  time. Rural Americans are struggling to get the help they need to file  their taxes. It still needs to provide guidance to taxpayers on how the  Republican tax law will impact them. Without a full-time leader in  place, I worry that the IRS will be rudderless at the top. Ultimately,  such an outcome would be unfair to hard-working Vermonters who just  want to pay their taxes as quickly and easily as possible.   As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to  fight for the funding the IRS needs to meet the many challenges it  faces and repair the damage caused by years of budget neglect. I will  also be supporting the nominee today, despite my unequivocal opposition  to the IRS dark money decision, so that the agency has the leadership  it needs as well.    Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on this.   Today, the Senate will consider final passage of the ``Minibus #1''  conference report. This package contains the Legislative Branch, Energy  and Water Development, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies Appropriations Bills.   I agree with what Vice Chairman Shelby has said. When we first  considered this package in June, we held our first real debate on the  Senate floor on an appropriations bill in many years. We had eight  rollcall votes on amendments. We adopted a managers' package that  Senator Shelby and I submitted. It contained 32 more--a step toward  returning to regular order.   Today, we are going to take another step. This is not exactly the  bill I would have written. I think it is safe to say it is not exactly  the bill Chairman Shelby would have written. We know you have to have  compromise. You have to work things out. I also knew I could rely on  his word, and he could rely on my word. That is why we are here today  voting on this bipartisan package.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill  includes significant new investments in mental health and opioid abuse  treatment. We are not just talking about things we would like to do to  address opioid abuse; we are actually including it in a bill. It  invests $1 billion in new funding over fiscal year 2017 levels for  mental healthcare programs and suicide prevention and $454 million over  fiscal year 2017 for opioid treatment and prevention.   This bill also provides resources important to Vermonters. It  increases funding for long-term, noninstitutional care programs like  the Veterans Independence Program in Vermont, which partners with  community providers to support veterans who prefer to continue living  in their own homes, avoiding costly nursing home care and offering  better quality of life. It provides funding for homeless veterans  programs, such as the Grant and Per Diem program that offers supportive  transitional housing to homeless veterans, and it includes a $40  million increase for Supportive Services for Veteran Families to help  veterans and their  [[Page S6134]]  families secure permanent affordable housing.   The bill nearly doubles funding for the popular Adaptive Sports Grant  Program and expands it so that more service-disabled veterans,  including those who suffer from invisible injuries like PTSD and brain  injuries, can participate in lifelong sports in their communities, or  train to showcase their mental and physical training at national  competitions. This bill also includes a $40 million investment for the  National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and its evidence- based approach to the treatment of veterans bearing the hidden wounds  of war.   However, I am extremely disappointed that House Republicans and  President Trump refused to accommodate funding for the costs associated  with the VA Choice Program. The program is going to face a shortfall  beginning in May 2019. We are not helping our veterans if we make  promises we don't keep. We cannot just take funding from other programs  for veterans or terminate programs to help low-income Americans or  important research at the National Institutes of Health, even though  the President is proposing it.   We must adjust the budget caps to accommodate programs for our  veterans that have already passed Congress and been signed into law.   We made a promise to veterans. The chairman and I will work hard on  making sure Congress keeps that promise.   In the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill, we make  significant investments that support scientific research, make America  more competitive in clean energy and increase funds for renewable  energy.   Congress rejected President Trump's shortsighted attempt to eliminate  ARPA-E, which researches and invests in new energy technologies, and  increased its funding by $60 million over fiscal year 2018. Thanks to  the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, investments in the Office of Science  are increased by $1.2 billion over fiscal year 2017, paving the way for  new and groundbreaking scientific research.   And with Hurricane Florence set to make landfall on America's East  Coast, this package includes the highest ever level of funding for the  Army Corps' Civil Works program of nearly $7 billion. For every dollar  invested, it is estimated that there is a $16.60 return by mitigating  flood damage and transportation rate savings from moving goods on our  waterways.   The Energy and Water bill also makes important investments in our  rural communities through regional commissions, including $20 million  for the four-State Northern Border Regional Commission. We once again  provide strong funding for the Weatherization Program, which helps so  many families in Vermont and other northern States who struggle with  high home heating prices during the cold winter months. Ad I am pleased  that the bill supports much needed repairs and improvements in our  environmental infrastructure and energy infrastructure and strengthens  innovative ways to deliver these critical assets that will make Vermont  and the entire country more resilient to the changing climate and  violent weather events.   The Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill includes funding to pay  congressional interns for the first time. A congressional internship  offers an entrance to a career in public service, but many dedicated,  young adults do not have the means to spend a summer working for free  in Washington or in our home districts. By paying interns for their  work, we open the door to a wider and more diverse pool of applicants  looking to serve their country.   I have long realized the potential benefits to our country of  providing this opportunity to talented young people from diverse  backgrounds. That is why, since my first day in the Senate, in 1975, I  made sure there were the resources available in my office to compensate  our interns. I am glad this opportunity will now be available in every  office, both House and Senate.   For the first time in the legislative branch bill, we are also  requiring Senate candidates to file electronic campaign finance  reports, something the House has required since 1995. This will  increase transparency in campaign finance and finally bring the system  into the 21st century.   This is a compromise bill. It makes significant investments in the  American people. It was not an easy path to get to where we are, but  the Shelby-Leahy-McConnell-Schumer agreement we entered into--the four  of us--has laid the bipartisan framework for a path forward. This  package does have bipartisan support. It is free of poison pill riders,  and it is in line with the bipartisan budget agreement.   I commend my friend Richard Shelby for his leadership. I also thank  Senators Alexander, Feinstein, Boozman, Schatz, Daines, and Murphy for  their vital contributions.   This is the only successful path forward for the remaining  appropriations bills, and I am hopeful that House Republicans will  continue to engage with this process.   I also remain hopeful that President Trump will join this bipartisan  and bicameral vision for the appropriations process.   However, the President's repeated shutdown threats are not helpful.   Just last week, at a campaign style rally, the President threatened  to shut down the government after the midterm elections--an attempt  that would avoid the immediate political consequences of his brash and  short-sighted decision to hold the American people hostage for his  useless and ill-considered border wall, which he has repeatedly  promised Mexico would pay for.   A government shutdown is not a political talking point. It has real  consequences on real people, and I hope the President will leave his  rhetoric at his rally and work with Republicans and Democrats in  Congress.   In the Senate, we have come together, Republicans and Democrats. We  have made more progress than we have in decades in appropriations.   I hope that we will continue down this path and pass the two  additional minibus appropriations bills that are in conference before  the end of the fiscal year. Funding the government is one of Congress's  most basic responsibilities, and we owe it to the American people to do  our jobs.   Lastly, I often say I am a constitutional impediment to my staff-- Chuck Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, Jay Tilton, and Jean  Kwon, as well as Chairman Shelby's staff, Shannon Hines, Jonathan  Graffeo, and David Adkins, as well as the staff on both sides of the  aisle for each of the three subcommittees. It takes a lot people to get  a bill like this across the finish line, and I thank them for their  hard work and dedication.   I am ready to vote.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have spoken before about Suvash Darnal,  an extraordinary Nepalese Dalit activist who was tragically killed in a  traffic accident in Virginia on August 15, 2011.   Mr. Darnal was only 31 years old when he died, but he had already  made more of his life than many people who live to be twice or three  times his age. He grew up impoverished, with nothing to look forward  to. In large measure because of the adversity he experienced and his  inherent thirst for knowledge, he became a passionate advocate for his  people at home and around the world. As I have said before, his  integrity, his humility, his vision, and his dedication live on as an  inspiring example of why caste discrimination has no place in the 21st  century, in Nepal or anywhere else.   From 2008 to 2009, Mr. Darnal was a fellow at the National Endowment  for Democracy. Carl Gershman, President of NED, was among Mr. Darnal's  admirers and has helped to convey the lessons of Mr. Darnal's life to a  wider audience.   I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gershman's account of recent events  in Kathmandu in remembrance of Suvash Darnal be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                          [From the kathmandupost]                             (By Carl Gershman)         Aug. 28, 2018.--I visited Nepal recently to attend two days       of memorial events held in honour of Suvash Darnal, an       activist for Dalit rights who perished in a terrible car       accident in Washington in 2011. I first met Darnal a decade       ago when he was a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the       National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the organisation that       I head. 1 found him to be an unusually gifted democracy       activist. He had a marvellously engaging personality, and he       impressed many people in Washington as a sophisticated       analyst of Nepal at a time when the country was just coming       out of a civil war. He was also an ardent and effective       spokesman against caste discrimination.        Darnal had the ability to make the Dalit issue come alive       for Americans, partly by  [[Page S6136]]       drawing parallels with America's own history of slavery and       racial discrimination. There are obviously great differences       between the US and Nepal, as well as between racial and caste       discrimination. But experiences have a way of travelling       across borders and cultures in our globalised world, and in       his public presentation as a NED fellow on discrimination       against Dalits, Darnal called for a programme of `affirmative       action', an idea that was developed in the US after the civil       rights movement to highlight the need for proactive measures       to address the deeply rooted problem of racial inequality.        One of the attributes that made Darnal such an effective       activist was that he understood the importance of       organisation and the need for institutions of civil society       capable of taking collective action. When he was only 20       years old, he took the lead in creating the Jagaran Media       Centre which was both the largest Dalit media outlet in South       Asia and an advocacy group fighting to eliminate caste-based       discrimination.        When king Gyanendra took power in 2001 and shut down       Nepal's nascent democracy, he helped found the Collective       Campaign for Peace, a coalition of 43 non-governmental       organisations that became the secretariat for the civic       movement fighting for the restoration of democracy. And when       he returned from his fellowship at NED, during which he had       thought deeply about the need to change the pure-impure       dichotomy of the caste-based culture and system in Nepal, he       created the Samata Foundation to bridge the gap between       politics and caste.        What has impressed me about the Dalit movement in Nepal is       that it did not succumb to discouragement by Darnal's tragic       death, but has found a way to build upon his legacy of       struggle and organisation. The programme of remembrance on       August 14-15 consisted of three major events--a conference at       Tribhuvan University at which five young Dalit scholars and       practitioners presented papers on different dimensions of the       continuing struggle against caste discrimination; an evening       forum where four prominent international scholars placed the       Dalit issue in a global context; and a concluding award       ceremony at Kathmandu's City Hall attended by 500 people at       which frontline Dalit activists were recognised for their       efforts to carry forward Darnal's vision of social justice.        These events took place at a time of deep anxiety among       Dalits over the rise of nationalism in Nepal that has led the       Left Alliance government to dismiss demands for minority       rights and the inclusion of marginalised groups as       inconsistent with the need for national unity. This problem       was addressed by a paper delivered at the Tribhuvan       University conference by Amar BK, a PhD candidate at the       University of Pittsburgh in the US, who wrote that despite       the hopes for an end to untouchability engendered by the       adoption in 2007 of a progressive interim constitution, the       recent rise of Hindu religious nationalism has caused an       anti-Dalit backlash. Other conference papers highlighted the       persistence of exclusion and discrimination in the judiciary       in Nepal and the need to refute `dominant narratives' against       affirmative action, such as that the policy undermines       meritocracy.        Despite the current backsliding on the Dalit issue, I was       heartened that the movement is pressing ahead at every level.       In Parliament, Dalit Members of Parliament are preparing       shadow bills on the critical issues of land reform,       employment, housing, health care, education and the defence       of political rights and freedom of assembly and association.       At the state level, the Samata Foundation is developing a       leadership academy to train new Dalit members of Provincial       Assemblies. Training and protection are also being provided       to the thousands of Dalits who have been elected to positions       on local councils but who are being blocked by old-line       forces from carrying out their responsibilities. And, of       course, there are continuing efforts to address the critical       long-term need for youth education and capacity-building.        What especially impressed me was the invariably positive       and hopeful attitude that the Dalit activists take to the       challenges they face, despite the legacy of harsh       discrimination and a bloody civil war. At the Tribhuvan       University conference, for example, grassroots activist Sona       Khatik movingly described the terrible injustices she had       suffered, yet said that she had decided early on to take her       revenge by doing good deeds, not by using violence. Darnal's       widow Sarita Pariyar also took the path of nonviolence by       invoking the memory of Dr Martin Luther King when she spoke       about ending the scourge of caste humiliation.        This positive attitude exemplified the spirit of Suvash       Darnal, who always rejected the politics of grievance and       victimisation. He never appealed to people's sense of guilt       over the injustices done to Dalits, nor did he ever ask for       sympathy, let alone pity. Rather than put people off with       rancour and righteous anger, he preferred to draw them in       with humour, warmth and wit. He always took the high road and       appealed to common ideals of social justice and shared       humanity. The Dalit movement is building upon what Suvash       accomplished, and is using his example as a model and       inspiration. If they succeed, they will make Nepal a stronger       and more successful country, and will give inspiration to       others around the world who are responding to new threats to       democracy at a very troubled time in world history.                            ____________________
