 Mr. Chairman, about 1 out of 3 Wisconsinites have a gas  stove, and about 40 percent nationwide do. There is some name-calling  over there as far as what the parties stand for.   The gas stove is about three times cheaper than the electric stove.  The Republican Party is the party of the working class. The party that  pays attention to what their energy bill is. There is another class of  people out there: The rich Hollywood types, the high-tech billionaires,  the well-paid college professors who don't have to worry how much they  pay for electricity.   As a result, that side feels very good when a bill is passed where  they restrict what the hoi polloi can do. Also, they don't have to  worry about the welfare class because they will give stuff perhaps to  the welfare class to make up the difference. But they won't help the  middle class. And that is who the Republican Party tries to look out  for. The average guy who knows exactly what he is paying in his energy  bill.   Mr. Chair, I ask that we leave the working class alone.    Mr. Speaker, we go home every weekend. In June, when we  go home to Wisconsin, what do we think of? What is going on in June?  June is Dairy Month in Wisconsin. It is Dairy Month around the whole  country.   Of course, last weekend, I spent Dairy Month at Breakfast on the Farm  in Winnebago County and Breakfast on the Farm in Manitowoc County,  having milk and all sorts of different cheeses.   Whether you like Colby or provolone, cheddar or mozzarella, whether  you like your milk pasteurized or raw, whole or 2 percent, whether you  like cream cheese or just plain cream, Wisconsin is America's  Dairyland, and everybody has to remember, June is Dairy Month.   Now, on to our next topic. I have just been reading about a KGB  defector. What he wrote should be required reading for all Congressmen  and all young children. His name, he has since died, is Yuri Bezmenov.  He was a Soviet defector in the 1980s.   When he defected--he defected to China--he gave an interview about  the KGB. He said things that I think are far different than what the  average American thinks about the KGB.   He pointed out that about 85 percent of the KGB employees were not  spies. They were not going around looking for nuclear secrets or  finding out more about our military. They were wide out in the open.  They were engaging in psychological warfare, subversion to destroy the  American psyche.   He pointed out that what they do is out in the open, if only the  press would pay attention. Well, you can see he was a newcomer to  America, as he thought the press might pay attention.   He pointed out that, at the time, people might think we were at  peace, but in fact, we were at war. It was a war, psychological  warfare.   Nikita Khrushchev said the same thing. He felt we would destroy  America from within. It would not be a military attack that would  destroy America. It would be America losing confidence in itself.   There are a variety of ways in which the United States is, in my  mind, in danger. Last week, we talked about the huge deficit, and  President Biden, through a variety of bills last year, certainly put  the value of the dollar at risk.   You can say we are in danger because we are losing the value of the  family. Of course, John Adams said that our Constitution is built for a  moral and religious people, totally unfit for any other kind.   We have a situation here in which a group called Black Lives Matter,  which had a lot to do with the Democrats maintaining their majority in  2020, Black Lives Matter was opposed to the traditional nuclear family.  Of course, they have a lot of allies here in Congress who presumably  didn't object to that.   That is another way we could tear down America, through our growing  welfare state, having more and more people without the psychological  background of a family.   We certainly have a problem at the southern border. No normal country  could survive unlimited immigration. We see two things going on down  there. We see over 200,000 people a month streaming across the border,  and we also see, compared to past administrations, even people who  break the law are not deported.                                time  2110    You could say that is another way we are being destroyed from within.  It is not a military attack, but it is over 200,000 people who have not  been trained how to become Americans, who have not had drilled into  them the freedoms that we should respect and that we are a great  country because our great Constitution is supposed to have a limited  government, guarantee us a limited government, and we are supposed to  be self-reliant. That is certainly a problem.   We have the bizarre transgender movement. I ran into a gal the other  day who had literal surgery taking away some of her organs at 15 years  old and puberty blockers. That is another way to completely try to  blend the difference of the sexes, which would be another way to  destroy society.   What I am going to focus on tonight is the Biden obsession with  racism. I think if there is one issue that Joe Biden seems most  obsessed over, it is this idea that supposedly in the United States we  are a racist country. He brought it up four times in his inaugural  speech and talked about white privilege once. This year, in his State  of the Union speech, again Joe Biden talked about the racist police and  if you are a person of color, you have to tell your children to watch  out for the racist police. Obviously, this is an important message from  Joe Biden.   He has certainly acted on it, as well. Right now, his Department of  Labor nominee--she may make it; she may not--claimed in the past that  we are a society built on white privilege, kind of this bizarre hatred  of White people that I thought was merely in academia, but Joe Biden  decided to try to appoint someone head of the Department of Labor who  felt that way. I sure hope the Senate rejects her.   He is trying to appoint General Charles Q. Brown to be head of the  Joint Chiefs. He right off the bat said we have too many White  officers. He wants to restrict the number of White officers in the  military to 43 percent. In other words, he doesn't want qualified White  people becoming officers, because he has got some psychological problem  there. I think we have to pay attention to that sort of thing when it  comes to the Biden administration.   This is not limited to President Biden. Not long after he took  office, both Senator Duckworth of Illinois and Senator Hirono of Hawaii  threatened Joe Biden saying they did not want any more White men, that  they were not going to vote to confirm any more White men in his  administration. He met with them. They backed off that to a degree. I  should say, he shouldn't appoint White men unless they are gay, which  gets back to this kind of obsession with breaking away with the  traditional family that we sadly have among the Democratic Party right  now.   In addition to that, President Biden wants in his budget to have new  equity action teams in all of our government agencies: the Department  of the Interior, the Department of Justice. These equity action teams  presumably will enforce the type of things that Senators Duckworth and  Hirono want. They want to look at people's race before anybody gets  hired. They want to look at somebody's race before they get a  government grant. I think it is something that the American public is  not discussing anywhere nearly as much as they should.   It is kind of particularly ridiculous, because, of course, you are  never probably going to have a country in which more immigrants, who  have different ethnicity than the native born, have succeeded so much  and are so accepted. If you look around, the most successful ethnic  group in America today are Indian Americans. You look at other wildly  successful groups: Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cuban. Thomas  Sowell wrote 40 years ago--I can't vouch whether it is today or not-- but  [[Page H2878]]  by the second generation, immigrants from the Caribbean of African  descent outperform the average American.   At a time when the overwhelming evidence is that racism has very  little role in America, Joe Biden is trying to elevate the potentially  hard feelings by doing all he can by not treating people equally and  looking at people racially.   Now, I think we should have a discussion over this, and the  discussion does not necessarily have to be in Congress, but it should  be here, as well. I think the discussion should be in periodicals,  online, as people debate what the answers to various questions are.   First of all, how long should this go on? Affirmative action--in  other words, preferences based on race or based on sex, as well as  preferences for women--have been going on since 1965. We have been  going on with this thing 58 years. I have a feeling when Lyndon Johnson  really kicked it off in earnest--there was a more mild policy under  President Kennedy--when it was kicked off by President Johnson, I don't  think even he would have dreamed that this would have been going on for  57 years. The question is, should there be a time when it ends.   When we give people preferences or identify people by their ethnic  group, what defines somebody's ethnic group? Right now, we identify or  put on the government forms African American, Latin American, Asian  Pacific Islander, Native American. What makes up a person in these  groups?   Right now you self-identify. In the extreme case of Elizabeth Warren,  who was something like a 64th or a 128th Native American, she felt that  was enough that she should be a Native American. I think she is  relatively rare. I don't think a lot of Americans would do that, but  apparently it is legal. It was a way for her to become a professor at  Harvard Law School. But what should be the cutoff? A half a percent? A  quarter a percent? One-eighth?   On the face of it, it seems a little bit strange, because a lot of  these people you would never even guess what ethnicity they are, but  that is the way the system works nowadays. We do have DNA tests  nowadays. I think we should put some sort of standards as to who gets  preferences.   Then where you come from. Right now, if you are somebody whose  ancestry was in Spain and you come to the United States, you are  considered a European, but if your ancestry is Spain and your ancestors  spent three generations in Cuba, you are considered an ethnic minority.  To me, that seems a little bit silly. I am not sure what the difference  is.    Maybe the person from Spain just came here right now and the person  from Cuba, one-quarter Cuban, came here 50 years ago. Does this make  any sense that when you fill out the forms or see who is going to get  the government contract or who is going to get into Harvard Law School,  that the person from Cuba is treated different than the person from  Spain? If we have someone from Italy or somebody who was of Italian  descent but spent three generations in Argentina, should that person be  given preference? I think that is something we should have a public  discussion over.   Should you have to be from America? Right now, the way these programs  work, if you show up, if you are not even a citizen, you can get  preferences on the form.   You have an example right now, the Vice President's own dad who came  here from Jamaica. Originally, at the time this affirmative action  kicked in, I thought it was a little bit to make up for slavery or make  up for Jim Crow. Well, somebody like the Vice President's dad, he  wasn't mistreated in America. He wasn't in America at all. He came here  for the land of opportunity, came here to become a professor at  Stanford University. Is that fair?   When we try to identify different groups as somebody who really never  suffered in the United States at all, because they are a recent  immigrant, should they be getting these preferences? I think that is  something that should be talked about. I don't know.   Should there be a wealth component? We are supposedly helping the  underserved communities, but the way the programs work today and the  different areas that they pick out--I think it is government  employment, employment in businesses that do business with the  government, government contractors, if you have a business, and  admissions to universities.                                time  2120    Should there be a wealth component? If I am the son of a multi- multimillionaire who is a member of a favored group, do I get  preferences?   It kind of seems wrong to say I am an underserved group, but that is  the way it works today, which is typical, and we will come back in a  second to what Thomas Sowell says about affirmative action.   He wrote a book on the topic. Usually it benefits the well-off  people, as things that come up from the progressive background usually  do.   Should there be some familiarity with your background? I mean, if I  am going to claim to get preferences because my ancestors came from  Peru, should I have to know something about Peru?   Somebody that doesn't even know Spanish, has spent generations here,  never lived in a Spanish country, should I get preferences there?  Should that have something to do with this?   Are there jobs that should be exempt from preferences where it is  entirely based on merit? One of the things that is going on in America  today is a lot of medical schools are saying you don't have to take the  MCAT test.   Now, when I was younger, we usually associated doctors with the ones  that did the best on the test because if you were going to be a doctor,  it was a matter of life and death. We wanted to take the smartest  person no matter what.   Now we have medical schools saying we don't want to look at any test  to determine your intelligence. We want to base your admission on  things like what you say on an essay or how many groups you volunteered  for, that sort of thing.   I think we should have that discussion. Maybe we should have  preferences for certain jobs like college professor where you can say  it is not a matter of life and death if we have somebody who is not as  good, but we should make sure we always get the better people for the  medical field or for dentistry or for airline pilots or air traffic  controllers.   Should we say, well, we can afford to have people that aren't good  air traffic controllers because what is the worst thing that could  happen?   I think that is another question that we should be asking right now  because the Biden administration is clearly walking down this path.   That is why they have these what we are referring to as equity action  teams. We want to know exactly what standards the equity action teams  are using.   I had a fellow come up to me a few years ago whose son worked in one  of our Federal agencies, and he loved the job. He went to college for  the job.   He was told after 9 or 10 years why he was not being promoted. He was  told, you are a White guy who is not a veteran. We give preferences to  veterans too.   Is that fair? If they are going to continue down that path, shouldn't  we at least make it public so this guy wouldn't have gone to school to  learn about a field that he wanted to excel in, only to be told 10  years later that he is a White guy, he is not a veteran, too bad? I  think that is something that ought to be discussed before we hurt any  other people.   In any event, I think this is a topic to look at. I think it is  certainly one way to cause hard feelings in America.   I have talked about Thomas Sowell who wrote a book dealing with  affirmative action about 40 years ago now. He pointed out that other  countries that went down this path--America's not all the way down the  path--but have the same experiences as America.   First of all, it begins, and it is supposed to be temporary; 57 years  later, it is still here. It is supposed to be restricted to maybe one  or two ethnic groups, but here in America, first people of African  decent, and then people who never were mistreated in the United States  come here and are automatically given preferences based on where their  ancestors were born centuries ago.   We begin to add other groups. I make another point about why this is  relevant, because Joe Biden is also trying to add another preference  group.   He wants to add Middle Eastern and North African people. Right now, I  rattled off all the different backgrounds  [[Page H2879]]  that we are supposed to be keeping track of, but we don't keep track of  people from Algeria or Syria or Iraq, and Joe Biden wants to do that,  as well.   I think we should have a discussion there. There are not a lot of  people in this country with backgrounds from those countries, but there  are more and more people coming here.   Joe Biden apparently says that if you are from America, and you apply  for a job, and we have an immigrant from Algeria or an immigrant from  Iraq, people like that should be given preferences.   Well, I think maybe that is something we should talk about here a  little bit and see what the appropriate course of action is.   Whatever the course of action is, it should be after a thorough  public discussion, not just something, you know, pushed in under the  table because it is a sensitive topic.   In any event, I would ask the press to look into this situation. We  want to find out what rules President Biden's equity action teams are  operating under.   We want to have a public discussion. Is it right to add North African  and Middle Easterners to this topic?   Should we give preferences to people who have no background of  discrimination in America, people who just show up and immediately get  preferences?   I obviously have my strong opinions, but I would like to hear what  the pundit class, that so many of us read, has to say.   I would like to see maybe sometime the Committee on Education and the  Workforce or the Judiciary Committee look into this and see what the  different viewpoints are because it affects a lot of Americans. We are  kind of moving down this train without having a public discussion.   Those are my comments on that topic. I think it is a topic more  people ought to look into. I think they ought to review how some people  want to destroy America from within.    I think they ought to review what happened in other countries as they  went down the affirmative action path, be it Nigeria, be it Sri Lanka,  be it Malaysia or Singapore, and I think a lot of times it doesn't work  out very well.   It is something we ought to have a discussion about, and nobody else  is talking about it around here, so we throw that open for discussion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
