 Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this legislation to  stand with those advocating for human rights in Iran however I have  concerns that the legislation could prohibit the President's ability to  adjust sanctions as national security conditions warrant. I am hopeful  this is the last time that Congress puts forward a sanctions bill  without a clear mechanism to remove them as needed.
