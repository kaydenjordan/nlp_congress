 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the work of the  committee for doing the work of the American people.   Prior to coming to Congress, as a small-business owner and small- business leader, I was feeling the pain of the Dodd-Frank Act,  wondering whether anyone in Washington, D.C., was listening. Now that I  have had the opportunity to serve just this 1 year now in Congress, I  have gone around the district. I have gone around and talked to  businessowners, to farmers, and to community bankers who have been  suffering under this law.   One of the things that hasn't been talked about is how the Dodd-Frank  Act has harmed the SEC, how it has deprived people of due process. All  but the wealthiest Americans are trapped in a system where the SEC has  quasi-judicial hearings using administrative law judges. They have a 90  percent win rate because they have all the keys. They can block  discretion, they can block discovery, and they can limit the facts and  limit the debate.   So one of the good things that the Dodd-Frank reform--known as the  CHOICE Act--accomplishes is ending this process so that people do have  the right to due process in our courts.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 10 and to  end the abuses of the previous era.
