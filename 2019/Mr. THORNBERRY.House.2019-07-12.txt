 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I have only myself to speak, so I  reserve the balance of time to close.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, we had a number of these debates last night as far as  DOD resources in supporting the ICE mission at the border.   I might note, parenthetically, no Republican amendments on this issue  were made in order under the rule, only Democratic amendments.   But, on the substance of the matter, I completely agree with, I  think, the sentiments of the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson)  in that I would prefer not one dollar--or one person--from DOD have to  be sent to the border to support the ICE mission. We ought to fully  fund border security on its own, because we have enough issues with  broader national security for the Pentagon and the military to deal  with.   Unfortunately, that is not possible when we don't fully fund ICE and  when we have an unprecedented situation at the border. Border Patrol  stations are at a breaking point. They have been over capacity for  nearly all of 2019. DHS has already apprehended more than 390,000  illegal immigrant members in 2019, which is more than triple the amount  of the year before.   So we have triple the number of migrants, we don't fully fund border  security and ICE, and now this amendment says we also can't use DOD  resources to back up.   So what is the result? The result is either one of two things: You  have this humanitarian crisis that appalls us all because the resources  have not been put on the border to take care of these people and  process them appropriately, or you just give up border security and you  just have open borders and let anything and anybody who wants to come  in, come in.   Those are the alternatives if you don't provide the resources at the  border that are needed.   Again, my preference is DOD doesn't do any of this. DOD has its hands  full. But if you don't fully fund ICE commensurate with the number of  people, the situation they have got to deal with on the ground, triple  the number of migrants, if you don't fund them to deal with that  situation, then that is where DOD gets called in as backup and support.   As Ranking Member Rogers mentioned last night, there are no ICE  detainees in DOD facilities right now. I hope that there are not.  Again, DOD has its own mission.   But you create the problem if you don't fund ICE. If you say you  can't use DOD or anything else, then what happens? You have a  humanitarian crisis.   I think that we need to do better. This Congress needs to do better  on the whole issue of border security. That will benefit the migrants  that we are talking about; that will benefit DOD; and that will benefit  the country.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time to  close on this amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, there is a train of thought, a political philosophy in  the United States, at least since the sixties, that we are the problem,  that the world would be a better place if we reduced our military, if  we were weaker, if we did less; we are the problem.   In one political convention, Jeane Kirkpatrick called it the ``blame  America first'' approach, and I think we are seeing elements of that  philosophy in this amendment, because this amendment requires a bunch  of studies about how we cut stuff.   Now, it doesn't really talk about, okay, what are our adversaries  doing. It doesn't really talk about the challenges in meeting the  security needs of our neighborhoods, how we prevent terrorists from  coming to America and blowing us up, how we prevent the Russians, the  Chinese from doing a variety of things, the Iranians, North Korean  missiles. No, it just talks about, okay, what can we do to cut us.   And, specifically, section (a)(1)A asks for studies on options for  reducing the Nuclear Security Enterprise; B, options for reducing  service contracts; C, options for reducing special operations forces;  D, options for reducing overseas military presence; F, options for  replacing military personnel with civilian personnel. It is all about  cuts.   I understand that there is that approach, but that approach has not  been what has guided the broad majority of American political  leadership for the last 70 years, because that approach has been that  America needs to be strong. We are not perfect. Absolutely, the  Pentagon is not as efficient as it should be, no question. But the idea  is we should be strong and we have to pay attention to what adversaries  are doing. That is not the approach that this amendment takes.   One other point, I think that Chairman Smith made a very important  point a while ago, and that is one of the worst things we can do is  send men and women out on missions without providing the support, the  training, all that they need to, the best equipment, all that they need  to perform that mission successfully.                                time  1015    We owe them that when they risk their lives. Yet, that is exactly  what  [[Page H5740]]  this government, and I think there is blame on both sides, has done in  the past.   The world did not get safer. We did not reduce the missions we asked  them to do. Yet, the budget was cut by 20 percent. And what happened?  More of them lost their lives. There are real consequences to cuts  without taking into account a strategy and including what adversaries  are doing.   The administration has, for the first time in a long time, a  significant National Security Strategy. It is not perfect, but at least  it is an approach to dealing with these things: Here is the strategy.  Here are the resources we need to meet that strategy.   That is what they have given us. You can agree or disagree, but they  have done that.   That is not what this amendment does. This amendment says cut. This  amendment says, have America grow weaker and, somehow, the world will  benefit. I don't think that is true.   Madam Chair, I am opposed to this amendment. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I would inform the Chair that I have  only myself to speak on this amendment. I don't know if the chairman  has other speakers.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, let me start in a similar way that I started 2 days ago,  and that is to express my appreciation to the staff, which has done a  terrific job of wading through a ton of issues, a lot of paper, in  bringing this bill to the floor.   I also want to express my particular appreciation to some unsung  heroes, and those are the folks in the legislative counsel. Members and  staff come up with these great ideas. Well, it takes the professionals  to actually get that down on paper in legislative language in a timely  way so that we can deal with it here on the floor or in committee or  subcommittee, wherever it is. They do a magnificent job, and I don't  think they get enough attention for the work that they do.   In addition, I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Smith and  to all the members of the Armed Services Committee for their  commitment, for not just the work they put into it, but for their  dedication and commitment to the country's national security.   There have been some inferences, and even more than inferences, on  the floor that there is some sort of political maneuvering or games  going on. I have not seen that in the Armed Services Committee. I  believe, to a man and woman, every member of that committee is  sincerely dedicated to doing the right thing for the troops and for the  country's national security.   The truth is, together, we have done a lot of good work over the  years, 58 straight years. In recent years, we have together grappled  with the problem that we were discussing a few moments ago, a readiness  crisis that resulted in the highest number of aviation deaths in 6  years last year and an increasing number of accidents.   Together, we grappled to turn the corner and do a better job. There  is a lot of pride in what the committee together has done over the  years.   There is concern, at least among the Members on my side of the aisle,  that a lot of that progress we have made together stands a chance of  slipping backward with this bill.   We have spent 3 days going through hundreds of amendments. A lot of  times, we don't talk about the core of the bill. Let me give some  examples of the concerns that I have about the reductions in  authorization in the underlying bill that make a real difference.   For example, the underlying bill cut $295 million from aircraft  carrier procurement, leading to a 1-year delay in the construction of  the next carrier. We need 12 carriers. We have 11. We are on a path to  nine. As a result of this bill, we are going to delay by another year  getting another carrier.   It cuts $155 million from fast inshore attack craft mine  countermeasures. Within the last 2 days, we have had some of these  small boats in the Persian Gulf threaten British tankers, yet this bill  cuts $155 million from the sort of thing that deals with that.   A lot of us are concerned about what the Russians and the Chinese are  doing in hypersonics. A number of people think they are ahead of us in  a number of respects. This bill cuts $20 million from hypersonic wind  tunnels and infrastructure. It makes it harder for us to catch up.   This bill cuts $261 million from 5G next-generation communications.  These funds were supposed to go to sites across the country to kick- start domestic innovation and explore 5G applications in military  depots, seaports, and defense manufacturing. 5G is a big deal for the  military, and we are competing with the Chinese especially. Yet, the  bill cuts $261 million from what the administration requested.   It cuts $123 million from F-15 spares and repair parts. Twenty-eight  of these aircraft are grounded today. The average age of the fleet is  35 years. Yet, this bill cuts $123 million from the spare parts to get  those planes flying again. I think that is a mistake.   The bill cuts $42 million for a missile defense test that was  approved, on a bipartisan basis, for the SM3 Block 2A missile.   It cuts $376 million from next-generation OPIR, which is the new  satellite constellation to help warn against missile threat.   Specific, concrete things--these are not numbers out of the air.  These are specific things where Members are concerned that it leads to  sliding backward on readiness or not making the progress that we need  to make when it comes to our adversaries.    That was the bill coming out of committee. Then, as we have heard,  the bill took a disturbing turn on its way to the floor. I won't repeat  the numbers about the Rules Committee. The statistic that concerns me  the most, frankly, is that, of the amendments made in order that were  contested--in other words, there was a debate; there was a difference  of opinion; it was not agreed to--of those amendments that were made in  order, one was a Republican amendment,  Mike Turner's amendment on low- yield nukes. That was the only Republican opportunity to shift the bill  in a different direction.   Then, Madam Chair, I note that the Armed Services Committee has put  out a press release that is titled ``Democratic Priorities in the FY20  NDAA.''   The first bullet says, ``This is the first time in history that HASC  has cut $17 billion from the President's budget.''   ``First time in history,'' not exactly a way to maintain a bipartisan  approach to national security when the majority is boasting that, for  the first time in history, they are cutting a President's request more  than ever.   I turn to page 4: ``Accelerates Closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention  Facility. . . . Eliminates arbitrary statutory restrictions on transfer  of detainees from Guantanamo Bay.''   This restriction was put into law about 10 years ago under a  Democratic majority and with President Obama in the White House. It  prevented GTMO detainees from being transferred to the U.S. That was  taken out in this bill. Not exactly the way to build a bipartisan  majority.   On page 6, the headline is ``Protects Against Nuclear Catastrophe.''  Underneath, it says, ``Prohibits deployment funding for low-yield  nuclear warheads,'' and, ``Reduces requested funding for NNSA nuclear  weapons programs by $608 million.'' Down a little lower, it says,  ``Cuts $103 million from the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.''   So, we are going to prevent nuclear catastrophe by cutting ourselves.  It doesn't talk about what the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, North  Koreans, anybody else are doing. We prevent nuclear catastrophe by  cutting ourselves.   That is the trend that this bill has taken as it has approached the  floor.   I realize that there are various points of view within the Democratic  Caucus. I note a political article that says Congressional Progressive  Caucus leaders ``are demanding a string of concessions from Speaker  Pelosi and her top lieutenants.''   That is the concern, I think, that many of us have.   Madam Chair, I would say two things.   One is, unfortunately, this year in the House, we have spent a lot of  time on messaging bills that are never going to be considered by the  Senate, will never get to the President. I don't want the NDAA to turn  into a messaging  [[Page H5742]]  bill, where we can go home and brag about something we voted, but those  provisions have no chance of becoming law.   Secondly, and lastly, I would say there is a lot of good in this  bill. I have talked about some of the not so good, in my view. There is  a lot of good in this bill. There always is in an NDAA, in a bill this  big, good and bad. There is a lot of good, and a lot of Members on both  sides have contributed a lot of good, but the direction it has taken is  not for the good.   I would suggest that Members who do care about a strong military,  about doing the right things for our troops and for our American  national security, consider very carefully their vote on final passage  when it comes to that time.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    I am in its present form.    Madam Speaker, this motion is the last opportunity to  amend the bill, and it does so, of course, without delaying passage.  The bill, as it was considered in committee, authorized $733 billion  for defense. Thanks to the work of General Bacon, the committee added  $2.3 billion for disaster aid, and then the Rules Committee added the  widow's tax, Afghan visas, and other items that brought the total up to  about $737 billion.   This amendment takes one more incremental step to fill essential  funding gaps in the way that matters most to the troops. It restores  $1.6 billion of readiness for things like repairs to F-15s of which  only 59 percent are flyable today, and it restores money for training,  the things that matter most in saving the lives of our men and women.  It restores $308 million to the personnel account. Now, that is not as  much as the Pentagon asked for, but it does take it up to the level  that passed the Senate by a vote of 86-8.   Finally, it provides a 4 percent pay raise for the troops.   Now, remember, Madam Speaker, the current underlying bill does  nothing for pay. The formula is as it is, and those Members who have  claimed the underlying bill did something have gotten three Pinocchios  over it.   Well, this underlying measure does do something. It provides a 4  percent pay raise to help with recruitment and retention and to send a  message to our troops that we value them.   Now that is it, straight up the middle, three things, you either vote  for them or you vote against them.   It takes the total authorization to just about $740 billion. That is  not enough in my opinion, but it is better.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan.    Madam Speaker, it is straight up: pay raise, restore  personnel accounts, and improve readiness. It is straight up or down.  You are for it or against it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
