 Madam Speaker, last week, Vice  President Harris bizarrely said the southern border is secure. The  reality is more threatening and absurd.   Since Biden took office, over 3 million illegal aliens have crossed.  In August alone, there were over 200,000 illegal alien encounters. This  is three times the illegal crossings compared to  [[Page H8022]]  the last August when Donald Trump was President.   Dangerously, there are 66 trained murderers from the terrorist watch  list that have crossed. Separately, half a million illegal aliens have  invaded in the last year, admitted the Department of Homeland Security.   Biden and the Democrats are responsible for a national security  crisis due to the open border, with American families at a greater risk  of murderous attacks than ever before.   In conclusion, we will not forget 9/11. God bless our troops who  successfully protected America for 20 years as the global war on  terrorism continues, moving from a safe haven in Afghanistan to  America. God bless Ukrainian victory.                            ____________________
