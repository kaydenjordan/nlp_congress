 Mr. President, this is at least the third time the Senate  is debating Senator Marshall's proposal to terminate the national  emergency declaration related to COVID-19. I am going to have just a  few brief remarks on why the Senate ought to vote this down and move on  to the crucial year-end priorities that actually have a chance of  becoming law.   First, the Marshall resolution has been referred to the Senate  Finance Committee. As the chairman of the committee, we have long  focused on healthcare and, particularly, Medicare.  [[Page S6686]]  And my view is that the Marshall resolution is part of a larger effort  to create more redtape and less flexibility in American healthcare.   Now, I have been talking to a lot of Oregonians about many issues  over the last few months. And I can just say, nobody has come up to me  in one of our iconic Fred Meyer stores or to a townhall meeting and  said, ``Hey, Ron, we need more healthcare redtape.''   I want to be specific about what this means. The Marshall resolution  will make it harder to keep waivers on the books that have helped  resolve critical shortages of healthcare providers in hospitals  overwhelmed with sick patients. The policies allowed under the national  emergency have also helped address shortages of medical supplies needed  to treat patients and protect medical workers.   Looking at the bigger picture, the Marshall resolution is part of a  broader effort by Republicans to wipe out a host of important policies  that have saved lives and helped our healthcare system stay afloat over  the last few years.   This larger effort by Republicans, for example, could make it harder  for people to get hospital quality services provided at home where they  are most comfortable. There is a risk it would lead to a whole lot of  vulnerable Americans losing coverage through Medicaid.   Taken together, that is a recipe for chaos in American healthcare and  serious headaches for millions of patients who would have their  coverage and their care upended.   Nobody is saying that emergency policies that began in the pandemic  are going to stick around forever. Changes do have to be handled  responsibly. And what we try to do in the Finance Committee is work in  a bipartisan way.   So, colleagues, in my view, this Republican effort--and it has been  what we have been debating now again and again--comes down to less  flexibility and more chaos in American healthcare, and that sounds like  an idea the U.S. Senate ought to avoid.   That begins with voting down the Marshall resolution. My sense is  this is also exactly the wrong time to start undermining important  healthcare flexibilities. Doctors and public health experts--we have  all read these articles--are telling us this is going to be a painful  flu season. We are hearing this across the country. Hospitalizations,  colleagues, for the flu are already surging.   At the same time, there is a huge wave of RSV infections across the  country. That is particularly serious for infants and toddlers. It can  be a big problem for adults, too. Many pediatric hospitals are  overwhelmed. The flu and RSV are hitting just as the country braces for  possibly another COVID wave during the winter.   Congress ought to be looking here to support medical workers, protect  our healthcare system from becoming totally overwhelmed by viruses, and  save lives. The Marshall resolution and this broader Republican effort  that we have been hearing about on the floor to eliminate healthcare  flexibilities does the opposite.   An earlier version of this Marshall resolution passed back in the  spring because some Members were absent for the vote.   Colleagues, this is going nowhere in the other body.   Now, I will close by saying there are serious healthcare issues that  deserve bipartisan attention here in the Senate. For example, Democrats  and Republicans on the Finance Committee, many of them have been  working with Democrats in a very thoughtful way for months on improving  mental healthcare in America.   We are very proud on the Finance Committee that four major provisions  of our bipartisan work that we put in a year and a half on came out to  be the back letter text on mental health in the gun safety legislation.  So we want to work in a constructive way. You see that with mental  health. Members on the Finance Committee come forward with good ideas.  That is the kind of work we ought to be doing on healthcare.   My view is the Marshall resolution is a partisan step in the wrong  direction. I think it is a mistake for American healthcare at this  crucial moment to reduce flexibility for government to deal with the  challenges. I oppose the Marshall proposal.   I yield the floor.   The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading  and was read the third time.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 63
