 My personal view is that he richly deserves       impeachment.    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. One of the Members of the House of  Representatives said that we are bringing these Articles of Impeachment  so he doesn't get elected again.   Here we are, 10 months before an election, doing exactly what they  predicted. The whistleblower's lawyer, Mr. Zaid, sent out a tweet on  January 30, 2017.   Let me put that up on the screen:         The #coup has started. First of many steps. #rebellion.       #impeachment will follow ultimately.    And here we are.   What this body, what this Nation, and what this President have just  endured--what the House managers have forced upon this great body--is  unprecedented and unacceptable. This is exactly and precisely what the  Founders feared. This was the first totally partisan Presidential  impeachment in our Nation's history, and it should be our last.   What the House Democrats have done to this Nation, to the  Constitution, to the Office of the President, to the President himself,  and to this body is outrageous. They have cheapened the awesome power  of impeachment, and, unfortunately, of course, the country is not  better for that.   We urge this body to dispense with these partisan Articles of  Impeachment for the sake of the Nation, for the sake of the  Constitution.   As we have demonstrably proved, the articles are flawed on their  face. They were the product of a reckless impeachment inquiry that  violated all notions of due process and fundamental fairness. Then  incredibly--incredibly--when these articles were finally brought to  this Chamber without a single Republican vote, the managers then  claimed that now--now--they needed more process; that now they needed  more witnesses; that all of the witnesses that they compiled and all of  the testimony that you heard was not enough; that your job was to do  their job--the one, frankly, they failed to do.   We have already said, many times, the charges themselves do not  allege a crime or a misdemeanor, let alone a high crime or a  misdemeanor. There is nothing in the charges that could permit the  removal of a duly elected President or warrant the negation of an  election and the subversion of the American people's will. That should  be whatever party you are affiliated with. You are being asked to do  this when, tonight, the citizens of Iowa are going to be caucusing for  the first caucus of the Presidential election season for the Democratic  Party--tonight.   I think there is one thing that is clear. The President has had a  concern about other countries' carrying their fair share of burden of  financial aid. No one can doubt--and I think we have clearly set  forth--the issue of corruption in Ukraine.   The President's and the administration's policy on evaluating foreign  aid and the conditions upon which it is given have been clear. Mr.  Purpura laid that out in great detail.   The bottom line is that the President's opponents don't like the  President, and they really don't like his policies. They objected to  the fact that the President chose not to rely each and every time on  the advice of some of his subordinates, even though he, not those  unelected bureaucrats who work for him, were elected to office.   The President, under our constitutional structure, is the one who  decides our Nation's foreign policy. Here is a perfect example--the  House managers brought this up frequently: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.  He admitted on page 155 of his transcript testimony that he ``did not  know if there was a crime or anything of that nature''--that is his  quote--but that he ``had deep policy concerns.'' So there you have it.  The real issue is policy disputes.   Elections have consequences. We all know that. And if you do not like  the policies of a particular administration or a particular candidate,  you are free and welcome to vote for another candidate. But the answer  is elections, not impeachment.   To be clear, in our country, in the United States, the President,  elected by the American people, is, in the words of the Supreme Court,  ``the sole organ of the federal government in the field of  international relations'' and foreign policy for our government--no  unelected bureaucrats, not unhappy Members of the House of  Representatives. And however you were to define ``high crimes and  misdemeanors,'' there is no definition that includes disagreeing with a  policy decision as an acceptable ground for removal of a President of  the United States. None.   The first Article of Impeachment is, therefore, constitutionally  invalid and should be immediately rejected by the Senate.   Now, as to the second Article of Impeachment, President Trump in no  way obstructed Congress. The President acted with extraordinary  transparency by declassifying and releasing the transcript for the July  25 call and the earlier call. It is that July 25 call which is  purportedly at the heart of the Articles of Impeachment. He did so soon  after the inquiry was announced.   And despite the fact that privileges apply that could have been  asserted, he released them anyway in order to facilitate the House's  inquiry and cut through all of it--all of the hearsay, all of the  histrionics--to get the transcript out.   Now, I want to take a moment because my colleague Deputy White House  Counsel Pat Philbin addressed this idea of privilege. I have heard over  and over again--and you have, too--phrases like: coverup; that the  assertion of a privilege is a coverup.   Here is what the Supreme Court of the United States has said about  privileges in a variety of contexts:         To punish a person because he has done what the law allows       him to do is a due process violation of the [basic order]--      the . . . basic sort, and for an agent of the state to pursue       a course of action whose objective is to penalize a person's       reliance on his constitutional rights is patently       unconstitutional.    And how much more so when you are talking about the President of the  United States.   How about this? And this goes to the context of assertions of  privilege and other constitutional privileges. The allegation has been  that if you assert a privilege, you are assumed to be guilty. That has  been the assertion.   Why would you do that? We have explained at great length--and I do  not want to go over that again--the importance of the executive  privilege and what it means to separation of powers and the functioning  of our government, but I will say this: As the Supreme Court has  recognized in other contexts with other privileges, the privilege  serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by  ambiguous circumstances.   In another Supreme Court case, Quinn v. The United States: ``The  privilege, this Court has stated, was generally regarded then, as now,  as a privilege of great value, a protection to the innocent . . . ''  The opinion goes on to say that ``safeguard against heedless, unfounded  or tyrannical prosecutions.''   I traced for you, and I am not going to do it again, how all of this  started all those years ago, 3 years ago--how all of this began. There  is no point to go over that because that evidence is undisputed, and  the FISA Court's most recent orders put that into fair play.   We have talked about the fact that the House violated its own  fundamental rules in a series of unlawful subpoenas. I won't go over  that again. Mr. Philbin laid that out in great detail.   But I do think it is important to note that, when seeking the advice  of the President's closest advisers, despite the well-known, bipartisan  guidance from the Department of Justice regarding immunity, the House  managers act as if it does not exist. They sought testimony on matters  from the executive branch's confidential, internal decision-making  process on matters of foreign relations and national security, and that  is when protections are at their highest level.  [[Page S784]]    Let's not forget that the House barred the attendance of executive  branch counsel at witness proceedings when executive branch members  were being examined.   Notwithstanding these substantial abuses of process, the executive  branch responded to each and every subpoena and identified the specific  deficiencies found in each. You cannot just remove constitutional  violations by saying you didn't comply.   You have heard that one recipient of a subpoena, and this is--in  fact, we have talked about it a number of times, but I think as we wrap  up, I think it is worth saying again.   One subpoena recipient did seek a declaratory judgment as to the  validity of the subpoena that he had received. It was set up to go to  court. A judge was going to make a decision. The House withdrew the  subpoena and mooted the recipient's case before the court could rule.   Now, was that because they didn't like the judge that was selected?  Was it because they didn't like the way the ruling was going to go? Was  it they didn't mean to have that witness in the first place?   Whatever the reason, there is one undisputed fact: As the case was in  court, they mooted it out by removing the subpoena.   The assertion of valid constitutional privileges cannot be an  impeachable offense, and that is what article II is based on, the  obstruction of Congress.   For the sake of the Constitution, for the sake of the Office of the  President, this body must stand as a steady bulwark against this  reckless and dangerous proposition. It doesn't just affect this  President; it affects every man or woman who occupies that high office.   So as we said with the first Article of Impeachment, we believe the  second Article of Impeachment is invalid and should also be rejected.   In passing the first Article of Impeachment, the House attempted to  usurp the President's constitutional power to determine policy,  especially foreign policy.   In passing the second Article of Impeachment, the House attempted to  control the constitutional privileges and immunities of the executive  branch--all of this while simultaneously disrespecting the Framers'  system of checks and balances, which designate the judicial branch as  the arbiter of interbranch disputes.   By approving both articles, the House of Representatives violated our  constitutional order, illegally abused our power of impeachment in  order to obstruct the President's ability to faithfully execute the  duties of his office.   These articles fail on their face as they do not meet the  constitutional standard for impeachable offenses. No amount of  testimony could change that fact.   We have already discussed some of the specifics. I think Alexander  Hamilton has been quoted a lot, and there is a reason. What has  occurred over the past 2 weeks--really, the past 3 months--is exactly  what Alexander Hamilton and other Founders of our great country feared.   I believe that Hamilton was prophetic in Federalist 65 when he warned  how impeachment had the ability to ``agitate''--his words--``the  passions of the whole community, and . . . divide it into parties more  or less friendly or inimical to the accused.   He warned that impeachment would ``connect itself with the pre- existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities,  influence, and interest on one side or on the other.''   He continued:         The convention, it appears, thought the Senate--    This body--       [the] most fit depositary of this important trust. Those who       can best discern the intrinsic difficulty of the thing, will       be least hasty in condemning that opinion, and will be most       inclined to allow due weight to the arguments which may be       supposed to have produced it.    In the same Federalist 65, Hamilton regarded the Members of this  Senate not only as the inquisitors for the Nation but as the  representatives of the Nation as a whole.   He said these words:         Where else than in the Senate could have been found a       tribunal sufficiently dignified or significantly independent?       What other body would be likely to feel confident enough in       its own situation to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the       necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the       representatives of the people, his accusers.    You took an oath. They questioned the oath. You are sitting here as  the trier of fact. They said the Senate is on trial.   Based on all of the presentations that we made in our trial brief, in  the arguments that we have put forward today, again, we believe both  articles should be immediately rejected.   Now, our Nation's representatives holding office in this great body  must unite today to protect our Constitution and the separation of  powers. And, you know, there was a time, not that long ago, even within  this administration, where bipartisan agreements could be reached to  serve the interests of the American people.   Take a listen to this.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Senator MARKEY. Today we had a beautiful, bipartisan moment       where Democrats and Republicans, working together, to keep       that fentanyl out of our country, to use these devices to       accomplish that goal. It is not perfect. We need to do a lot       more, but today was a very good start, and I want to praise       all of the people--Democrats and Republicans and the       President--for working together on this bill.        Senator SHAHEEN. As has been said, and we can see by the       people assembled here, if we work together in a bipartisan       way, we can get things done. This is a place where we can all       agree that we've got to do more and where we can work       together. So I applaud everyone's efforts.        President TRUMP. We are proudly joined today by so many       Members of Congress--Republicans, Democrats--who worked very,       very hard on this bill. This was really an effort of       everybody. It was a bipartisan success--something you don't       hear too much about, but I think you will be. I actually       believe we may be--will be over the coming period of time. I       hope so. I think so. It is so good for the country.        President TRUMP. Thank you, everybody. This was an       incredible bipartisan support. We passed this in the Senate       87 to 12. That's unheard of. And then in the House we passed       it 358 to 36.        Senator COONS. . . . be here to help celebrate your signing       of this next step in the critical Women's Global and       Prosperity Development Initiative. It dovetails nicely with       the bill--the bipartisan bill you signed into law with the       WEEE Act, which recognizes this as a critical strategy. So I       think this is a tremendous initiative. Thank you, Mr. Trump.        President TRUMP. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. This is what the American people expect.   I simply ask this body to stand firm today to protect the integrity  of the U.S. Senate, stand firm today to protect the Office of the  President, stand firm today to protect the Constitution, stand firm  today to protect the will of the American people and their vote, stand  firm today to protect our Nation.   And I ask that this partisan impeachment come to an end to restore  our constitutional balance, for that is, in my view and in our view,  what justice demands and the Constitution requires.   With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to the White House  Counsel, Mr. Pat Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you,  Members of the Senate.   I will leave you with just a few brief points:   First, I want to express on behalf of our entire team our gratitude-- our gratitude to you, Mr. Chief Justice, for presiding over this trial;  our gratitude to you, Leader McConnell; our gratitude to you,  Democratic Leader Schumer; and all of you on both sides of the aisle  for your time and attention.   I also want to express my gratitude to our team. It is large, and  with the large number of people who have helped in this effort--I won't  name them all--but I want to thank them for their effort and their hard  work in the defense of the Constitution, in defense of the President,  in defense of the American people's right to vote. I want to thank, as  Members of that team, the Republican Members of the House of  Representatives who have also been engaged in that effort throughout  this entire period of time and the Democrats in the House who voted  against this partisan impeachment. I also want to thank the President  of the United States for his confidence in us to send us here to  represent him to all of you in this great body and for all he has done  on behalf of the American people.    I would make just a couple of additional points. No. 1, as we have  said repeatedly, we have never been in a situation like this in our  history. We have  [[Page S785]]  an impeachment that is purely partisan and political. It is opposed by  bipartisan Members of the House. It does not even allege a violation of  law. It is passed in an election year, and we are sitting here on the  day that election season begins in Iowa. It is wrong. There is only one  answer to that, and the answer is to reject those Articles of  Impeachment, to have confidence in the American people, to have  confidence in the result of the upcoming election, to have confidence  and respect for the last election and not throw it out and to leave the  choice of the President to the American people and to leave to them  also the accountability to the Members of the House of Representatives  who did that. That is what the Constitution requires, and I think that  should be done on a bipartisan basis, and that is what I ask you to do.   Point No. 2: I believe the American people are tired of the endless  investigations and false investigations that have been coming out of  the House from the beginning, as my colleague Mr. Sekulow pointed out.  It is a waste of tax dollars. It is a waste of the American people's  time and, I would argue, more importantly--most importantly--the  opportunity cost of that--the opportunity cost of that--what you could  be doing, what the House could be doing. Working with the President to  achieve those things on behalf of the American people is far more  important than the endless investigations, the endless false attacks,  the besmirching of the names of good people. This is something we  should reject together, and we should move forward in a bipartisan  fashion and in a way that this President has done successfully.   He has achieved successful results in the economy and across so many  other areas, working with you on both sides of the aisle, and he wants  to continue to do that. That is what I believe the American people want  those of you elected to come here to Washington to focus on, to spend  your time on--to unify us, as opposed to the bitter division that is  caused by these types of proceedings.   So at the end of the day, we put our faith in the Senate. We put our  faith in the Senate because we know you will put your faith in the  American people. You will leave this choice to them, where it belongs.  We believe that they should choose the President. We believe that this  President, day after day, has put their interests first, has achieved  successful results, has fulfilled the promises he made to them, and he  is eager to go before the American people in this upcoming election.   At the end of the day, that is the only result; it is a result, I  believe, guided by your wise words from the past that we can, together,  end the era of impeachment; that we can, together, put faith in the  American people, put faith in their wisdom, put faith in their  judgment. That is where our Founders put the power. That is where it  belongs.   I urge you, on behalf of those Americans--of every American--on  behalf of all of your constituents, to reject these Articles of  Impeachment. It is the right thing for our country. The President has  done nothing wrong, and these types of impeachments must end.   You will vindicate the right to vote, you will vindicate the  Constitution, you will vindicate the rule of law by rejecting these  articles. I ask you to do that on a bipartisan basis this week and end  the era of impeachment once and for all.   I thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to us, for your  attention, and for considering our case on behalf of the President.   I come here today to ask you to reject these Articles of Impeachment.  Reject these Articles of Impeachment.   Thank you for granting us the permission to appear here at the Senate  on behalf of this President, and I ask you on his behalf, on behalf of  the American people to reject these articles.   Thank you.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, it is a problem  that here at the end of the trial the President's lawyers still dispute  the meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors. Some say it requires an  ordinary crime or that if the President misbehaves when he thinks it is  good for the country, it is OK. Neither is correct. We need to clear  this up by looking at what the Founders said.   When the Founders created the Presidency, they gave the President  great power. They had just been through a war to get rid of a King with  too much power, and they needed a check on the great power given to the  President. It was late in the Constitutional Convention that they  turned to the impeachment clause. Madison argued in favor of  impeachment. He said it was indispensable.   Mason asked:         Shall any man be above Justice? Above all shall that man be       above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?   Randolph defended ``the propriety of impeachments,'' saying: ``The  Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.''   The initial draft of the Constitution provided for impeachment only  for treason or bribery. Mason asked:         Why is the provision restrained to Treason & bribery only?       Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many       great and dangerous offences.    And he added:         Hastings is not guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the       Constitution may not be Treason as . . . defined.    Now Hastings' impeachment in Britain at this time was well known, and  it wasn't limited to a crime.   They considered adding the word ``maladministration'' to capture  abuse of Presidential power, but Madison objected. He said: ``So a  vague a term would be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the  Senate.'' So maladministration was withdrawn and replaced with the more  certain term ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' because the Founders knew  the law.   Blackstone's Commentary, which Madison said was ``a book in every  man's hand,'' described high crimes and misdemeanors as offenses  against King and government.   Hamilton called high crimes and misdemeanors ``those offenses which  proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the  abuse or violation of some public trust.''   During ratification, Randolph in Virginia cited the President's  receipt of presents or emoluments from a foreign power as an example.  And Mason's example was a President who may ``pardon crimes which were  advised by himself,'' or before indictment or conviction to ``stop  inquiry and prevent detection.'' It is clear. They knew what they  wrote.   The President's lawyers tried to create a muddle to confuse you.  Don't let them. High crimes and misdemeanors mean abuse of power  against the constitutional order, conduct that is corrupt, whether or  not a crime.   Now some say: No impeachment when there is an election coming. But  without term limits when they wrote the Constitution, there was always  an election coming. If impeachment in election years was not to be, our  Founders would have said so.   So here we are: Congress passed a law to fund Ukraine to fight the  Russians who invaded their country. President Trump illegally held that  funding up to coerce Ukraine to announce an investigation to hurt his  strongest election opponent. He abused his power corruptly to benefit  himself personally, and then he tried to cover it up. That is  impeachable.   The facts are clear, and so is the Constitution. The only question is  what you, the Senate, will do.   Our Founders created a government where the tension between the three  branches would prevent authoritarianism; no one of the branches would  be allowed to grab all the power. Impeachment was to make sure that the  President, who has the greatest opportunity to grab power, would be  held in check. It is a blunt instrument, but it is what our Founders  gave us.   Some of the Founders thought the mere existence of an impeachment  clause would prevent misconduct by Presidents, but, sadly, they were  wrong because twice in the last half century a President tried to  corruptly use his power to cheat in an election--first, Nixon with  Watergate, and now another President corruptly abuses his power to  cheat in an election.   The Founders worried about factions--what we call political parties.  They built a system where each branch of government would jealously  guard their power, not one where guarding a faction was more important  than guarding the government.  [[Page S786]]    Opposing a President of your own party isn't easy. It wasn't easy  when Republican Caldwell Butler voted to impeach Nixon in the Judiciary  Committee. It wasn't easy for Senator Barry Goldwater to tell Nixon to  resign. But your oath is not to do the easy thing; it is to do  impartial justice. It requires conviction and removal of President  Trump.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the  President, Senators, since I was a little girl and started going to  church, I have been inspired by the words of scripture: ``[W]hatever  you did for one of the least of my brothers . . . you did for me.''   We are called to always look out for the most vulnerable. Sometimes  fighting for the most vulnerable means holding the most powerful  accountable, and that is what we are here to do today.   The American people will have to live with the decisions made in this  Chamber. In fact, Senators, I believe that the decision in this case  will affect the strength of democracies around the world.   Democracy is a gift that each generation gives to the next one. If we  say that this President can put his own interests above all else, even  when lives are at stake, then we give our Nation's children a weaker  democracy than we inherited from those that came before us. The next  generation deserves better. They are counting on us.   I am a Catholic, and my faith teaches me that we all need  forgiveness. I have given this President the benefit of the doubt from  the beginning. Despite my strong opposition to so many of his policies,  I know that the success of our Nation depends on the success of our  leader. But he has let us down.   Senators, we know what the President did and why he did it. This fact  is seriously not in doubt. Senators on both sides of the aisle have  said as much. The question for you now is, does it warrant removal from  office? We say yes.   We cannot simply hope that this President will realize that he has  done wrong or was inappropriate and hope that he does better. We have  done that so many other times. We know that he has not apologized. He  has not offered to change. We all know that he will do it again.   What President Trump did this time pierces the heart of who we are as  a country. We must stop him from further harming our democracy. We must  stop him from further betraying his oath. We must stop him from tearing  up our Constitution.   The Founders knew that in order for our Republic to survive, we would  need to be able to remove some of our leaders from office when they put  their interests above the country's interests. Senators, we have proven  that. This President committed what is called the ABC's of impeachable  behavior--abusing his power, betraying the Nation, and corrupting our  elections. He deserves to be removed for taking the very actions that  the Framers feared would undermine our country. The Framers designed  impeachment for this very case.    Senators, when I was growing up poor in South Texas, picking cotton,  I confess I didn't spend any time thinking about the Framers. Like me,  little girls and boys across America aren't asking at home what the  Framers meant by high crimes and misdemeanors, but, someday, they will  ask why we didn't do anything to stop this President, who put his own  interest above what was good for all of us. They will ask. They will  want to understand.   Senators, we inherited a democracy. Now we must protect it and pass  it on to the next generation. We simply can't give our children a  democracy if a President is above the law, because in this country no  one is above the law--not me, not any of you, not even this President.   (English translation of statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   Nobody is above the law--nobody.   This President must be removed. With that, I yield to my colleague  Mr. Crow.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, 2 weeks  ago we started this trial promising to show you that the President  withheld $391 million of foreign military aid to force an ally at war  to help him win the 2020 election. And by many of your own admissions,  we succeeded in showing you that, because the facts still matter.   We also promised you that, eventually, all of the facts would come  out, and that continues to be true. But we didn't just show you that  the President abused his power and obstructed Congress. We painted a  broader picture of President Trump--a picture of a man who thinks that  the Constitution doesn't serve as a check on his power, but, rather,  gives it to him in an unlimited way; a man who believes that his  personal ambitions are synonymous with the good of the country; a man  who, in his own words, thinks that if you are a star, they will let you  do anything. In short, it is a picture of a man who will always put his  own personal interests above the interests of the country that he has  sworn to protect.   But what is in an oath, anyway? Are they relics of the past? Do we  simply recite them out of custom? To me, an oath represents a firm  commitment to a life of service, a commitment to set aside your  personal interest, your comfort, and your ambition to serve the greater  good, and a commitment to sacrifice.   I explained to you last week that I believe America is great not  because of the ambition of any one man, not simply because we say it is  true but because of our almost 250-year history. Millions of Americans  have taken the oath, and they meant it. Many of them followed through  on that oath by giving everything to keep it.   But there is more to it than simply keeping your word, because an  oath is also a bond between people who have made a common promise.  Perhaps the strongest example is the promise between the Commander in  Chief and our men and women in uniform. Those men and women took their  oath with the understanding that the Commander in Chief, our President,  will always put the interests of the country and their interests above  his own, and understanding that his orders will be in the best interest  of the country, and that their sacrifice in fulfilling those orders  will always serve the common good.   But what we have clearly shown in the last few weeks and what  President Trump has shown us the past few years is that this promise  flows only one way. As Maya Angelou said, ``When someone shows you who  they are, believe them the first time.''   Many of us in this room are parents. We all try to teach our kids the  important lessons of life. One of those lessons is that you won't  always be the strongest, you won't always be the fastest, and you won't  always win. There are a lot of things outside our control, but my wife  and I have tried to teach our kids that what we can always control are  our choices.   It is in that spirit that hanging in my son's room is a quote from  Harry Potter. The quote is from Professor Dumbledore, who said: ``It is  our choices . . . that show what we truly are, far more than our  abilities.''   This trial will soon be over, but there will be many choices for all  of us in the days ahead, the most pressing of which is how each of us  will decide to fulfill our oath. More than our words, our choices will  show the world who we really are, what type of leaders we will be, and  what type of Nation we will be.   So let me finish where I began, with an explanation of why I am here  standing before you. I have been carrying my kids' Constitutions these  last few weeks, and this morning I wrote a note to them to explain why  I am here:         Our Founders recognized the failings of all people. So they       designed a system to ensure that the ideas and principles       contained in this document would always be greater than any       one person. It is the idea that no one is above the law. But       our system only works if people stand up and fight for it,       and fighting for something important always comes with a       cost.        Some day you may be called upon to defend the principles       and ideas embodied in our Constitution. May the memory and       spirit of those who sacrificed for them in the past guide you       and give you strength as you fight for them in the future.    Thank you for your time.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, and counsel for  the President, this is a defining moment in our history and a  challenging time for our Nation. A thousand things have gone through my  mind since this body voted to not call witnesses in this trial. The  vote was unprecedented. The  [[Page S787]]  President's former National Security Advisor indicated that he was  willing to testify under oath before the Senate. Yet this body did not  want to hear what he had to say.   The President's lawyers have asked you to not believe your lying eyes  and ears, to reinterpret the Constitution, and to believe that if the  President thinks his reelection is in our national interest, then he  can do whatever he wants--anything--to make it happen. And that is  exactly what he was attempting to do--anything--when he illegally held  much needed military aid while pressuring Ukraine's President to  announce bogus investigations into his most feared political rival.   This trial is about abuse of power, obstruction, breaking the law,  and our system of checks and balances, and since we are talking about  the President of the United States, this trial is also most certainly  about character.   I am reminded today, Senators, of my own father. He worked more than  one job. He didn't have a famous last name. His name appeared on no  building, but my father was rich in something no money and, apparently,  no powerful position can buy. You see, my father was a man who was  decent, honest, a man of integrity, and he was a man of good, moral  character. The President's lawyer never spoke about the President's  character during this trial, and I find that quite telling.   I joined the police department because I wanted to make a difference,  and I believe I did. As a police chief, I was always concerned about  the message we were sending inside the agency, especially to young  recruits, especially to newly hired dedicated police officers. We had  to be careful about just how we were defining what was acceptable and  unacceptable behavior inside the department and out in the community.  Yes, people make mistakes. Yes, individuals make mistakes. But we had  to be clear about the culture inside the organization, and we had to  send a strong message that the police department was not a place where  corruption could reside, where corruption was normalized, and where  corruption was covered up.   Today, unfortunately, I believe we are holding young police recruits  to a higher standard than we are the leader of the free world. If this  body fails to hold this President accountable, you must ask yourselves:  What kind of Republic will we ultimately have with a President who  thinks that he can really truly do whatever he wants? You will send a  terrible message to the Nation that one can get away with abuse of  power, obstruction, cheating, and spreading false narratives if you  simply know the right people.   Well, today, Senators, I reject that because we are a nation of laws.  Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States said this:  ``America will never be destroyed from outside. If we falter and lose  our freedoms, it will be because we chose to destroy ourselves.''   I urge you, Senators, to vote to convict and remove this President.  Thank you so much for your time.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, President's counsel, I mentioned on the floor last week that  Alexander Hamilton has played a starring role during this impeachment  trial. But Ben Franklin has only made a cameo appearance, but that  cameo appearance was an important one, when he made the observation, in  the aftermath of that convention in 1787, that the Framers of the  Constitution had created ``a Republic, if you can keep it.''   Why would Dr. Franklin express ambiguity about the future of America  during such a triumphant moment? Perhaps it was because the system of  government that was created at that convention--checks and balances,  separate and coequal branches of government, the independent judiciary,  the free and fair press, the preeminence of the rule of law--all of  those values, all of those ideas, all of those institutions have never  before been put together in one form of government. So perhaps it was  uncertain as to whether America could sustain them.   But part of the brilliance of our great country is that year after  year, decade after decade, century after century, we have held this  democracy thing together. But now all of those ideas, all of those  values, all of those institutions are under assault, not from without  but from within. We created ``a Republic, if you can keep it.''   House managers have proven our case against President Trump with a  mountain of evidence. President Trump tried to cheat, he got caught,  and then he worked hard to cover it up.   President Trump corruptly abused his power. President Trump  obstructed a congressionally and constitutionally required impeachment  inquiry with blanket defiance. President Trump solicited foreign  interference in an American election and shredded the very fabric of  our democracy. House managers have proven our case against President  Trump with a mountain of evidence.   If the Senate chooses to acquit under these circumstances, then  America is in the wilderness.   If the Senate chooses to normalize lawlessness, if the Senate chooses  to normalize corruption, if the Senate chooses to normalize  Presidential abuse of power, then America is in the wilderness.   If the Senate chooses to acquit President Trump without issuing a  single subpoena, without interviewing a single witness, without  reviewing a single new document, then America is truly in the  wilderness.   But all is not lost. Even at this late hour, the Senate can still do  the right thing. America is watching. The world is watching. The eyes  of history are watching. The Senate can still do the right thing.   Scripture says--Second Corinthians, the fifth chapter and the seventh  verse, encourages us to walk by faith, not by sight. Faith is the  substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. We have  come this far by faith.   And so I say to all of you, my fellow Americans, walk by faith.  Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, the left and  the right, all points in between, walk by faith. There are patriots all  throughout the Chamber, patriots who can be found all throughout the  land--in urban America, rural America, suburban America, smalltown  America. Walk by faith. Through the ups and the downs, the highs and  the lows, the peaks and the valleys, the trials and the tribulations of  this turbulent moment, walk by faith--faith in the Constitution; faith  in our democracy; faith in the rule of law; faith in government of the  people, by the people, and for the people; faith in almighty God. Walk  by faith.   The Senate can still do the right thing. And if we come together as  Americans, then together we can eradicate the cancer that threatens our  democracy and continue our long, necessary, and majestic march toward a  more perfect union.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to begin by thanking  you for the distinguished way you have presided over these proceedings.   Senators, we are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies. If  Lincoln could speak these words during the Civil War, surely we can  live them now and overcome our divisions and our animosities.   It is midnight in Washington. The lights are finally going out in the  Capitol after a long day in the impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump.  The Senate heard arguments only hours earlier on whether to call  witnesses and require the administration to release documents it has  withheld. Counsel for the President still maintains the President's  innocence, while opposing any additional evidence that would prove  otherwise.   It is midnight in Washington, but on this night, not all the lights  have been extinguished. Somewhere in the bowels of the Justice  Department--Donald Trump's Justice Department--a light remains on.  Someone has waited until the country is asleep to hit ``Send,'' to  inform the court in a filing due that day that the Justice Department-- the Department that would represent justice--is refusing to produce  documents directly bearing on the President's decision to withhold  military aid from Ukraine. The Trump administration has them, it is not  turning them over, and it does not want the Senate to know until it is  too late. Send.   That is what happened last Friday night. When you left home for the  weekend, in a replay of the duplicity we saw during the trial when the  President's lawyers argued here that the House must go to court and  argued in court that the House must come here,  [[Page S788]]  they were at it again, telling the court in a midnight filing that they  would not turn over relevant documents even as they argued here that  they were not covering up the President's misdeeds.   Midnight in Washington. All too tragic. A metaphor for where the  country finds itself at the conclusion of only the third impeachment in  history and the first impeachment trial without witnesses or documents,  the first such trial--or nontrial--in impeachment history.   How did we get here? In the beginning of this proceeding, you did not  know whether we could prove our case. Many Senators, like many  Americans, did not have the opportunity to watch much, let alone all,  of the opening hearings in the House during our investigation, and none  of us could anticipate what defenses the President might offer.   Now you have seen what we promised: overwhelming evidence of the  President's guilt. Donald John Trump withheld hundreds of millions of  dollars from an ally at war and a coveted White House meeting with  their President to coerce or extort that nation's help to cheat in our  elections. And when he was found out, he engaged in the most  comprehensive effort to cover up his misconduct in the history of  Presidential impeachment: fighting all subpoenas for documents and  witnesses and using his own obstruction as a sword and a shield;  arguing here that the House did not fight hard enough to overcome their  noninvocation of privilege in court, and in court that the House must  not be heard to enforce their subpoenas but that impeachment is a  proper remedy.   Having failed to persuade the Senate or the public that there was no  quid pro quo, having offered no evidence to contradict the record, the  President's team opted, in a kind of desperation, for a different kind  of defense: first, prevent the Senate and the public from hearing from  witnesses with the most damning accounts of the President's misconduct,  and second, fall back on a theory of Presidential power so broad and  unaccountable that it would allow any occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania to  be as corrupt as he chooses, while the Congress is powerless to do  anything about it. That defense collapsed of its own dead weight.    Presidents may abuse their power with impunity, they argued. Abuse of  power is not a constitutional crime, they claimed. Only statutory crime  is a constitutional crime, even though there were no statutory crimes  when the Constitution was adopted. The President had to look far and  wide to find a defense lawyer to make such an argument, unsupported by  history, the Founders, or common sense. The Republican expert witness  in the House would not make it. Serious constitutional scholars would  not make it. Even Alan Dershowitz would not make it--at least he  wouldn't in 1998. But this has become the President's defense. Yet this  defense proved indefensible.   If abuse of power is not impeachable--even though it is clear the  Founders considered it the highest of all high crimes and  misdemeanors--but if it is not impeachable, then a whole range of  utterly unacceptable conduct of the President's would now be beyond  reach. Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians in exchange for support  in the next election or decide to move to Mar-a-Lago permanently and  let Jared Kushner run the country, delegating to him the decision  whether to go to war. Because those things are not necessarily  criminal, this argument would allow that he could not be impeached for  such abuses of power.   Of course, this would be absurd--more than absurd, it would be  dangerous. So Mr. Dershowitz tried to embellish his legal creation and  distinguish among those abuses of power which would be impeachable from  those which wouldn't. Abuses of power that would help the President get  elected were permissible and therefore unimpeachable, and only those  for pecuniary gain were beyond the pale. Under this theory, as long as  the President believed his reelection was in the public interest, he  could do anything, and no quid pro quo was too corrupt, no damage to  our national security too great. This was such an extreme view that  even the President's other lawyers had to run away from it.   So what are we left with? The House has proven the President's guilt.  He tried to coerce an ally into helping him cheat by smearing his  opponent. He betrayed our national security in order to do it when he  withheld military aid to our ally and violated the law to do so. He  covered it up, and he covers it up still. His continuing obstruction is  a threat to the oversight and investigatory powers of the House and  Senate and, if left unaddressed, would permanently and dangerously  alter the balance of power.   These undeniable facts require the President to retreat to his final  defense. He is guilty as sin, but can't we just let the voters decide?  He is guilty as sin, but why not let the voters clean up this mess? And  here, to answer that question, we must look at the history of this  Presidency and to the character of this President--or lack of  character--and ask, can we be confident that he will not continue to  try to cheat in that very election? Can we be confident that Americans  and not foreign powers will get to decide and that the President will  shun any further foreign interference in our democratic affairs? And  the short, plain, sad, incontestable answer is, no, you can't. You  can't trust this President to do the right thing, not for one minute,  not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can't.  He will not change, and you know it.   In 2016, he invited foreign interference in our election. Hey,  Russia, if you are listening, hack Hillary's emails, he said, and they  did, immediately. And when the Russians starting dumping them before  the election, he made use of them in every conceivable way, touting the  filthy lucre at campaign stops more than 100 times.   When he was investigated, he did everything he could to obstruct  justice, going so far as to fire the FBI Director and try to fire the  special counsel and ask the White House Counsel to lie on his behalf.   During the same campaign, while telling the country he had no  business dealings with Russia, he was continuing to actively pursue the  most lucrative deal of his life--a Trump Tower in the heart of Moscow.  Six close associates of the President's would be indicted or go to jail  in connection with the President's campaign, Russia, and the effort to  cover it up.   On the day after that tragic chapter appeared to come to an end with  Bob Mueller's testimony, Donald Trump was back on the phone, this time  with another foreign power--Ukraine--and once again seeking foreign  help with his election, only this time, he had the full powers of the  Presidency at his disposal. This time, he could use coercion. This  time, he could withhold aid from a nation whose soldiers were dying  every week. This time, he believed he could do whatever he wanted under  article II. And this time, when he was caught, he could make sure that  the Justice Department would never investigate the matter, and they  didn't.   Donald Trump had no more Jeff Sessions; he had just the man he wanted  in Bill Barr, a man whose view of the imperial Presidency--a Presidency  in which the Department of Justice is little more than an extension of  the White House Counsel--is to do the President's bidding. So Congress  had to do the investigation itself, and just as before, he obstructed  that investigation in every way.   He has not changed. He will not change. He has made that clear  himself without self-awareness or hesitation. A man without character  or ethical compass will never find his way.   Even as the most recent and most egregious misconduct was discovered,  he was unapologetic, unrepentant, and more dangerous, undeterred. He  continued pressing Ukraine to smear his rivals even as the  investigation was underway.   He invited new countries to get involved in the act, calling on China  to do the same. His personal emissary, Rudy Giuliani, dispatched  himself to Ukraine, trying to get further foreign interference in our  election. The plot goes on; the scheming persists; and the danger will  never recede. He has done it before. He will do it again. What are the  odds, if left in office, that he will continue trying to cheat? I will  tell you: 100 percent. Not 5, not 10 or even 50, but 100 percent.   If you have found him guilty and you do not remove him from office,  he will continue trying to cheat in the election until he succeeds.  Then what shall  [[Page S789]]  you say? What shall you say if Russia again interferes in our election  and Donald Trump does nothing but celebrates their efforts? What shall  you say if Ukraine capitulates and announces investigations into the  President's rivals?   What shall you say in the future, when candidates compete for the  allegiance of foreign powers in their elections, when they draft their  platforms so to encourage foreign intervention in their campaign?  Foreign nations, as the most super of super-PACs of them all, if not  legal, somehow permissible because Donald Trump has made it so and we  refused to do anything about it but wring our hands.   They will hack your opponents' emails; they will mount a social media  campaign to support you; they will announce investigations of your  opponent to help you--and all for the asking. Leave Donald Trump in  office after you have found him guilty, and this is the future that you  will invite.   Now, we have known since the day we brought these charges that the  bar to conviction, requiring fully two-thirds of the Senate, may be  prohibitively high. And yet, the alternative is a runaway Presidency  and a nation whose elections are open to the highest bidder.   So you might ask how--given the gravity of the President's  misconduct, given the abundance of evidence of his guilt, given the  acknowledgement by Senators in both parties of that guilt--how have we  arrived here with so little common ground? Why was the Nixon  impeachment bipartisan? Why was the Clinton impeachment much less so?  And why is the gulf between the parties even greater today?   It is not for the reason that the President's lawyers would have you  believe. Although they have claimed many times, in many ways, that the  process in the House was flawed because we did not allow the President  to control it, it was, in reality, little different than the process in  prior impeachments. The circumstances, of course, were different. The  Watergate investigation began in the Senate and had progressed before  it got moving in the House. And there, of course, much of the  investigative work had been done by the special prosecutor, Leon  Jaworski. In Clinton, there was likewise an independent counsel who  conducted a multiyear investigation that started with a real estate  deal in Arkansas and ended with a blue dress.   Nixon and Clinton, of course, played no role in those investigations  before they moved to the House Judiciary Committee. But to the degree  you can compare the process when it got to the Judiciary Committee in  either prior and recent impeachments, it was largely the same as we  have here. The President had the right to call witnesses, to ask  questions, and chose not to.   The House majorities in Nixon and Clinton did not cede their subpoena  power to their minorities, and neither did we here, although then, as  now, we gave the minority the right to request subpoenas and to compel  a vote, and they did.   So the due process the House provided here was essentially the same  and, in some ways, even greater. Nevertheless, the President's counsel  hopes that, through sheer repetition, they can convert nontruth into  truth. Do not let them.   Every single court to hear Mr. Philbin's arguments has rejected them:   The subpoenas are invalid--rejected by the McGahn court.   They have absolute immunity--rejected by the McGahn court.   Privilege may conceal crime or fraud--rejected by the court in Nixon.   But if the process here was substantially the same, the facts of the  President's misconduct were very different from one impeachment to the  next. The Republican Party of Nixon's time broke into the DNC, and the  President covered it up. Nixon, too, abused the power of his office to  gain an unfair advantage over his opponent, but in Watergate he never  sought to coerce a foreign power to aid his reelection, nor did he  sacrifice our national security in such a palpable and destructive way  as withholding aid from an ally at war. And he certainly did not engage  in the wholesale obstruction of Congress or justice that we have seen  this President commit.   The facts of President Clinton's misconduct pale in comparison to  Nixon and do not hold a candle to Donald Trump. Lying about an affair  is morally wrong, and when under oath it is a crime, but it had nothing  to do with his duties in office.   The process being the same, the facts of President Trump's misconduct  being far more destructive than either past President, what then  accounts for the disparate result in bipartisan support for his  removal? What has changed?   The short answer is, we have changed. The Members of Congress have  changed. For reasons as varied as the stars, the Members of this body  and ours in the House are now far more accepting of the most serious  misconduct of a President as long as it is a President of one's own  party. And that is a trend most dangerous for our country.   Fifty years ago, no lawyer representing the President would have ever  made the outlandish argument that if the President believes his  corruption will serve to get him reelected, whether it is by coercing  an ally to help him cheat or in any other form, that he may not be  impeached, that this is somehow a permissible use of his power.   But here we are. The argument has been made, and some appear ready to  accept it. And that is dangerous, for there is no limiting principle to  that position.   It must have come as a shock--a pleasant shock--to this President  that our norms and institutions would prove to be so weak. The  independence of the Justice Department and its formerly proud Office of  Legal Counsel now are mere legal tools at the President's disposal to  investigate enemies or churn out helpful opinions not worth the paper  they are written on. The FBI painted by a President as corrupt and  disloyal. The intelligence community not to be trusted against the good  counsel of Vladimir Putin. The press portrayed as enemies of the  people. The daily attacks on the guardrails of our democracy, so  relentlessly assailed, have made us numb and blind to the consequences.   Does none of that matter anymore if he is the President of our party?   I hope and pray that we never have a President like Donald Trump in  the Democratic Party, one who would betray the national interest and  the country's security to help with his reelection. And I would hope to  God that, if we did, we would impeach him, and Democrats would lead the  way.   But I suppose you never know just how difficult that is until you are  confronted with it. But you, my friends, are confronted with it. You  are confronted with that difficulty now, and you must not shrink from  it.   History will not be kind to Donald Trump--I think we all know that-- not because it will be written by Never Trumpers but because whenever  we have departed from the values of our Nation, we have come to regret  it, and that regret is written all over the pages of our history.   If you find that the House has proved its case and still vote to  acquit, your name will be tied to his with a chord of steel and for all  of history; but if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak  the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the  Davids who took on Goliath. If only you will say ``enough.''   We revere the wisdom of our Founders and the insights they had into  self-governance. We scour their words for hidden meaning and try to  place ourselves in their shoes. But we have one advantage that the  Founders did not. For all their genius, they could not see but opaquely  into the future. We, on the other hand, have the advantage of time, of  seeing how their great experiment in self-governance has progressed.   When we look at the sweep of history, there are times when our Nation  and the rest of the world have moved with a seemingly irresistible  force in the direction of greater freedom: more freedom to speak and to  assemble, to practice our faith and tolerate the faith of others, to  love whom we would and choose love over hate--more free societies,  walls tumbling down, nations reborn.   But then, like a pendulum approaching the end of its arc, the outward  movement begins to arrest. The golden globe of freedom reaches its  zenith and starts to retreat. The pendulum swings back past the center  and recedes into a dark unknown. How much farther will  [[Page S790]]  it travel in its illiberal direction, how many more freedoms will be  extinguished before it turns back we cannot say. But what we do here,  in this moment, will affect its course and its correction.   Every single vote, even a single vote by a single Member, can change  the course of history. It is said that a single man or a woman of  courage makes a majority. Is there one among you who will say  ``enough''?   America believes in a thing called truth. She does not believe we are  entitled to our own alternate facts. She recoils at those who spread  pernicious falsehoods. To her, truth matters. There is nothing more  corrosive to a democracy than the idea that there is no truth.   America also believes there is a difference between right and wrong,  and right matters here. But there is more. Truth matters. Right  matters. But so does decency. Decency matters.   When the President smears a patriotic public servant like Marie  Yovanovitch in pursuit of a corrupt aim, we recoil. When the President  mocks the disabled, a war hero who was a prisoner of war, or a Gold  Star father, we are appalled because decency matters here. And when the  President tries to coerce an ally to help him cheat in our elections  and then covers it up, we must say ``enough.'' Enough.   He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again. He  has compromised our elections, and he will do so again. You will not  change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters  little to him. What is right matters even less. And decency matters not  at all.   I do not ask you to convict him because truth or right or decency  matters nothing to him but because we have proven our case and it  matters to you. Truth matters to you. Right matters to you. You are  decent. He is not who you are.   In Federalist 55, James Madison wrote that there were certain  qualities in human nature--qualities I believe, like honesty, right,  and decency--which should justify our confidence in self-government. He  believed that we possessed sufficient virtue that the chains of  despotism were not necessary to restrain ourselves ``from destroying  and devouring one another.''   It may be midnight in Washington, but the sun will rise again. I put  my faith in the optimism of the Founders. You should too. They gave us  the tools to do the job, a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant  to constrain: impeachment. They meant it to be used rarely, but they  put it in the Constitution for a reason--for a man who would sell out  his country for a political favor, for a man who would threaten the  integrity of our elections, for a man who would invite foreign  interference in our affairs, for a man who would undermine our national  security and that of our allies--for a man like Donald J. Trump.   They gave you a remedy, and they meant for you to use it. They gave  you an oath, and they meant for you to observe it. We have proven  Donald Trump guilty. Now do impartial justice and convict him.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                   Adjournment of the Court of Impeachment
