 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  one of my district's most innovative businesses, KCF Technologies.   KCF Technologies is an employee-owned technology company located in  State College, Pennsylvania. Their passion is using technology to make  the things we live and work with smarter.   Part of KCF's work focuses on improving the lives of our wounded  warriors through self-powered prosthetic devices. These self-powered  prosthetic limbs capture energy when the individual is walking and uses  that energy to recharge the prosthesis.   KCF Technologies has created many of these innovative devices thanks  to research funded by the U.S. Army Telemedicine & Advanced Technology  Research Center and the National Science Foundation.   Today, KCF Technologies is at Walter Reed National Military Medical  Center to demonstrate its newest prosthetic technology. These  electromechanical devices make life better for not just our wounded  servicemembers, but for amputees of every age and in every walk of  life.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this company, and I look forward to the  new innovations KCF Technologies will produce in the future.  [[Page H5820]]                                ____________________
