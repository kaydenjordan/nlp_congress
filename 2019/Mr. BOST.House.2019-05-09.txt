 Mr. Speaker, last weekend Southern Illinois University and  the larger Carbondale community lost two icons, Harvey Welch and  Seymour Bryson.   Harry Welch, a native of Centralia, was the first Black athlete to  earn a basketball letter at SIU, playing from 1951 to 1954. He was also  the first Black student to complete the ROTC program at the university.  Harvey went on to a 20-year career in the Air Force, and he was the  first of three Black officers to be promoted to colonel.   After retiring from the Air Force, Harvey came back to Carbondale and  SIU in 1975. He served as the first Black dean of student life at SIU  and then as vice chancellor from 1987 to 2000.   Seymour Bryson of Quincy, a fellow basketball standout, received  three degrees from SIU. He was one of three African Americans to  progress from assistant professor to full professor at SIU. He was also  the first African American associate dean of the college and the second  of three African American deans. Seymour was active in the Carbondale  NAACP, Jackson County Mental Health Board, and Carbondale United Way.   Harvey Welch and Seymour Bryson are members of the SIU Saluki Hall of  Fame. They will be dearly missed.                          Recognizing Kody Vanfossan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only as a Member of Congress,  but also as a former firefighter to recognize Kody Vanfossan of  Christopher, Illinois. Kody, a 24-year-old firefighter, passed away in  the line of duty early Sunday morning.   Kody grew up around the fire station and comes from a family with  deep traditions of public service. His dad, Brent, is a captain on the  Christopher force. His grandfather is Christopher's mayor but was also  a firefighter at the Valier Fire Department.   Kody's family instilled in him a passion for helping others, despite  the risk. Now his community will remember him as a hero.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kody for his service, and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
