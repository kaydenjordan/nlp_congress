 Mr. Speaker, today I rise because our family will  welcome its first grandchild in the coming months. This is her 17-week  ultrasound, and I cannot wait to meet her. This child is already known  by her mother, Julia, quoting Psalm 139: ``For You created my inmost  being; You knit me together in my mother's womb.''    Mr. Speaker, this child is a gift from God, a gift that we have far  too often abandoned in this country.   Today, we know so much more. We know that, after 3 weeks, my  granddaughter had a heartbeat. After 7 weeks, she began kicking her  mother, like any good Wagner child would. By week 12, she could suck  her thumb, and at week 20, my granddaughter knew the sound of her  mother's voice and could feel pain.   Mr. Speaker, I stand for life, from conception to natural death. I  stand for H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. And on  behalf of my granddaughter, I will continue to fight for the day when  abortion is not only illegal, but it is unthinkable.
