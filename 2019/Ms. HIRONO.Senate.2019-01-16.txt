 Mr. President, S. Res. 19 is unnecessary because no  religious test is being applied to nominees for Federal office. If my  colleague, the junior Senator from Nebraska, wants to embrace the alt- right's position by offering this resolution, that is his business.   Rather than passing a resolution to address a problem that doesn't  exist, we should focus on something real, like ending this totally  unnecessary, unjustified shutdown that is harming millions of  Americans.   I ask unanimous consent for, statements supporting the separation of  church and state from Catholics for Choice, People for the American  Way, and several Hawaii residents.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           Catholics for Choice,                                    Washington, DC, January 4, 2019.      Hon. Mazie Hirono,      U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Hirono: Catholics for Choice represents the       majority of Catholics across the United States that believes       that each woman should be free to follow her conscience in       moral matters regarding reproductive health.        We were very disappointed to see your colleagues, Senators       Hirono and Harris, attacked for duly questioning district       court nominee Brian Buescher about his ability to keep       judicial impartiality due to his membership in the hardline       Catholic organization, Knights of Columbus. They had every       reason to raise these questions due to the Knights' troubling       record.        Today's Knights of Columbus have strayed far from their       civic roots as a philanthropic organization. Our enclosed       report, The Knights of Columbus: Crusaders for       Discrimination, provides a detailed look at how they have       brazenly used their 501c8 status to pour money, effort and       influence into political contests and policy debates.        As our investigation showed, they have spent more than $10       million since 2014 in direct antichoice and anti-LGBT       lobbying, like their petition in Albuquerque to try to ban       later abortion. The Knights' organization uses a large       portion of its time and effort funding ultrasound equipment       for fake health centers that actively deceive and pressure       women to keep unwanted pregnancies. The insurance arm of the       Knights ranks in the top one percent of the North American       insurance market, yet pays no federal and nearly no state or       local taxes. Make no mistake: they do not represent what the       majority of Catholics believe on issues of reproductive       health or the separation of church and state.        We believe this and other attacks on Senators fulfilling       their obligations to question judicial nominees are just the       latest tactic in shifting the conversation about religious       liberty toward making special accommodations to those who       wish to refuse, impede and impose rather than to protect the       true religious liberty of all, no matter their beliefs. As       Religious Freedom Day nears--and we usher in a historic new       Congress that embodies our country's religious plurality--we       must remember that our society allows for free religious       exercise, but also protects against religious influence in       politics.        Catholics for Choice works at the intersection of religious       liberty, reproductive freedom and freedom of conscience for       all. We are at your and your staff's disposal as the       committee continues to protect fundamental freedoms through       its work. Should you have any questions, please contact me at       [emailÂ protected] or 202-986-6093.            Sincerely,                                                    Glenn Northern,      Domestic Program Director.                                   ____                  [From Honolulu Civil Beat, Jan. 14, 2019]                            Letter to the Editor                (By Lisa H. Gibson, Ray Markey, Maya Maxym)         U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, is under       attack.        She stands for women, both as a champion of a woman's right       to choose and as a defender of those who have been sexually       assaulted; she fought Trump and the Republicans in defense of       the Affordable Care Act, against the Muslim ban and the       Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination. She is being attacked       because she has become one of the most eloquent and effective       voices of the values Indivisible Hawaii cherishes.        The attack comes not only from rightwing ideologues, it now       comes from Hawaii's own member of the House of       Representatives, Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat who on Friday       announced her candidacy for the presidency. Her article in       The Hill accuses Democratic Party members of the Senate       Judiciary Committee of ``fomenting religious bigotry'' and       ``weaponizing religion'' during their questioning of nominee       Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court in Nebraska.        This thinly veiled attack on Sen. Hirono, who sits on the       Senate Judiciary Committee which is responsible for approving       judicial nominees, is a ludicrous assertion and a stunning       act of hypocrisy on the part of Rep. Gabbard. The assertion       is that Hirono is a religious bigot because of questions       designed to reveal a nominee's clear record of anti-choice       activism as a barrier to his appropriateness for a judicial       appointment.        This attack is not only inaccurate, it exposes Gabbard's       self-serving attempt to project herself as a defender of       religious freedom--a position which is inconsistent with her       own actions. Rather than align herself with India's overt       right-wing Hindu Nationalists or Syria's Assad, we suggest       Rep. Gabbard follow Sen. Hirono as a model of both authentic       patriotic behavior and defense of civil rights.        Members of Indivisible Hawaii and other groups have visited       Sen. Hirono's offices, as well as those of the other members       of Hawaii's Congressional delegation, dozens of times since       President Donald Trump's Jan. 20, 2017, inauguration. We know       firsthand that she has championed our beliefs because we have       talked with her and her staff many times. We have followed       her votes, watched her on television, read her Facebook Page       and emails, and attended her town halls.        Sen. Hirono immigrated to Hawaii as a child and understands       from personal experience the challenges faced by immigrants.       She is the first Buddhist to serve in the Senate. Her years       of public service establish a record which, in particular,       show her to be a defender of religious tolerance as well as       the values of democratic government and the rule of law upon       which our country depends.        We witnessed what Gabbard did at, during, and after the       Democratic Party Convention ion 2016 to attack not Trump or       the Republicans, but former Secretary of State Hillary       Clinton and the Democratic Party. Since Trump's election       Gabbard's silence in response to Trump's efforts to       dismantle the institutions of our democracy has been       deafening and stands in stark contrast to Sen. Hirono's       forthright, clear and courageous actions to fight the       racist, misogynist, and authoritarian actions of Trump and       the GOP. The Hill article mimics her past behavior--why       does she choose to do this again?        As we fight to preserve our democracy unity is more       important than ever. An attack on Sen. Mazie Hirono as a       champion of progressive values in the Democratic Party is an       attack on all of us who want to take our country back. We       must stand with Sen. Hirono and other champions of democracy       to be successful.

Leslie Watson Malachi)         Happy New Year! Well, for most of us it should be--unless       you are fighting to protect our courts. New year, same old       tactic by conservatives, who are hoping to insulate narrow-      minded judicial nominees from scrutiny by smearing people who       ask critical questions about their records and rhetoric.        This dishonest ``religious bigotry'' strategy has been       around as long as the organized effort to shift the federal       judiciary to conservatism and reverse decades of precedent       that protect Americans' legal and constitutional rights. In       the recent past, for example, these groups have charged some       Catholic senators with wanting to keep Catholics off the       federal bench.        The latest smear is being pushed by the notoriously right-      wing editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, which has       run an attack on Senators Kamala Harris and Mazie Hirono. The       Journal's editorial is an over-the-top response to written       questions submitted by Sens. Harris and Hirono to federal       court nominee Brian Buescher about his commitment to       upholding legal equality for LGBTQ Americans and American       women's legal right to abortion.        In their questions, the senators noted Buescher's long-time       membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal       organization that does much laudable charitable work, but       which was also a top funder of anti-marriage-equality efforts       and supports restrictions on federal family-planning funds.       Before the 2016 election, the group's influential leader       declared that Catholics cannot vote for candidates who       support abortion rights.        Given these facts, the senators asked Buescher whether he       could assure litigants that he would deal with these issues       fairly and impartially as a federal judge. (Buescher's answer       stated that while he had run for political office as a ``pro-      life candidate,'' as a judge he would ``faithfully apply all       United States Supreme Court and Eighth Circuit Court of       Appeals precedent on all issues, including Roe v. Wade'' and       Obergefell.)        The Journal's editorial board responded to the senators'       reasonable line of questioning with outrage and horror. By       seeking to protect LGBTQ equality and reproductive rights,       and asking questions about the Knights' public policy       positions, the editorial implied, Sens. Harris and Hirono       were resurrecting the kind of anti-Catholic bigotry directed       at John F. Kennedy and earlier presidential candidate Al       Smith. The editorial said the questions were part of a       ``distressing pattern'' that seeks to ``banish'' religious       people from public life--the kind of false charge Religious       Right groups have often leveled to deflect criticism of their       political agendas or tactics.        This is not only absurd, but an insult to American voters.        The Journal also gave space to conservative African       American pastor Eugene Rivers to repeat the charge, saying       that the senators' questions were ``about silencing believers       of any kind whose views differ from the progressive view on       social issues.'' He unbelievably suggested that opponents of       Buescher's confirmation would be voting to deny his chance to       be a public servant based on his baptism in the Catholic       Church.        These inflammatory charges are designed to create       distraction. It is not only acceptable, but necessary for       senators to explore whether a nominee for a powerful lifetime       job as a federal judge will uphold every Americans' rights.       In the case of Buescher this is doubtful, given that as an       unsuccessful candidate for attorney general of Nebraska, he       said he did not believe LGBT Americans should be protected by       anti-discrimination laws the way people are protected from       racial or ethnic discrimination. It was also at this time       that he declared that he supported the ``complete reversal''       of Roe v. Wade. Buescher has a long record as a partisan       ideological warrior, an additional reason cited by the       Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in opposing his       confirmation.        Religious freedom is a core constitutional principle, and       as the Constitution makes clear, there must be no religious       test for public office. We rely on the federal courts to       enforce all Americans' constitutional rights. That means       judges, regardless of their religious or personal beliefs,       must be counted on to uphold Americans' legal protections.       Subsequently, a person's political positions or legal       ideology grounded in their faith does not make those legal       and political stances off-limits to questioning or criticism.        With Senate Republicans rubber-stamping even President       Trump's most extreme and unqualified nominees, right-wing       intimidation tactics must not prevent senators from       fulfilling their constitutional obligation to ensure that       lifetime federal judges are committed to protecting the       rights of all Americans.        Thank you, Senators Harris and Hirono! It's a new year, and       it's time to retire this old dishonest tactic of silencing       and attempts to shame. Let the questions be asked and let       them be answered.                                   ____              [From the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Jan. 6, 2019]                            Letter to the Editor                             (By Gary Edwards)         With regard to Donna L. Ching's letter (``Leave religion       out in vetting qualifications,'' Star-Advertiser, Dec. 27):       While I agree that a person's religious affiliation, alone,       should not be a means of exclusion for public office, I do       not agree that religion should be ``left out of the       conversation.''        One of the real concerns in vetting candidates for public       office is how they will apply their personal beliefs,       including their religion, to the role they seek to fill. And       while freedom of religion is a vital right, so is freedom       from religion.        Significant damage can be done to our society by those who       would seek to impose their religious beliefs and values on       others through the force of law. These beliefs and values do       not always align with the principles of our Constitution, and       laws based on them would deny others their freedom and fair       treatment.        I'm glad U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Kamala Harris are       probing these issues.        Kaneohe.                                   ____                [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 15, 2019]           Senators Were Right to Ask Those Questions on Religion                            (By Michael Keegan)         Regarding your editorial ``Kamala Harris's Dark Knights''       (Jan. 3): Sens. Harris and Mazie Hirono's questions for Brian       Buescher were focused on appropriate and important questions,       namely whether the nominee could be counted on as a federal       judge to recognize and protect the legal equality of LGBTQ       Americans and the right of American women to have access to       safe and legal abortion.        You charge that such questioning is about trying to       ``banish'' people from public life for their religious       beliefs and associations. In reality, protecting the legal       rights of all Americans of all faiths by ensuring that       nominees for powerful lifetime seats on America's federal       courts are committed to enforcing them is one of senators'       most important responsibilities, one that the current       Republican majority has abandoned in its rush to achieve       ideological domination of the courts.                            ____________________
