 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since President Trump's draconian FY 2018 budget was released last  year, Democrats have warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget  agreement was needed to adequately invest in American families and  communities. Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head  Start, job training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of  inadequate funding, at best.   Instead of engaging with Democrats to reach a budget agreement, the  majority is seeking to advance a full year of funding for only the  Department of Defense, busting budget caps, while punting every other  Federal service and investment to an uncertain future.   Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being  completely run by a Republican government can't keep the lights on more  than weeks at a time. How did we get here?   Democrats will not go along with any plan that neglects critical  national security and domestic needs. If this bill were to become law,  the majority would have no workable plan to make the investments that  are necessary for priorities, including biomedical research,  infrastructure projects, Pell Grants, homeland security, assistance for  local communities, veterans health, opioid funding, job training, the  FBI, and other Federal law enforcement and more.   This is not a serious bill. We know that it will be quickly rejected  by the Senate. It is the furthest possible cry from regular order that  the majority so frequently discusses yet rarely follows. It is nothing  more than a political ploy that will place us on the brink of another  shutdown.                                time  1730    It is well past time to increase budget caps and enact responsible  spending bills. The majority displays a lack of urgency regarding  reaching a budget agreement and enacting appropriations law, choosing  instead to advance partisan measures that fail to lift unmanageable  budget caps for both defense and nondefense.   Republicans must abandon these partisan short-term bills and work  with Democrats to fund the entirety of government for the remainder of  the fiscal year to serve the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development,  and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the ranking member of the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is the latest example of Republicans being completely incapable  of governing. We must finish our work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
