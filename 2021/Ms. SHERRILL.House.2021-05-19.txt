 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  3233, which creates a bipartisan independent commission to investigate  the attacks on the Capitol on January 6.   Why do we need this commission?   We need this commission because the American people must understand  exactly what happened so we can all forge a more resilient democracy.   We need this commission because, on January 6, I was lying on the  floor to avoid possible shooters in this very Chamber, holding a gas  mask in one hand and a phone in the other as I called my husband in  case I didn't make it home.   We need this commission because, despite our own experiences, despite  video footage, despite testimony by police, it has been suggested that  this was simply a normal tourist event. Well, we have a lot of tourism  where I am from. People visit our beautiful shore and historic sights,  and no tourist event I have ever seen looks like that day.   As The New York Times reported: The pure savagery of the mob was  breathtaking, as cataloged by injuries inflicted. One police officer  lost an eye; another, the tip of his finger. Still another was shocked  so many times with a taser gun that he had a heart attack.   Madam Speaker, we need this commission.
