 Mr. President, we truly don't have any time to waste.  The American people are in desperate need of help. And I want to start  by thanking all of my colleagues who have been working so hard together  across the aisle to bring us to a point where we can actually provide  some help, albeit temporary, to the American people. So, thank you, and  I am pleased to have been involved in elements of that negotiation and  appreciate it.   But we are stuck right now, and I just want to remind people of a few  numbers. More than one in three American adults in a recent survey said  they are struggling to pay household expenses, including rent and  mortgage. If we don't get something done in the next hours or days, we  are going to see thousands of people in Michigan lose their homes in  the middle of the winter.   There are 7.8 million Americans who have fallen into poverty since  June--7.8 million people have fallen into poverty since June. The  number of people applying for unemployment keeps rising. There were  885,000 people who filed initial claims last week, and thousands and  thousands and thousands of people who are self-employed, who are  contract workers, and others, will find themselves with zero support  right after Christmas, unless we take action.   A recent survey found that one in four small businesses are in danger  of closing if the economic conditions don't improve--one out of four. I  have talked to so many friends, so many people in Michigan, vibrant  small businesses--they put it all on the line for that business they  always wanted to have--and now they are barely holding on. They need  help, and they needed help before now. They need help now. They are  waiting and waiting and waiting and holding their breath.   Up to 50 million Americans are struggling to feed their families  right now. One out of four American households have experienced food  insecurity in this last year--so one out of four households. People who  volunteer at the food bank and people who have always contributed to  the food bank now find themselves waiting in their car for hours and  hours for a box of food in the United States of America. We not only  have a health pandemic; we have a hunger crisis going on, and people  need help now.   On top of that, this past Wednesday, 3,638 Americans died in 1 day of  coronavirus, and we are now looking at government services shutting  down in less than 12 hours--the backdrop of everything that is  happening for Americans. And despite all the good work that has been  going on, on a bipartisan basis, we are now looking at less than 12  hours of services for people and to our country shutting down.   And why? Because my colleague, the Republican Senator from  Pennsylvania, thinks it is more important to take away the Federal  Government's ability to help people and help businesses and create jobs  than it is to actually help people. Now, I want to say, Senator Toomey  and I had a wonderful hearing this week in our HELP Subcommittee on  Finance, of which he chairs, and we have been working together doing  really important, meaningful things on Alzheimer's disease, and I very  much enjoyed doing that. But on this issue--on this issue, at this  time, with so many people in pain and so much hardship at this moment-- I don't understand when he said that preventing the next Treasury  Secretary and the Federal Reserve from relaunching the emergency credit  facilities that support manufacturers and other job providers is ``the  most important thing'' in this COVID-19 package. Really? Really? The  most important thing in this package is to take away the tools of the  Treasury and the Federal Reserve that have been used when we are in  crisis, and we need to be a backstop for our businesses in the credit  market, when we need to be supporting job providers and jobs? Really?  Really? That is the most important thing?   Tell that to a mom who is afraid her kids will end up on the street  because she can't pay her rent in January, which is what, 2 weeks away.  Tell that to the small business owner who is having to lay off their  entire staff a week before Christmas. Tell that to a senior citizen who  is risking his health by waiting in an hours-long line to get a box of  food. Tell that to the healthcare workers who are literally putting  their lives on the line right now fighting this pandemic.   Really? Taking away economic tools from the Treasury and the Fed are  more important than people in our country? Small businesses? Farmers,  who have been hanging on? Really?   Tell that to the thousands of American families who are preparing for  their first holiday without loved ones who have been lost to the virus.  Just yesterday, another loss in Michigan--so many losses, thousands of  losses--but a dear friend, a sheriff of Wayne County, Benny Napoleon,  his family, today, a funeral for a friend as well in Detroit   So the most important thing is not supporting families, is not  helping people at least get through the winter, at least get through  the next several months to put food on the table and a roof over their  heads and help their businesses and make sure the vaccines can be  distributed and support our healthcare workers and put money into  education and all the other things that are needed right now--the most  important thing is to have a fight with the  [[Page S7696]]  Treasury and the Fed because you want to limit what they can do in  terms of their powers to help people and to help businesses in a  crisis.   Our Nation is in a crisis, and we would be in an even deeper crisis  right now if it weren't for the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve  stepped in early during the crisis. Under the current administration, I  might add, where nobody was suggesting that we provide these kinds of  amendments or restrictions then--under the current administration,  under the Trump administration, I didn't hear that debate. Maybe I  missed it, but I didn't hear that debate. But thank goodness we didn't  have a debate because they stepped in early, taking extraordinary  measures to keep credit from freezing up for our businesses. This is  the money that businesses use to provide services and keep people  employed.   And I have to say, as someone coming from a major manufacturing State  like Pennsylvania, like Ohio, like Indiana, like Wisconsin, that having  the capacity for the Fed to step in and provide some confidence in the  marketplace so that our auto suppliers and our other manufacturers  could get what they needed in terms of the credit, it was critical to  jobs--thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs.   The emergency powers that the Federal Reserve passed were put in  place during the 2008 financial crisis so that the Fed could respond  quickly to the next crisis. Well, here we are in the next crisis. The  crisis is all around us, and yet some are laser-focused on taking away  the Fed's ability to respond in the future with a new President--not  the current sitting President but a future President. This is like a  fire department selling off their fire trucks while houses down the  street are burning.   Now, 2020 has been brutal--really brutal--on families and businesses  and communities across the country. And this crisis is not over. I  really wish it was. I mean, we have hope because of the vaccines and  more effective testing and so on, but this isn't over, and things could  get worse in 2021 if we sabotage the very things that helped us this  year. If this is how you are setting up a new President to not have the  tools to make the economy better, what does that say about what people  care about--the people we represent? Because, ultimately, it is about  people losing their jobs; it is about businesses. This is more than  just about cross-partisan politics.   My friend Senator Schatz, who has a way with words, on Twitter, put  it this way:         We almost have a bipartisan COVID package, but at the last       minute Republicans are making a demand that WAS NEVER       MENTIONED AS KEY TO THE NEGOTIATIONS. They want to block the       FED from helping the economy under Biden. It's the reason we       don't have a deal.    Is that really the reason we don't have a deal to help people in our  country right now? Just cross-partisan politics wanting to set up a way  for the next President to fail? Because when colleagues take away tools  that a President--any President--and the Federal Reserve have to boost  the economy and prevent economic collapses, they are saying they care  more about that cross-political fight--make sure somebody looks bad and  make sure somebody fails--rather than caring about the people we  represent who create the jobs, the businesses, large and small, and the  people who have those jobs and the people who need those jobs.   Michigan is the proud home to so many small- and medium-sized  manufacturing businesses that employ thousands of people. I know there  are those same businesses across the country, including the State of  Pennsylvania, where my colleague is advocating for this.   I would urge--strongly urge--at this moment in time, at the end of  what has been such a horrible, difficult year for Americans, I would  urge my colleague from Pennsylvania and any others supporting him to  try stop trying to undermine American jobs and our ability as a country  to respond to the economic crisis that is still happening. Let's stop  stalling. We need to do our jobs to keep our military going and  healthcare and education and transportation and all the other critical  services that the Federal Government funds. And we need to pass this  critical COVID legislation today and give the American people the help  they need and the help they deserve to survive the next few months of  this health and economic crisis.   A wonderful bipartisan effort brought us to this moment where we can  provide a critical lifeline to Americans across our country.   It would be a tragedy and an outrage if efforts to undermine our  economy and the success of our incoming President stop this urgent help  from being passed. We need to get this done now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone  who is more than just a colleague. He is more than just a friend. In  fact, he has been a true partner here in the Senate, and that has paid  huge dividends for farmers, families, and communities across our  country.   Pat Roberts has been here in the Senate for a long time. Some might  even call him an institution. At a recent Ag Committee event, I joked  that, as a young man, he advised George Washington on farm policy. That  might be a bit of an exaggeration, but his legacy can hardly be  overstated. He has left a lasting imprint on farm and food policy in  this country. He is the only person to have written a farm bill as both  the chair of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees.   Those of us who have had the honor of serving alongside Pat on the  Senate Agriculture Committee know there is no other place quite like  it. It is a place where we leave politics at the door and focus on the  ways we can improve people's lives and livelihoods in rural America. We  do that because we know agriculture isn't a red issue or a blue issue.  Agriculture and food policy affect everyone. And nobody knows that  better than Pat.   Senator Roberts and I never gave up on passing the 2018 farm bill  even when it got tough. At the beginning of negotiations, we made a  commitment to work together. We visited each other's home States-- twice, in fact. I arrived in ``The Little Apple'' of Manhattan, KS,  wearing K-State purple. A few weeks later, Pat came to Frankenmuth, MI  and wore a MSU green tie.   Around this time, we also made a commitment to each other to write a  bipartisan farm bill. Throughout the entire process, I never doubted  that Pat had my back--even when negotiations got tough. Thanks to this  partnership, we achieved the most bipartisan bill in history.   We first passed our Senate bill by 86 votes, but that wasn't enough.  We decided to beat that record and passed the final farm bill by 87  votes, the most yes votes ever. We were able to do that because we have  a unique partnership built on trust and mutual respect. And the outcome  was a strong, bipartisan bill that provided certainty for all farmers,  from wheat farmers in Kansas to cherry growers in Michigan. Part of  that certainty is Federal crop insurance--and nobody deserves more  credit for the foundation of that important safety net program than  Senator Roberts.   Pat is also a champion for food security, agricultural exports, and  agricultural research, which is why he and I worked together to  establish the Foundation for Food and Agriculture in the 2014 Farm  Bill. He also understands the importance of protecting food assistance  for children and families. I was honored to share the Food Research and  Action Center's Distinguished Service Award with Senator Roberts last  year for our teamwork.   Above all, it has been an honor working with Pat because he is truly  one of a kind. From the moment I met him, it became abundantly clear  that he wasn't your run-of-the-mill politician. Some say it is his  unflappable nature. Others say it is his unique sense of humor. But to  me, Pat Roberts is defined by his loyalty, integrity, and dedication to  the people of Kansas.   He started his career as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps. And  it is clear he has carried that courage and conviction with him  throughout his life. He was also a newspaper reporter, which makes  sense when you consider his dogged determination, and, for better or  worse, his ability to be exceptionally quotable.   As a public servant, he is so beloved in his home State of Kansas  that he never lost an election, a record of 24-0. If only his K-State  Wildcats could be so lucky.   Senator Pat Roberts, it has been such an honor to be your partner-- and an even bigger honor to be your friend. So while your retirement is  well earned, you will be deeply missed on the Agriculture Committee and  here in the Senate.   Thank you for all you have done for farmers, families, and the  American people.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor someone whom I  have had the good fortune to serve alongside both in the House and the  Senate.   In American political history, there are certain names that carry a  legacy. There are the Roosevelts, a family of great means who  nonetheless understood the deeply personal pain of the Great Depression  and helped bring a nation through it. There are the Kennedys, a family  that for generations has been near the center of American power and  popular culture.   And there are the Udalls.   Now, the Udalls have never been flashy. They might not be the  equivalent of political royalty. You are more likely to find Udalls in  cowboy boots and jeans than expensive suits. But they are a family that  is deeply devoted to public service, protecting the people and places  of the West, and just being some of the kindest, hardest-working, most  decent folks you could ever meet.   Senator Tom Udall has certainly lived up to his family's legacy  during his long career in public service. New Mexico is so fortunate to  be represented by him, and I feel so fortunate to have him as a friend.   Tom, it has been such a pleasure to work with you on issues including  protecting funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, ensuring  that our community health centers receive full funding, strengthening  rural communities, and improving services for our veterans and our work  together on TSCA reform. I have been so impressed by your work on clean  energy and on protecting the wild places that make our States so  special--and, of course, your important work on reforming the Senate.  And I am so grateful for your strong leadership on the Indian Affairs  Committee and your hard work on behalf of our Nation's Tribes. You have  also set yourself apart through your work on foreign relations and on  keeping our Nation safe.   I will never forget our trip to Vietnam and South Korea last year. It  was such a special moment when Jill organized a Passover Seder for  everyone on our plane to Ho Chi Minh City. It brought everyone together  to focus on our common humanity and what we are each called to do:  serve others.   Whatever the future holds for you, I have no doubt that you will  continue serving the people of New Mexico and this great Nation. Public  service, that is what Udalls do.   Tom, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you for a job well  done. You have been a true blessing to New Mexico and our Nation.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone  who hasn't been in the Senate very long, but whose character,  compassion, and dedication to justice will leave a mark here for years  to come.   Many of us are old enough to remember that awful day in 1963 when a  peaceful Sunday morning was shattered by a bomb. This attack on the  16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, carried out by members of the  Ku Klux Klan, ended the lives of four young girls: Carole Robertson,  Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, and Denise McNair.   I was just a little younger than Carole, Addie, and Cynthia, who were  all 14. Doug Jones was just a couple of years younger than 11-year-old  Denise. When something so unspeakable happens to people you could have  gone to school with, been friends with, and grown up with, it sticks  with you.   It certainly stuck with Doug. He got involved in organizing at the  University of Alabama and volunteered on a campaign to modernize the  State's courts. After graduating from Cumberland School of Law at  Samford University in Birmingham, he served as staff counsel on the  Judiciary Committee for Senator Howell Heflin, whose seat he currently  holds.   After time as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and in private practice,  Doug was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Attorney for the Northern  District of Alabama in 1997. In that position, he successfully  prosecuted two of the four men responsible for the devastation on that  long-ago Sunday morning. He didn't just remember those four little  girls. Instead, he fought to bring their families some measure of  justice and closure--because that is just the type of person Doug is.   Doug, your Future Act to permanently fund historically Black colleges  and universities will help build a brighter future for students across  our  [[Page S7708]]  country. It has been such an honor to work with you to extend funding  for community health centers and to expand access to care and resources  to families living with Alzheimer's disease. And millions of Americans  have you to thank for a timely vote to save the Affordable Care Act and  their healthcare.   Doug, you know what really matters: pursuing justice, expanding  opportunity, and simply making life better for the people who sent us  here.   Three days after those beautiful young girls were killed, Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., delivered their eulogy. In it, he said this: ``(Their  deaths) say to each of us, black and white alike, that we must  substitute courage for caution.   ``They say to us that we must be concerned not merely about who  murdered them, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy  which produced the murderers.   ``Their death says to us that we must work passionately and  unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream.''   Doug, you might not know yet what your future holds, but you have  been working passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the  American dream for your entire career. I have absolutely no doubt that  in whatever you do next, Doug, you will continue to be a tireless  advocate for justice and equality.   Thank you for who you are. It has been such an honor serving with  you.
