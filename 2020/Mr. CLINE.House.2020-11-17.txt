 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two businesses in  the Sixth District who have committed themselves to serving those who  served our Nation.   Tactical & Survival Specialties, Incorporated, of Harrisonburg was  awarded the Department of Labor's HIRE Vets Medallion for the second  year in a row, while Rubicon Planning of Roanoke earned this  distinction for the first time.   This prestigious honor is the only program within the Federal  Government that recognizes the meaningful and verifiable efforts  undertaken by job creators to hire and retain our Nation's veterans.   These two patriotic businesses understand why veterans are such an  asset to any workforce.   According to a new Census report, veterans are more willing than  civilians to work longer hours and seek full-time employment. Further,  by nature, veterans work well in a team and have a sense of duty. They  are disciplined, determined, and confident. They are trained to be  problem-solvers, to adapt to changing situations, and they have a work  ethic that is simply unmatched. For these reasons, I encourage all  businesses to hire veterans.   I applaud and thank Rubicon Planning and TSSi for being one of a  select few awardees across the Nation who have already committed  themselves to doing so.                            ____________________
