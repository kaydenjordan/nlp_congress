 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, a bill to assist  the United States Department of Labor in identifying and preventing  cases of human trafficking.   I thank Chairman Walberg for his leadership on this issue and for  introducing this legislation of which I am an original cosponsor. As  chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment,  Labor, and Pensions of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Mr.  Walberg and I have found common ground on a number of important issues  facing the American people, and human trafficking is one of them.   We may think that human trafficking is something that occurs in far- off countries. And, yes, according to the International Labor  Organization, there are 21 million men, women, and children around the  world who are currently subjected to forced labor. Unfortunately,  however, the injustice of human trafficking happens right here at home  in the United States as well.   Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking  Resource Center hotline here in the United States received reports of  over 8,000 cases of human trafficking in our country last year, an  increase of 35 percent over the year before.   I have seen cases of this terrible scourge firsthand in my own  district, the Northern Mariana Islands. A number of construction  companies lured foreign workers to come to the Marianas with false  promises and misrepresentations about pay and conditions.  [[Page H5487]]  The companies then withheld the employees' wages and confiscated their  passports. The workers were subjected to horrible working conditions,  crowded unsanitary barracks with barely enough food and water. They  were forced to work in unsafe conditions, suffering serious injuries  without access to adequate medical care. There was even a workplace  fatality.   To their credit, the Department of Labor's OSHA and Wage and Hour  divisions have worked to address these injustices, issuing fines and  citations, recovering back wages. But we need to identify human  traffickers and prevent cases like this before they happen.   That is the purpose of our bill, the Enhancing Detection of Human  Trafficking Act. H.R. 2664 directs the Department of Labor to train  appropriate Department staff on how to detect human trafficking, and  ensure that these staff people get regular updates on how traffickers  are adjusting to avoid detection.                                time  1515    Our bill establishes training for a clear course of action for  referring cases of suspected human trafficking to the Department of  Justice and other appropriate authorities so these offenders are  prosecuted.   And the bill requires the Department to report back to Congress  within a year on the progress that is being made because Congress needs  to do more than simply enact programs with lofty goals. We also need to  build in mechanisms to tell us whether our programs are working as  intended.   Mr. Speaker, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act will, I  believe, give the Department of Labor the tools and resources it needs  to combat human trafficking. I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this bill.   I would like to also thank the leadership of the House, especially  Chairwoman Virginia Foxx and Ranking Member Bobby Scott of the  Education and the Workforce Committee, for moving this bill to the  floor. And again, I thank my friend, Chairman Walberg, for his  leadership in this important area of public policy.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge all  my colleagues to please support, vote ``aye'' on H.R. 2664.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
