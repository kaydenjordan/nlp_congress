 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  the abortion on demand until birth act.   I have worked in Congress to promote a culture of life and remain  supportive of measures that respect the sanctity of human life by  encouraging alternatives to abortion, including counseling and  pregnancy centers for women.   By contrast, the abortion on demand until birth act attempts to  override past and future pro-life laws at the Federal and State levels.  This will allow abortions based on Down syndrome diagnosis, sex of the  baby, and even dismemberment abortions. Simply put, this bill's goal is  to promote abortion anywhere, anytime, from conception to birth.   Madam Speaker, our Nation should be investing in women's healthcare  and the healthcare of unborn babies. This bill does the opposite. I  urge my colleagues to oppose it.
