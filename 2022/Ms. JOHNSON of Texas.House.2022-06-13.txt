 Madam Speaker, for over 150 years, June 19th,  also known as Juneteenth Independence Day, has served as a source of  reflection, inspiration, and hope for generations of Black Americans.  It is a day when we are reminded of the trials and tribulations of  those who came before us, and celebrate the incredible progress we have  made. It is a day when we can rejoice together in the freedom and  liberties that we all share, and recommit ourselves to everlasting  equality and justice. It is a day that means so much, but for too long  had not been formally recognized as a federal holiday.   That was, Madam Speaker, until our advocacy was finally met with  action from the rest of Congress and the White House. I was proud to  join my colleagues here in Congress and the Biden Administration last  year to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Now, just one year later,  many more Americans understand and appreciate the day's history.   Today, I am especially thankful for Texas's very own, Ms. Opal Lee.  Colloquially known as the ``Grandmother of Juneteenth,'' Ms. Lee has  worked tirelessly over the years to educate, inform, and advocate on  behalf of the Juneteenth movement. I have had the pleasure of meeting  her several times over the years and am constantly reminded that we  stand on the shoulders of icons like her.   Madam Speaker, I want to wish those in Texas's 30th Congressional  District and across the country a Happy Juneteenth.                            ____________________
