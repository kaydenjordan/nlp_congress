 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Indiana.    I ask to send a question to the desk on my behalf and  Senator Barrasso's for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Braun and Barrasso for counsel for the  President:         The House Managers have said the country must be saved from       this President, and he does not have the best interests of       the American people and their families in mind. Do you wish       to respond to that claim?    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  while the House managers are coming before you and accusing the  President of doing things, in their words, solely for personal and  political gain and claiming that he is not doing things in the best  interests of the American people, the American people are telling you  just the opposite.   The President's approval ratings, while we are sitting here in the  middle of these impeachment proceedings, have hit an alltime high. A  recent poll shows that the American people are the happiest they have  been with the direction of the country in 15 years. Whether it is the  economy, security, military preparedness, safer streets, or safer  neighborhoods, they are all way up. We, the American people, are  happier. Yet the House managers tell you that the President needs to be  removed because he is an immediate threat to our country.   Listen to the words that they just said: We--we, the American  people--cannot decide who should be our President because, as they tell  us--and these are their words--``we cannot be assured that the vote  will be fairly won.'' Do you really, really believe that? Do you really  think so little of the American people? We don't. We trust the American  people to decide who should be our President. Candidly, it is crazy to  think otherwise.   What is really going on? What is really going on is that he is a  threat to them, and he is an immediate, legitimate threat to them, and  he is an immediate, legitimate threat to their candidates because the  election is only 8 months away.   Let's talk about some of the things the President has done. We have  replaced NAFTA with the historic MCA. We have killed a terrorist--al- Baghdadi and Soleimani. We secured $738 billion to rebuild the  military. There have been more than 7 million jobs created since the  election. Illegal border crossings are down 78 percent since May, and  100 miles of the wall have been built. The unemployment rate is the  lowest in 50 years. More Americans--nearly 160 million--are employed  than ever before. The African-American unemployment, the Hispanic- American unemployment, the Asian-American unemployment has the lowest  rate ever recorded. Women's unemployment recently hit the lowest rate  in more than 65 years. Every U.S. metropolitan area saw per capita  growth in 2018. Real wages have gone up by 8 percent for the low-income  workers. Real median household income is now the highest level ever  recorded. Forty million fewer people live in households receiving  government assistance. We signed the biggest package of tax cuts and  reforms in history. Since then, over $1 trillion has poured back into  the United States. Six hundred and fifty thousand single mothers have  been lifted out of poverty. We secured the largest ever increase for  childcare funding, helping more than 800,000 low-income families access  high-quality, affordable care. We passed, as Manager Jeffries will  recall, bipartisan criminal justice reform. Prescription drugs have  received the largest price decrease in over half a century. Drug  overdose deaths fell nationwide in 2018 for the first time in nearly 30  years.   The Gallup poll from just 3 days ago says that President Trump's  upbeat view of the Nation's economy, military strength, economic  opportunity, and overall quality of life will likely resonate with  Americans when he delivers the State of the Union Address to Congress  next week.   If all that is solely--solely, in their words--for his personal and  political gain and not in the best interests of the American people,  then I say: God bless him. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. Keep doing it.   Maybe if the House managers stop opposing him and harassing him and  harassing everyone associated with him, with the constant letters and  the constant investigations, maybe we can even get more done.    Let's try something different now. Join us. Join us. One Nation. One  Nation. One people. Enough is enough. Stop all of this.  [[Page S705]]    Thank you.    Mr. Chief Justice, I, along with Senator Lee, send to the  desk a question for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Braun and Lee is for the counsel for the  President:         Under Professor Dershowitz's theory, is what Joe Biden is       alleged to have done potentially impeachable, in contrast to       what has been alleged against President Trump?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   I believe that, under Professor Dershowitz' theory, remember, he  tried to categorize things into three buckets. One was of purely good  motives. One was, well, you might have some motive for your personal  political gain, as well as public interest motives for doing something  or intent. Then there was the third bucket of purely private pecuniary  gain. He said that is the one, if you are doing it for purely private  pecuniary gain, that has the problem.   I think that would be the distinguishing factor in what is  potentially a presence in the facts known about the Biden and Burisma  incident because the conflict of interest that would be apparent on the  face of the facts that are known is that there would be a personal,  family financial interest in that situation.   Vice President Biden is in charge of Ukraine policy. His son is  sitting on the board of a company that is known for corruption. The  public reports are that, apparently, the prosecutor general was  investigating that company and its owner, the oligarch, at the time.  Then Vice President Biden quite openly said that he leveraged $1  billion in U.S. loan guarantees to ensure that that particular  prosecutor was fired at that time.   One could put together fairly easily from those known facts the  suggestion that there was a family financial benefit coming from the  end of that investigation because it protected the position of the  younger Biden on the board, and that would be a purely private  pecuniary--financial--gain. That is the third bucket that Professor  Dershowitz was describing and the one that is necessarily problematic  when he said that that is where there is going to be a problem, that  that is where you would have a crime and a potentially impeachable  offense.   So I think that would be the distinction there. That is one that, if  all of those facts lined up under Professor Dershowitz' categorization  of things, would be the problematic category.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Minnesota.
