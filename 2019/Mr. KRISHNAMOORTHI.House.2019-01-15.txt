 Madam Speaker, I rise on Martin Luther King,  Jr.'s birthday to urge passage of H. Res. 41 and to reject white  nationalism and supremacy in all its forms.   I applaud both sides for taking up this resolution in support of  rejecting white nationalism.   But today, Madam Speaker, I ask one question: Where does President  Trump stand on this resolution? Will President Trump do as we are doing  and reject white supremacy in all its forms?   So far, we have heard nothing but silence. I ask him to act and do  the same: reject white supremacy and white nationalism, today.
