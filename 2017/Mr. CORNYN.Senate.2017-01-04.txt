 Mr. President, there has been a flurry of activity this  week with the beginning of the new year and the beginning of a new  Congress--the 115th Congress--and we have a lot of work to do.   This election that we just went through on November 8 was surprising  in many ways, gratifying in many ways. Personally, I think the best  thing about it is that it gives us an opportunity to start anew, to  deal with the problems that the American people were, frankly, not all  that happy with either of the political parties about in terms of the  solutions that we were to offer. I would hope that it would also give  us an opportunity to hit the reset button when it comes to working  together to try to find political consensus to solve some of these big  problems.   I mentioned yesterday our friend, the chairman of the Budget  Committee, and his 80-20 rule, which I told him I have used time and  again to make the point that just because you disagree on some things  doesn't mean you can't get  [[Page S35]]  anything done. To the contrary, people of widely divergent ideological,  philosophical, and political beliefs can work together by simply trying  to find common ground. That is possible. That, in fact, is the way our  Constitution created our government to force us to do that, because  what we decide here impacts a lot of people--well over 300 million  people in the United States alone. But if there was one consistent  complaint that I heard from my constituents back in Texas and that we  heard in the national media and beyond, it is about the failure of the  promise of ObamaCare. We made a solemn commitment to the American  people that if they provided us with the majority we needed to do it  and if they provided us a President who would sign it, we would repeal  ObamaCare and we would replace it with affordable health care that  would be of their choosing, as opposed to a top-down mandate, a one- size-fits-all, which is the failure of ObamaCare.   In a previous life, I was attorney general of my State, the State of  Texas. We had a huge division of trial lawyers called the consumer  protection division. What we did is we sued people who committed  consumer fraud--people who promised one thing but delivered another. I  can't think of a bigger case of consumer fraud than ObamaCare, which  was sold under false pretenses: If you like what you have, you can keep  it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you are a  family of four, your premiums will go down by an average of $2,500.   None of that has proven to be true.   The reason why ObamaCare is so unpopular is that people have seen  their premiums skyrocket. People have seen their deductibles grow to  the point where they are effectively self-insured, which is not having  insurance at all. Many people have simply seen insurance companies pull  out of the insurance market, leaving them with little or no choices in  terms of where to buy their health care.   So many remember the PR campaign of the President and Democrats, with  which they sold ObamaCare to the American people, and, as I said,  promised better coverage, more choices, and lower prices.   That means now that ObamaCare has failed to deliver that. It is  incumbent on us to try to repeal it, which we will do, and to replace  it with more affordable coverage that people will choose and that fits  their needs better. The bad news of ObamaCare picked up throughout last  summer into the fall. As I mentioned, insurance companies were losing  money and were unable to operate and deliver health care under the  tight grip of ObamaCare. But the real losers weren't the insurance  companies. It is the tens of thousands of Texans who were forced to  find new insurance at higher prices--not insurance they would have  chosen on their own, but which they were forced to accept because there  was no alternative.   So instead of helping rural Texans--the Senator from Vermont talked  about rural residents in his State--I would submit that for people  living in rural areas across the country, the implementation of  ObamaCare hurt most of our rural country by dwindling the number of  choices to one health care option for the year. That sounds like the  opposite of more choices and better coverage to me. But we can't forget  that behind these numbers and headlines are real personal consequences  for families across the country.   So today I want to provide just a snapshot of some of the thousands  of letters that I received in my office about ObamaCare and the burdens  that it is placing on the backs of the people I represent in Texas. One  Texan wrote telling the story that I have heard time and again. She  said her insurance plan was discontinued--so much for ``if you like  what you have, you can keep it.'' But she did what she had to do, and  she switched to a more expensive plan--one with a higher monthly  payment and one with an $11,000 deductible. What good is health  insurance if you have to spend $11,000 out of your own pocket before  the insurance begins to kick in? It is nearly worthless.   Well, nothing about that says affordable health care. Unfortunately,  this individual is like many folks across the country, full of  questions and with nowhere to turn to find any relief for their  families or their small business.   Another one of my constituents had a similar complaint. He wrote to  me that he was searching for yet another health insurance plan for the  third time in as many years after his was canceled. He went on to  highlight this in this letter, which I received from a constituent on  November 23, 2015. He said:         I seem to remember the President saying something about       liking your insurance and being able to keep it. For myself       and my family, it has been just the opposite. We loved our       insurance prior to the passage of the Act and since have been       forced to purchase much more expensive insurance with much       higher deductibles.    Well, this Texan is right, but unfortunately, his experience was not  isolated. It was shared by millions of people across the country for  whom ObamaCare was a false promise. It is not as if he had the freedom  to choose. The choice was made for him, and this was the fundamental  flaw of ObamaCare. In a country as big and diverse as ours, this notion  of ``one-size-fits-all'' and that somehow the people who live and work  inside the beltway are smarter than the rest of us and we can figure  out what is good for them and a choice they would not themselves make  is just simply implausible. It is not true. This constituent ended his  letter by asking the Congress:         Do anything. Do anything within your power to reverse this       terrible health care trend. I need relief.    After this historic election, after the promises we made that have  given us the opportunity to govern in the majority, with a President in  the White House who will work with us, I believe we have a clear  mandate to repeal this terrible law and make it a relic of the past. We  will do that by adopting the budget resolution submitted by Chairman  Enzi of the Budget Committee.   It is not just Republicans who have pointed out the defects of  ObamaCare. Many of our Democratic colleagues have pointed out the law's  failed promises as well--from an op-ed entitled ``How to fix the  Affordable Health Care Act,'' which was written by a Democrat, to  statements on the Senate floor, to legislation introduced to ``fix the  glitch.'' Even in campaign ads, many of our Democratic colleagues have  themselves been outspoken advocates for changing ObamaCare. The senior  Senator from Missouri, pointing out the ``huge problem ObamaCare has  been in her State'' came up with an entire list of necessary changes.  I, for one, would be happy to start with her list and say let's try to  use this as a core of issues that we can then try to build consensus  around to begin to make that replacement and make it on a bipartisan  basis.    We have seen that attempted fixes, unsupported by the Obama  administration and vastly insufficient, continually have been met with  frustration by Democrats and Republicans. I pointed out yesterday that  when the Democrats voted through ObamaCare, they had 60 votes. They had  60 Senators. Today they have 48.   At one point, certainly back in 2009 and 2010 when ObamaCare passed,  they had a majority in the House of Representatives. Well, they lost  that. Now they have lost the White House itself. I just don't know how  much longer, how much more needs to be said or done for them to get the  message that this is not working because I believe they are paying a  political price for it as people are searching for accountability for  what they have to deal with day in and day out.   The senior Senator from Indiana said that he supported the Affordable  Care Act to help working and middle-class families have access to  health care, but he said that doesn't mean the law is perfect, and it  doesn't mean we don't still have work to do.   I was delighted to hear the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, say he  agrees ObamaCare is not perfect. My request of him and others is to  work with us to try to replace it with something better.   I recognize that neither side is going to be able to get everything  they want. That is just not the way this place works. Indeed, the  single failure of the Obama administration is to try to do things on a  go-it-alone basis because we are going to see those Executive orders  that he issued unilaterally rescinded on the first day President-Elect  Trump takes office. All the massive regulations that have been issued,  we are going to use the Congressional  [[Page S36]]  Review Act to rein those in or to defund those through the  appropriations process. In order for legislation and policy to be  sustainable, it is going to have to be bipartisan. I realize our  Democratic colleagues are disappointed with the outcome of the election  on November 8. That is an understatement. At first they started out in  denial: It just can't be true. The next stage was met with anger. Well,  they are angry about it, and they are going to obstruct everything the  new majority, working with the White House, tries to do, but I would  hope they would move past that denial and past that anger and do what  the Senate was always designed to do; that is, to work on a bipartisan  basis, as our friend and colleague from Wyoming demonstrated to us  working on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with  the liberal lion of the Senate, Teddy Kennedy. Let's try the 80-20 rule  and see how it works. It will work.   The senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin--this is another  Democrat--has said he would vote to repeal ObamaCare. He said that we  should be working together to identify which parts of the law are  broken and need to be fixed. We may learn that some parts of the law  can't be repaired and we should eliminate those parts entirely. This is  our Democratic friend and colleague from West Virginia, Senator  Manchin.   I think that is a great place to start because no matter which side  of the aisle you sit on, you can see the Affordable Care Act is not  working, certainly not as sold to the American people. The choice of  the Democrats now is whether to obstruct or whether they will actually  work with us, as we should have done in the first place, to come up  with something more sustainable that would address costs and preserve  individual choice.   It is interesting. It is not just our Democratic colleagues, many of  whom voted for ObamaCare. I remember during the Presidential campaign  that former President Bill Clinton made some pretty interesting  comments. This would have been on October 5, 2016. I am reading from a  CNN story here. It said:         Speaking at a Democratic rally in Flint, Michigan, the       former president ripped the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for       flooding the health care insurance market and causing       premiums to rise for middle-class Americans who do not       qualify for subsidies.    Here is what he said:         So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25       million more people have health care and then the people who       are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up       with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.       It's the craziest thing in the world.    Former President Bill Clinton said that in Flint, MI, on October 5,  2016.   He is right, but that is what you get when you try to do things in a  partisan, unilateral fashion. We should learn from our collective  mistakes and try to do better, and shame on us if we can't do better  than ObamaCare with all of its failed promises.   By repealing ObamaCare, Congress is doing more than just delivering  on a promise we made to the people who put us here. We are providing a  way forward for millions of people across the country who have been  hurt by ObamaCare and are looking for relief.   I look forward to making ObamaCare and the many burdens it has placed  on American families a thing of the past in this new year. That is what  we will do when next week we pass this budget resolution, and then  reconciliation instructions will be sent to the relevant Senate and  House committees. They will then report back with the replacement, and,  yes, it may take some time to transition into that replacement because  it has taken us 6 years to get into the mess, into the ditch we find  ourselves in now. When your truck or car is in the ditch, the first  thing you need to do is get out of the ditch. Sometimes that takes a  lot of hard work.   We are going to have to work as hard as we can. I would hope our  colleagues will work with us, not just to resist for resistance's sake,  not just to take a partisan position because they feel they are  required to do so because of their allegiance to the policies of the  Democratic Party. Let's do what this institution has always been best  known for; that is, to try to find some way to work together on a step- by-step basis to produce reform which will make health care more  affordable and still preserve those choices for individuals and their  families, not a one-size-fits-all government mandate which simply has  failed in this tragic experiment known as ObamaCare. We can and we will  do better.   I yield the floor.
