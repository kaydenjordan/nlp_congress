 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the  Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act.   Small businesses help make up the foundation of our country's  economy, with over half of Americans owning or working for small  businesses. As the driving force behind our economy, it is crucial that  the government uplift them at every possible point.   This bill clarifies the function and duties of the Office of Advocacy  of the Small Business Administration to allow the Office of Advocacy to  represent the views and interests of small businesses before foreign  governments and international entities. This will allow American small  businesses to be better represented in international markets and in  negotiations with foreign entities.    Whether domestic or abroad, our small businesses deserve a seat at  the table if discussions are going to affect the bottom line.   My district is an international hub. We have some of the most  important and highest traffic ports in the United States. Louisiana  businesses connect with diverse companies and international markets  across the globe every day. This bill will ensure that small business  owners have someone at the table fighting for them.   I will continue to do everything in my power to support American  small businesses so they can better compete in the international  market.   I thank our chair and Congressman Luetkemeyer for working with me on  this important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
