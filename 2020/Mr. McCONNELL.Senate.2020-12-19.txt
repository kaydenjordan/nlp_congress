 Mr. President, our Nation stands at a crossroads in  our months-long battle with the new coronavirus. Tracking recent  developments lately has felt like watching a split-screen television.  On the one hand, Operation Warp Speed has fostered a modern medical  miracle. The genius of science has brought forward safe and effective  vaccines at a pace which, just months ago, many claimed would be  impossible. For about 9 months now, our Nation has been treading water  altogether. Now the road to victory is in sight.   But at the same time, even as we see this hopeful sunrise on the  horizon, in the here and now, we are still facing an ongoing five-alarm  national crisis. The virus is surging across our country. Two days ago,  my home State of Kentucky set another bleak new record--the most  Kentuckians lost in a single day of this pandemic so far. Nationwide,  since the start of December, we have lost around 3,000 of our fellow  Americans to this disease every single day.   Meanwhile, although the American people have built our economic  recovery with more speed and resilience than anyone had anticipated, we  have known all along that recovering prosperity would come hand-in-hand  with defeating the virus. Thus, millions of working families across the  Nation are still under terrible strain.   Last week, economists thought we would see a slight downward tick in  new unemployment claims. Instead, the numbers shot up, logging 885,000  new claims in just 1 week--almost  [[Page S7832]]  900,000 newly laid-off Americans in 1 week alone.   Senators on both sides know what we need to do. In the springtime,  when the country needed a bridge, we passed the largest rescue package  in American history on a unanimous, bipartisan basis. Now what  Americans need is another bridge. Fortunately, this time we do not need  a bridge over an unknown and frightening future but a bridge through  the next several months, while the lifesaving vaccines can flow  throughout our country.   Frontline healthcare workers are receiving the vaccine as we speak.  Yesterday, Vice President Pence, Speaker Pelosi, and I all received  first doses of vaccines pursuant to preexisting plans for the  continuity of our government.   These vaccines are safe. They are effective. They are our Nation's  path out of this hellish chapter. So the first lines of the cavalry are  already arriving. We just need to help American families hold on while  reinforcements continue to pour in: more paycheck protection loans for  the hardest hit businesses, more additional Federal unemployment aid,  more direct assistance for families, a lot more funding for K-12  schools to reopen safely and get our kids' educations back on track,  and, perhaps most important of all, a huge amount of funding for  vaccine distribution so that we aren't just helping Americans endure  this battle, but we are helping them win the battle as fast as possible                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night, we extended government  funding for 2 additional days. The Senate and the House need to  finalize another rescue package containing all the policies I just  named and many more. We need to finalize government funding legislation  for next year, and we need to pass these measures with a big,  bipartisan vote and get them signed into law without further delay.   We need cooperation and focus from all sides. There is a kind of  gravitational pull here in Congress, where, unless we are careful, any  major negotiation can easily slide into an unending catalogue of  disagreements. Let's guard against that.   The American people have already waited for more assistance longer  than they could afford. In my judgment, they have waited far too long  for a relief package of the same general size and scope that Senate  Republicans have been proposing literally since last summer. Every one  of us in the Senate and the House represent American families who  simply cannot wait any longer for Congress to conclude these  discussions. Every day that we delay may very well cost more small  businesses their survival, cost more American workers their jobs, and,  yes, cost more Americans their very lives.   We have had productive discussions this week. I appreciate the good- faith spirit that has characterized my talks with the Democratic  leader, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and Secretary Mnuchin, but the  American people cannot feed their families or pay their bills with  Congress's good-faith discussions. They need us to act. We need to  conclude our talks, draft legislation, and land this plane.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote  by which cloture was not invoked.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.
