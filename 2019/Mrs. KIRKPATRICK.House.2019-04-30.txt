 Madam Speaker, I am standing here today to  recognize my southern Arizona community. While in Tucson for the work  period, I saw goodness in action. The city of Tucson, the county,  Catholic Community Services, and other local churches and nonprofits  came together with open arms and hearts to welcome and care for the  hundreds of families seeking asylum across our southern border.   With limited resources and fleeting time, southern Arizonans stepped  up to provide shelter, transportation, food, clothing, and childcare.  City volunteers ran with little children who hadn't played in weeks and  weeks.   The families fleeing their birthplace journeyed to the United States  for a safer and better life for their children. Their stories are gut- wrenching, and the response I have seen and heard from the Tucson  community has been unparalleled.   No walls or cages, I saw goodness in action. We must come together  like Tucson to find humane and proactive solutions to help these  families.  [[Page H3311]]                                ____________________
