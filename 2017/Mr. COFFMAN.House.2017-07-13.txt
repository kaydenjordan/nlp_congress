 Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the gentleman from  Florida's amendment. This amendment strikes section 541 of the 2018  National Defense Authorization Act, which ensures that graduates from  military service academies fulfill their military service commitments,  without exception, before participating in professional sports. Current  policy allows a cadet or midshipman to be released from their 5-year  Active Duty service to participate in professional sports just 24  months after graduating from a military service academy.   As chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee and a Marine Corps  combat veteran, I believe that the service academies exist to develop  future officers to lead, enhance readiness, and increase the  effectiveness of the Armed Forces.   This is not an issue of recruiting qualified and motivated  applicants. Each year, my district office receives far more  applications from talented and qualified students who wish to serve  their country than we can accommodate. For example, there were 17,000  applications for 1,100 slots last year at the Naval Academy. All of our  military service academies have similar numbers of applicants.   We are a country still very much engaged in hostilities around the  world, and we need these officers leading our troops and defending the  country, not playing professional sports.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the provision in the  overwhelming bipartisan HASC-passed FY 2018 National Defense  Authorization Act and oppose Representative Rooney's amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally), my friend and colleague.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition. As the only Air  Force Academy graduate in Congress, we train these cadets to become  officers and leaders and warfighters for our military. We are not  training them to become pro athletes, just like my colleague said here.   And you want to talk about morale?   Having been there, there is nothing worse than watching somebody try  to get out of their commitment to go play pro sports, for the rest of  the cadets that are there ready to lead America into battle.   I strongly support the underlying bill. We are at a time of military  crisis and readiness crisis right now. We do not release people to go  fly for the airlines or go start their own business or go be an  entrepreneur or go to a high-tech company and then just say: Oh, just  pay it back.   There are so many people that are trying to get into these academies  so they can wear the uniform and lead America into battle.   So this is about warfighting, not about becoming a linebacker. So  let's please--I am urging my colleagues to vote down this amendment and  to support the underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I think that if Roger Staubach played for  the Dallas Cowboys, graduated from the United States Naval Academy,  served his entire Active-Duty commitment of 5 years before he went to  play professional sports, this does not eliminate somebody from playing  professional sports.   The fact is that we are a nation at war, and it is very competitive  to get into these academies, and they ought to fulfill their 5-year  obligation. If they want to play professional sports, there are lots of  schools they can go to outside of our service academies.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Thomas J. Rooney).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.                    Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Keating    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7  printed in House Report 115-217.
