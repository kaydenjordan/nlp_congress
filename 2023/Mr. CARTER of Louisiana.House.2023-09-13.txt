 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoyer very much for  this great opportunity and thank him for his incredible leadership in  leading this Regional Leadership Council.   A special thank you to our leader, Leader Jeffries, for this very  significant appointment to serve on this committee with so many  outstanding Members of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the representative of Region 7 on the  House Democrats' Regional Leadership Council representing Alabama,  Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.   In Louisiana, the month of August is known for its hurricanes. To see  what climate change looks like, I invite you to visit us. Storms,  floods, sea-level rise: our lives, our homes, our cultures are  literally on the line.   I was honored to have my friend Senior Advisor Mitch Landrieu back  home during the district work period to talk about critical funding  Democrats secured during the 117th Congress through the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law to help combat the crisis in our climate.   We announced new climate resilience funding through two competitive  grant programs, marking a pivotal moment in safeguarding our  communities and building a more resilient Nation.   Democrats are dedicating more money to FEMA to empower communities  nationwide to proactively reduce the vulnerability to floods,  hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, extreme heat, and other climate- induced hazards. These are real.   As it was said earlier, what a shame that some would suggest it isn't  real, that it is a hoax. Ask the people throughout America if they  believe it is a hoax.   Louisiana received funds through both grant programs. Specifically,  we had 55 projects selected totaling $207 million statewide, and my  district alone receiving $96.5 million. These dollars reflect  recognition of the growing threats posed by climate change and a  commitment to addressing these issues head-on.   The benefits of these programs are happening all over Region 7  through FMA and BRIC grants.   Flood Mitigation Assistance Grants were awarded to: Alabama, $27,500;  Mississippi, $2.4 million; North Carolina, $7.6 million; South  Carolina, $1.2 million.   BRIC grants were awarded to: Mississippi, $315,000; North Carolina,  $163 million; South Carolina, $40.7 million.   These investments in Region 7 are being used for projects like:  Installing standalone emergency generators to be used in power failures  affecting some 30,308 folks in Mississippi; protecting North Carolina's  water supply, a Justice40 Project, and alleviating repetitive flood  loss to critical lifeline utilities and emergency support services; and  ensuring a South Carolina water treatment plant supply during flooding  events.                                time  1915    Millions of Americans bear the brunt of climate change's impact every  year. Whether through drought, extreme heat, wildfires, or floods,  Louisiana knows the truth better than anybody else. These projects are  not just infrastructure; they are lifelines that strengthen the fabric  of our community.   We know that these are real. We know that it is making a difference.  Democrats have been fighting for these issues and providing not just  talk but real action. The cost of war has been real, and we have seen  it in every way.   The Honoring our PACT Act addresses the full scope of issues  affecting toxic-exposed veterans' access to VA care and benefits while  reforming VA's presumptive decisionmaking process. It will expand VA's  healthcare eligibility for over 3.5 million veterans exposed to burn  pits and establish a presumption of service in connection for over 23  respiratory illnesses and cancers. It would eliminate the requirement  that veterans prove exposure to toxic substances, a requirement that  has often prevented many from accessing the care and benefits they  earned and deserve.   This comprehensive bill expands access to care and benefits to the  veterans who were exposed as they selflessly served our country. It  also expands benefits to their loved ones and surviving family members.   I have joined my colleagues in widely promoting the benefits of this  bill and encouraging veterans to apply. One year after its passage,  more than 800,000 claims and counting have already been filed.   Veterans deserve more than a hollow thank-you for their service. They  deserve action. Democrats are making good on our promise to care for  all veterans exposed to toxic substances.   In Region 7 alone, we have 2.6 million veterans. This includes:  Louisiana, 279,000; Alabama, 359,000; Arkansas, 211,000; Mississippi,  187,000; Tennessee, 453,000; North Carolina, 703,000; Puerto Rico,  81,000; South Carolina, 393,000.   Most importantly, we thank the families of veterans who tragically  lost their lives because of being exposed to toxic substances during  their time of service for their sacrifices.   Tonight, we are celebrating this historic achievement of the 117th  Congress. We are seeing lives changed in real time. Democrats will keep  fighting to make life better for all Americans, regardless of race,  background, socioeconomic status.   Again, I am proud to be the representative for Region 7 on the  Regional Leadership Council. We are working for you, and we aren't  nearly done.
