 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Madam Chair, this is an ideologically driven solution in search of a  problem. The U.S. oil and gas system represents only 3\1/2\ percent of  overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions. You ask yourself: If that is  the case, if over 96 percent of the problem is elsewhere, why wouldn't  we focus on that? It is ideological, that is why.   The temperature impact of this emissions reduction is miniscule, at a  mere .0047 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, and, of course, that is a  model and that is predicted. No one really knows for sure. But we can  know this for sure: it is miniscule.   EPA's own research shows that combined oil and gas methane emissions  have fallen 19 percent since 1990. During the same period, natural gas  production has risen 52 percent and oil production has increased 28  percent.   The cost of this unnecessary regulation will be $530 million per year  by 2025, again, to get .0047 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. 322,000  Pennsylvanians' jobs are supported by the oil and gas industry, and we  can't afford it.
