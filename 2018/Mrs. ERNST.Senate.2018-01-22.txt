 Mr. President, I rise today to urge Senate Democratic  leadership to end their reckless government shutdown.   It is no secret that over the years I have made clear that I don't  like funding our Federal Government from one shortsighted, bandaid bill  to another. We must establish a path forward to responsibly fund our  government for the long term. It is the responsible and right thing to  do for our military, for future generations, for our veterans, and for  the American people.   But rather than finding a long-term funding solution to ensure  stability in our military, the Senate Democratic leadership has decided  to shut down the government. What does that mean for our military?  Well, for starters, critical defense projects have come to a halt. We  could also see delays in maintenance of our critical aircraft, ships,  and weapons systems at a time when our adversaries are becoming more  aggressive and more advanced. Our servicemembers, who put their lives  on the line every day for our country, don't know when they will  receive a paycheck.   I have an adviser right now who is deployed to the Middle East. I  received an email from him this morning. He said: It is really hard for  all of us here knowing that our government is shut down. But every day  it is the same for us here in Afghanistan. We will do what we need to  do.   God bless him for that.   Iowa National Guardsmen are deployed overseas right now. One of my  former units, the 248th Aviation Support Battalion, is spread out  through the Middle East, doing their mission while we struggle to find  a way forward for them here in Washington, DC.   Military schools have been canceled. I spoke to an Active-Duty Army  officer this morning. She was scheduled for her precommand course this  weekend, and her orders were canceled. She told me: I will not be able  to go to that precommand course before I deploy. She will head overseas  not having had a vital course to instruct her on leadership in the  military. The likelihood of her picking up that course again in the  future is near zero--near zero.   Additionally, having served as a battalion commander in the Iowa Army  National Guard during our last government shutdown, I can tell you that  these shutdowns have a significant impact on our National Guardsmen. A  shutdown prohibits our citizen soldiers from participating in drill and  training exercises essential to our military readiness.   Our public affairs officer sent out this notice this morning from the  Iowa National Guard. The headline:         IOWA NATIONAL GUARD FEELS EFFECTS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       SHUTDOWN        More than 1,000 full-time federal technicians furloughed    That is in Iowa alone. ``Approximately 400 personnel sent home from  weekend training.'' That is just Iowa.   And 110,000 National Guardsmen were affected after this last weekend  because of the shutdown. Should these men and women be called to defend  our Nation in the face of danger, it is critical that they are properly  prepared, and a government shutdown does not allow this. During the  time that the government shutdown goes on, we are not able to maintain  our equipment; that hurts our readiness. Our personnel can't do their  wellness and medical checks; that hurts our readiness. Our military  members can't get to their schools for advancement in their careers;  that hurts our readiness. And once those orders to schools have been  canceled, you can't just pick up on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday  and say: OK, I am going to school now. There are only so many slots  allocated, and if you miss that training period, you may be waiting  months, perhaps even a year, in the National Guard to pick up those  schools.   During a shutdown, our folks are furloughed. Depending on how long  the government is shut down, our citizen soldiers might not receive  enough training days to be adequately prepared for duty. This could  also mean that their time serving throughout the year might not be  included in their total years of service, potentially further  jeopardizing their benefits and pay.   What a lot of folks here who haven't served in the military--the  Reserves, Guard, or Active Duty--don't understand is that in the  Reserves and Guard you have to meet so many points in a year for that  to be considered a good retirement year. If you fall a few days short  of that, the entire year does not count toward your retirement. The  entire year does not count toward your retirement.   Despite their rhetoric otherwise, Senate Democrats are turning their  backs on our men and women in uniform by putting our military's  resources and readiness in jeopardy. It is inexcusable.   Additionally, the legislation the Senate voted on Friday night would  have reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance Program for 6 years-- 6 years--providing approximately 80,000 Iowa children with access to  important healthcare services, especially in the rural and underserved  areas.   Unfortunately, Senate Democratic leadership is playing political  games and has opposed our efforts to ensure this critical funding is in  place for children in Iowa and across the country. Instead, the Senate  Democratic leadership's shutdown hurts Iowa's low-income children, puts  rural and underserved areas at a major disadvantage, and disrupts  States' abilities to ensure sound financial planning for their  healthcare programs.   Folks, the reality is, this shutdown happened because Democratic  leadership didn't get everything they wanted in this funding bill. They  didn't get everything they wanted. As a result, they decided to hold  hostage our military, our military's readiness, our children's  healthcare, and our government.   You see, the Senate Democrats who chose to play politics also set  arbitrary--arbitrary--deadlines regarding Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, also known as DACA. I, too, want to ensure that Congress  finds a solution for DACA recipients. We have many, many recipients in  Iowa. Many of my colleagues want to see resolution on this as well.   America is a nation of immigrants, and our diversity truly is our  strength. It is incredibly important that we find a fix for DACA  recipients, as they are so important to the fabric of our communities  and to our future.   Many young, undocumented children were brought here truly through no  fault of their own. Congress has been and must continue to work  together to identify and pursue a measured approach that addresses DACA  recipients' unique situation and also respects the importance of our  immigration laws, keeps our borders secure, and discourages future  illegal immigration.   There is still time to achieve a solution. There is still time. But  holding the government hostage and stalling important discussions on  DACA really is nonsensical.   Some of my Democratic colleagues are starting to show a willingness  to work through these issues and reopen the government, and I am asking  them  [[Page S431]]  to vote yes for funding our government so that we can move ahead. But  the decision to remain shut down lies solely with the Democratic  leadership here in the Senate.   So today, I am calling on Senate Democratic leaders to put their  reckless games aside and start working with us on a path forward to  fund the government, ensure that low-income children have access to  healthcare, provide the resources our military needs, and find a  solution for our DACA recipients.   I am asking my Senate colleagues--those whom I have spoken with on  both sides of the aisle--to join us in a ``yes'' vote today at noon or  shortly thereafter so that we can find solutions.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
