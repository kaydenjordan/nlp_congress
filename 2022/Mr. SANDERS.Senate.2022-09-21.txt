 Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the  state of democracy, both in terms of the upcoming election in Brazil as  well as here in the United States.   It is no great secret that, today, democracies around the world are  under great threat from rightwing extremism. That obviously includes  our own, as we all saw tragically on January 6, 2021, when there was an  attack on this very building by those seeking to overturn our  Presidential election.   One of the countries where democracy is now under threat is Brazil,  the largest nation in Latin America and one of the largest democratic  countries in the world. On October 2, less than 2 weeks from now,  Brazil will hold its Presidential election. According to many polls, it  appears that the two major candidates in that election are President  Jair Bolsonaro and former President Lula da Silva. If no candidate in  that election receives over 50 percent of the vote, there will be a  runoff election between the top two candidates on October 30.   Mr. President, over the past many months, Brazilians from all sectors  of society have publicly expressed serious concerns about ongoing  efforts in that country to undermine democracy, including close to 1  million Brazilians who signed an open letter released on July 26, 2022,  defending the democratic institutions of Brazil and the rule of law.   And there is, in fact, a very good reason as to why the people in  Brazil are concerned about their democracy, and that is that the  current President and candidate for reelection, Jair Bolsonaro, has  made some very provocative statements which suggest that he might not  accept the election results if he loses. In other words, Bolsonaro  might attempt to destroy Brazilian democracy and remain in power no  matter what the people of Brazil determine in a free and democratic  election.   Here are just a few examples of what Mr. Bolsonaro has said over the  years.   Back in September 2018, before he won his election, Bolsonaro stated:         I will not accept an election result that is not my own       victory.    On September 7, 2021, as reported by the Financial Times, Bolsonaro  stated:         There are those who think they can take me from the       presidency with the mark of a pen. Well, I say to everyone I       have only three possible fates: Arrest, death or victory. And       tell the bastards I'll never be arrested. Only God can take       me from the presidency.    According to Human Rights Watch, previously, President Bolsonaro had  claimed, without providing any evidence, that the last two Presidential  elections were fraudulent, including his own election, in which he  claimed he got more votes than the final tally showed.   But it is not just Bolsonaro's words that should be of concern to  those of us who still believe in democracy. According to a recent  survey by the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  is experiencing a 335-percent increase in violence directed against  political leaders in 2022 relative to 2019.   Mr. President, it is obviously not the business of the United States  to determine who the next President of Brazil is or to get involved in  Brazil's Presidential elections in any way. That is a decision to be  made solely by the people of Brazil through a fair and free election.  But it is the business of the United States to make clear to the people  of Brazil that our government will not recognize or support a  government that comes to power through a military coup or the  undermining of a democratic election. That is our business.   In that regard, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support a  resolution  [[Page S4909]]  that I have introduced with Senator Kaine, S. Res. 753. And Senator  Kaine, of course, is the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations  Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and that is also cosponsored by  Senators Leahy, Merkley, Blumenthal, and Warren.   This resolution is very simple and straightforward. It does not take  sides in Brazil's election, obviously, and that would be unacceptable.  But what it does do is express the sense of the U.S. Senate that the  U.S. Government will make it unequivocally clear that the continuing  relationship of the United States and Brazil depends upon the  commitment of the government of Brazil to democracy and human rights.   This resolution urges the Biden administration to make clear that the  United States will not support any government that comes to power in  Brazil through undemocratic means and to ensure U.S. security  assistance to Brazil remains compliant with our laws related to the  peaceful and democratic transition of power--in other words, no  military aid to a military coup in Brazil.   This does not seem to be a complicated or, in my view, controversial  piece of legislation. Yet--and I say this with a great deal of sadness,  and maybe it tells us the state of democracy in the United States--we  have not been able to get one single Republican to cosponsor this very  simple, straightforward resolution.   Why is that? And the answer is, I would love for my Republican  colleagues to explain to me why they cannot support and add their names  to a resolution that simply supports Brazil's democracy and the  peaceful transfer of power. Obviously, it would be most effective if  this resolution had bipartisan support, and I hope that it will.   Mr. President, in my view, it is imperative that the U.S. Senate make  it clear through this resolution that we support democracy in Brazil.  It would be unacceptable to the United States to recognize a government  that came to power undemocratically; and, if we did that, it would send  a horrific message to the entire world. So it is important for the  people of Brazil to know that we are on their side.   We are on the side of democracy, and that is what this resolution is  about. I ask my colleagues, in a bipartisan way, to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 1056 and  1060; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 452, H.R. 6899.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, September 22; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume the motion to proceed to Calendar  No. 484, S. 4822, with the provisions of the previous order in effect;  further, that if cloture is not invoked, the Senate proceed to  executive session to vote on confirmation of the Bennett nomination;  that upon disposition of the Bennett nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the Prabhakar nomination and at 1:45 p.m. vote on  confirmation of the nomination; finally, that if any nominations are  confirmed during Thursday's session, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of the Senate, there will be two  rollcall votes at 11:30 a.m. and one rollcall vote at 1:45 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:33 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, September 22, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
