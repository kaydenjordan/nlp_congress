 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, as the Senate knows--and I suspect a lot  of people outside of the Chamber know--we will move forward on the  healthcare reform effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare very soon. A  bill will be released as early as tomorrow morning, representing a  discussion draft.   I think it is important to remind all of our colleagues of the  urgency that we face. We already know that insurance premiums have gone  up since 2013 alone for those in the individual market--those would be  individuals with small businesses--by 105 percent. This is 2013. Can  you imagine in 2013 paying a premium only to realize that over the next  4 years, it would quadruple in just a short period of time?   Most Americans can't absorb that additional cost. We know that many  people are struggling from the high cost and the lack of quality of  care and the choices available to them.   Again, on the cost issue, when ObamaCare was being sold to the  American people, I still remember President Obama saying that the  average family of four would see a decrease in their premiums of  $2,500. I think the correct figure is based on experience. They have  seen their premiums go up $3,000.   I shared a story last week about a small business owner in Texas who  had lost his healthcare. He lost his doctor, and yet he had to pay  astronomically more for what ends up to be less coverage. I would say  he is only one person who I have heard from. I have heard from many,  many more under similar circumstances.   Even those who receive their healthcare from their employer are  feeling trapped by ObamaCare. I had a constituent, for example, from  Needville, TX, and his story, yet again, is all too familiar. After his  employer renewed their healthcare plan, premiums rose 50 percent, and  his current doctors refused to accept his plan from the ObamaCare  marketplace. While his healthcare costs rose, of course, his salary did  not follow suit.   He has been forced to dramatically cut back on his standard of living  and is living from paycheck to paycheck. In his letter, he said he is  worried about being able to provide for his family. Can you imagine  what that must be like? And not thinking of himself, but what this  means for his coworkers, as well, and his community.   This is one of the endless stories that my constituents have sent me  over the past few years, and I know Texas isn't alone, which causes me  to wonder who our colleagues are listening to or not listening to in  their States.   I mentioned yesterday that I had one colleague, whose name I won't  mention out of respect for his confidential communication--this is a  Democratic Senator--who has a son who has seen his insurance premiums  go up to $7,500. Sorry, that is the deductible. But his premium has  gone up $5,000. He told me that his son's out-of-pocket costs for  healthcare was $12,500 a year.   That is another casualty of ObamaCare. Yet, when we are looking  around to see how many Democrats are willing to join us to come to the  rescue of people who are being hurt by the destruction of the  healthcare markets, we see no one raising their hand or coming forward.   For our Democratic friends to attack us for trying to fix the havoc  that they wreaked in our healthcare system is really ridiculous. Our  friends on the other side of the aisle had their chance. They passed  ObamaCare by a party-line vote. In the interim, it demonstrated that  this is an experiment in big government and massive spending that has  simply failed.   Our friends on the other side know that. They also realize that,  regardless of who won the election in November, we would be moving  towards a new, better healthcare alternative, but they are simply  unwilling to participate and are sitting on their hands and waiting.  Indeed, they are hoping that we will fail in our efforts to save many  Americans--millions of Americans--from a healthcare system they were  promised but one that was not delivered.   Instead of working with us, they effectively are throwing what could  only be called a temper tantrum. They are trying to shut down any  productive activity in the Senate, including bipartisan committee work.   I was in three committee hearings this morning, one involving the  Intelligence Committee and our investigation into Russian active  measures involving the 2016 election. I was in another important  Finance Committee hearing where we talked about the importance of  modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and then  another one in the Judiciary Committee, where we talked about the  influx of dangerous gangs into the United States, including MS-13, from  Central American countries. Yet our Democratic colleagues are so bent  out of shape over the healthcare debate that they are willing to shut  down legitimate bipartisan concerns for each of those issues by not  letting our committees operate as they should.    Here is the rub. If they actually had a better plan, we would be more  than happy to listen. We would be more than happy to work with them.  But the only thing they have offered has been offered by the Senator  from Vermont--one of their Presidential candidates--Mr. Sanders, who  said that what he wants is nothing less than a complete Federal  Government takeover of healthcare, the so-called single-payer system.  That would wipe out all private insurance, and you would be looking to  the government for all of your healthcare.   We know that hasn't worked particularly well in places like Canada  and England and elsewhere. We also know that it is completely  unaffordable. The Urban Institute, which did a study of Senator  Sanders' single-payer healthcare system, said that just in 2017 alone,  it would add more than a half trillion dollars to Federal spending, and  it would add trillions and trillions of dollars more over ensuing  years. This isn't a solution. This is creating a bigger problem.   Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have let the far left  faction of  [[Page S3668]]  their own conference hold them hostage to pushing for a single-payer  system that would make ObamaCare look like a wild and resounding  success.   As I said, we need only look to our neighbors to the north, who under  a single-payer system have their healthcare decisions decided for them  by the government, while they see their taxes go up every single day.   Canada is marketed as an affordable outcome, but only if your  procedure is deemed necessary by the government. In other words, if the  government doesn't think the procedure you need is necessary, good luck  with that.   Would you want somebody in the government making your medical  decisions for you or your family without considering your individual  medical history? I certainly wouldn't. Under a single-payer system,  this could lead to many families having to buy supplemental health  insurance on top of the taxes they have already paid or simply pay  cash, rewarding high-income individuals with a better level of  healthcare above that offered to the rank-and-file citizens under a  government program.   Single-payer systems are not a solution, certainly not in this  country. Not only is choice and cost threatened under a single-payer  system, but so is quality of care.   Just last year in Canada, it took an average of 20 weeks for patients  to receive medical care that was deemed necessary--the longest recorded  wait time since wait times began to be tracked. One report estimated  the Canadians are waiting for nearly 1 million healthcare procedures.   Can you imagine having to wait up to 38 weeks for some medical  procedure, the whole time worrying about your health or the health of  your loved one?   Single-payer is a costly, inefficient, and unfeasible option, and,  perhaps because of that, we are not hearing many people on the floor  stating what I believe to be the case, which is that it is the only  choice being offered by our friends across the aisle. They are not  willing to come here and debate the merits of what we are proposing,  which is a market-driven, individual-choice system, which is designed  to keep premiums down in a way that makes it more affordable. They are  not willing to debate that and a government takeover known as a single- payer option with all of its assorted problems.   The reforms we are seeking are patient-centered and market-driven.  These are the sorts of things that many of our colleagues across the  aisle said they would like to see as well, but they have somehow fallen  in line with part of their political base, which makes it impossible  for them to have an open, rational discussion about the merits of each  proposal.   We are left with no option but to finalize our discussion draft and  introduce that tomorrow so that the world can see it and so it can be  put on the internet, so we can have a fulsome debate and we can have  unlimited amendments in the so-called vote-arama process, which I know  is very popular around here. We will vote dozens of times or more on  proposed amendments to the bill. That is the kind of transparency and  openness that I think are important when you are dealing with something  as important as healthcare.   Here are the goals of what we are going to propose tomorrow in this  discussion draft.   First, we need to stabilize the markets that have left millions in  the country with no choices when it comes to insurance providers. Under  ObamaCare, insurance markets have collapsed. In Texas, one-third of  Texas counties have only one option for health insurance, which is no  choice whatsoever. Of course, in addition to threatening competition,  it also lowers quality while doing nothing about rising costs.    Second, we have to address the ballooning price of ObamaCare premium  increases. I mentioned, just in the ObamaCare exchanges since 2013,  they have gone up 105 percent. If we do nothing about it, they are  going to go up by double digits again next year, so doing nothing is  not an option. Again, without competition, there is no room for these  prices to go anywhere but up, and we have to come to the rescue of the  millions of Americans who are simply being priced out of the health  insurance market.   Third, something our Democratic colleagues have repeatedly called for  is that we have to protect people with preexisting conditions. If we  want our healthcare system to work, we must be able to provide  coverage, particularly for preexisting conditions, for all Americans.  We will do that in the discussion draft proposed tomorrow.   Lastly, I believe we need to give the States greater flexibility when  providing for the low-income safety net known as Medicaid, in a way  that is more cost-efficient and effective. For example, in my State, we  have asked for a waiver in order to provide managed care for people on  Medicaid. More than 90 percent are on managed care, which means if you  have a chronic illness--if you have a particularly complicated medical  problem--you have a medical home and somebody keeping track of your  treatment, making sure you get the treatment you need and are entitled  to.   Now we have the opportunity to make Medicaid a sustainable program.  We know that it is not, as currently written. What we are proposing is  to spend more money each year on Medicaid but to do so at a cost-of- living index that will be affordable and sustainable by the American  taxpayer. We have the opportunity to address the quality issues and  redtape issues and provide this important entitlement to make sure that  it remains on a stable path.   The American people have made clear, time and again, that the status  quo of ObamaCare is not working. All you have to do is look around.  There were 60 Democratic Senators in 2010 who voted for ObamaCare. They  were in the majority--a big majority. How many are there today? Well,  there are not 60 anymore. They have gone from the majority to the  minority, I believe, in large part because of the unfulfilled promises  of ObamaCare.   I encourage our colleagues across the aisle--indeed, I encourage all  of us to listen to the stories from our constituents. There are too  many families asking us to step up and come to their aid. We need to do  more than just give floor speeches or loft impossible single-payer  options, which simply won't work. We need to actually deliver on the  promises we made to deliver healthcare reform and to do so to the best  of our ability.   I am under no illusion that this will be perfect. Indeed, when you  are operating under the constraints of the budget rules, with Democrats  taking a walk and sitting on their hands, it is impossible for us to  come up with the best possible product we could under the  circumstances. But I dare say, it will be better than the status quo,  which is a meltdown in the insurance markets, and we will take large  steps forward in not only stabilizing the markets but bringing premiums  down, while assuring coverage for preexisting conditions and putting  Medicaid on a sustainable path forward.   We invite our Democrat colleagues to join us, if they will. But under  present circumstances, it doesn't look as though they plan to do so.    Mr. President, if I could take 30 seconds more--because  my colleague from Louisiana is here--I, frankly, think the objection to  nine committees meeting in the Senate is indefensible. I mentioned the  three committee hearings we had this morning, but they are just an  indicator of important issues, such as the investigation by the  Intelligence Committee of Russian involvement in our election; the  Judiciary Committee looking into  [[Page S3669]]  the role of MS-13, one of the most dangerous and violent street gangs  in America, with about 10,000 gang members present in the United  States. We are looking at things like trade and the importance of  modernizing NAFTA and the 5 million jobs that binational trade supports  with Mexico or the 8 million jobs with Canada.   For our Democratic colleagues to object to our being able to meet in  committees because of their pique over healthcare--which they have  voluntarily taken themselves out of--is just beyond indefensible. I  hope the American people realize exactly what they are doing. This is  the temper tantrum I talked about a moment ago. This is not about  having an open and honest debate and trying to solve a problem that,  frankly, is not just our problem; it is a problem for all Americans. We  ought to do better than that. We ought to hold ourselves to a higher  standard than that. But this is the kind of temper tantrum,  unfortunately, you get when a political party is not willing to  participate in the debate and where they have no ideas that are  actually workable, other than a single-payer system that will bankrupt  the country and will fail to deliver quality healthcare to all our  citizens.
