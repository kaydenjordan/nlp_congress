 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3763) to direct the Secretary of State to provide assistance and  technical expertise to enhance the representation and leadership of the  United States at international standards-setting bodies that set  standards for 5th and future generations mobile telecommunications  systems and infrastructure, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3763.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking our ranking member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. McCaul  [[Page H31]]  of Texas, for his hard work on the bills that we are considering.   Mr. Speaker, in the years ahead, 5G will revolutionize the way we use  technology. From transportation to healthcare to entertainment, the way  people interact with wireless internet devices will change  dramatically. As it does, there will be massive economic benefits, but  only if we are able to take advantage of them. There will also be risks  as people become more dependent on wireless communications and generate  even more data about themselves and how they live their lives.   Mr. Speaker, 5G will bring with it substantial national security,  cybersecurity, and privacy challenges. Massive networks in the United  States and allied countries could become vulnerable to spying eyes and  cyberattacks. That is why there is near universal agreement on both  sides of the aisle that American leadership will be essential as we  transition to 5G technology, both to seize on the opportunities and  guard against the risks.   We have four bills on the floor today that address the future  expansion of 5G telecommunications systems across the United States and  around the world. These bills will protect American consumers,  strengthen our national security and that of our allies, and help make  sure the United States is taking all the steps necessary to pave the  way for a 5G future that enhances our lives, brings us closer together,  and protects against anyone who wants to exploit this technology for  harm.   The bill before us, the Promoting United States International  Leadership in 5G Act, will help chart that path forward. This  legislation requires the development of a strategy to promote American  leadership at international standards-setting bodies for 5G. It directs  our agencies across the government to assess security risks posed by  China's engagement in this area, and it increases cooperation between  the U.S. and its allies and partners in identifying and countering  those risks.   It is an important start in what will be a massive undertaking for  our government and our private sector. I am pleased to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), and I ask unanimous consent  that she may control that time.
