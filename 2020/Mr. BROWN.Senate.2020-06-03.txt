 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following my  remarks, the senior Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.    Madam President, I note with some interest that one  Republican colleague after another comes to the floor--their ``protect  the President at all costs'' colleagues, no matter what he does, no  matter what he says, no matter how he acts, no matter how incompetent,  no matter how divisive--and continues to point their fingers at the  Chinese for the coronavirus. God knows, China deserves heaps of blame  for the outbreak in the early spread of the coronavirus. There is no  question they deserve a lot of blame for the outbreak in the early  spread, and they are lying about it. But keep in mind that we are 5  percent of the world's population, and 30 percent of the deaths from  the coronavirus have been Americans. This President continues to make  excuses and point fingers. And the compliant, always obedient,  sheeplike Members of the Republican caucus conference of the Senate  continue to stay quiet, continue to do nothing about this President's  behavior and the 105,000 deaths from coronavirus in this country.
