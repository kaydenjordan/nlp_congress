 Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the leadership many  California elected officials showed this week in coming to Washington,  D.C. and sitting down with President Trump to talk about the problems  and dangers as a result of actions taken by Sacramento Democrats in a  sanctuary State and what it has done for the State of California. I  commend them for bringing the truth and the clear danger this means for  our communities in the State of California, and across the country.   One of the leaders in my own district, District Attorney Stacey  Montgomery, as well as a friend of mine, Assemblywoman Melissa Mendez,  and many others, stepped forward to bring a strong message of how this  endangers Californians and sends the wrong signal to those who want to  immigrate properly to this country. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that  effort by those leaders.                            ____________________
