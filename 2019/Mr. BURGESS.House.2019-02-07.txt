 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for yielding.   Let me just say, I spent the last several hours in a hearing in the  Energy and Commerce Committee, a hearing called by the Democrats on the  Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. The hearing was evaluating  the failures of the Trump administration on the child separation  policy.   Let me just share with you some of the statements of the witnesses.  These were pediatricians. These were ACLU lawyers. Statements like the  Trump administration policy was intentionally hurtful, that it was an  incredibly difficult position that people were in, that parents have a  right to keep their children safe, and that this was nothing more than  government-sanctioned child endangerment.    Mr. Speaker, I want to share a story with you. Just like Mr. Walker,  I had a guest here at the State of the Union the other night when the  President was here. My guest was Chris from Keller, Texas, and he sat  up in the gallery right behind us here.   I met Chris probably a year and a half to 2 years ago. He came to see  me one day, brought in, actually, by his mother. His mother was  concerned because he had suffered an injustice in his life, and he was  upset, and he couldn't get over it. He just needed to talk to someone,  and a Member of Congress is the last person I can think of to talk to,  but maybe it can help.   So Chris told me his story. I practiced medicine for 25 years, and I  heard some sad stories. I have been in Congress for 15 years, and I  have heard some sad stories. But I will tell you, this was the saddest  story that I can recall ever having heard.   Chris was serving his country in Iraq. In fact, he was in Iraq in  2005 when they had the big election where everyone was going down the  road with an ink-stained thumb, and he helped make that happen. He  helped pull that off.   Chris continued his service in various forms and was in Iraq when he  got word that his wife was ill. His wife was, as it turns out, very,  very ill, and he had to come home. He cared for her for the last few  months of her life before she succumbed to breast cancer.                                time  1730    He said he made her a promise right at the end of that illness that  he would  [[Page H1435]]  always, always, always take care of their daughter. Now Chris is a  single dad. He has got an only child. The child was 12, 13 years old,  the light of his life. Everything in Chris's life was wrapped up in his  daughter.   His daughter came home one day and said she wanted to go spend the  night at a friend's house, and Chris said no.   She said: Please, Daddy, you never let me do anything. Please let me  go.   After multiple entreaties, Chris agreed. She could go over to this  friend's house and spend the night.   At some point during the evening, the girls went out to a convenience  store that was across the street. She drops her cellphone, goes back to  retrieve it, and she was hit by a car. There were a number of cars  coming down the street at that point. One was going faster than the  others. All of the other cars stopped, but the car that hit Chrishia  inflicted substantial injury upon her.   The driver of that vehicle did stop, and the police were called. The  driver of that vehicle was in the country without the benefit of  citizenship. So the driver of that car was taken down to the police  station. Drug and alcohol tests were administered. A search of the  records revealed a previous infraction with Customs and Border Patrol  or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He had come into the country  illegally before, so there was that. He had speeding tickets, and he  had been arrested for driving without a license. In fact, this time the  only citation that he received was driving without a license, and he  was released after 35 minutes.   Chris came in to see me several months later, literally at the end of  his rope. I will never forget as he told me this story and he looked at  me with tears in his eyes.   He said: Congressman, I put on the uniform of my country. I served my  country. I did my job. Mr. Congressman, if you had been doing your job,  my daughter would be here today.   I have to tell you, as I was walking Chris back to where he could get  a cab to his hotel after the State of the Union Address--we have  actually corresponded on a fairly regular basis, and he is a very  likeable individual--as we walked off the Hill to get to where he could  catch a cab beyond the Capitol Police barrier, he said: I really have  enjoyed meeting you, Congressman. You have been great to me.   I said: Chris, I would give anything if we had never met.   This is not a manufactured crisis. This is a real crisis affecting  our citizens and our constituents. The people on the panel today were  very concerned about the Trump administration's policy from last June.  But this is not a new deal. There has been a problem on our Texas  border, particularly in the lower Rio Grande sector for years. The  previous administration had problems. The Clinton administration had  problems. The Carter administration had problems. It is a difficult  problem, and it does need to be solved.   President Trump has outlined a reasonable approach that, yes,  includes sensors; yes, includes increased personnel; yes, includes all- weather roads in areas; and, yes, it does include a barrier. Without  that, there cannot be success in securing our southern border, and as a  consequence, our citizens cannot be safe and secure in their homes.   I thank the gentleman for providing the time tonight and leading this  hour.   I hope Chris does get some measure of peace eventually, but, clearly,  this is a problem that has affected a great many lives of people in our  districts. I think we each can find someone in our district who has  suffered from a similar loss.
