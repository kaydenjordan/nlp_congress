 Mr. Speaker, let's make no mistake about it. We are here  this morning solely because of a mistake. This is the blunder rule.  This is not the first big blunder in this bill, and indeed it certainly  won't be the last. We will be cleaning up this mess and the blunders in  this bill all of next year.   The only questions are: How many people will get hurt in the process?  How much money is lost to the United States Treasury because of the  many loopholes in this Swiss cheese-kind of a bill that they have  created? How many loopholes will deny revenue that eventually will come  out of the pockets of the middle class and will come out of the small  businesses of this country to make up for all these special interest  provisions that the lobbyists got added?                                time  1045    This is what happens when you run roughshod over the process, when  every member of the Trump administration lacks the intestinal  fortitude, the courage, to come and answer any questions about this  bill. That is what happened here. Americans need to understand that.   Trump is over there tweeting away. He is bragging about all the  wonderful things. But is he willing to send one official--even one--to  come before any committee of this Congress and respond to questions  about the many wrongs that are contained in this bill? Of course the  answer is absolutely no.   What about the businesses across America that are impacted by this  bill? What about the academic experts of all political points of view  who could come and respond and help perfect and avoid errors just like  this? They were all left out. There was not one minute of examination  from any objective source coming in and talking in a hearing to the  committee about this bill.   I am one of the conferees to adjust the differences between the House  and the Senate. My, was that a great honor, a great experience in the  new democracy that these Republicans are providing for America.   In that conference committee, the chairman of the committee refused  to entertain a single motion or a single amendment. But he told us not  to worry. After we adopt this conference report behind closed doors and  agree to it, you can look at it and can read it over the weekend before  you vote on it at the beginning of the next week. You just can't change  it in any way. You cannot study it in any way. You cannot share it with  anybody in any way because we are only interested in sharing it with  those lobbyists with whom we have special connections and operate in  secrecy behind closed doors.   Of course, one of the many sad things about this particular bill is  that it lost its name in the Senate in what we are considering this  morning.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    In fact, if you turn to the bill, which is a big old  thick stack, you see it says ``short title, et cetera,'' and it stops.  It is nameless at this point. It is a bill that has no name. And, of  course, it has no heart.   But what is the solution to that? Well, every time Donald Trump  touches a tower, he puts his name in bold letters across it: Trump  Tower. This is the only accomplishment that President Trump can point  to this year.   Why don't we put his name on this bill? We could call it the ``Donald  J. Trump Inequality Act,'' because it will do more than any legislation  we have considered here in recent years to widen the gap between those  at the very top and the rest of us.   Or we could call it the ``Donald J. Trump Family Windfall'' bill,  because he and his family are going to pocket an immense amount of  money. There is no surprise they are over there at the White House  celebrating all afternoon. He and his family personally will walk away  with a huge amount of resources out of this.   Or we could just call it ``Fat Cats Get Fatter,'' because one of our  colleagues on the Republican side who is closest, perhaps, to President  Trump admitted and said quite candidly: I can't go back to my donors if  we don't pass this legislation.   What a study in wise investment.   The Senate Budget Committee, last night, pointed out that Goldman  Sachs contributed over $26 million to Republicans since 1990. They get  about a $6 billion tax cut. Where can you get a return like that? Or  Pfizer, who contributed $15 million, they get a nearly $39 billion tax  cut.   Yes, this bill is a job creator. It creates more jobs for accountants  and tax lawyers than anyone can imagine because they will be going in  there trying to undo some of the things that were done and shape the  loopholes a little more favorably for their folks.   What we have here is a bill that is compared also with the other  issues that we have here.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman again has expired.    I know how much the gentlewoman cares about the future  of our children and the Children's Health Insurance Program.   I think of the Family Visiting program to help young parents. That is  in our committee.   I think about our crumbling roads and bridges and the fact that we  need dollars to invest in them to keep our transportation system  competitive.   They agree on all these measures. They make speeches about them. The  only thing is they don't want to put any money into them. They say we  can't afford to do that. If we don't steal Medicare premium money to  fund the Children's Health Insurance Program and use general revenue  dollars, that will drive up the debt. At the same time, they are  willing to drive the debt up trillions of dollars, they refuse to  invest in people, or invest in our children and provide them the  healthcare that they deserve.   In short, this is a Christmas gift to those at the very top--and  especially to the Trump family and his billionaire buddies and other  real estate moguls who gain in the conference report. They get the  Christmas gift. The American people, the middle class, get the gift  wrapping, and that is it.    Mr. Speaker, we are here solely because of Republican  blunders. Hardly the first blunder. Many more blunders will need  correcting from this trumped-up partisan bill.   If President Trump blunders into signing it today, it will trigger  $25 billion in Medicare cuts.   This sad bill is left without any name. Like other towers, this  towering monstrosity should be called ``Trump''-the ``Trump Inequality  Act,'' the ``Trump Family Enrichment Act,'' or perhaps just call it the  ``Whopper'' because it is a lie wrapped in lies.   The truth will eventually catch up with these lies.
