 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Homeland Security and the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged  from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 4708) to amend the  Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to issue Department of Homeland Security-wide guidance and  develop training programs as part of the Department of Homeland  Security Blue Campaign, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
