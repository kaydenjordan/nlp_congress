 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  local business in Orange, Massachusetts, Dean's Beans Organic Coffee  Company, as it embarks on an exciting change.   Its founder, Dean Cycon, is retiring after 30 years of leading this  people-focused business and turning the reins over to his employees.  That is right. To end a successful career in the coffee business, Dean  is giving control of the company to his employees who will share in its  management, operations, and, of course, its profits.   Dean's Beans already has a storied legacy, partnering closely with  their farmers, sourcing organic coffee, and paying a living wage.  Workers receive health insurance that covers premiums, copays, and  deductibles.   To many of us who know Dean, we are not surprised. He has led a  career proving that you can make money, do good, and treat people with  kindness, all while making a mean dark roast.   That is why I toast my good friend, Dean Cycon, and the entire team  at Dean's Beans.   Here is to new stories and adventures and great cups of coffee along  the way.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I light up the Republican Conference for an  absolutely awful process that made a series of offensive amendments in  order and blocked some very reasonable amendments, I want the record to  reflect that I have the deepest respect and affection for the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole). He always sounds reasonable, in part, because  he is a reasonable person. Unfortunately, he is surrounded by Members  who are not reasonable, who are not rational, and who are not fair.   Mr. Speaker, I return the compliment that he gave me. Dealing with  him is always an exercise in civility and there is mutual respect here.  I appreciate him. I appreciate the staff on both sides of the aisle who  were up until 2:30 in the morning last night as we were dealing with  this rule. I regret very much the process that has brought us to where  we are right now.   Mr. Speaker, for the second time this week the Rules Committee was  unexpectedly called back at 11 o'clock last night. We sat and waited  for over an hour for the meeting to actually get underway, all because  Republicans couldn't get their act together.   Republicans had to have yet another backroom meeting, another  midnight seance to resurrect this rule because a dozen or so far right,  MAGA wing nuts once again threw a fit and hijacked the bill when they  realized they weren't going to get a bill that was perfect to them.   It should go without saying, but it is outrageous that a tiny  minority of Republicans is getting to dictate exactly what amendments  come to the floor. It is outrageous that the Rules Committee last night  managed to mess up a bipartisan bill and put it on a path toward  becoming a hyperpartisan one by loading it up with every divisive  social issue under the Sun. Here is my word of wisdom to Republican  leadership: When you have a razor-thin margin in one-half of one branch  of government, you don't get your way on everything. Democracy means  compromise. Divided government means compromise. Compromise means you  don't get everything you want. There has to be a give and take.   I have to admit that I have never in all my time here experienced an  NDAA process as outrageously bad as this one. This bill passed out of  the House Armed Services Committee by a vote of 58-1. Let me repeat  that. It passed with a bipartisan vote of 58-1.   Looking at how extreme most of the Republican amendments are that  were made in order, I would be surprised if  [[Page H3497]]  this bill can even pass the House. I fear what this final bill is going  to look like because of the amendments they are making in order today.  This is honestly a disaster. I never ever want to hear lectures about  process ever again.   Mr. Speaker, when I was chairman, Democrats made in order over 650  amendments. Democrats made in order over half of all amendments  submitted because we believed in the radical idea that we ought to  actually do our job and debate things.   Republicans in this NDAA have made in order fewer than a quarter of  all the amendments submitted. In fact, despite a record number of  amendment submissions this year, they made in order fewer amendments  than every Democratic-led NDAA.    What is worse, these are the worst of the worst amendments. They  blocked dozens and dozens of commonsense ideas, but they paved the way  for the most radical amendments.   In the rule that we are considering today, they made in order 70  Republican amendments, 6 bipartisan amendments, and get this, drum  roll, please, 4 Democratic amendments.   Some of these amendments made in order were submitted minutes before  we held our markup. For all my Republican friends who rant and rave  about how important it is to provide enough time for members to read  and understand what they are voting on, we had minutes.   As I said, it is not just the number of amendments they are allowing  to come to the floor, it is the type of amendments.   The amendments this rule makes in order are so extreme that it will  be a wonder how Republicans will pass this bill if the amendments are  included in the final version.   We are all supportive of putting more amendments up for votes. That  is how this body should work. When Republicans block Democratic  amendment after Democratic amendment after Democratic amendment, and  then make in order dozens of the most extreme Republican proposals,  they are not trying in good faith to pass a bipartisan bill. They are  not being intellectually honest. They are merely serving up red meat to  the most extreme fringe of the Republican base in this country.   Mr. Speaker, let me give you an example. Many of us supported a  bipartisan amendment to allow an up or down vote on whether or not the  United States should transfer cluster bombs to other countries. I  personally do not think this country should be giving cluster munitions  to any country because they can harm civilians, and they do harm  civilians.   At the last second, our amendment was cut from the rule and replaced  by an amendment that would only prevent the transfer of cluster bombs  to Ukraine. That is really puzzling to me because when the Republican  chair of the Armed Services Committee came to testify, and the ranking  Democrat of the Armed Services Committee came to testify, I asked them  a specific question: whether or not they would allow this bipartisan  amendment banning cluster munitions to be made in order. Do you know  what they said? They had no problem with making it in order.   To have it all of a sudden removed is just puzzling to me. Why do we  have hearings--why do we solicit answers on basic questions like: Do  you think this would be a good thing to debate on? Are you okay  debating on this amendment?--if these hearings mean nothing?   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is being offered by Congresswoman  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been vocal in her opposition to  supporting Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. What is  this all about?   We want to prevent cluster munitions from going to any country,  Ukraine and other countries. Why the narrowing down of this amendment?  Why give this amendment to somebody who I don't believe cares about the  impact of cluster munitions but is only interested in undermining our  policy toward Ukraine?   Forgive our skepticism in thinking that this isn't really about  cluster bombs for the new amendment sponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I asked for both amendments to be made in order. I  thought that was a fair deal, right? Keep the amendment that we  originally had dealing with you can't send cluster bombs anywhere, and  you can keep the Marjorie Taylor Greene one. Let's have a debate on  both. Let's see where people are. I was told ``no.'' In fact, every  single Republican voted ``no.''   It is clear to me that this is about buying off Members of the MAGA  fringe. It is about appeasing a small group of radical, hard-right  Members, the MAGA circus I call them, a group that is extorting the  Speaker of the House and threatening to take down the bill, and maybe  threatening to take down his speakership if they don't get every single  thing that they want.   What they want is to load up the NDAA with every single divisive  social issue under the sun. The group that is pushing these amendments  is the so-called Freedom Caucus. I say so-called because they don't  care about freedom.   They are demanding amendments that threaten a woman's access to  abortion. They are demanding amendments that roll back LGBTQIA+ rights.  They are demanding amendments that undermine diversity, equity, and  inclusion efforts.   The Freedom Caucus doesn't care about freedom when it is a woman's  freedom to make their decisions about their own bodies or someone's  freedom to love who they want or be who they are, or people's freedom  to not get shot at school, a grocery store, or a mall.   America needs to understand who the Freedom Caucus is and what they  stand for. They do not care about your freedom. They care about their  own freedom. They care about their freedom to do whatever the hell they  want to do, the American people be damned. What an embarrassment. That  is who Kevin McCarthy has put in charge.   We are here debating social issues in a defense bill because the far  right, the MAGA fringe, the Freedom Caucus are obsessed with these  culture wars. They say Democrats are the ones injecting social issues  into the military, but make no mistake, they are the ones who are doing  that.   Kevin McCarthy has ceded control of this body to the most extreme  Members of his own Conference while hanging everyone else out to dry.  It is all so that he can hold on to his power. I almost feel bad for  our Republican colleagues who are closer to the center, if any of them  still exist. Kevin McCarthy may be the MAGA ringmaster, but it is clear  that the clowns have taken over the circus.   Mr. Speaker, so many of the amendments this rule makes in order are  simply offensive. They have the potential to really hurt people, and  they are destructive. I hope that all my colleagues are well-read on  what each does before they come to the floor over the next few days to  vote.    Mr. Speaker, I will be voting ``no'' on this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who is a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't even know where to begin. I will just say to the  gentleman that I actually do a lot of work on the issue of grandparents  raising grandchildren because some kids don't have moms and dads. Aunts  and uncles are raising their nieces and their nephews. So, I don't know  even know what that rant was about.   Mr. Speaker, this rule makes in order an amendment that prevents  implementing the unanimous recommendations made by the bipartisan base  renaming commission. The goal of the commission--for my colleagues to  be informed--was to ensure that our bases do not celebrate Confederate  officers who took up arms against the United States. That is right. The  amendment actually stops us from implementing unanimous recommendations  to rename bases named after Confederates, men who fought on the side of  slavery.   Contrast that with some of the amendments that my Republican  colleagues blocked last night. An amendment to provide veterans with  free mental health visits was blocked. An amendment to provide funding  to organizations to assist the transition of servicemembers back to  civilian life was blocked because it was too woke. On my amendment to  provide ride-sharing transportation for homeless veterans, they all  voted no.   All of them were blocked, but this Confederate base renaming  amendment was made in order. That is their priority, protecting the  good name of Confederates, literal traitors to the United States? This  is the big issue for the Republican Party on the NDAA.   I will say to the gentleman from Texas who was just shouting on the  floor that when he talks about this being a good process, again, in  this rule that we are considering right now and bringing to the floor  right now, there  [[Page H3499]]  are 70 Republican amendments, 6 bipartisan amendments, and 4 Democratic  amendments. How is that fair or reasonable under any measure?   I could go on and on about how awful some of the Republican  amendments are. Let me just highlight another one. Mr. Roy, a member of  the Rules Committee, submitted an amendment that says that we are not  allowed to teach people that any part of the Constitution has ever been  racist.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have to tell you that I was a history major in  college. Do I have to explain to people what the three-fifths  compromise was? When the Constitution was written, it counted enslaved  African Americans as three-fifths of a person, for God's sake. The  Constitution literally said that Black people weren't full people when  it was written.   Does the author of this amendment just want us to pretend like it  didn't happen?   I am someone who actually is proud that America has made progress  since then. I am proud of the work that so many have done to right  these wrongs. I find this attempt to diminish that progress and to  pretend as if there was never any racism in this country incredibly  offensive.   Slavery? Never happened.   Jim Crow? What is that? Racism doesn't exist.   Three-fifths compromise? Never heard of it.   This is all just so, so wrong.   For the record, it wasn't until the 14th Amendment passed in 1868  that the three-fifths compromise was explicitly repealed.   So, what is the point of this amendment? To imply that slavery didn't  happen? To imply that racism wasn't a problem? To rewrite history and  gloss over the three-fifths compromise?   There was a time when the racism of the Republican Party was more  subtle. Now, it is just out in the open. They might as well have made  in order an amendment to bring back the Confederacy.   I find it incredibly, incredibly disgusting that this was made in  order. This is wrong. It is racist. It is really offensive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, as I have said, this rule makes in order a  number of truly, truly offensive amendments.   You know what? If the majority wants to do that and put this  bipartisan bill at risk, that is their prerogative. It is, again, the  contrast between what they are prioritizing and what they are blocking  that astonishes me.   For example, the rule makes in order an amendment to restrict  servicewomen from accessing abortion care when 40 percent of Active  Duty servicewomen now serve in States that have banned or restricted  access to abortion.   These servicewomen are stationed based on the needs of our Nation and  not on personal preference and deserve access to crucial reproductive  healthcare services.   I look forward to voting ``no'' on that amendment, but an amendment I  won't have a chance to vote on is my amendment that calls for an annual  report to Congress on atrocity prevention and response in Sudan.   Why does this rule make room for a controversial amendment to prevent  abortion care, which might threaten the passage of this bill, by the  way, but it blocks dozens and dozens of noncontroversial amendments  like that one? What is wrong with a report on atrocity prevention?   I genuinely do not understand, Mr. Speaker. There is only one  explanation that I have, and that is that rational people are not  calling the shots here.   Mr. Speaker, rather than these culture wars designed to kind of  relive the Confederacy that some of my colleagues seem hell-bent on  doing, we ought to be talking about things that matter to the American  people. We ought to be talking about how we protect Social Security and  Medicare.   I am going to urge a ``no'' vote so that we can bring up an amendment  to get Members on record saying that they do want to protect Social  Security and Medicare.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question and to speak on this amendment.  [[Page H3500]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Vasquez).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman how many more  speakers he has on his side?    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, this process has shown us the priorities  of the Republican majority; protecting the reputation of confederate  leaders, banning books because they want to rewrite history,  controlling women's bodies.   Overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't enough. They want to ban abortion  nationwide. They want to restrict a servicemember's ability to get  travel expenses covered, attacking LGBTQ+ servicemembers, cutting off  aid to Ukraine in the middle of their fight against Putin, stifling  diversity and equity in the military, and shrugging off climate change,  which the Department of Defense says poses a direct threat to our  national security.   You can't make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker. The thing is, many  Republicans know that these amendments are offensive. They know these  plans and these ideas are unpopular. That is why there has been so much  whiplash the last few days to get this rule to the floor today.   What was not on their priority list in this bill? I will tell you  what was not on their priority list; reducing the NDAA top line, which  is far too high and wastes taxpayer dollars.   In the appropriations process, they are cutting moneys from WIC and  from Meals on Wheels, but they boost up the defense budget.   What is not on their list is helping our veterans with post-traumatic  stress disorder. They rejected an amendment on that yesterday in the  Rules Committee.   What is not on their list is protecting access to reproductive  healthcare or ensuring the ability for transgender individuals to serve  their country or encouraging diversity and equity in all military ranks  or preventing the transfer of cluster munitions to all countries.   That is not even to mention the dozens of noncontroversial Democratic  amendments that would simply authorize reports on our national defense.   This is ridiculous. Let me again remind everybody in this rule, there  are 70 Republican amendments, 6 bipartisan amendments, and 4 Democratic  amendments. On what planet is that even considered reasonably fair?  This is outrageous.   Again, a big chunk of the Democratic amendments, you may not agree  with them, but we ought to have 10 minutes  [[Page H3501]]  of debate and a vote up or down on them.    As they say, this is about getting ``woke'' out of the military. They  blocked my amendment to help homeless vets get rides to medical  appointments. What the hell is woke about that? They blocked it because  it was woke. I mean, I don't even know what they are thinking.   Look, if the extreme MAGA amendments pass and this NDAA bill passes  on a partisan vote, it should not be seen as a victory for Speaker  McCarthy.   Barely passing a bill that usually passes with a supermajority is not  a victory. I wish him luck in negotiations with the Senate where some  of these policies will be nonstarters.   The Speaker of the House needs to grow a spine, not for his own  reputation but for the good of this country. This is a terrible,  terrible process. These amendments are pathetic that have been made in  order. They are offensive. It disrespects and diminishes this  institution.   It is sad to see the small group of extremists calling the shots  here, but that is what is happening right now. They have turned this  defense bill into a place for them to launch their culture wars.   What a disservice to our country; what an insult to the Members of  this Chamber; what an insult to the men and women who serve our country  that these are the priorities that we are debating here today. I mean,  give me a break.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
