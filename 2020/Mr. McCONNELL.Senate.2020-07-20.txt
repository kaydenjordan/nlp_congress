 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Friday, the Nation lost a monumental  figure, someone who made huge personal sacrifices to help our Nation  move past the sin of racism and align more with the principles of our  founding.   John Lewis had secured his place among the giants of American history  before his career in Congress had even begun. From a sharecropper's  farm with no electricity or running water,   John Lewis rose to share  the stage with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a founding leader of the  mid-century civil rights movement. His unwavering example of nonviolent  resistance became a powerful rallying cry, swelling the ranks of  marches and sit-ins and commanding the attention of the Nation.   As a young student, John demonstrated wisdom beyond his years and  unimaginable patience and dignity in the face of harassment and brutal  assaults from the champions of segregation. From boycotts and sit-ins  to Bloody Sunday in Selma, he suffered, and suffered, and suffered. But  he kept working. He was unshaken in the belief that our Nation could do  better, and he was willing to pay for that progress with his own blood.   The cause of justice called John Lewis to the vanguard--from  organizing the lunch counter sit-ins that made Nashville the first  southern city to begin desegregating public places to leading the first  historic Freedom Riders across the South, to chairing the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee that helped mobilize a generation, to  addressing the March on Washington from the Lincoln Memorial. By the  time he turned 25, John had already lent his voice and his body to a  full lifetime's work. But he wasn't finished yet.   That same spirit of urgency followed him here to Washington. Whether  the day's issues found you on his side of the policy debate or on the  opposite side, his warmth, friendliness, and dedication to his  neighbors in Georgia's Fifth District made an impact on everyone.   I am reminded particularly of joining hands with him at a ceremony  here in the Capitol honoring his friend, Dr. King, in 2008. As Members  of Congress sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' it was humbling to reflect on  what the man standing next to me had suffered and sacrificed so that  those words could be sung, at such an occasion, in that place.  [[Page S4252]]    The memory of our colleague brings to mind Dr. King's own words. He  famously said: ``The arc of the moral universe is long, and it bends  toward justice.''   It would be a mistake to read those words and assume that he meant  this bending is inevitable. Our society has only marched toward justice  because great figures like Congressman   John Lewis took it upon  themselves to lead the way. The Nation mourns his passing, and we  celebrate the life of this American hero.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, it has  been half a year since the deadly coronavirus began to spread from  China throughout the world. Now, 3.7 million cases have been recorded  on American soil. More than 140,000 lives have been lost.   Today, our Nation stands at a challenging crossroads. States and  localities are trying to balance the need to reopen and foster economic  recovery with the need to stay on offense against the virus.   Back in March, the American people began a period of historic  disruption and heroic sacrifice in order to stunt the spread of the  virus. Life as we have known it was simply put on ice. Daily routines  were reinvented, not as a permanent solution but as a short-term  emergency measure to save our healthcare system.   The American people stepped up. The sacrifices saved lives. Nowhere  in the United States did hospitals suffer the fate of the medical  system in places like Italy.   Our Nation met new kinds of American heroes: doctors and nurses, who  worked double shifts, washed their hands raw, and endured physical  separation from their loved ones so they could continue to treat ours;  essential maintenance, delivery, and grocery store workers, who kept  clocking in to keep families, communities, and entire industries  supplied and functioning; teachers and parents, who tried their best to  keep school in session for our Nation's children, from virtual  classrooms and kitchen tables all across our country.   No generation before us had ever had to pull the emergency brake on  national life in quite this way. This historic challenge required  historic support so the Senate wrote and passed the largest rescue  package in history.   The CARES Act puts financial assistance in the pockets of American  families. It sent hundreds of billions of dollars so that employers  could keep paying workers. It mobilized unprecedented resources for the  medical response. Economists and experts across the spectrum agreed  that the Senate's bold, bipartisan policies have made a tremendous  difference these past months.   The question before the Senate this week is, Where are we now? Where  are we now? On the one hand, our healthcare fight against the virus  itself is very obviously unfinished. New spikes in large and  economically central States show that we are nowhere near out of the  woods. At the same time, neither economics nor our Nation's sanity  would sustain an indefinite total lockdown until there is a vaccine. So  even as we continue to fight the healthcare battle, cautious reopenings  will need to proceed in ways that are as smart, safe, and data-driven  as possible.   This is the situation facing the Senate as we discuss and consider  the possibility of another recovery package. It would neither be  another multitrillion-dollar bridge loan to make up for a totally  shutdown economy, nor an ordinary stimulus for a nation ready to get  back to normal. The need now lies somewhere in between.   We need to continue supporting our healthcare system and harbor no  delusion that this virus is behind us because it isn't, while also  taking strategic steps to help laid-off American workers get rehired  and American families get their kids back to school this fall.   That is why Senate Republicans will be putting forward a strong  starting point for additional recovery legislation, hopefully, as soon  as this week. It will take good-faith, bipartisan cooperation from our  Democratic colleagues to actually make a law. That productive spirit is  what got the CARES Act across the finish line unanimously, but last  month, that spirit was absent. A political determination from our  Democratic colleagues led them to block the JUSTICE Act and block the  Senate from even turning to the subject of police reform, even as  millions had taken to the streets demanding change.   So, for the sake of our Nation, if we want to continue helping the  American people, the next several weeks will need to look a lot more  like March and a lot less like June. Senate Republicans will put  forward our proposal soon. I hope our Democratic colleagues will be  ready to work together to get an outcome.   First, this week, the Senate will complete two other important pieces  of the people's business. First, we will confirm the President's choice  to head the Office of Management and Budget. Then we will finish and  pass the National Defense Authorization Act for the 60th consecutive  time.   As COVID-19 captured our Nation's attention, we knew our adversaries  around the world would not ease up. We knew that those who seek to harm  America, our interests, and our allies would use the commotion to show  even more of their true colors, and, sure enough, the Russian military  has flirted even closer to the boundaries of U.S. airspace. Iran has  stepped up its meddling in regional conflicts. China has escalated both  its international bullying and its domestic repression, such as in Hong  Kong.   So I am particularly encouraged that Chairman Inhofe, Ranking Member  Reed, and our committee colleagues put forward a robust, bipartisan  bill. It will invest in the training and technology that will keep our  fighting forces on the cutting edge. It will strengthen our alliances  and partnerships with shared systems for containing threats. It will  honor our servicemembers and their families with pay raises and top- notch services they deserve here at home. That means new investments in  5G systems and hypersonic weapons, the establishment of European and  Pacific defense initiatives for greater cooperation to check Russia and  China, and improving military family housing, education, and  healthcare.   This NDAA will build on the success of the last 3 years in rebuilding  and modernizing the world's greatest fighting forces. It will continue  to advance our new national defense strategy, putting aside the naive  resets of the past administration and continuing to invest in strength  instead.   I will be proud to vote to advance and pass the NDAA, and I hope all  of our colleagues will join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under provision of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:06 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 21, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
