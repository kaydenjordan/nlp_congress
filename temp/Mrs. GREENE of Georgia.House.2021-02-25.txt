 Madam Speaker, I would like to point out to  my Democrat colleagues that there is no Republican Member of Congress  that condones the attack on the Capitol on January 6.   I was also a victim in this Chamber when it happened, and we are very  offended at your constant attacks on us for claiming we had anything to  do with it. So that needs to stop.                      Equality Act Causes Discrimination     I would also like to address the entire 117th  Congress and say that the Equality Act is not about stopping  discrimination. It is about causing discrimination against women and  religious freedoms.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 25, 2021, on page H632, the following appeared:  EQUALITY ACT CAUSES DISCRIMINATION I would also like to address  the entire 117th Congress and say that the Equality Act is not  about stopping discrimination.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this conversation  tonight about cancel culture. I think it is one of the most relevant  topics that we should be discussing more, and I am really glad to talk  about this.   I think this past year we have seen more things canceled in our  American history than we have at any other time. In the past year,  starting with the virus, that has been politicized. I say that, I  believe that, along with millions and millions of Americans that  believe it.   We saw, starting with schools got canceled, business got canceled,  jobs got canceled, people had to stay home. Then things got further.  Sports were canceled, prom was canceled, graduation was canceled,  social life was canceled, vacations, movies, entertainment,  restaurants, and the list goes on and on. Basically, the ability to  pursue happiness in the United States of America got canceled due to  COVID-19 and the politicization of it because it was an election year.   I can't think of anything worse. I have been privileged to be a  business owner for almost two decades, and it has been a joy in my life  to be able to function as a business owner, to employ people, to do  business in the marketplace and have the freedom to do that. But over  the past year, many small businesses have been shut down, along with  many big businesses.   Dreams for people starting a business have been canceled. But even  more than that, the belief that conservative opinions and thoughts and  statements and just beliefs are being canceled and considered  dangerous.   The fact that millions and millions of Americans support President  Trump, still support President Trump, and are angered that he has been  canceled is unbelievable to me.   You see, America is the greatest country in the world, and I say it  over and over. We are all blessed to be Americans. We are blessed that  we are equal, and we should have equal voices. We are given that with  our First Amendment, with freedom of speech.   But today, it is not looked at that way. People that support  President Trump are considered to be possibly domestic terrorists. How  can that be?  [[Page H708]]  You see, we don't look at America that way. We don't look at people  that we disagree with politically that way, not at all.   President Trump was canceled on Twitter. I understand what that is  like. I have been suspended multiple times on Twitter. I have been in  Facebook jail multiple times for stating my opinions, things I think  and feel. It shouldn't be that way, where people are canceled by  companies.   We are moving in an era of corporate communism to where corporations  and businesses can force their views and political opinions, and force  it on their customers. That is absolutely wrong. It should not be  happening. But that is where we are today.   Where do we go from here? Today, we saw my Democrat colleagues here  in Congress cancel gender. This is not up for debate, and it should not  be shocking for us to say there is only male and female. That is not a  shocking statement. It is science. There are only two sets of  chromosomes. They also canceled women's rights, religious freedom, and  the ability for little girls to have privacy in the bathroom.   This cancel culture has gone too far, and we have to change that. The  media is addicting America to hate, and the media is addicting people  to the idea that they can cancel out someone's opinion that they don't  agree with.    Mr. Roy, would you like to elaborate on that?    Yes.    Thank you, Mr. Roy. I really appreciate that.  Yes, being canceled in Congress after 35 days, being stripped of my  committee membership, is not something that I ever expected, and I  think it is completely wrong.   Statements and things that I had said that I addressed here and with  my colleagues that happened before I even campaigned for Congress,  certainly not anything I did as a Member of Congress, but that  cancelation is taken to an extreme, and it should not happen.   Then the fact that we did object to electoral college votes, that is  something we are able to do. You disagreed with us, and here we are,  having a perfectly great conversation. I wish we could have the same  type of conversation with our Democrat colleagues because they have,  indeed, objected to electoral college votes in the past, I think, every  Presidential election for the past 20 years or so. Thank you for  reminding me that, and thank you for setting this up tonight.
