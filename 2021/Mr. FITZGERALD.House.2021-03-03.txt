 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R.  1280 and defunding the police.   When vandalism and violence plagued cities across the country last  summer, our law enforcement officers were the thin blue line protecting  us. The violence reached communities from New York City to Portland. It  even hit places in my district, and we saw our local law enforcement  act heroically.   Unfortunately, as both the son and father of law enforcement  officials, this bill is a step in the wrong direction. The bill  substantially reduces due process for police officers, restricts access  to needed equipment, and makes it more difficult to get critical  funding.   Our law enforcement officers need more funding, not less. More  funding will help our officers get additional training to deescalate  conflicts and get more equipment to keep all parties safe. Instead of  focusing on how we can help the police build trust in the communities,  this bill focuses on how we can take from the police.    Clearly, the bill is designed to satisfy those that seek to defund  and dismantle the police. None of this bill serves to build trust  between law enforcement and their communities. Like every occupation,  law enforcement has bad apples that must be held accountable.
