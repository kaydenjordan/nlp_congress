 Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the  bill on the floor before us, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017.   Over the last 8 years, it has been clear that our country has been on  the wrong path. Through overregulation and government bureaucracy, the  chance at the American Dream has seemed to be slipping away and  unreachable for far too many Americans. In November, the American  people spoke and made it clear: it is time to change course and reform  the rulemaking process to energize robust growth in the American  economy.   To do so, we not only need to address the number of Federal  regulations, but also their convoluted and complex nature. Our  constituents should not need a law degree or an army of consultants and  accountants to understand the rules they are required to follow.  Nevertheless, given their technical language, it can be extremely  difficult to fully understand proposals unless one is an expert in that  field.   Title VI of H.R. 5 includes language from a bill that I introduced  earlier in this Congress. My bill, the Providing Accountability Through  Transparency Act, would require each Federal agency, when providing  notice of a proposed rulemaking, to produce a 100-word, plain-language  summary of the proposal and make it publicly available online. This  commonsense reform would give the American people straightforward and  uncomplicated access to the rules proposed by the executive branch.   The American people deserve to be informed about the rules and  regulations being proposed by their government, and I am honored to  have my legislation included in this regulation-curbing package.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his leadership on H.R. 5, as well as  my colleagues who joined me in contributing language to this critical  legislation.
