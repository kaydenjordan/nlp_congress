 Mr. Speaker, for over 100 years, America's  railways, roadways, runways, and rivers were the envy of the entire  world. Now they are emblems of a past time that requires significant  upgrades to support our current needs. They not only allow us to  participate in a global economy, but allow us to dominate that economy.   First, let me note that American infrastructure is made up of the  following: 4.1 million miles of public highways, over 600,000 bridges,  140,500 miles of railways, 11,300 miles of public transit systems,  25,000 miles of navigable waterways, 250 water ports, and 19,500  airports.   Much of that infrastructure is decades old and in dire need of  repair. For too long, America has stood by and allowed our once world- leading infrastructure to crumble.   Our competitors have not only caught up with us, but, in many cases,  have surpassed us. Countries like China and India spend billions on new  roads, new rails, and ports, while we have allowed ours to decay.   America still has the most dynamic, innovative, and diversified  economy in the entire world, but we must rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure to remain competitive.   Our taxpayers already pay enough in taxes, so we have to find ways to  pay for these infrastructure improvements. It is imperative that we do  so without putting a heavier burden on our hardworking American  taxpayers.   That is why I have worked on legislation over the years, with  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, that uses a combination of  public and private funds to fix our public works. By working together,  we can rebuild our Nation's infrastructure by harnessing the private  sector's capacity for innovation and investment, rather than raising  taxes.   I would like to outline some of the legislation that I am talking  about, which I believe is just the type of outside-the-box thinking we  need to achieve those goals.   Today, Earl Blumenauer and I introduced the BUILD Act. This  legislation raises the Federal statutory cap on private activity bonds  that can be issued by or on behalf of State and local governments for  qualified highway and freight improvement projects from $15 billion to  $20.8 billion. In short, it allows State and local governments to  enhance their capacity to finance surface transportation projects  through private-public partnerships.   As more of our Nation's infrastructure requires critical investment  and improvements, we must find ways to reinvest in our roads and rails  without burdening our hardworking American taxpayers. This bill will  help finance improvement projects at a minimal cost to taxpayers with a  maximum impact on America's roads, bridges, and rails. This is a jobs  bill.   I joined with Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, Representative  Napolitano, and Representative Westerman to introduce H.R. 2440, the  Full Utilization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act. This  bipartisan bill ensures the harbor maintenance trust fund is used for  its intended purpose, and that is maintaining our federally authorized  harbors.   Erie, Pennsylvania, knows that our airports badly need this support.  The Port of Erie is part of our economic lifeblood. For decades, cargo  ships have had to light load because of a lack of dredging,  significantly increasing the cost per unit for shipped goods.    People ask: What do you mean by light load? What I mean by that is  they cannot load to their full capacity. They are light loading so the  ships can navigate through areas that have not been dredged in years.   Our Nation's 59 busiest ports are available less than 35 percent of  the time. Conditions of our midsize and emerging harbors are far worse.  [[Page H3469]]    Currently, there is over $9 billion sitting in the harbor maintenance  trust fund. This money has come from the users of those assets. They  have put that money in for the express purpose of thinking that it was  going to be used to improve the ports that they used.   Over the next decade, there is going to be an additional $24.5  billion in revenue that will be collected by the harbor maintenance  tax. This bill provides for the investment of approximately $34 billion  for our Nation's coastal and inland harbors over the next decade  without raising one dime in taxes for our hardworking American  taxpayers. This money will provide for dredging of all Federal harbors  to their constructed widths and depths.   Because of developments like the opening of the expanded Panama Canal  in 2016, larger container ships will increasingly call upon our  Nation's ports, and dredging is necessary if they are allowed to have  access to these ports. Our goal is to guarantee that our Nation is  competitive in the global economy of the 21st century.   Also with Earl Blumenauer, I introduced the Public Buildings Renewal  Act. This bipartisan legislation will spur private investment in public  building infrastructure throughout the United States by creating $5  billion in private activity bonds for the improvement of government- owned public buildings.   In every small town or city in America, the conditions of our public  schools, our public hospitals, our universities, and our police and  fire stations are deteriorating because of delayed maintenance. We just  haven't been able to afford to do it.   With State and local budgets becoming increasingly tight, capital  investments in public buildings have fallen by the wayside. For  example, the average public school building is at least 40 years old,  and the current backlog of maintenance and repair projects adds up to  more than $45 billion, annually, in unmet funding needs.                                time  2015    The Public Building Renewal Act aims to unlock private sector capital  for the public sector's benefit. The public buildings that house vital  services for Americans must be maintained and improved.   We have also dropped the Building Rail Access for Customers and the  Economy Act. Representative Blumenauer and I introduced this bill just  recently.   The short line rail industry operates on nearly 50,000 miles of  railroad track in 49 states. And is part of the origination or the  termination of one out of every five cars, railroad cars, on the  national railroad system.   Short line railroads serve the most vulnerable part of the rail  network. Small towns and small businesses who would have otherwise been  cut off from the national network, are now served by the short lines.   Unfortunately, though, as the freight rail industry has evolved, many  short line railroads and smaller communities have been abandoned.   This removes a critical first- and last-mile link between producers,  consumers, and export opportunities in large and small communities  across America.   Since it was first enacted in 2005, the 1- or 2-year increment  extensions of the Short Line Railroad Maintenance Credit provided  limited certainty for short line railroads to make investments in their  infrastructure.   Our legislation delivers confidence by making the short line railroad  maintenance credit permanent while also applying it retroactively to  tax year 2018.   The short line railroad maintenance tax credit is responsible for  more than $4 billion of investment in privately held short line  railroads across America.   The tax credit requires the short line railroad to invest $1 dollar  for every 50 cents in credit up to a credit cap of $3,500 per track  mile.   In 2015 alone, 2,140 rail miles were improved.   5.27 million railroad ties were replaced; and the short line industry  invested nearly 25 percent of their revenue on infrastructure  improvements.   These investments ensure that more than 10,000 rail companies can  rely on safe, efficiently and economically competitive transportation  for their products.   Also, I would like to talk just a little bit about the GAIIN Act.   During the last Congress, I introduced a bipartisan bill with a broad  coalition from the Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Black  Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the House Freedom  Caucus.   This legislation has the potential to help fund critical  infrastructure projects in the Nation's poorest communities while  simultaneously paying down on our national debt.   The poorest areas in our country have been routinely overlooked or  are in dire need of infrastructure improvements that will facilitate  economic growth and self-sustainability.   Reviving these forgotten cities and breathing life back into these  towns throughout America is both a moral and economic imperative that  uniquely unites all lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.   Selling some of the $2 trillion of nonperforming debt and lease  assets held by Federal agencies on the open market would be a good  strategy for a down payment on infrastructure improvements.   The GAIIN Act will do that and reduce our debt without asking  taxpayers for one more penny of their money.   Half the proceeds from these sales will be put into projects and  communities below the poverty line and directly lead to jobs and  economic growth where it is most needed.   Also, the contractors doing this work in these communities would be  required to hire people who actually live there, to help build these  products and projects.   Imagine the generational pride that will be created when fathers and  mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers tell their children and  grandchildren, ``We rebuilt this community for you.'' It lasts for  generations, and it is a pride that you can't just stop thinking about  how good it is for our country.   Now, the other half of the revenue we collect would go to debt  reduction. And this is a private-sector solution to a public-sector  problem, and another huge win for America.   It is time for us to come together as a Nation to keep America on its  path of greatness.   This is not a red State or blue State issue. This is not a Republican  or Democrat issue. This is a red, white, and blue American issue.   We must make sure American infrastructure allows our people to  compete in the global economy now and in the future. In an economy that  we not only participate in, but that we dominate, that America takes  its rightful place in the world when it comes to what we are able to  do.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the President's rescission of the  onerous regulations unleashed our economy, and we are seeing the best  job numbers that we have seen in over half a century.   Now, in order for that success to be sustained and long-term, it is  incumbent that we upgrade our infrastructure.   So I call on all my colleagues to work together and come up with  creative solutions to pay for these very necessary improvements and to  support the bills I have outlined today.   America's best times lie in front of her, not behind her. And once  again, it is Yankee ingenuity that will lead us to the top again and we  will become that country that others long to belong to and become a  part of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
