 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to raise an issue that would  ``shock the conscience.'' Those are not my words. Those are the words  of a distinguished Federal judge when he refused to sentence two  ranchers in my district to 5 years in prison. Judge Hogan looked at the  case and he said: That is not right. It would ``shock the conscience.''   This Friday, the younger of those two ranchers will mark his fourth  year in prison for starting a fire--by the way, fire on the range, high  desert, is a management tool. They were using it for that purpose. They  were tried. They were convicted. They never should have been sentenced  to this.   The Obama administration came back and resentenced them to 5 years  for 139 acres. We burn hundreds of thousands of acres every year. The  government starts fires that burn onto private land. Nothing seems to  happen.   It is time for the President to review this situation and to grant a  pardon to Steven and Dwight Hammond, pull them back together with their  families. They have served long enough.   This is an issue that shocks the conscience. It is time for real  justice, and President Trump can administer that.                            ____________________
