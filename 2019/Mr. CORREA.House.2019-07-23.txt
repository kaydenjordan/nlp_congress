 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 504) to amend title 36, United States Code, to authorize The  American Legion to determine the requirements for membership in The  American Legion, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 504         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Let Everyone Get Involved in       Opportunities for National Service Act'' or the ``LEGION       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Since the end of World War II, the Federal Government       has designated specific periods of war, the dates of which       are important for qualification for certain benefits or       membership in veterans organizations established by Congress.        (2) In between those recognized periods of war, during so-      called peacetime eras, the United States military has been       involved in not fewer than 12 known eras, which are       unrecognized by the United States Government as periods of       war, resulting in numerous United States personnel combat       casualties.        (3) Those 12 unrecognized war eras occurred at the       direction of the then President of the United States, with       full knowledge and consent of the then Congress.        (4) The first of those 12 unrecognized war eras involving       active United States military personnel was the Greek Civil       War, fought in Greece from 1946 to 1949 between the army of       the Government of Greece, supported by active military       personal of the United States and the United Kingdom, and the       Democratic Army of Greece, the military branch of the       Communist Party of Greece.        (5) During the Greek Civil War, one member of the Armed       Forces of the United States sacrificed his life in service to       the United States, and five others suffered non-combat       deaths.        (6) The second of those unrecognized war eras involving       active United States military personnel was the Chinese Civil       War, which occurred during the aftermath of World War II.        (7) During the Chinese Civil War, the United States       military equipped, trained, transported, and supplied the       Kuomintang-led Government of the Republic of China with       approximately $4,430,000,000 in its resistance to the       Communist Party of China.        (8) During the Chinese Civil War, 14 members of the Armed       Forces of the United States sacrificed their lives in service       to the United States, 150 non-combatants of the United States       lost their lives in the war, and 51 were wounded, resulting       in 215 United States military casualties.        (9) The third unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel is known as the Cold War.        (10) The Cold War was a period spanning from approximately       1947 until 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed.        (11) Although no direct large-scale military fighting       occurred between the militaries of the United States and the       Soviet Union, active United States military personnel served       in multiple regional conflicts during the Cold War, resulting       in the deaths of not fewer than 32 members of the Armed       Forces who sacrificed their lives in service to the United       States and not fewer than 12 additional casualties.        (12) The fourth unrecognized war era involving active       United States military personnel is known as the China Cold       War.        (13) The China Cold War started when the Kuomintang-led       Government of the Republic of China retreated to the island       of Taiwan and lasted until 1972, after President Richard       Nixon conducted a landmark state visit to China.        (14) During the military operations of the China Cold War,       not fewer than 16 members of the Armed Forces of the United       States sacrificed their lives in service to the United       States.        (15) The fifth unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel was the Lebanon Crisis of 1958,       which involved more than 14,000 United States personnel and       resulted in the death of one member of the Armed Forces who       sacrificed his life in service to the United States and five       non-combat deaths.        (16) The sixth unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel was the Bay of Pigs invasion in       April 1961.        (17) The Bay of Pigs invasion was a failed military       invasion of Cuba undertaken by a United States military group       sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency that resulted in       not fewer than one death of a member of the Armed Forces who       sacrificed his life in service to the United States and 19       non-combat deaths.        (18) The seventh unrecognized war era involving active       United States military personnel was the Cuban Missile       Crisis, which took place between October 16 and October 28,       1962.        (19) The Cuban Missile Crisis directly related to homeland       protection against the deployment of a Soviet ballistic       missile in Cuba.        (20) During the Cuban Missile Crisis, one member of the       Armed Forces sacrificed his life in service to the United       States and 19 others died as non-combatants.        (21) The eighth unrecognized war era involving active       United States military personnel was the Dominican Civil War       in 1965.        (22) Operations during the Dominican Civil War resulted in       the deaths of 27 members of the Armed Forces who sacrificed       their lives in service to the United States, 20 non-combat-      related deaths, and 283 wounded.        (23) The ninth unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel was the Iran Hostage Crisis, which       lasted from November 4, 1979, through January 20, 1981.        (24) The Iran Hostage Crisis involved military intervention       by the United States which resulted in the deaths of 8       members of the Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives in       service to United States.        (25) The tenth unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel was the Salvadoran Civil War.        (26) The Salvadoran Civil War lasted more than 12 years,       through the terms of two Presidential administrations of the       United States, and resulted in the deaths of 22 members of       the Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives in service to the       United States, 15 non-combat deaths, and 35 other casualties.  [[Page H7221]]         (27) The 11th unrecognized war era involving active United       States military personnel started on April 5, 1986, when the       La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, Germany, was bombed,       killing two United States soldiers and wounding 79 other       members of the Armed Forces, which triggered what became       known as the Libyan Conflict.        (28) The military operations of the Libyan Conflict       included numerous air strikes by United States military       forces and resulted in the deaths of two members of the Armed       Forces who sacrificed their lives in service to the United       States.        (29) The Libyan Conflict led to the 12th unrecognized war       era involving active United States military personnel, known       collectively as the Persian Gulf Conflicts, which lasted from       July 24, 1987, through September 26, 1988.        (30) The Persian Gulf Conflicts involved United States       military missions to protect Kuwaiti-owned oil tankers which       represented the largest United States naval convoy operation       since World War II.        (31) The Persian Gulf Conflicts resulted in numerous       military operations and the deaths of not fewer than 39       members of the Armed Forces who sacrificed their lives in       service to the United States and 31 wounded.        (32) Since the armistice that ended the hostilities of the       Korean War on January 31, 1955, nearly 100 active United       States military personnel have sacrificed their lives in       service to the United States in South Korea, and more than       132 people of the United States have been wounded in-country.        (33) Since January 1, 1947, through all of the unrecognized       war eras involving active United States military personnel,       not fewer than 778 combat and non-combat members of the Armed       Forces have sacrificed their lives in service to the United       States and not fewer than 797 have been wounded.        (34) Since January 1, 1947, the unrecognized war eras       involving active United States military personnel who were       wounded and killed serving their country were administered       under orders from the commander in chief and with the consent       of Congress, proving that the United States has been       conducting deadly wartime service to protect the country       consistently since December 7, 1941.        (35) Eligibility for membership in The American Legion is       determined by Congress through the establishment of specific       dates of declared and officially recognized hostilities in       which United States military personnel are on active service.        (36) The American Legion provides invaluable services to       its members and supports the community of veterans who       sacrificed in service of the United States.        (37) Membership in The American Legion allows veterans to       engage in public service activities, such as supporting Boys       and Girls State and Nation, youth mentorship programs, and       benefit assistance, career fairs, and employment assistance       for veterans.        (38) The American Legion has gone on record as supporting       the 12 unrecognized war eras involving active United States       military personnel since the beginning of World War II.        (39) The American Legion has aided, assisted, and comforted       the families of the men and women who were called to serve or       volunteered to serve during all of the unrecognized war eras       and continues to provide support to veterans of those eras.        (40) The American Legion has commended the heroic actions       of all military personnel who risked their lives in defense       of freedom during each of the unrecognized war eras involving       active United States military personnel.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       in accordance with the history, tradition, and purposes of       The American Legion, it is fair, proper, and reasonable that       the privilege of membership in The American Legion should be       extended to all military personnel who served on active       military duty during all of the unrecognized war eras       involving active United States military personnel.       SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE AMERICAN LEGION.         Section 21703 of title 36, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``during any period       from--'' and all that follows through the end of clause (vii)       and inserting the following: ``during--        ``(i) the period from April 6, 1917, through November 11,       1918; or        ``(ii) any time after December 7, 1941; or''; and        (B) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``or time'' after ``a       period''; and        (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``or time'' after ``that       period''.       SEC. 4. NONDISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS                     FOR HOLDING A STAFF POSITION IN THE AMERICAN                     LEGION.         (a) In General.--Chapter 217 of title 36, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 21704 the       following new section:       ``Sec. 21704A. Nondiscrimination         ``The requirements for holding a staff position in the       corporation may not discriminate on the basis of race, color,       religion, sex, or national origin.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 21704 the following new item:  ``21704A. Nondiscrimination.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 504, the Let Everyone Get  Involved Opportunities for National Service Act, or the LEGION Act.  This bipartisan bill will expand the eligibility for American Legion  membership to include honorably discharged veterans who have served in  unrecognized conflicts.   The American Legion was chartered by Congress in 1919. Since then,  The American Legion has grown to become the Nation's largest veteran  service organization, with more than 2 million members. In Orange  County alone, The American Legion is home to nearly 8,000 members.   For millions of veterans The Legion has offered a community of  support. Sadly, not all veterans are eligible to join The American  Legion. Currently, only veterans who serve during periods of declared  hostilities are eligible.   Over the past decades, military personnel have served during at least  12 unofficial combat operations. They also deserve to be members of The  Legion, and this bill will allow veterans who have honorably served in  our Armed Forces during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Libyan conflict,  and other recognized conflicts to join The Legion.   I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of  this process, and, once again, I ask for their support of this  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
