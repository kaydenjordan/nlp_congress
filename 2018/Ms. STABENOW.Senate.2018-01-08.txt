 Mr. President, today marks a sad and, frankly, shocking  day for too many of America's children and hard-working families  because it has now been 100 days since funding for the Children's  Health Insurance Program and community health centers expired.   History has shown us that there is a whole lot that can get done in  100 days. It took Thomas Jefferson only 17 days to write the  Declaration of Independence; the brave allied forces who landed on D- day advanced through France and liberated Paris in only 80 days; and  Congress managed to pass 15 major pieces of legislation during  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first 100 days in office. Yet,  here we are, 100 days past the deadline of September 30, and Congress  still hasn't managed to pass long-term legislation to reauthorize what  we call CHIP--the Children's Health Insurance Program--and to fund our  community health centers.   We have a strong bipartisan bill funding CHIP, which was passed out  of committee. I give our chairman and ranking member kudos for working  together. I was proud to work with them. It came out of committee with  only one ``no'' vote and has waited and waited and waited on the floor  of the Senate. Senator Blunt and I have a bipartisan bill to continue  funding community health centers, and 70 Members of the Senate have  signed a letter supporting long-term funding for community health  centers, which expired September 30--100 days ago.   Right now, we are in a situation where 9 million children and their  parents don't know what is going to happen long term. As soon as this  month, 100,000 children and their families in Michigan have begun to  get letters saying that their children will lose coverage, and they are  trying to figure out what is going on.   Imagine being a parent who is working hard. A lot of folks I know are  working two jobs, trying to hold it together. You don't have health  insurance; you earn too much for your children to be able to get  Medicaid health insurance, so the Children's Health Insurance Program  is your lifeline. It is your lifeline. It gives you peace of mind to  know that if your daughter falls and breaks her arm or your son gets a  cough that won't go away, you can take them to the doctor.   What if those children have something worse than a broken arm or a  cough? What if they are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes or asthma or  cancer? Just imagine being that parent and getting a letter which says  that your child may no longer have health insurance. It is not  necessary. This is not necessary.   We could do this tomorrow. If we thought it was important enough to  bring it to the floor, we could get a vote--and I believe it would be  overwhelmingly bipartisan--tomorrow if  [[Page S62]]  there were a sense of urgency, an understanding, about how these  parents feel and how these children feel.   So what would you do if you got that letter? Would you tell your  kids? You don't want them to worry about it. What would you do? I  believe hard-working families--and we are talking about working  families, people with jobs, working--deserve better.   Then we have community health centers that serve 25 million people  across the country, including 300,000 veterans and 7.5 million  children. Our health centers are doing a phenomenal job. At more than  260 sites across Michigan, our health centers are serving 681,000  people, including about 13,000 Michigan veterans.   This month, health centers that were supposed to receive a new 12- month grant are only getting a small amount of funding to get them  through the next few weeks, not knowing what is going to happen again.  By June, Michigan's community health centers will lose over $80 million  in funding, and over 99,000 patients will lose care.   Last month, I had the opportunity to visit two of our great Michigan  community health centers, each of their networks operating more than  one site--Hamilton Community Health Network in Flint and Western Wayne  Family Health Centers in Inkster. Like clinics across Michigan, these  centers are serving literally thousands of Michigan families every  day--people of Michigan who don't have medical care for one reason or  another. Now those thousands of people are at risk of having no place  to go if they get sick or if they need preventative care so that they  don't get sick.   Hamilton Community Health Network will run out of funding in April,  and Western Wayne Family Health Centers will not get their full funding  this month. They were asking me: Should they lay people off? How should  they be planning for their centers? What should they be doing?   That means 15,500 people are wondering what will happen to them if  they or their children get sick or slip on the ice--which there is a  lot of in Michigan--and sprain an ankle.   Felicia knows what it is like to live under that cloud of fear. She  wrote me a letter indicating that in 2011 she was an AmeriCorps  volunteer serving in Lansing and didn't have health insurance. When she  started feeling tired all the time and losing weight, she went to the  Center for Family Health in Jackson, MI, another great center. The  Center for Family Health, which served 29,000 patients in 2016, will  run out of funding in March if we don't act.   Felicia was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma--pretty scary  stuff. The Center for Family Health helped her get her health coverage  through Medicaid and care from the University of Michigan, including  chemotherapy and later a stem cell transplant.   Felicia wrote me:         Now I am feeling awesome, I am cancer-free, and I am       working part time while I am finishing up college. I feel       that I owe my life to the Center for Family Health.    Felicia knows the importance of community health centers; one in  Michigan saved her life. People like Felicia and children who are  covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program, which we call  MIChild in Michigan, shouldn't have to wait a day longer. They are  counting on us to get this done. It has been 100 days of uncertainty  that did not have to happen.    Let me say that again. We have a bipartisan bill reported out of the  Finance Committee. The House has reported their version. There is no  reason we can't immediately put a 5-year extension on the floor of the  Senate.   Senator Blunt and I and our cosponsors of our bill have always  assumed that once CHIP came to the floor, we would be adding in  community health centers, for which there is strong support, and we  would be able to get this done. People would know that their  neighborhood health center is there. Their children can go to the  doctor instead of sitting for hours in the emergency room. They would  be able to see their doctor if they got sick. It has been 100 days  since funding has expired for community health centers and children's  health insurance. That is 100 days too many.   I have been coming to the floor every week to say: Let's do it today.  Let's do it tomorrow. We don't have to wait and hold them as bargaining  chips in some bigger appropriations negotiation. These are families.  These are kids. These are people who want to have confidence in us that  we will do our jobs. This one can get done. It could have gotten done  before the holidays. What a great Christmas present that would have  been. It can get done now.   On behalf of the 25 million people who use those community health  centers, the 9 million children and their parents who use the  Children's Health Insurance Program, I call on all of us to have the  sense of urgency and the leadership--the leader--to bring this up. We  can get it done in a day. We would all feel good about it because it  would be something we would be doing together instead of having these  families wait and wait.   Mr. President, before yielding, I want to acknowledge our newest  Senator, Mr. Jones, who is here, and thank him. Even as he was in his  happiness, and rightly so, on the evening he found out he was going to  be the next Senator, he mentioned CHIP. In listening to that acceptance  speech, it did my heart good to know that children's health insurance  was at the top of our newest Senator's mind at that important time, and  it is a pleasure to see him on the floor this evening.   I believe the Senator from Arizona is here.    Mr. President, I am proud to pay special tribute  today to the people of Macomb County, MI, who are celebrating their  county's bicentennial this year.   The people of Macomb County symbolize the history, sacrifices, and  character of people all across our country who have helped create the  American middle class. They represent America's diverse history of  immigrants coming to this country to find the American dream. When it  comes to hard work, the people of Macomb County are second to none. The  county's rich history has created a resilient people who put family,  faith, and community first in their lives.   Macomb County was founded on January 15, 1818. Located on the shores  of Lake St. Clair, the county is named in honor of General Alexander  Macomb, a veteran of the War of 1812. The county was the third county  founded in Michigan and, today, is Michigan's third most populous  county.   Macomb County is known for its innovation and impressive  manufacturing might. It is a backbone of the American automotive  industry. Fiat  [[Page S65]]  Chrysler, Ford Motor, and General Motors employ more than 35,000 people  and operate 10 facilities in Macomb County. There are more than 1,600  manufacturers in Macomb County employing more than 69,000 individuals.  I am so proud to represent these hard-working Michigan workers.   The county is also an important defense hub for both Michigan and the  United States. It is home to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which  was established in 1917 and, today, is home to operations of all  branches of the U.S. military, as well as several Department of  Homeland Security agencies. In the 10 years immediately following  September 11, 2001, approximately 3,816 Michigan Air National Guard  airmen from Selfridge deployed to locations around the world. Macomb  County is also home to the Detroit Arsenal, the first ever mass- production tank plant in the United States and a vital part of our  Nation's ``Arsenal of Democracy'' during World War II. The Detroit  Arsenal now hosts the headquarters of the U.S. Army Tank Automotive  Research, Development and Engineering Center, called TARDEC, and the  U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, or TACOM, Life Cycle  Management Command.   Numerous events and celebrations are planned in the county throughout  this year to mark this special historical milestone. Congratulations to  the people of Macomb County on 200 years of distinguished history. We  all look forward to many years of prosperity and success in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
