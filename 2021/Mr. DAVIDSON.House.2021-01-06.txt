 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this objection.    Madam Speaker, every one of us swore an oath to support  and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,  both foreign and domestic.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H109, the following appeared:   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this objection.   Madam Speaker, every one of us swore an oath to support and defend  the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both  foreign and domestic.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     I swore that oath in uniform, and the first part of that oath is the    same as what we swear here in Congress.The last time we needed to  defend our Constitution against a domestic  [[Page H110]]  enemy, we fought a civil war. And at the conclusion of that Civil War  we passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that make clear that no  State is so sovereign that they can deprive their citizens of equal  protection of the laws.   When it comes to elections, that means one person gets one vote. It  doesn't mean that other citizens can dilute the votes of other citizens  and deprive them of equal protection. And it doesn't mean that a State  can do that by law or by practice.   So whether the law was changed and made it such that there is no way  to provide equal protection--one person, one vote--or the practice was  corrupted, it cannot stand. Frankly, lastly, it must guarantee that  there is a proof that it was equal protection under the law.   None of that happened in a number of States. The people of America,  tens of millions of them who came out to vote, have been unheard by  this body and by far too many courts. We need to show them the respect  they are due by the Constitution of the United States of America, the  Constitution that we fought to sustain to end the era of Jim Crow to  pass civil rights legislation, the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights  Act, and so many other pieces of jurisprudence.    I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H110, the following appeared:  I  yield to the gentleman from Ohio.    ========================= END NOTE =========================
