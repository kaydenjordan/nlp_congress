 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson for allowing me  to speak in support of H.R. 5421, the America COMPETES Act of 2022.   Congress must advance this legislation to ensure American technology  and manufacturing has the innovation advantage to continue to grow our  economy, strengthen our national security, and tackle our supply chain  issues.   Indiana's First Congressional District is home to an incredible  manufacturing, steel, and industrial complex, and I want to recognize  my Senate colleague from Indiana, Senator Todd Young, for his  initiative on the Senate companion legislation, the Endless Frontier  Act.   Our Nation has been faced with technology challenges in the past.  Today, we have the opportunity to legislate together, with our  collective interests in mind, to protect our workers and lead the world  in innovation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson for the time, and I  encourage all my House colleagues to support the America COMPETES Act.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank  the chairwoman and to reiterate one fact, a story about my district,  one of the top-producing steel districts in the Nation and also one of  the top auto producers in the Nation.   Today we are faced with enhancing the ability for them to perform,  enhancing the ability to produce automobiles because it takes  semiconductors. When we don't have semiconductors, people stop working.  When the auto industry stops working, then the steel industry stops  working. Then my district is impacted. Today is vital for the creation  of jobs, to protect our Nation, and, as a national security issue, to  be able to correct the supply chain and to be able to produce  semiconductors here in the United States.   The vitality of that is the example of the plant in Columbus, Ohio,  and the investments that are going to be made in technology jobs so  that the next generation of workers in technology will have an  opportunity to equitably participate in our economy.   Madam Speaker, I encourage the House to pass this piece of  legislation.
