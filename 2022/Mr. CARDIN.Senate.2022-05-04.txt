 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have taken this time to talk about  National Small Business Week, but because of the events of the last 48  hours, I need to comment on the Justice Alito draft opinion that, if it  were adopted by the Supreme Court, would overturn Roe v. Wade.   I find this draft opinion to be outrageous. It puts the health, well- being, and constitutional rights of women across the Nation in great  jeopardy, particularly those low-income women.   Thirty-six million women of reproductive age would be at risk if the  Alito opinion became the ruling of the Supreme Court.   We look to our courts to protect and expand our constitutional  protections, not to contract and weaken the constitutional protections,  reversing nearly 50 years of legal precedent of Roe v. Wade.   What we need to do is to make sure that this body does everything we  can to protect women's rights and to protect their healthcare right to  make their own decision.   I am pleased that 16 States, including the District of Columbia, have  taken action to protect women's rights, including my own State of  Maryland, but we need to do more. We need to pass the Women's Health  Protection Act. I am a cosponsor of that--proud to be a cosponsor of  it--which would codify Roe v. Wade to protect reproductive rights for  women. I hope we will have the opportunity to do that. I think we all  recognize that we have a responsibility to act before the Supreme Court  makes its ruling that could jeopardize the constitutional rights.    Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that the SBIR  Program and the STTR Program are critical to our American small  businesses. It offers them incredible opportunities to develop  technology important for our Nation. I also agree with my colleague  that it is important we prevent critical national security technology  developed by the programs from being acquired by China and Russia.   I do point out that if you look at the COMPETES Act, there are  safeguards to prevent our foreign adversaries from acquiring sensitive  technology--and not just China and Russia but all foreign countries of  concern, including Iran and North Korea. This effort  [[Page S2321]]  builds on section 223 of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act that provides protection and requires disclosure to  guard against foreign influence on federally funded research and  development.    I am going to support the motion to instruct and work with my  colleague so we can develop clear language and make it clear that the  technology developed by the SBIR Program and STTR Program are protected  against being taken into China and Russia. I look forward to working  with my colleague.   I support the motion.                                Vote on Motion
