 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to overturning the Fair Pay  and Safe Workplaces rule under the Congressional Review Act. Undoing  this rule would once again allow unethical Federal contractors to  collect billions of dollars from taxpayers while stealing from,  endangering, and discriminating against their employees.   Right outside this building, on January 20, President Trump promised  to give power back to the people and empower everyday Americans. I do  not understand how allowing Federal contractors to hide records of wage  theft, safety violations, and discrimination keeps that promise.   I am particularly concerned with what repealing this rule will mean  for our Nation's veterans. Because Federal contractors are encouraged  to employ the men and women who have served, they will be greatly  affected if we let companies off the hook for repeatedly violating  workplace laws.   In addition, President Obama's executive order helps to guarantee  that Federal contractors comply with longstanding law that protects  veterans and people with disabilities from discrimination in the  workplace. It also encourages contractors to recruit, hire, promote,  and retain these individuals.   This is why the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote a letter to the  Speaker and minority leader asking that they oppose this resolution to  ensure fair and safe working conditions for our veterans. PVA was also  joined in a separate letter by Vietnam Veterans of America and  disability advocates, including Easterseals, the American Association  of People with Disabilities, and dozens more opposing the resolution we  are debating today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record both letters.                                   Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                   Washington, DC, January 30, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: Paralyzed       Veterans of America urges you to reject a Congressional       Review Act (CRA) disapproval resolution of the 2016 Federal       Acquisition Regulation rule designed to reduce employment       discrimination against people with disabilities and veterans,       including those with service-connected disabilities. PVA is       the nation's only Congressionally-chartered veterans' service       organization solely dedicated to representing veterans with       spinal cord injuries and/or diseases.        Disapproving this rule will weaken important       nondiscrimination and affirmative hiring provisions intended       for people with disabilities and veterans. For more than four       decades, individuals with disabilities and veterans have been       protected by federal laws against discrimination in       employment with employers that do business with the federal       government. In addition, these landmark laws (Rehabilitation       Act of 1973 and Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance       Act of 1974) have required large federal contractors to take       affirmative action to recruit, hire, promote, and retain       these individuals, who traditionally face higher unemployment       rates than their peers. The Federal Acquisition Regulation       (81 Fed. Reg. 58562)--that is being targeted by this CRA       resolution of disapproval--simply ensures that companies that       want to do business with the federal government disclose       whether they have been in violation of these longstanding       requirements.        Please ensure that veterans and other individuals with       disabilities are not denied fair and equal employment       opportunities by voting against the CRA resolution of       disapproval of the Federal Acquisition Regulation published       at 81 Fed. Reg. 58562.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                        Carl Blake,      Associate Executive Director.                                   ____                                        Consortium for Citizens with                                                    Disabilities,                                                   February 1, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The       undersigned members of the Consortium for Citizens with       Disabilities (CCD) and our allies urge you to reject a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) disapproval resolution of the       2016 Federal Acquisition Regulation rule designed to reduce       employment discrimination against people with disabilities       and veterans, including those with service-connected       disabilities.        CCD is the largest coalition of national organizations       working together to advocate for Federal public policy that       ensures the self-determination, independence, empowerment,       integration and inclusion of children and adults with       disabilities in all aspects of society.

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government, which spends  billions of dollars contracting with private companies every year, has  an obligation to demonstrate and promote responsible behavior. We  should not be in the business of working with contractors who  repeatedly violate our Nation's labor laws, particularly when they harm  the veterans who have served our Nation so bravely.   Repealing this rule sends the wrong message to employers, the wrong  message to veterans, and the wrong message to hardworking Americans who  deserve to be treated with respect in the workplace.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) as well as the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. Jayapal)  for hosting this important Special Order hour. Congressman Raskin and  Congresswoman Jayapal are two of the newest members of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I want to express my gratitude  for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, last week, President Trump issued an executive order  that violated America's basic commitment to projecting hope and  tolerance around the world. With a stroke of his pen, he turned his  back on a humanitarian crisis and shut the door on desperate families  fleeing unspeakable violence. It has taken just 2 weeks for this  administration to undermine our moral authority and weaken our role in  promoting peace and stability in a volatile world.   In airports across the country, in streets of coastal cities and  midwestern towns, in States that voted for Secretary Clinton and in  States that voted for President Trump, the American people are  expressing their outrage at the Muslim ban. Patriotic men and women are  standing up for the compassionate, exceptional country we strive to be.   Religious leaders are standing up to say: This is not who we are.   Veterans are standing up to say: This is not what we fought for.   There was a time when Republican leadership stood with them. These  two tweets to my right are a memorial to a time when Vice President  Pence and Speaker Ryan were prepared to publicly oppose policies they  called un-American. Now, when faced with the reality of this policy,  Speaker Ryan is choosing to support the ban. Our Vice President deleted  his tweet. We had to search around to find the original tweet, and it  is right over there.   The American people deserve better.   Let's be clear. The President's executive order makes America less  safe. The only threat to America posed by Syrian refugees is to our  conscience. Instead of protecting the homeland from terror, the  President has gift-wrapped powerful propaganda for our enemies.   This is not just my opinion or the opinion of Democrats in Congress.  This is what we have heard from dozens of national security experts  from both parties. They are warning us that this executive order is a  stain on our reputation and a setback for counterterrorism efforts  around the world. Yet congressional Republicans remain silent.   Mr. Speaker, our democracy has endured and prospered for more than  two centuries because of our system of checks and balances. Congress  has a responsibility to act when the executive branch advances reckless  and ill-conceived policies. We are failing to fulfill that duty by  refusing to repeal the Muslim ban, by refusing to investigate the  President's many conflicts of interest. And by refusing to stand up for  America's most basic principles, my friends across the aisle are  putting our global leadership and the integrity of our government at  risk.   If ever there was a time to choose your country over your party, this  is it.
