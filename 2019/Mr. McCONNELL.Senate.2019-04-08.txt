 Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 200.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, the Senate mourns a part of our  institution's history who passed away over the weekend. Until Saturday,  Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina was the oldest living former  Senator. He is also the longest tenured junior Senator in history,  since 36 of his 38 years in this body came alongside Senator Strom  Thurmond.   But there was nothing ``junior'' about Fritz's career, his impact, or  his larger-than-life personality. By the time I arrived in the Senate,  Fritz had already built a reputation as a war veteran, State  legislator, Governor, Senator, and as a candidate for the Democratic  Presidential nomination. He had raised a family between his hometown of  Charleston and the State capital, Columbia.   At every turn, he was a square-jawed southern gentleman. In every  case, he was someone who would call things exactly how he saw them.  Fritz spoke his mind with cutting wit and undeniable sincerity on  causes that captured his attention. As a result of his passion and  skill, his name will be forever linked with a long list of important  achievements here in the Senate. He called attention to a growing  Federal budget deficit, advocated for the needs of our Nation's men and  women in uniform, and confronted the tragic poverty in America's own  backyard, especially child hunger.   So today the Senate mourns not just a friend and former colleague but  a true example of what it means to live a life of service. We mourn  with Fritz's family and the people of South Carolina, and we join them  in celebrating a life so fully lived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and be in a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  April 9; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive  session to resume consideration of the Domenico nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:10 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 9, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
