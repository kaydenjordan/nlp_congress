 Mr. President, Americans are deeply troubled by the  images and news of parents being separated from their children at the  southern border. The Trump administration's policy of zero tolerance at  the border has already resulted in 2,300 cases of forced family  separation, according to Homeland Security statistics obtained by the  Associated Press. The pace of separations has increased from nearly 50  to nearly 70 a day.   Any parent could imagine how difficult this is, how heartbreaking it  is to be forcibly separated from your young son or your young daughter,  looking at their faces as they wonder: What is going on here? Why are  they taking my parents away from me? It is just as heartbreaking to  imagine the separation and the anxiety it produces in everybody.   Let's be clear. Separating children from their parents and denying  relief to victims of brutal domestic violence will not make our country  a better or safer place. These policies are cruel, inhumane, and so  unlike the America we have known for 229 years.   No one who doesn't meet the legal requirements should be allowed into  this country; we cannot have open borders, but we have an adjudication  process for those cases. In the past, there has been  [[Page S3962]]  no need to separate parents from children while that adjudication was  occurring. The Trump administration has actively decided to take a  different, crueler, more callous approach.   Yet what does President Trump do? He has spent the last few days  trying to deflect blame. The President has said repeatedly that the  separation of parents and children is the result of a law ``the  Democrats forced . . . upon our nation.'' That is not true.   Allow me to quote from the Associated Press's nonpartisan, fact-check  of the President's claims. Here is what they say:         There is no law mandating the separation of children and       parents at the border. The separations are a consequence of a       Trump administration policy to maximize criminal prosecutions       of people caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally. Trump's       repeated, but nonspecific references to a Democratic law       appear to involve one enacted in 2008. It passed unanimously       in Congress--    That meant Democrats and Republicans supported it--       and was signed by Republican President George W. Bush.    He was hardly a Democrat.         It was focused on freeing and otherwise helping children       who come to the border without a parent or guardian. It does       not call for family separation.    I know what Donald Trump will say as he tries to undo our American  institutions: That is fake news. It is from the Associated Press, which  has had a reputation of being down the middle for scores of years.   Let me quote the New York Post editorial, one of the most  conservative newspapers in America--hard right. Here is what they say:         The immediate cause of the crisis is Team Trump's decision       to start prosecuting illegal border-crossers, rather than       simply deporting them.    In the editorial, they ought to go on and say to President Trump: Fix  this problem. Stop blaming Democrats. They are not to blame.   President Trump and Attorney General Sessions announced this zero  tolerance policy in April, and it went into effect in May. If there  were a law requiring it, why hasn't it been going on since Trump became  President? They just started it. Chief of Staff Kelly called the policy  a ``tough deterrent.'' This has nothing to do with our current  immigration laws. It has nothing to do with any Democratic law. This is  entirely a decision made by the Trump administration to start  separating families.   Let me say this to President Trump: President Trump, you can undo the  policy tomorrow, if you want to, with a snap of your fingers. President  Trump, if you don't want to change the policy, own up to it and defend  it, instead of blaming somebody falsely. Either reverse it, which you  can do, Mr. President, or own up to it. But this idea that ``Oh, well,  Democrats are to blame'' is false and untrue and not showing much  strength or courage of conviction.                                  HEALTHCARE    Mr. President, over the past few months, insurers in several States-- Maryland, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Oregon--have requested  significant rate increases for next year, the result of Republican  healthcare policies that have undermined our healthcare system. On  Friday, the State of Minnesota sought a decrease in their rates.   Why? What has made Minnesota so different from these other States?  Why were the people of Minnesota allowed to breathe a sigh of relief  that their insurance costs weren't going up, whether it be the monthly  payments or the deductible or the copay?   Why? I will tell you why. Minnesota implemented a State-funded  reinsurance program that is helping to backstop their healthcare  market. This is what can happen when States support patients and fight  back against what President Trump and congressional Republicans are  doing. This is what happens when you try to strengthen our healthcare  system instead of sabotaging it.   Imagine if every State were like Minnesota. Imagine if every State,  for the first time in decades, were dropping premiums and out-of-pocket  costs for consumers next year. Think about what a difference that would  make in the lives of tens of millions of Americans who pay too much for  healthcare and worry that their healthcare bills are going to go up and  the quality of their healthcare and availability of their healthcare  will go down.   It wouldn't have been that difficult to achieve the goals of  Minnesota. We spent months negotiating a bipartisan healthcare  stabilization package that included ideas like the reinsurance policy  that has been implemented in Minnesota. Senator Nelson from Florida  talked about this and wanted to do it; our Republican friends wouldn't.   Senators Murray and Alexander came to an agreement. It would have  done a load of good. But rather than pass that bill to strengthen our  healthcare system, even after the Republicans tried and failed to  repeal the ACA, the Republicans doubled down on sabotage. They just  hate the system--the idea that people should get so much help from  their government--and they make it worse. As a part of the tax bill,  Republicans repealed the coverage requirement and put nothing in its  place. Then they added poison pills to the bipartisan bill to make sure  it wouldn't pass.   When President Trump canceled the program that helps offset costs for  low-income Americans and proposed expanding junk insurance plans that  cost a lot and cover very little, our Republican colleagues hardly made  a peep.   Recently, the administration has said that it will refuse to defend  in court the protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.  This is a new one. Our Republican friends now say: We don't want to  make sure a family who has a preexisting condition gets health  insurance. That is even worse than before.   Last week, the Republican leader said that his whole caucus supports  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. While this is a  complete reversal from the various healthcare bills our Republican  leadership supported last year, which would have decimated protections  for people with preexisting conditions, I applaud him for saying it and  hope it represents turning over a new leaf.   Now Senate Republicans have to put their money where their mouth is.  When President Trump does things that are so bad for the American  people, so bad for his very supporters who depend on healthcare, our  Republican colleagues fold. They are afraid of him. I hope that is not  the case with preexisting conditions because millions of Americans'  lives and health and sanity, at least fiscal sanity, depend on it.   If Republicans were serious about maintaining protections for people  with preexisting conditions, they would join us in urging the Trump  administration to reverse their shameful decision not to defend the  preexisting healthcare law in court. They would join us in urging the  administration not to finalize their plan to sell junk insurance  policies.   I say to my Republican friends and my dear friend Leader McConnell:  Actions speak louder than words. Your simply saying that your whole  caucus supports protecting Americans with preexisting conditions  doesn't make it so, as the very administration you support tries to  undo it.   Republicans should work with Democrats, right now and throughout the  summer, to focus on lowering costs for the American people. That starts  with telling the Trump administration to defend the vital protections  for Americans with preexisting conditions.   I wish to say one more thing on the immigration issue.                           Forced Family Separation    First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the New York Post editorial, which I referenced, titled: ``Stop  breaking up families at the border.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [From NY Post]                  Stop Breaking Up Families at the Border                         (By Post Editorial Board)         House Speaker Paul Ryan says he wants to stop the mass       separation of children from their families along the border,       but his bid to fix it is pathetic. And President Trump's       claim that Democrats need to change the relevant law is no       better.        The immediate cause of the crisis is Team Trump's decision       to start prosecuting illegal border-crossers, rather than       simply deporting them. Because the law severely limits how       long the feds can detain the children, immigration officials       on the ground then have no choice but to break up the       families.        Ryan's answer is to stick a change of the law into the two       big immigration bills he has  [[Page S3963]]       the House voting on this week. But there's no way the Senate       will pass either one--indeed, not much chance the House will.        Anyway, making it so Immigration and Customs Enforcement       can detain the kids along with their parents is only a minor       improvement--since ICE is already running out of space to       hold people, and looking at ``tent cities'' as a supposedly       temporary expedient.        You can bet that critics will start calling these ``Trump's       concentration camps,'' and the term will catch on if they're       full of kids.        The polls were starting to suggest that Republicans might       not lose big in this November's midterm elections, but       they'll turn back the other way if this keeps up--and rightly       so.        It's not just that this looks terrible in the eyes of the       world. It is terrible: at least 2,000 children ripped from       their parents' arms, sometimes literally, in just the first       six weeks.        Maybe the White House figures families will stop coming       once word gets out, but they won't all stop: Some are fleeing       truly horrific situations back home.        We recognize that returning to the policy of two months       back creates some perverse incentives: Bring kids along, and       you'll just be deported if you're caught. But at least       switching back avoids having the U.S. government earning       comparisons to the Nazis.        If the president doesn't want to admit defeat, he can just       add this to the long list of things he blames on Attorney       General Jeff Sessions. Trying to tough this one out is       guaranteed disaster.     Mr. President, second, I wish to mention this. The House  is toying with a bill, supported by some of the less extreme  Republicans, and they are trying to deal with this issue of family  separation.   First, we haven't seen the copy, but from all reports, it doesn't  really deal with this. Second, it is loaded up with so many other  poison pills that it is never going to see the light of day.   If our Republican colleagues in the House, who endeavored to pass the  discharge petition and failed by a few votes--so they could help the  Dreamers--want to do something real about this, about the Dreamers, and  about family reunification, the support of the bill that is dead on  arrival in the Senate will not assuage their constituents, assuage  their conscience, or, most important, fix the problem.   I yield the floor.
