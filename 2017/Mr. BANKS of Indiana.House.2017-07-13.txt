 Mr. Speaker, last week, as we celebrated our  Nation's birthday, news broke that North Korea successfully launched  its first intercontinental ballistic missile.   The missile's estimated range would put Alaska within reach. Like all  Americans, I am deeply concerned by this development.   North Korea's possession of an estimated 20 nuclear warheads and  chemical and biological weapons makes it an urgent and imminent threat  to the United States.   While there are no easy options, our country must do more to deter  the Kim regime. I strongly support building our missile defense  programs, which is a priority in this year's National Defense  Authorization Act, which the House is considering this week.   I also support increasing sanctions against China and Chinese  companies that support the Kim regime. At this critical time, all  options, including military action, must be on the table. The threat of  a nuclear-armed North Korea is too serious to simply maintain the  status quo.                            ____________________
