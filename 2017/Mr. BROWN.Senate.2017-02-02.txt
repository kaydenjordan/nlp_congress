 Mr. President--    Mr. President--    Up to 5 minutes?    Up to 5 minutes?    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution  before us, which really ought to be titled the ``Kleptocrat Relief  Act.''   My Republican colleagues today are trying to repeal a critical  bipartisan rule initiated by Senator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana,  and Senator Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland. It is a critical  bipartisan rule to prevent corruption.   This transparency rule is part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform  law. It is one of the best anti-corruption tools that President Trump  now has to keep his promise to, in his words, ``drain the swamp'' in  Washington and around the world.   But now, in just week 2 of his Presidency, Republicans are racing to  use an obscure law called the Congressional Review Act to wipe it out.  The CRA was not intended to hand a new President the power to roll back  regulations that protect workers, protect the environment, protect  investors, and protect consumers.   In this case, Republicans are using the CRA to target rules that have  gone through extensive years-long administrative and public review,  including on issues that agencies were specifically ordered by this  Congress to study and address.   Republicans' unprecedented use of the CRA is not about Congress  performing due diligence or agency oversight, it is a gross abuse of  power to make their big corporate allies happy. I heard my friend from  Idaho talk about the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum  Institute. That is just a start.   The rule they are trying to repeal protects U.S. citizens and  investors from having millions of their dollars vanish into the pockets  of corrupt foreign oligarchs. It does that by requiring all oil, gas,  and mineral companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose the  royalties and the bonuses and the fees and the taxes and other payments  they make to foreign governments.   This kind of transparency is essential to combating waste, fraud,  corruption, and mismanagement, as Senator Isakson talked about the  poverty he sees in these resource-rich countries.   Yet Rex Tillerson, whom this body just, I believe yesterday,  confirmed with a pretty much partisan vote--Rex Tillerson and  congressional Republicans want to strip it away. Rex Tillerson, in his  years as CEO of ExxonMobil--and we will talk about that in a moment-- strongly opposed this rule, almost by himself, with ExxonMobil as the  head of that company.   At Mr. Tillerson's confirmation hearing, Senator Kaine from Virginia  introduced into the record a 2008 report by Republican Senate Foreign  Relations Committee staff. That report was the basis--Republican staff,  I assume at the behest of Senator Lugar and others--that report was the  basis for what eventually became section 1504 of Dodd-Frank, known as  the bipartisan Cardin-Lugar amendment to fight corruption in mineral- rich developing countries. That report concluded that many resource- rich countries are poor because their vast mineral resources often  breed corruption. That corruption lines the pockets of the  kleptocrats--read ``thieves''--increases poverty, increases hunger, and  increases instability.   As Senator Lugar said:         Paradoxically, history shows that rather than a blessing,       energy reserves can be a bane for many poor countries,       leading to fraud, corruption, wasteful spending, military       adventurism and instability. Too often, oil money that should       go to a nation's poor ends up in the pockets of the rich or       is squandered on the trappings of power and massive showcase       projects instead of being invested productively and       equitably.    That is called the resource curse. It prevails all over the world  today. For example, oil-rich Venezuela is running out of food and  medicine. Resource-rich Nigeria is in an economic mess wracked by  terrorism and poverty. Armed groups have fought for years  [[Page S636]]  over mineral wealth in the Congo and elsewhere in Africa.   Resource-rich countries in Asia have similar problems. The natural  resource sector in so many countries is famously corrupt--the world's  single most corrupt industry, according to the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development. But oil companies can no longer  hide behind the excuse of confidentiality. Increasingly, companies are  expected to disclose what they pay in taxes and other payments to  governments whose natural resources they extract. That is what this  language from Senator Lugar, Senator Cardin, and Senator Leahy did.  That is what the rule does. That is what we should do. This Congress  wants to undo that. This is now required under the laws of the United  States and 30 other countries, as well as international initiatives. In  other words, what we did here was followed by 30 other countries, and a  number of more responsible energy companies, I would say, passed this  language and began to implement these laws.   The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is a global  standard that aims to put information about government revenues from  natural resource deals into the public domain in 51 countries,  including ours. This includes telling us what taxes the companies pay,  which is key to ensuring citizens know what benefits they get--from  Venezuela or Nigeria or Congo--from their own natural resources.   Let me offer some concrete examples of the kind of corruption we are  talking about. This just turns your stomach.   In Equatorial Guinea, according to anti-corruption groups, oil  companies, including Exxon, have had a long history of problems on this  front. The regime of President-for-life Obiang, who executed his brutal  uncle to gain power almost 40 years ago, has been tarnished with  allegations of corruption, cronyism, brutal political repression,  routine human rights violations, and drug trafficking for years and  years.   Years ago, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  released a report and held a public hearing which revealed that a  number of oil companies--again, ExxonMobil; they keep coming up in  this--were making direct payments into an account in the name of the  Republic of Equatorial Guinea located at Riggs Bank in Washington, DC.  Virtually all of the money in the account, tens of millions of dollars,  consisted of royalties and other payments from oil companies,  primarily--surprise--ExxonMobil, to the country of Equatorial Guinea  for the right to explore and produce oil in that country. But instead  of paying the money to the government or the national treasury of  Equatorial Guinea, the companies sent the money to the account at Riggs  Bank. That account was controlled by President-for-life Obiang and two  of his relatives. The account signatories were the President-for-life,  his son, and his nephew. Imagine that. Instead of paying the national  treasury, the oil companies made payments into this account in another  country, controlled by a dictator and his relatives. I can't believe we  in this body support that. How could the citizens of Equatorial Guinea  know how much royalty money was coming in for their oil in their  country and where it was going when it was in a secret account  controlled by a dictator? The answer, obviously, is they couldn't.   The report from the PSI--the committee that investigated--documented  that some of the funds from that account were used to make suspicious  transactions. The United States then investigated the President-for- life's family finances. Prosecutors noted that President-for-life  Obiang's son ``received an official government salary of less than  $100,000 a year but used his position and influence as a government  minister to amass more than $300 million worth of assets through  corruption and money laundering.'' He paid himself $100,000 but found a  way to amass $300 million more--all in violation of the laws of his  country and our country both.   In 2014, the son settled a case brought by Federal prosecutors. He  agreed to sell his $30 million mansion in Malibu, his Ferrari, and  various items of Michael Jackson memorabilia he had collected.   The New York Times reported earlier this month that he is still  working to delay his trial on corruption charges in France, where  prosecutors say he amassed a personal fortune of $115 million, which he  used to indulge his tastes.   When he served as Agriculture Minister of Equatorial Guinea,  prosecutors say he used his influence over the timber industry--next to  oil, the most important export industry in the country--to line his  pockets.   Last November, prosecutors in Switzerland seized luxury cars  belonging to him, and last month, at the request of the Swiss, the  Dutch authorities seized his 250-foot, $100 million yacht named the  ``Ebony Shine'' as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea. He said  the yacht belonged to his country's government. All the while, his  people are starving.   You can't make this stuff up. If the bill before us were adopted, the  Obiang family would be celebrating. They would be celebrating in  Washington, in California, and in Equatorial Guinea.   In Nigeria, again according to Global Witness, a major oil deal  struck by--surprise--ExxonMobil with the Nigerian Government is being  investigated by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, a  law enforcement agency that investigates high-level corruption. The  probe centers on a protracted and controversial deal agreed to by  ExxonMobil and the Nigerian Government in 2009 to renew three lucrative  oil licenses, which at the time accounted for around a quarter of  Nigeria's entire oil production.   ExxonMobil agreed to pay $600 million to renew the licenses and  construct a powerplant at a cost of $900 million to the company, making  a total contribution of $1.5 billion. Yet documents suggest that the  Nigerian Government may have valued the licenses at $2.5 billion and  that the Chinese oil company CNOOC offered to pay $3.7 billion for the  same licenses--over six times the amount reportedly paid by ExxonMobil.   Other incredible and notorious examples abound. It would be reason  enough for us to act to try to help the millions of people around the  world who are victims of this corporate collusion, but in today's  world, the resource curse doesn't just impact far-off countries; it  affects Americans every day. It has empowered anti-American dictators  in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, situations which cost American lives and  American taxpayer dollars. It worsens global poverty, which can be a  seedbed and a fertile growing ground for terrorism against us and our  allies. It leads to the instability that threatens global oil supplies.  It raises gas prices at home.   That is why we need this rule--all of the above--to protect American  national security interests by combating the corruption and secrecy,  with all these oil companies at the table with them. That has caused  conflict, instability, and violent extremist movements in Africa and  the Middle East. As ISIS has demonstrated, nonstate actors benefit from  trading natural resources in order to finance their terrorist  operations.   Despite all this, the Republican-led House of Representatives, as  Senator Crapo said, voted yesterday to repeal this bipartisan  initiative--an initiative that holds Big Oil accountable and protects  the American people. Today, the Senate Republican leadership is  following suit. It is a little ironic in light of the fact that  Candidate Trump, at almost every rally in my State, almost every rally  in State after State after State where he was campaigning, talked about  draining the swamp.   Since the rule's creation, ExxonMobil, led by Mr. Tillerson--now the  Secretary of State--and Big Oil allies, such as the American Petroleum  Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation,  have fought to kill it.   Who else opposes this rule besides Senate Republicans, House  Republicans, and President Trump? There are the autocrats in Russia. We  know about the connections between Russia and the Secretary of State.  We don't know quite enough about the connections between our President  and President Putin because we can't get the President's tax returns.  We know something is going on. Everybody knows it. Nobody knows quite  what.    Who else opposes it? Autocrats in Iran, where Advisor Flynn made some  interesting and provocative comments today, autocrats in Venezuela,  autocrats in Africa with oil wells, gasfields,  [[Page S637]]  or copper mines who want to keep their payments a secret. It is working  for them. It is working for the autocrats. It is working for Exxon.  Apparently it is working for Republicans in the House and Senate too. I  am not sure exactly how, but I know it is working.   More than 30 countries--mostly the United States, Canada, and  European nations--have adopted similar anti-corruption standards.  Senator Lugar, Senator Leahy, and Senator Cardin's law passed as part  of Dodd-Frank, and the SEC is adopting this rule. More than 30 other  countries in the world followed our lead, and some of the more  responsible oil companies were prepared to comply. So to be clear, with  Europe and Canada in the same disclosure system, the playing field is  now level. It is working.   Many companies already report such payments under European rules and  are doing just fine, so this is hardly causing them undue burdens in  the regulatory framework that my colleagues like to talk about. That is  why many in industry support the rule, despite the actions of Exxon,  the bad actor here, and the CEO of Exxon--now, amazingly, our Secretary  of State.   BP and Shell--two major, large oil companies--have publicly endorsed  payment reporting and lining up U.S. rules with those in other markets.  Foreign and state-owned oil companies from China and Brazil, including  CNOOC, PetroChina, Sinopec, and Brazil's Petrobras, are required to  disclose under U.S. rules, leveling the playing field for U.S.  companies. Gazprom, Rosneft, BP, and Shell already report under UK  rules. The largest mining companies in the world, including Newmont  Mining, BHP Billiton, and Rio Tinto, have supported similar reporting.  Oil, gas, and mining workers unions, such as United Steelworkers, back  the rule.   Notice who doesn't back the rule: Exxon, the American Petroleum  Institute, and autocrats in Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.   Investors also support it--including investor groups with $10  trillion under management--so they can better understand and manage the  reputational, expropriation, sanction, and other risks facing firms in  which they invest. It is supported by the American Catholic bishops,  the Presbyterian Church--all kinds of religious groups.   Who is against it? Republicans in the House, Republicans in the  Senate, the President of the United States, ExxonMobil, the Secretary  of State, who used to be CEO of ExxonMobil, and autocrats in Iran and  Venezuela. We get the picture.   All these groups who care about justice, who care about fair play,  who care about doing business with predictable and fair rules, like BP  and Shell, all of them support it--Global Witness, the ONE Campaign,  Oxfam, and Publish What You Pay.   We need to be clear on one other thing my friend from Idaho said:  This rule won't cost a single American job. Everything oil companies  can legally do today is still allowed under the anti-corruption rule.  They only have to do one more thing: They have to report their numbers  to the Securities and Exchange Commission. How can that cost millions  of dollars?   The Cardin-Lugar rule makes Big Business and government more  transparent, fights corruption, and does it all without hurting  taxpayers. It is a creative approach to global problems that our  leaders did embrace until we had a President who wants to ``drain the  swamp,'' he says--should be embracing, not rejecting at the behest of  just a few actors.   Again, who is lobbying to overturn this rule? It is autocrats around  the world. It is Exxon. It is the American Petroleum Institute. It is a  very small number of companies, when so many people are on the other  side.   If we repeal this measure today, shareholders, investors, and poor  communities around the world will continue to see their money and  natural resources stolen by crooked oligarchs. We will be undoing the  moral leadership. This is in so many ways a moral question that Senator  Cardin, Senator Lugar, and Senator Leahy brought to us bipartisanly,  with broad support by both parties. We will be turning a blind eye to  corruption, we will be betraying our principles, and we will be  undercutting our allies in Europe and Canada who followed our lead and  crafted their own rules based on ours.   Under the terms of the Congressional Review Act, any future  ``substantially similar'' rule will be forever prohibited from being  written by the SEC. That makes no sense.   I hope this effort fails. I know my Republican colleagues understand  this because enough of my colleagues recognize the merits of this anti- corruption measure and they refuse to kowtow to the dinosaur wing of  Big Oil. It is not even all of Big Oil; it is the dinosaur wing of Big  oil. It is the autocrats. It is the American Petroleum Institute. It is  the Chamber of Commerce. It is ExxonMobil.   I thank Senator Cardin and Senator Leahy for their work, and I thank  former Senator Lugar from Indiana for the important work he did on this  measure.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from  Alaska--also from Cleveland--and those of my friend from Cincinnati,  Senator Portman, about opioids. I appreciate his leadership in my  State, the work he has done, and the work we have done together on  opioid addiction. It is a tragedy, and I don't go much of anywhere in  the State without finding someone who is affected, someone who is  addicted in a family, or a close friend who has died.   As Senator Portman said, Ohio has more opioid deaths than any State  in the country. We are the seventh largest State, but the State with  the most deaths. It is troubling, and clearly we are not dealing with  it as well as we should.   Mr. President, I rise to close the debate on this motion today on the  Congressional Review Act to wipe out the SEC rule. I rise in opposition  to the bill, as a number of colleagues on my side of the aisle have  very strong feelings on it. With the exception of my friend from Idaho,  the chairman of the Banking Committee, there weren't many Republicans  who wanted to come to the floor for this, in part because I think it is  just the supporters they have on their side don't make you want to rush  to the floor and support them. Some called this the Kleptocrat Relief  Act. I will give you a real quick history before I wrap up.    There is a provision in Dodd-Frank to deal with giving the President  and others the best anticorruption tools we could have around the  world, where countries that have lots of natural resources have been  countries with all the wealth from natural resources. They are some of  the most corrupt governments with some of the worst poverty anywhere on  Earth.   This legislation in Dodd-Frank, and the rule that came out of it from  the SEC, was going a long way to preventing corruption. What we saw was  the support. Thirty countries in the world followed suit from our  country. The companies that were affected, with a few very notable  exceptions, were beginning to do what they knew they needed to do and  should have done and that the rule called for. As a result, we were  going in the right direction until this new administration, this new  Congress.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record relevant  letters from investors.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    August 14, 2013.      Mary Jo White,      Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman White: As investors representing more than       US$5.6 trillion in assets under management, we commend the       U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its       leadership in producing final rules for the implementation of       Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act (Section 1504). The  [[Page S652]]       rules were carefully considered and reflected investors'       substantial interest in oil, gas and mining industry payment       transparency. The SEC's leadership encouraged the development       of a public global disclosure standard that includes the       European Union Transparency Directive and regulation under       development in Canada.        On July 2, the U.S. District Court for the District of       Columbia made a ruling in American Petroleum Institute et al.       vs. Securities and Exchange Commission vacating the rules for       the implementation of Section 1504 and requiring the       Commission to review them. We encourage the SEC to continue       its vigorous defense of the Section 1504 rules as it responds       to the'U.S. District Court's decision.        It is in the interest of investors and companies subject to       both the U.S. and EU requirements that the reporting       obligations in these jurisdictions are as uniform as       possible. Consistent and predictable regulations may lower       compliance costs and enhance the salience of disclosures.       Therefore, we hope that the SEC will take all necessary steps       to ensure that the rules go into effect as early as possible       and that they maintain continuity with regulations in other       jurisdictions. In doing so, the SEC should have due regard to       the lengthy deliberations it conducted before the       promulgation of the rules, and the inputs from diverse       constituencies including many investors.        Payment disclosure regulations, such as Section 1504 and       the European Union Transparency Directive, play a critical       role in encouraging greater stability in resource-rich       countries, which benefits both the citizens of those       countries and investors. The Extractive Industries       Transparency Initiative (EITI) Board Chair Clare Short has       stated that mandatory payment disclosure regulations would       ``strengthen the local accountability EITI provides.'' In       fact, the latest revision of the EITI standard explicitly       made project level payment disclosure contingent on alignment       with SEC and EU regulation. We encourage the SEC to keep the       complementary nature of regulations such as Section 1504 and       EITI in mind as it considers its response to the U.S.       District Court.        Investors depend on the SEC's leadership and deliberate       consideration of disclosure requirements that protect       investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and       facilitate capital formation. We commend the Commission on       issuing rules for the implementation of Section 1504 that       reflect thorough contemplation of these factors and are       confident the SEC will continue to act in the interest of       investors as it responds to the U.S. District Court's July 2       ruling in API vs. SEC.                                   ____                                                     April 28, 2014.      Mary Jo White,      Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington,           DC.    Re: Section 1504 of the Dodd--Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer                               Protection Act         Dear Chair White: We write on behalf of the 34 undersigned       institutional investors to convey our strong support for the       leadership the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)       has shown in producing final rules for the implementation of       Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act [Section 13(q) of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934]. This letter follows up on a prior       submission made to the SEC on August 14th 2013 on this       subject and signed by many of the institutions below.        By way of introduction, the signatories of this submission       manage assets that collectively total more than US$ 6.40       trillion, and our mandate is to deliver sustainable long-term       returns to our pensions, insurance and savings clients. It is       in this spirit that we wish to contribute our views on the       value to investors of improving transparency and governance       in the extractives sector through regulations such as Section       1504. We also welcome the parallel submission by Calvert       Investment Management et al, and note the common objectives       our respective groups of signatories share in promoting high       standards of transparency in the extractives sector.        We would like to highlight that we have only belatedly       become aware of the detailed submission made on April 15,       2014 by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on this       subject. Inasmuch as we had produced this statement, and       secured approvals from the undersigned institutions, well       before having had an opportunity to review the API       submission, we wish to draw your attention to a brief       supplementary comment that several of our signatories will       shortly be submitting by way of parallel submission in order       to address any additional points that are relevant to the       API's arguments.        The undersigned signatories strongly support the Extractive       Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). As such, we not       only welcome the US's involvement as an EITI Supporting       Country since the Initiative's inception in 2003, but are       particularly pleased to note its recent admission as an EITI       Candidate Country. We regard the United States' decision as       instrumental in establishing the de facto global standard for       transparency in the extractives sector, and see the steady       progress being made as a critical factor in helping to reduce       volatility in the oil and other vital hard commodity markets,       with beneficial impacts on global financial markets and the       real economy.        In line with our support for the EITI, we also highlight       that we regard the mandatory project-level reporting       provision contained in Section 1504 as entirely consistent       with, and complementary to, the goals of the EFL As such, we       wish to underscore the important revisions made in 2013 to       the EITI Standard that aim specifically to ensure convergence       with the disclosure standard pioneered by Section 1504. These       are now echoed in similar legislation already passed by the       European Union (Transparency and Accounting Directives) and       in progress in Canada (Canadian Mandatory Reporting in the       Extractive Sector).        In short, Section 1504 started a process that has now been       embraced by the world's other key jurisdictions: where       initially it could have placed US listed companies at a       commercial disadvantage, this risk has been reduced. As       institutions based in numerous international jurisdictions,       with both customers and assets spread around the globe, we       welcome this virtuous development, and consider that       regulations favouring not only high, but just as importantly,       globally consistent standards of transparency, are essential       to safeguarding the effective functioning of the financial       markets.        Finally, we highlight that our portfolios have substantial       exposure to the global extractives sector, through both       equity and fixed income instruments, and that many of the       undersigned also invest actively in the sovereign debt of       resource-dependent emerging nations whose fiscal governance       has a direct bearing on the quality of the credits they hold.       It is therefore specifically with a view to safeguarding and       enhancing our clients' portfolio returns that we contribute       the following comments.        Chair White, your fellow SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar       has recently been reported to have voiced the concern that       Section 1504 may have involved a degree of legislative       overreach, by allowing ``special interests, from all parts of       the political spectrum that are trying to co-opt the SEC's       corporate disclosure regime to achieve their own       objectives.'' Commissioner Piwowar raises a valid point that       merits discussion: as investors whose interests are       inextricably bound with the commercial interests of the oil       and mining companies in which we invest, we wish to clarify       that we fully agree that the remit of the SEC is, and should       remain, that of safeguarding the efficient functioning of       financial markets. We also agree that legislative and       regulatory tools aimed at achieving purely social aims       properly belong within instruments other than SEC       regulation.        However, it is our contention that Section 1504, in line       with the broader purpose of the Dodd Frank Act, i.e.       mitigating systemic financial market risk, plays an essential       role in containing behaviours related to extractive sector       activity that contribute to damaging levels of financial and       economic instability.        As you know, Section 1504 calls for the provision of       detailed publicly-available information regarding payments to       government. The purpose of such disclosure is to: a) defuse       suspicions by civil society; b) curb the incidence of       corruption and fiscal mismanagement; c) and thereby reduce       the social and political risk factors that drive high levels       of operating risk in resource-dependent emerging nations. The       latter notably exacerbates the volatility and risk in the       commodities markets. It is precisely because of its role in       helping to counteract these damaging pressures that we regard       Section 1504 as very much in the interests of investors, and       consistent with the basic mission of the SEC.        Nevertheless, as investors, we are sympathetic to the       concerns of industry regarding the practical impacts of any       new legislation in terms of potential administrative       complexity and cost burden, particularly in respect of       companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions. As such, it       is imperative that the disclosure regulations introduced by       Section 1504 reflect alignment between the US, EU and       Canada--all key jurisdictions for extractive industry       issuers. Firstly, this would simplify compliance for       extractive companies, particularly for those that already       have dual listings. Secondly, it would lift overall       transparency standards while deterring less scrupulous       issuers from actively seeking out more opaque regulatory       regimes. Such `forum-shopping' would not only harm well-      governed companies through unfair competition, but expose       investors to higher risk, and the general public to greater       systemic risk.        Our strong interest as investors is therefore to achieve       both consistency across competing jurisdictions and high       standards, rather than regarding them as necessarily mutually       exclusive. In this regard, the moves by the EU and Canada to       follow in Dodd Frank 1504's footsteps signal a clear trend       that is now very difficult to reverse: transparency has       firmly taken hold, and it would be a mistake to roll       backwards.        As a large group of diverse investment institutions, we       acknowledge that different investors may make greater or       lesser use of the granular data produced through such       disclosure for individual stock decision purposes, depending       on the nature of their portfolios and investment processes.       However, while individual investment strategies may differ,       we are strongly of the view that disclosure of the type       called for by Section 1504 affords the following benefits to       investors:        Putting such information in the public domain is of major       indirect benefit to investors, thanks to its impact on the       overall quality of the business climate: better transparency       helps to build trust with the citizenry, deter corruption       through better scrutiny of revenues and spending, and reduce  [[Page S653]]       the likelihood of contract rescissions. An anonymous       compilation of the submissions required by Section 1504 would       likely not provide the information necessary to serve this       purpose.        The value of such a standard lies in its consistent       application across all global markets: this means that       country exemptions should not be granted in cases where       foreign jurisdictions wish to impose secrecy--otherwise, such       exemptions, often referred to as the ``tyrant's veto'', will       merely serve to encourage such governments to introduce anti-      transparency standards, thereby undermining the very object       of this regulation.        The impact of such disclosure on competitiveness has been       overstated, as demonstrated by the strong support afforded to       Section 1504's Canadian equivalent by the leading trade       associations in the Canadian mining sector (Mining       Association of Canada and Prospectors and Developers       Association of Canada), and the more nuanced position of the       Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers relative to the       American Petroleum Institute. We also note that this       information can be easily obtained by purchasing specialist       research--which merely ensures that it is available to       competitors who can afford to pay, but not to citizens who       cannot. More importantly, as investors, we stand to benefit       more from efficient, competitive markets that enable ethical       behaviour than we do from isolated instances of companies       gaining a temporary negotiating advantage through secrecy.        The impact on companies' compliance costs should be given       due consideration, and we would therefore urge that with       regard to the definition of `project', the disclosure       framework in Section 1504 be consistent with best practice       for disclosing disaggregated production information that       references the legal relationship between individual projects       and host governments. Such an approach may be modeled on the       project-level disclosures that have been developed under the       EU Directives and also made by Statoil, the large Norwegian-      based international oil company, as well as Tullow Oil, the       FTSE100 UK oil company. These base their definition, either       implicitly or explicitly, on economic rather than geological       entities (so-called `payment liability'), which we regard as       a cost-efficient way of mirroring internal corporate       reporting. We recommend a single consistent standard in       preference to allowing companies to self-define project       boundaries for two reasons: 1) a multiplicity of reporting       standards would cause confusion and drive up compliance       costs; 2) flexibility for companies would also risk       undermining the aim of the regulation. Such a standard should       also require a consistent and reasonable degree of       disaggregation, as this would meet the aims of the       regulation, namely improving fiscal governance at both       national and subnational level.        In conclusion, we are pleased to signal our strong support       for the SEC's leadership in establishing a mandatory       reporting standard in the extractives sector that is       complementary to the EITI, aligned with equivalent standards       in the EU and Canada, and designed pragmatically to deliver       the very real benefits that we see coming from enhancing       fiscal transparency and accountability in resource-dependent       emerging nations. The SEC has demonstrated great diligence in       appreciating the changing needs of investors through the       implementation of Section 1504. We remain confident that the       Commission will see the process through to a conclusion that       fulfills its mission and advances the interests of all its       stakeholders.        We thank you for your attention to this submission, and       remain at your disposal for any further information or       clarification.                                   ____                                                     April 28, 2014.      Mary Jo White,      Chair, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chair White: As investors representing more than $2.85       trillion in assets under management, we applaud the U.S.       Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its leadership       in producing final rules for the implementation of Section       1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act [Section 13(q) of the Securities Exchange Act       of 1934]. The rules the SEC adopted for the implementation of       Section 13(q) on August 22, 2012 would protect investors and       promote efficient capital markets by providing investors with       valuable factual information on risk profiles and company       performance. Delay in implementation of these rules or their       significant revision would continue to deny investors this       valuable information.        The opportunities and challenges of both operating and       investing in the oil, gas and mining industries have changed       significantly in recent decades as companies have been       increasingly compelled to explore and produce in countries       with challenging governance and business environments,       including some with pervasive corruption. We believe that       Section 13(q) creates a chance for disclosure requirements to       evolve in a manner that reflects the changing dynamics of       these industries.        Investors' decisions regarding the oil, gas and mining       industries and the efficient functioning of markets in       general rely on the public disclosure of relevant information       from issuers that is comprehensive and consistent. Therefore,       we agree with the Commission's August 2012 rules for Section       13(q) that require issuer-by-issuer, government-level, and       project-level public disclosures and believe that these are       beneficial to investors.        Issuers' annual public Exchange Act reporting is an       indispensable factor for investment decision-making. It must       be done on a basis that allows investors to make decisions       about the securities of individual issuers. An anonymous       compilation of the submissions required by Section 13(q)       would likely not provide the information necessary to serve       this purpose. It is in the interest of both investors and       issuers that the data disclosed pursuant to Section 13(q)       maintains consistency across each issuer's operations.       Following the enactment of Section 13(q), other jurisdictions       have responded with complementary regulatory efforts, most       notably the European Union Accounting and Transparency       Directives and Canada's commitment to establish mandatory       payment transparency reporting standards. Consistency with       these reporting mandates requires payment information for all       countries in which issuers operate, without exception.        Section 13(q) and its complementing regulations also       require project-level disclosure. It would be most beneficial       to investors if this disclosure were consistent with best       practice for disclosing disaggregated production information       that references the legal relationship between individual       projects and host governments. Such an approach may be       modeled on the project-level disclosures made by Statoil, the       large Norwegian-based international oil company, as well as       Tullow Oil.        The SEC has demonstrated great diligence in appreciating       the changing needs of investors through the implementation of       Section 13(q). We also welcome the parallel comment submitted       by Allianz Global Investors et al., and note the common       objectives our respective groups of signatories share in       promoting high standards of transparency in the extractives       sector. We remain confident that the Commission will see the       process through to a conclusion that fulfills its obligations       and advances the interests of all parties.     Mr. President, on one side of this argument, one side of  this rule, we see in the end--and this kind of sums it up. We have  these 30 countries that followed us and passed the rules and the laws  the same as we did. We have on our side, the American Catholic Bishops,  the Conference of Bishops, the Presbyterian Church, groups like the One  Campaign and Oxfam--public interest groups that made their mission  trying to end corruption and deal with the economic and social distress  and devastation brought on by some of these companies and some of these  kleptomaniacal--for want of a better term--governments. That is on the  one side.   On the other side, we have my Republican friends in the Senate and  House. We have Rex Tillerson, the new Secretary of State, who lobbied  vigorously and unceasingly against this rule as president of Exxon. We  have Exxon on the other side. We have the Chamber of Commerce and the  American Petroleum Institute. And on that side for this bill--against  the rule--we have autocrats in places like Russia, Iran, Venezuela. You  can bet on this vote tomorrow morning, if 7 a.m. comes out the way it  looks like it will, you can bet there will be celebrations in Russia,  in Iran, and Venezuela, in all these countries where these kleptocrats,  where these leaders who are so corrupt, where they benefited so much.   I think that really sums it up, how important it is that we defeat  this bill, how important it is that this President, who came to town  and has been in office less than about 2 weeks, his second week in  office--his campaign was all about drain the swamp, and one of the  first things he did, with his Republican House and Senate Members  following along like sheep, they have done this. It is just incredible  how they moved so quickly to side with the autocrats, to side with the  Russians, to side with Big Oil, to side with ExxonMobil and these  autocrats in places like Iran and Russia. It is not a good commentary  on this body. I am sorry to see it.   I ask my colleagues to vote no.   I yield back my time.
