 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Lowey and Ranking Member  Granger for this opportunity to speak today on this appropriations  legislation.   The bill before us right now provides crucial funding for our  Nation's military, giving our soldiers their biggest pay raise in a  decade and providing resources they need to win on the battlefield.   It is a strong complement to the next bill coming up today, where we  will fund the Army Corps of Engineers and pass through Congress  historic progress at the Soo Locks, funding the construction of a new  lock that will be vital to shipping on the Great Lakes and for American  manufacturing.   American manufacturing is responsible for millions of jobs, and this  legislation also supports hardworking men and women across our Nation  with the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.                                time  1200    Constituents across my district have told me how this program does  crucial work to support the production of Michigan-made goods.   Another issue I know my constituents are concerned about is the  opioid crisis and the threat of fentanyl to our communities. This  legislation funds efforts at our Nation's borders, where officials have  already stopped thousands of pounds of fentanyl and heroin from  entering our country. The opioid epidemic requires a robust effort from  all levels of government, as well as law enforcement and medical  professionals.   The next bill also helps in this fight, with record funding for the  NIH, which will support research into nonaddictive treatments for pain,  as well as the fight against cancer and Alzheimer's.   Finally, this bill funds Great Lakes monitoring at NOAA in the  Commerce Department, which, along with the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative, does outstanding work to protect our Great Lakes. The GLRI  works with State and local government, conservation groups and research  universities, including Central Michigan University in my district.  This year, the GLRI is receiving $320 million in the legislation that  is coming up next, and I know it will help protect the Great Lakes for  future generations.   I am grateful for the support for many of these priorities from our  colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee, including leadership  on both sides and, particularly, for my friend from Ohio, Marcy Kaptur,  who visited the Soo Locks with me and officials from the Army Corps  this summer.
