 Mr. Speaker, March is Women's History  Month, and I am grateful to recognize inspirational women who have  achieved success.   Inspirational women are the University of South Carolina's basketball  team, who won a sixth SEC title in 7 years, the first time that has  been done in SEC history. Congratulations to these talented women for  remaining number one.   This game was also historic because it was the first time two Black  head coaches met in a conference championship game with Coach Dawn  Staley leading the Gamecocks and Coach Joni Taylor leading Georgia, an  important milestone in American sports history.   Best wishes to the Gamecock women in the NCAA tournament.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Hatsy Young, widow of former  Congressman Ed Young from Florence.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, amendment No. 19 amends  section 111 and replaces the text with the National Right to Work Act.  Section 111 takes away the freedoms of hardworking Americans and  overrules State right-to-work laws of 27 States enthusiastically  enacted by voters.   American workers should not be forced to pay fees to a labor  organization. American workers should not be forced to have a union  represent them. American workers should not be forced to have their  money go to political candidates they do not support. American workers  deserve freedom, and this amendment delivers that.   Right-to-work States like South Carolina have seen firsthand the job  creation and robust economy that develops when we expand freedom for  jobs. It was crucial for South Carolina in our journey to become the  leading manufacturer and exporter of tires with Michelin, Bridgestone,  Continental, and Giti, while also being the largest exporter of cars in  the United States with BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes vans.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to call up H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from  behind screens and back in the classroom.
