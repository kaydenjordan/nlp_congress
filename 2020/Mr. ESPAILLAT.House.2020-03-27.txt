 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CARES Act.   Mr. Speaker, it would be criminal not to support billions of dollars  for our hospitals and healthcare workers. It would be criminal not to  support billions of dollars for our small businesses that will be  struggling. It would be criminal not to support help for working  families, $1,200 for individuals, $500 for a child.   But it is also criminal to leave out immigrants. They clean our  houses and take care of our children and the elderly.   It is also criminal to shortchange New York, which has become the  epicenter of this epidemic. The delay of ventilators and PPEs has also  been criminal.   Remember, all of you: New York is your future.
