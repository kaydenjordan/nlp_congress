 Madam President, what is the weather like in Las Vegas?  What is it like in Reno? I am not sure, but I will bet it is hot. And  the reason I am sure that it is likely to be hot is the weather  forecast.   I looked at that map, and it was solid red in the western half of the  United States, with extreme high temperatures at a level never  recorded. They said in the city of Seattle, there have only been a  handful of times that they have had temperatures over 100 degrees in  that city. It is going to happen again this weekend, at least that is  the prediction. That is the weather forecast.   It is not just confined to the blue coastal States, as some call  them. We have a drought in the Midwest. I hope it ends soon, but when  it comes to corn country--Iowa, Illinois, Indiana--we are worried. I  hope it doesn't happen, but it could, and we know it can happen soon.  And then in the southeastern part of the United States, there are  extreme storms--rains they haven't seen before.   I just say that after listening to the Republican leader describe the  situation with the environment, wondering if he reads the papers or  talks to people back home because extreme weather is happening all over  the United States, and it isn't just in Republican areas or Democratic  areas; it is virtually everywhere.   So when President Biden comes in and says: Shouldn't we do something  about this for the good of our children and our grandchildren?  Shouldn't we be willing to sacrifice a little bit? Shouldn't we be  willing to change some if it means that they are going to have a planet  that is worth living on--about 10 years ago, I started asking my  farmers who come and visit me from Illinois a couple of questions.  These are good people. They never vote for me, I know that, but I still  like meeting with them. They are good people. They bring their wives.  They dress up in their suits. They take it seriously. They are coming  to Washington. This is before COVID-19, of course. And they would sit  upstairs in my conference room. There would be about 20 or 30 of them  from organizations like the Farm Bureau or the corn growers or the  soybean growers. And I would say to them--this is 10 years ago--how  many of you believe that what we are doing on Earth is changing the  environment of the Earth we live on? I mean that our human activity is  having something to do with it. And I would ask for a show of hands.  And the response was, not one hand would go up.   And I finally said to them: Well, things are changing. What do you  think is behind all of it? And one fellow said--and he did this  seriously, and I believe he was speaking from the heart--he said:  ``Senator, some years God sends me a drought; some years God sends me a  flood; I got to deal with whatever God sends me.''   I respect him for that. That is his deep-hearted belief, and it is  sincere.   But I think there is more to the story. And now when I ask these same  farmers the same question, I get a different response. The Illinois  corn growers, looking around, thinking something is happening here in  this wonderful, bountiful State that I live in. The crops that are  grown traditionally are not producing what they did traditionally,  unless some hybrid seeds and other fertilizers are being used. There  [[Page S4710]]  are new weather conditions and it is changing every year and it is not  getting better. It is getting dryer and hotter.   So when Joe Biden starts talking about the next generation of energy  in America, I think about my granddaughter, ``Little Jo.'' I think  about Jo, and I am wondering what kind of world she is going to live in  and what I am going to do about it.   One thing that President Biden said was, we are moving toward  electric vehicles. You would think that it was some Federal mandate  that is bringing this on. But if you read the newspapers, you know it  isn't. General Motors has accelerated the timetable to go to electric  vehicles, Ford as well. They see the writing on the wall.   What we currently use for transportation will not be what we use in  10 or 15 years. It is going to change. We are going to move to electric  vehicles for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is there are  fewer emissions, greenhouse gas emissions.   The country of Norway just announced last week that over 50 percent  of their vehicles are electric vehicles. If you had been there in the  recent past, you see Teslas in every direction, electric vehicles in  every direction.   I spoke to the Ambassador from Norway, and I said: How did that  happen? How did you move to a point where more than half the vehicles  in Norway are electric vehicles?   She said: Tax breaks. We gave them tax breaks. And all of a sudden,  everyone had a new lifestyle with electric vehicles. And they think  that protects them in the future or at least holds the possibility of  reducing the pollution that they are dealing with, and I think they are  right. So does Joe Biden. But when we get into an infrastructure debate  with Republicans, the first thing they say is: Take electric vehicles  off the table. We don't want to even talk about it. No subsidies, no  encouragement for those.    Traditionally, we have been encouraging oil companies, with all sorts  of tax breaks throughout their history, to continue to explore and grow  in size and make a lot of money. But the notion of encouraging electric  vehicles is somehow heretical to our friends on the Republican side. I  think it is very shortsighted.   I think we should look at the obvious. I tell this story, and it is  worth repeating. Six years ago, we had an auto plant in Normal, IL-- yes, that is the name of it: Normal, IL. Six years ago, Mitsubishi  closed their auto plant. There were more than 1,000 people working  there, and there was that big sprawling complex just off of Interstate  55. Every time you took that interstate and looked out there, you  thought: That is going to be there forever. That building is just going  to deteriorate and be there forever.   Well, guess what. A year after they closed, the mayor of Normal, IL,  whose name is Chris Koos--a wonderful mayor--called me and said:  Senator, I think I have a buyer for the Mitsubishi plant.   I said: What kind of buyer?   He said: There is a man who wants to build electric vehicles. He came  down and took a look, and he liked that plant. He said it was way too  big for his purposes, but he is actually thinking of building electric  vehicles in the old Mitsubishi plant.   Darned if it didn't happen. The company is called Rivian. They bought  that plant, and they started building electric vehicles--just this  month, officially, in production.   How many workers will they have? Up to 4,000, maybe even 5,000. Will  they be able to use the whole plant? They are now building an addition  to the plant. Is it a viable company? Is it going to last? Well,  obviously Amazon thinks so because they have invested a billion dollars  in Rivian. And the companies are coming from all around thinking this  is the future.   So I say to the Senator from Kentucky, yes, there will be transitions  in jobs, but there are job opportunities at Rivian and places just like  that. Lion Electric is another company. It came in from Canada. They  build electric buses. One of the things we are envisioning is moving  toward electric schoolbuses across America. That is a big move. This is  a company that builds them.   We need more just like it, and there are going to be good-paying jobs  associated with it.   EVBox is a company out of the Netherlands, located in my State again.  They build the charging stations.   Closing your eyes to the opportunities here is very shortsighted.  Things are changing, and changing for the better. And because there is  change, it doesn't mean it is bad for everybody. There are transitions,  and we ought to help with educating people, preparing them for the new  jobs.   But if you look around at this world and what is happening with the  weather patterns and the environment, how shortsighted it would be for  us to say to our kids and grandkids: Well, we had a chance back in 2021  to do something about it, but we decided it just might make people  uneasy to think about that much change.   Well, I feel uneasy about the change that is coming if we do nothing.  It is going to be a dramatic change for the worse for our kids.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another topic, this notion that Joe  Biden is being pushed around by Vladimir Putin--the Senator who made  that statement on the floor, or one just like it, has he ignored what  happened over the last 4 years?   Every time the President of the United States, Donald Trump, would  meet with Vladimir Putin, they would ask the translators to leave the  room, the people from the intelligence agencies to leave the room, and  they would just play pat-a-cake. I mean, we know what was going on  there. There was some sort of political bromance between the President  and Vladimir Putin.   I don't believe that is ever going to happen with Joe Biden. He is a  realist. He made it clear that he went in that meeting with Putin to  lay down the law in terms of infiltrating our elections in the future  and the activities that we have seen in hacking and cyber crimes.   That is the kind of leadership we need in dealing with Vladimir  Putin.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I want to speak about two really  highly qualified judicial nominees the Senate Judiciary Committee came  up with through the White House   The first is Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, who has been nominated to an  Illinois seat on the Seventh Circuit. With her qualifications,  temperament, and range of experience, she is outstanding.   She is the daughter of two judges. Her father, Raymond Jackson, is a  Federal district court judge, and her mother, Gwendolyn Jones Jackson,  is a retired State court judge.   She went to Princeton and then Yale Law School--not bad. She clerked  for Judge David Coar on the U.S. District Court for the Northern  District and for Roger Gregory on the Fourth Circuit.   After her clerkships, she worked in private practice, and then she  made an interesting career decision, and not many people make it. She  decided to stop practicing in the private practice of law and become a  staff attorney at the Federal Defender Program for the Northern  District of Illinois, representing people who couldn't afford counsel.   Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi spent 10 years as a Federal public defender. She  defended hundreds of indigent clients at every stage of the legal  process. She is a real lawyer. She knows that courtroom inside and out,  and she knows the legal process as well.   Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi's experience and perspective on the criminal  justice system will be an asset in the Seventh Circuit. If she is  approved, she will be the second woman of color to be in that circuit.  It is about time.   Her skills and legal expertise will be invaluable. She received a  ``well qualified'' rating by the ABA.   She has a great temperament. One of our Senators on the Judiciary  Committee tried to trap her with a question, seeing just whether she  knew enough about the law. When it was all over, I think he was  satisfied that she did.   She spoke to the fact that her mother taught her how important it is  for judges to listen and for litigants to be heard. This is a  fundamental principle  [[Page S4711]]  in our system of justice. She is going to devote her life to defending  the rule of law in the future, as she has in the past. I really think  she is going to be extraordinary.   The second nominee the Senate will vote on this week has my strong  support as well, Judge Deborah Boardman, nominated to the U.S. District  Court for the District of Maryland.   She serves as a U.S. magistrate judge in the Maryland District Court.  Like Jackson-Akiwumi, she has received a ``well qualified'' rating from  the ABA. She, too, will bring diversity to the courts.   She spent 11 years as a Federal public defender herself. She is  bringing a perspective which is often not found in these court cases  with sitting judges. I have nothing against former prosecutors. I have  named a lot of them to the bench. But we ought to have diversity in  background, experience, and the like.   She has experience in private practice. She is a dedicated public  servant, and I hope my colleagues will support her.                            ____________________     Madam President, I watched television Sunday night with  my wife. There was a movie called ``Selma.'' Oprah Winfrey had  something to do with it because she was in it, and it was, as you might  expect, a quality production.   It told the story of what happened in 1965 in Selma, AL. It showed  the horrific images of Americans being beaten and brutalized in Selma  for daring to protest peacefully. For what? For the right to vote.   Fewer people know about Turnaround Tuesday. That was the day, 2 days  after Bloody Sunday, when many of the same people who had been beaten  on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday went back to that bridge  to make it plain that they were going to come back again and again  until every right of every citizen to vote was secured. That was  Turnaround Tuesday.   I had a lucky experience. The late John Lewis, who marched across  that Edmund Pettus Bridge and almost gave his life in the process, took  me, one foggy Sunday morning, for a walk across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, and he told me what he remembered from that day.   I have seen pictures over and over again. There he is in his white  raincoat, with a backpack, marching in the front of the line, and how  he was bashed in the head by either a trooper or someone who came along  trying to stop them from marching. He almost died as a result of it. It  was something I will never forget. I feel blessed that I had that  experience.   And then there was the vote on the floor yesterday. What a  disappointment. Today, I want to say it is ``welcome back'' Wednesday.  Welcome back to the fight to preserve voting rights that has never  ended.   It didn't start on that bridge in Selma, and it won't end in this  Chamber in Washington. This battle is going to continue because there  are those people who know that if you want to control America  politically, you have got to control those who vote.   We saw it after the Civil War, when we ended slavery and African  Americans initially had an opportunity to vote and lead in Southern  States. And then, sad to report, my political party, the Democratic  Party at that time, was part of initiating the Jim Crow laws, which  made it difficult, if not impossible, to vote.   And the battle was on, and it is being waged to this day, about  whether or not African Americans have a right to vote. Make no mistake.  When Republicans come to the floor and go through these long, elaborate  explanations of why a coordinated effort by Republican legislatures in  20 different States is just good government, I think they know better.  It is not good government, and it is not good for the people of those  States, particularly if you are a minority.   Well, this fight to prevent billionaires from buying elections and  root out corruption in government didn't end with that filibuster  yesterday. Republicans succeeded in delaying this debate for a time,  but they are not going to derail it. This is too important. Our  democracy is on the line.    Five months ago--I am sure Madam President will never forget it, as I  won't--a murderous mob--five people died--a murderous mob attacked this  Capitol and tried to overturn the Presidential election.   Who sent them? Well, it is clear to me who sent them: a vain, self- pitying former President who couldn't accept defeat or the will of the  American people. So Donald Trump created a Big Lie that the election  was stolen. He used that lie to incite that mob to attack this Capitol.  He continues to peddle the Big Lie from his exile at some country club.   Now the party that coddled that failed President when he was in power  is weaponizing the Big Lie and using it to justify a relentless attack  on voting rights across America.   Three weeks ago, Senate Republicans used the filibuster to kill a  bill creating an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate who  was behind this January 6 insurrection. They killed it with the  filibuster, just as they tried to kill the voting rights bill  yesterday. That filibuster is an echo, sadly, of how it has been used  in the area of civil rights for as long as it has been in the Senate.   This Big Lie is metastasizing; it is growing. Instead of stopping it,  Republicans are using all their leverage to prevent us from confronting  it. The filibuster yesterday was day one of this fight. It wasn't the  end of the story.   Welcome to day two. We mean to keep marching until we cross that  bridge and stop this assault on our democracy and put an end to the Big  Lie once and for all.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, last week, I told the story of a mother  who received critical support from an organization called Life Span in  Chicago after her daughter was sexually assaulted by the mother's  husband. The services provided by Life Span were paid for by the  Victims of Crime Act, VOCA.   This week, I want to tell you another story that is even more  troubling, but it dramatizes the need for us to act today, this  afternoon. I am going to use the name ``Sasha,'' not the real name of  the woman involved. She is a mother of three kids, and she was living  with a man who was unpredictable and dangerous.   He tried to kill her--not once but three times. He tried strangling  her, and the third time, she passed out. When she woke up with the kids  nearby, she knew that was it. She couldn't take it anymore. So she went  to a hospital. She was scared to death. She heard about a group called  Harbor House. Harbor House is basically a domestic violence survivors  center.   I would tell my colleagues in the Senate, if you have ever visited a  domestic violence survivors center and met with any of the victims, you  will never forget it. I swear, you will never forget it. I can remember  the first time I met with one of the victims in one of the shelters.  She was crying. Her eyes were red, one eye was blackened, and she  choked back the tears and told me the story of what she lived through.  For some reason--and I am not a psychologist; I can't explain it--she  blamed herself. And it happens so often.  [[Page S4713]]    What happens to these women who are the victims of domestic violence  abuse? Where do they go? Some of them can't find anywhere to go and end  up dying as a result of it. What happens to their kids who witness  these acts of violence in the home when mom is getting strangled by  this man? What happens to them? Well, luckily, we care enough in  America to do something about it. Through VOCA and the Crime Victims  Fund, we send money to Harbor House and Life Span and other agencies  and say: Do your best. Help them put their lives back together again.  Protect them.   Well, I want to fast-forward and tell you that 6 months after Sasha's  experience, things are much better. She lives safely in an apartment.  She still works with adult counselors and youth counselors to get  herself and her kids through this, and she knows that she is not alone.  These VOCA-funded advocates stepped into her life at just the right  moment and saved her life. They may have saved the lives of her  children too.   So when we cut back on funding for whatever reason, we are  jeopardizing the services that I just described that are so critical.   With decreased VOCA funding--if we do nothing today, with decreased  VOCA funding, Harbor House will have to cut its staffers, exactly the  types of professionals who helped Sasha and her family.   The executive director said:         If VOCA is cut, imagine being Sasha and having to go       through all of that alone.    That is why we have to pass this bill. That is why it is so critical.   As I noted last week, VOCA passed in 1984 to establish the Crime  Victims Fund. We can't even count the number of people who have been  helped over the years. Three thousand applicants come through my State  Attorney General's Office in Illinois, and every State has a similar  story to tell of thousands of victims helped by service providers,  victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking,  and drunk drivers.   And the Crime Victims Fund doesn't receive a dime of taxpayers'  dollars. How about that? What I just described for you doesn't come out  of the Treasury. It is funded through criminal fines, penalties,  forfeited bail bonds, and special assessments collected by the Federal  Government.   Historically, most of the money comes from criminal fines, but in  recent years, deposits have dropped off significantly. That is why we  are here at this moment. They need help, and they need it now.   Monetary penalties from deferred prosecutions and nonprosecution  agreements are currently deposited in the Treasury instead of the fund.  As a result, the shift has had a devastating impact on the fund. That  is why a bipartisan, bicameral group of Members of Congress, working  with advocacy organizations, have come up with this VOCA fix. Our bill  would stabilize the depleted fund by redirecting monetary penalties  from deferred prosecutions and nonprosecution agreements to the victims  and service providers who need the help.   The reduced deposits into the fund have already had a devastating  impact. Victim assistance grants have been reduced by more than $600  million in this year. And more cuts are coming if we don't do something  today.   Like Harbor House, advocates across the State and across the country  are begging for help. We don't have any time to waste. Every day that  goes by, we miss an opportunity to help replenish the fund and to put  these services on the street.   So far this year, the fund has already missed out on a total of  nearly $550 million in deposits that could be helping these agencies,  and we are not even halfway through the year. That is why it is  imperative that we pass this bill. The House already did it in March, 3  months ago--broad bipartisan support. Here in the Senate, we have a  broad bipartisan coalition of Senators--36 Democrats and 21  Republicans. We all get it. We are all for crime victims. But we have  been stopped because of an objection on the floor.   Let's end this today. Whatever the merits of any budgetary argument,  for goodness' sake, lives are at stake here. Unfortunately, this  objection about moving forward was made last week, and it probably will  be made again today. It involves Senator Toomey's concern about a  budgetary issue. It is a complicated issue about something called  CHIMPs, for goodness' sake, which he can explain, and I am sure he  will.   But after last week's argument on this, I went to the advocates who  are telling us that we should send this money as quickly as we can and  said: Is he right? Is this designed, without his amendment, so that  this money will not go to the people who need it?   They said he is wrong. This is not going to happen.   Here is their statement: ``During floor remarks for the unanimous  consent [last week], it was represented the VOCA Fix Act fails to  correct certain structural issues that prevent the funds from reaching  victims and their advocates. The premise of this statement--that these  structural issues impact the distribution of VOCA funds to survivors  and advocates--is not accurate.''   This is from the actual agencies themselves.   ``While the use of CHIMPS (Changes in Mandatory Programs) as budget  offsets continues to be a contentious issue, the claim that  Appropriators hoard money rather than releasing it to victim service  providers is false.''   Inaccurate and false.   ``In reality, Appropriators have substantially decreased the size of  the budget offset by releasing far more than the amount required by the  proposed substitute, and the proposed substitute intended to  restructure the entire appropriations process is incredibly  controversial.''   In other words, we are going to dive into the deep end of the pool on  budget process, budget rules, and budget regulation while people are  literally drowning in violence--victims of domestic abuse.   For goodness' sake, isn't there a better time and place and a better  group to hold hostage? It shouldn't be these domestic violence cases.   I yield at this point to the Senator from Rhode Island.    I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1652, which was received  from the House and is at the desk; further, that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if you  listen to this explanation, there is one thing missing and it is  critical. There is a suggestion that this money for the Crime Victims  Fund is being spent for another purpose. You never heard that, did you?  It said it could be, maybe it will be, it might be--but it hasn't been.   Listen to what they say, these people in the advocacy groups are  jealously watching every penny. They want every dollar, just as you do  and I do. And what do they say about your argument?   The premise of your statement that these structural issues impact the  distribution of the victims funds to survivors and advocates is not  accurate. It goes on to say that the claim that appropriators hoard the  money rather than releasing it to victims services is false. This is  from the very agencies receiving the money.   Are they in on the deal, Senator?   I don't think so. They are desperate for these funds, and without  them, they are going to have a serious cutback in services.   The proposed substitute intended to restructure the entire  appropriations process is incredibly controversial, and you know it and  I know it as a member of the Appropriations Committee. Yet you are  tangling up this relief for the victims of crime, victims of domestic  abuse, women who are seeking shelter and hospital care and trying to  care for their children and what they are going through. You want to  hold back on the possibility--the possibility--that somebody is going  to spend this on something else, even though you have no proof that it  has been done--none.   And the people who are the advocates for these groups are saying to  you: What you are saying is inaccurate and false.   And you won't give it up.  [[Page S4715]]    I would suggest: Pick another target. Find some other group to make  your budget point of order. Please don't take this out on these people  who are in the most desperate situations in their life. This is not the  time and place to raise this budget debate. I seriously hope that you  will think about them for a moment.   I object to your modification.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2198         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
