 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise because I love my  country.   And, Mr. Speaker, I rise today understanding that we are in mourning.  Our country is grieving. There are many reasons for this, but we still  haven't acknowledged that there is something we can do to eliminate  some of the mourning and grieving.   We are mourning because police officers are being murdered. Many have  been murdered across the length and breadth of the country. We are  mourning because persons are losing their lives at the hand of the  police. Many have lost their lives. We are in a state of mourning, but  it goes back far beyond George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Sandra Bland. It  goes back to really the founding of the country because we have not  atoned for some of our transgressions. Literally, we have committed  crimes against humanity for which we have not atoned.   Slavery was a crime against humanity; we have not atoned. What we did  to the indigenous population was a crime against humanity; we have not  atoned. The internment of the Japanese, based upon our xenophobia, we  have not atoned. Banning Chinese from the country, we have not atoned.  What we did to Muslims, banning them from the country, we have not  atoned.   There must be atonement. We have to reconcile. We did not do so in  1868, as it relates to slavery. We should have, but we had a President  who was antithetical to it, Andrew Johnson.   So, I am going to offer a resolution, a resolution to create a  department of reconciliation such that we can accomplish our atonement,  get out of this grieving, and bring our country together.   When we had a systemic need for dealing with agriculture, we created  a Department of Agriculture. When commerce was in need of some help, we  created a Department of Commerce. We have a Department of Labor because  labor needs the kinds of legislation and the kinds of benefits that a  Congress can accord labor, the persons who actually work for a living.  When we needed defense, we created a Department of Defense and a  Department of Homeland Security.   So, I am proposing that we have a department of reconciliation so we  can deal with the issues that have haunted this country for centuries.  A department of reconciliation with a secretary of reconciliation,  a department of reconciliation with a budget, a department of  reconciliation with under secretaries so that we can accomplish our  atonement with a department of reconciliation. It can be done.    I am not asking for a commission. This is about a commitment. A  department indicates that you are committed to a cause. We were  committed to labor; that is why we have a Department of Labor. We were  committed to education; that is why we have a Department of Education.  We now need a department of reconciliation, a commitment to ending this  long, sorrowful grieving that we have suffered over the years so that  we can understand each other better and work together better with each  other.   If we fail to do this, if we fail to reconcile, Dr. King's words will  become our greatest nightmare. He indicated that we must learn to live  together as brothers and, I would add, sisters, or we will perish  together as fools. We need a department of reconciliation. I will  introduce a resolution for such.                            ____________________
