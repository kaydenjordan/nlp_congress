 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to share the  story of one of my constituents. Her name is Trisha.   In December of 2017, Trisha and her family lost their home and all of  their belongings in the devastating Thomas fire. Since then, the family  has been working hard to rebuild their home and their lives while  supporting their two young children.   Now, because of the Trump shutdown, Trisha and her husband, who both  work as air traffic controllers, have gone weeks without paychecks,  facing very extreme hardship.   President Trump is holding them and 800,000 other Federal employees  hostage, making an already stressful time even worse.   I welcome an honest, bipartisan discussion on border security, but we  cannot have a full and transparent legislative process while the  American people are being held hostage. It is time to open up our  government now.                            ____________________
