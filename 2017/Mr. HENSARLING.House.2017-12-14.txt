 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 657, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2396) to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to update  the exception for certain annual notices provided by financial  institutions, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 657, the  amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on  Financial Services, printed in the bill, is adopted, and the bill, as  amended, is considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 2396         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Privacy Notification       Technical Clarification Act''.       SEC. 2. EXCEPTION TO ANNUAL NOTICE REQUIREMENT.         Section 503 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6803)       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g) Additional Exception to Annual Notice Requirement.--        ``(1) In general.--A financial institution that has not       changed its policies and practices with regard to disclosing       nonpublic personal information from the policies and       practices that were disclosed in the most recent disclosure       sent to consumers in accordance with this section shall not       be required to provide an annual disclosure under this       section if--        ``(A) the financial institution makes its current policy       available to consumers on its website and via mail upon       written request sent to a designated address identified for       the purpose of requesting the policy or upon telephone       request made using a toll free consumer service telephone       number; and        ``(B) the financial institution conspicuously notifies       consumers of the availability of the current policy,       including--        ``(i) with respect to consumers who are entitled to a       periodic billing statement, a message on or with each       periodic billing statement; and        ``(ii) with respect to consumers who are not entitled to a       periodic billing statement, through other reasonable means       such as on its website or with other written communication,       including electronic communication, sent to the consumer.        ``(2) Treatment of multiple policies.--If a financial       institution maintains more than one set of policies described       under paragraph (1) that vary depending on the consumer's       account status or State of residence, the financial       institution may comply with the website posting requirement       in paragraph (1)(A) by posting all of such policies to the       public section of the financial institution's website, with       instructions for choosing the applicable policy.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for  1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Financial Services.   After 1 hour of debate on the bill, as amended, it shall be in order  to consider the further amendment printed in House Report 115-462, if  offered by the Member designated in the report, which shall be  considered read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified  in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an  opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for a division of the  question.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2396, the Privacy  Notification Technical Clarification Act, which is an important bill  cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Members of the House and a bill  that was approved by the Financial Services Committee with a strong  bipartisan vote of 2-1, quite literally: 40-20. Additionally, this bill  builds upon an issue that has a long track record of strong bipartisan  support in Congress.   I thank Congressman Trott, a member of the Financial Services  Committee, for introducing this legislation and for leading  congressional efforts to modernize the privacy notification process for  consumers and to provide regulatory relief for our struggling financial  institutions.   There is a serious issue, Mr. Speaker, with the sheer volume,  complexity, weight, load, and cost of the regulatory burden upon,  particularly, our struggling community financial institutions, our  community banks, and credit unions.   It is no one specific regulation, but the totality, the combination  of them all, are causing us to lose a community bank or credit union a  day in America. As we lose them, our constituents lose their  opportunity for credit opportunities to share in their version of the  American Dream. It makes it more costly, more difficult for them to  finance someone to go to college, for them to perhaps buy an auto to  get them to work, or perhaps capitalize their own small business. So we  frequently hear from our community financial institutions.   I heard from a community banker in Nebraska, not long ago, who  explained: ``I have explained about how things have changed since I  started in banking 10 years ago. In efforts for our government to make  things more fair or easier for consumers, it has actually become  increasingly more difficult for people to obtain favorable loan terms  and, not to mention, obtain loans in a timely manner.''   I heard from a banker in Alabama about real estate regulations, who  said: They were intended to help customers, but it is actually hurting  them. As wait times increase and banks are no longer offering certain  products, not all of these people can be protected from themselves, no  matter how many rules and regs the banks follow to protect them.   I heard from a community banker in Utah, who said: I have been in  banking for 29 years. In that time, the regulatory burden has increased  dramatically. The ability to help customers and small businesses  succeed in rural America has been greatly hampered by regulation  intended to protect the customer from Wall Street banks, but in the  process, smaller community banks, such as mine, have been caught in the  fray or broad brush of regulations.   A banker in Oklahoma said that, because of Dodd-Frank regulations:  ``We no longer offer/purchase house loans.''  [[Page H9906]]    The list goes on and on and on.   So this is one regulation that simply says: under the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act, if a financial institution doesn't change their privacy  notification, they don't have to send out a piece of paper annually--a  piece of paper like this that 99 percent of the time customers throw  away and don't read in the first place.   Don't take my word for it. Professor Adam Levitin, who is a frequent  Democrat witness before the House Financial Services Committee  testified before our committee: ``One thing that I think should go the  way of the dodo bird are the Gramm-Leach-Bliley privacy notices. Nobody  reads them.''   That is a Democrat witness, Mr. Speaker. It is not a Republican  witness. It is a Democrat witness.   He goes on to say: ``There's no reason anyone should--even the large  banks--should be spending money on giving these notices.''   But that is not what this bill does. It just simply says, if a  financial institution does not change their privacy notification, they  don't have to send out a paper notification that creates more costs,  that gets passed on to the customer, and that nobody reads in the first  place.   Number one, it is important regulatory relief for our financial  institutions. But it is also important when we think in terms of the  sheer volume of financial disclosures that our constituents receive.   This goes back to the fact, Mr. Speaker, if you disclose everything,  you effectively disclose nothing because you overwhelm the customer.   So we must vigilantly ensure that our constituents are receiving  effective disclosure, not just voluminous disclosure, but effective  disclosure of material items written in clear, understandable, common  language. Again, not voluminous disclosure of irrelevant items written  in legalese and fine print. That doesn't do anybody any good, Mr.  Speaker.    Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his  leadership. The bill that he is bringing today has earned bipartisan  support because it is a simple technical correction to clarify that  customers have to be physically mailed an annual privacy notice only  when the privacy policies have actually changed from the previous year.   Importantly, this bill was carefully crafted to maintain and retain  current privacy and opt-out policies and does not exempt any financial  services provider from an initial privacy notice, nor does it allow any  loopholes for an institution to avoid issuing an updated notice.   In fact, this legislation, Mr. Speaker, does not change privacy  provisions at all, just how they are delivered. Let me repeat: the  legislation does not change privacy provisions at all, just how they  are delivered.   Again, Mr. Trott's bill has strong bipartisan support. It provides a  simple and flexible approach that modernizes privacy notification to  the benefit of our customers and to the benefit of our financial  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure and urge every Member to  vote for it, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 2396, the  Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act.   Contrary to the bill's title, this bill is far from a technical  clarification. So I want to be very clear about what this bill would  actually do.   H.R. 2396 would reduce the meaningful and clear disclosures that  financial institutions must currently provide to their customers every  year, even if those companies share their customers' nonpublic personal  information broadly with nonaffiliated third-party companies.   Unlike other privacy bills Congress has considered, this bill comes  with no guardrails whatsoever to discourage the company from broadly  sharing consumer-sensitive personal information.   While the bill provides several alternative mechanisms to deliver  privacy reminders, one option would result in the customer receiving no  written disclosure at all.   The current annual privacy notices serve as a reminder describing a  customer's right to restrict the sharing of their nonpublic, personal  information to nonaffiliated third parties and information about how to  exercise this right if they so choose.   This privacy right was created in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which  was signed into law in 1999. I served on the conference committee, so I  know firsthand that the initial and annual privacy notices in the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act were enacted partly in response to public  concerns about the sale of personal data for marketing purposes that  were highlighted in a number of legal actions brought by State  attorneys general at the time.   In 1999, for example, there was a settlement between the Minnesota  attorney general and U.S. Bank resolving allegations that the bank  misrepresented its practice of selling highly personal and confidential  information about its customers to telemarketers.   These concerns are just as relevant today. In fact, I find the timing  of the consideration of this bill very troubling, as it is being  brought to the floor just months after the massive Equifax data breach.   In the Equifax breach, 145.5 million Americans had their Social  Security numbers, dates of birth, and other sensitive financial and  personally identifiable information exposed to thieves.   Equifax is not the only major credit bureau to experience a large  data breach. About 2 years ago, Experian, one of the other three major  credit bureaus in this country, had a breach that exposed millions of  T-Mobile customers' information.   These breaches are on top of a long list of other breaches we have  seen at other companies where sensitive customer information was  compromised. Consumers have called on their Representatives in Congress  to enact tougher laws that would strengthen their control over their  personal information, not weaken it.   Consumers are increasingly wary about the unfettered sharing of their  personal information by financial firms to nonaffiliated third parties  that can result in consumer profiling, fraud, aggressive target  marketing, and identity theft.   Unfortunately, this bill goes in the opposite direction. Instead of  working to strengthen consumers' privacy protections, H.R. 2396 would  ease obligations on financial institutions to provide notices to their  customers describing their privacy practices and policies, and  importantly, fully explaining to these customers their right to  restrict the sharing of their information to nonaffiliated third  parties.   This is commonly referred to as a consumer's right to opt out of  having a financial institution share their information to companies  that are outside of their common corporate structure or organization.  These nonaffiliated third-party companies are generally not ones that  the consumers have an existing relationship with, meaning that they  have not received a product or service from the company in the past.   The proponents of H.R. 2396 may say the bill has nothing to do with  Equifax, or that Equifax would not be covered, if the amendment being  offered later today is agreed to. But the bill would roll back privacy  notice requirements for many financial institutions that engage in  vehicle financing, including megabanks like Wells Fargo, even if they  broadly share their customers' nonpublic, personal information with  other companies.                                time  0930    Let's discuss Wells Fargo and their auto lending practices and their  work with nonaffiliated third parties. Earlier this year, the  Democratic staff of the Financial Services Committee produced a report  on Wells Fargo's egregious misconduct, which has consulted in extensive  consumer harm.   For example, Wells Fargo charged over 570,000 consumers for  automobile insurance policies they did not need, which resulted in at  least 20,000 customers, including Active Duty servicemembers, having  their vehicles inappropriately repossessed. These auto insurance  policies were provided through a nonaffiliated third-party company  called National General Insurance.   The bank has also demonstrated a clear pattern of misusing millions  of their customers' information to open accounts in their name without  their permission.  [[Page H9907]]    So why should Congress consider relaxing the privacy requirements for  a recidivist bank like Wells Fargo?   Let me also address arguments that suggest customers don't read these  notices anyway. That is a quote that we hear oftentimes.   As I have discussed, I think consumers are paying closer attention  now after the Equifax incident. Proponents say that a company posting a  link on their website isn't so bad, and the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau allowed for it.   But the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provided an alternative  to the annual privacy notices for companies that do not share data in  ways that trigger consumers' opt-out rights under the law. Over the  last decade, Congress has heard repeatedly from banks and credit unions  that if a company does not share personal information with an  unaffiliated third party that allows consumers to opt out from having  it shared, and if they do not change their privacy policies, they  should be exempt from the annual notice requirements. In those  instances, the customer does not have the ability to opt out of having  the information shared.   After several years of research and debate, we made that targeted  change in the last Congress. Since then, other companies, specifically  captive auto finance companies, have made the case they should have  more flexibility satisfying the annual notice requirement because they  have a unique and close relationship with automobile dealers they work  with that still requires them to send the annual notice.   This unaffiliated third-party relationship triggers a consumer's  right under the law to opt out and not have their information shared. I  offered an amendment in committee that would have granted this targeted  relief, but it was rejected.   So, while I appreciate that H.R. 2396 provides flexibility to captive  auto finance companies, the bill is not limited to them and goes much,  much further. Mr. Speaker, over 30 consumer, community, privacy, and  civil rights groups have publicly opposed this bill, including U.S.  PIRG, and so do I. This is an area where more study is needed before  policymakers craft sweeping changes.   The bottom line is that I believe we should not open the door too  widely at this time to give this same degree of flexibility to all and  every financial institution, including recidivist banks like Wells  Fargo.   Furthermore, there needs to be more, not less, privacy protections  and consumer control relating to personal information following the  massive data breach at Equifax this year.   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge opposition to H.R.  2396, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say that I  listened very carefully. It was a fascinating speech from the ranking  member. Too bad it has absolutely nothing to do with the bill that is  before us. Ms. Waters was speaking of privacy policies. The bill has to  do with notification.   But I do agree with the ranking member that we do need more effective  disclosure. In H.R. 2396, we require financial institutions to make  their current policies available on its website at all times. That  actually improves disclosure. The only people who can be for the status  quo are those who own paper mills so that we can waste more paper.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Trott), the sponsor of this legislation and an outstanding, hardworking  member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to say I hope  that schoolchildren from around the Nation have been listening to this  debate because they would be educated on the House version of the  filibuster.   I thought that the ranking member was going to break out the  Washington, D.C., phone book and begin to read from it. It was a  fascinating discussion of a litany of Washington-based special interest  groups. I know they appreciated the shout-out; I know it will help them  in their fundraising efforts; but it has absolutely nothing--nothing-- to do with the bill that we are debating, nothing to do with the bill  that we are debating.                                time  1000    So the ranking member said how important it is that consumers receive  an annual--an annual--notice of the privacy policies of financial  institutions. Well, under this bill, H.R. 2396, they don't get it  annually, they get it monthly. They get it weekly. They get it daily.  They get it hourly.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   In fact, under H.R. 2396, the privacy notification must be  continuous. It has to be put on the website. This helps the consumer.  The consumer has access 24/7 to the privacy notification under the  gentleman from Michigan's bill, as opposed to the status quo being  defended by my friends on the other side of the aisle, who say, once a  year--once a year--you ought to get a piece of paper that is probably  going to end up in the round file anyway.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this debate has nothing to do with the privacy  policies of financial institutions. It has everything to do with the  notification of such policies. What we provide for is the continuous  notification; and should that policy change, then, and only then, does  that necessitate the killing of trees.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk), an outstanding member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), the sponsor of this legislation.    I yield the gentleman from Michigan an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 3\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there have been several surreal moments on the House  floor this week, and today certainly is one more of them.   The debate today is not between regulation and deregulation, but in  many respects, the debate is between smart regulation and dumb  regulation. What we have today is a dumb regulation that forces a  number of financial institutions annually to send out a paper  notification even if they don't change their privacy policy; cut down  trees, engage an expense--by the way, an expense that, my guess is,  doesn't come out of executive bonuses, but probably comes out of the  credit availability and the credit cost to the customer. It gets passed  on to the consumer.   What we are also having a debate about--and I would encourage all my  friends on the other side of the aisle, if in doubt, read the bill.   In this particular case, guess what, Mr. Speaker. It is a 2-page  bill. It really doesn't take that long to read. If you read it, what  you will find out is that this is a bill that is pro-consumer because  we go from a notification that happens once a year to a continuous  notification. We improve the consumer notification by ensuring that it  is consistently on the website of the financial institution.   What we hear from the ranking member is: No. I want to stay in the  20th century. Gramm-Leach-Bliley is a law from the 20th century.   But, Mr. Speaker, we are in the 21st century. Why don't we ensure  that the privacy notification for the consumer is actually on the  website?   This is what is truly pro-consumer, not forcing people to go and  subsidize the paper mills and the U.S. Postal Service by sending out a  notification on paper that doesn't change anything and merely confuses  consumers. If you are really pro-consumer, then try to respect their  markets and try not to pass additional cost on to them.   Again, regardless of what you have heard from the other side of the  aisle, this is everything to do with how we notify people of privacy  policies, not the underlying privacy policy itself. It is 21st century.  It is not 20th century. It is pro-consumer, regardless of all the  special interests and Washington, D.C.-based lobbyists that the ranking  member has cited.   The gentleman from Michigan brings us pro-consumer legislation, the  Privacy Notification Technical Clarification Act. I am kind of  embarrassed that we are having to spend this much time debating  something that should have been on our expedited suspension calendar.  It is almost like there is just simply a knee-jerk reaction anytime we  attempt to modify any government regulation.   This is pro-consumer. Frankly, it is pro-environment. Every Member of  the House should embrace H.R. 2396. I am sorry we have had to take up  so much time for it, but there are thousands and thousands of  regulations that hurt our financial institutions, that hurt our  consumers. We are trying to get rid of every dumb one, one at a time.   Again, this should be passing unanimously. I don't understand it, but  I am glad the American people could see this debate for what it is.   Mr. Speaker, again, let's be pro-consumer, let's be pro-community  financial institution, let's be pro-environment, and let's enact H.R.  2396.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Clay     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, again, I would encourage the ranking  member and all Members on the other side of the aisle to read the  underlying bill. It is 2 pages long. It has now been amended by perhaps  a 1-page amendment. This has nothing to do with Wells Fargo. It has  nothing to do with Equifax. It is limited to the annual paper  notification from auto finance companies, pure and simple.   Again, for those who listened to the earlier debate, the question is  whether or not these auto finance companies are going to be forced to  spend money that comes out of their customers' pockets to send out a  paper notification of privacy policies even when the policy doesn't  change, or whether or not we should modernize into the 21st century and  ensure that there is continuous notification on a website and that a  paper notification only goes out upon a change, an actual change.   What the ranking member is doing with the motion to recommit is once  again empowering the unconstitutional and unaccountable CFPB to engage  in even more activities that harm consumers. It ought to be rejected,  and we ought to ensure that we adopt H.R. 2396 and simplify and  modernize one regulation that is harming consumers and harming  financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the motion to recommit, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on:   Passage of H.R. 2396, if ordered;   The motion to recommit on H.R. 4324; and   Passage of H.R. 4324, if ordered.
