 Madam Speaker, I am honored to stand here today on the  floor of the House of Representatives to serve as the voice of east  Texans in Congress.   As a man of faith and father of four children, I rise today for the  very first time as a Member of Congress to stand for the sanctity of  life and in full support of children nationwide. I can think of no  better cause than the cause of life.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Ann Wagner, for  bringing this valuable bill to the floor. I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which  will ensure that all children who are born are protected and treated  the same as any other newborn.   Every life is a gift. Every life has a calling divinely given by God.  I stand firmly committed to protecting those lives and to opposing any  action that threatens them. This legislation is the next step in our  effort to protect our future generations and return to our Nation's  values.                            ____________________
