 Madam Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart to honor  the memory of Air Force Major Luke Unrath. Just days ago, Major Unrath  lost his life when the CV-22B Osprey he piloted crashed during a  training exercise off the coast of Japan. He was just 34 years old.   Major Unrath's journey of service began in Riverside in my district  where he graduated from Martin Luther King High School. His commitment  to a life of purpose and selflessness was evident early.   Described by his comrades as a natural leader, Major Unrath's cool  demeanor, high standards, and quick wit left a mark on all who had the  privilege of serving alongside him.   Today, we remember and honor a beloved husband, brother, and son.  Major Unrath's legacy is one of sacrifice, dedication, and exemplary  service to our great Nation.   Madam Speaker, may Major Luke Unrath rest in peace and may his memory  inspire future generations to uphold the values of service, integrity,  and courage that he so nobly embodied. I extend my deepest condolences  to the Unrath family.
