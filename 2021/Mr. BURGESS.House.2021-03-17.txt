 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  do have one of the en bloc amendments at the desk.   Madam Speaker, this amendment requires the Department of Justice and  the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on the  issues identified by a Government Accountability Office report and the  use of telehealth.   In 2018, the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee held an eye-opening hearing on sexual assault forensic  examinations that highlighted gaps in training and care related to  sexual assault forensic examinations. The Government Accountability  Office testified at this hearing on its 2016 report on sexual assault  forensic exams, which identified gaps in aspects of performing exams,  training, leadership development, examiner program sustainability, and  education of community stakeholders.   This amendment is simple, and it is common sense. The Department of  Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services must issue  guidance on addressing the gaps identified by GAO.   In Texas, there have been efforts to utilize telehealth, including  the Project ECHO model, to provide sexual assault forensic examinations  and training. The nurses involved in these programs have established  their success. I am sure States have employed other useful telehealth  models that should be further explored as well.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate that this amendment is endorsed by the  International Association of Forensic Nurses, signaling its importance,  and I urge support for this amendment.
