 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Judge Melinda Anderson on an incredible career in the First District's  Liberty County court system.   Judge Anderson's first major achievement of her storied career came  when she was appointed ex-officio notary and justice of the peace by  the Liberty County Grand Jury in 1979.   Then, in 1983 the legislative consolidation of the justice of the  peace and small claims court created the magistrate court.   Consequently, in 1988, Judge Melinda Anderson was elected as Liberty  County Chief Magistrate. Since then, she has served the First District  of Georgia well, and her accolades are too numerous for one speech.   I congratulate Judge Melinda Anderson on a magnificent career, which  included awards for both Magistrate of the Year and Lifetime  Achievement.                           Honoring Griffin Lotson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Darien City  Councilman Griffin Lotson, who is featured in the International African  American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina.    The Butler Island Plantation where the International African American  Museum stands, was where Lotson's ancestors, the Gullah Geechee, were  enslaved.   Councilman Lotson's family spans seven generations of Gullah Geechee  roots.   In addition to serving on Darien City Council, he also serves as the  vice-chair of the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, a  nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing Gullah heritage and  culture.   Griffin Lotson was also recently promoted to the level of Global and  State Goodwill Ambassador.   Darien, along with the rest of Georgia's First Congressional  District, is honored that Councilman Lotson calls our community home.                       Congratulating Lindsey Streeter     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Command Sergeant Major Lindsey Streeter for winning the Military Times  Veteran of the Year.   Sergeant Major Streeter enlisted in the Army at 17 years old as a  76C, equipment parts and records specialist.   Lindsey deployed from Hunter Army Airfield in support of Operation  Desert Storm, and when he returned, he was asked to go into the U.S.  Army Recruiting Command, taking on the weighty task of recruiting the  next generation of soldiers.   Over his 31-year career, he would go on to hold leadership positions  at every level, culminating with his first assignment as commandant of  the Noncommissioned Officer Academy at Fort Stewart.   Although he hung up the uniform, his desire to serve others only grew  stronger.   Once he left the Army, he joined Bank of America as its senior vice  president of global military affairs, a position that allows him to  help transitioning servicemembers and long-time veterans with financial  education and assistance.   On top of his professional work, Lindsey started a charity with his  late wife, Mary Ann, Quad E, that provides healthcare resources to  underserved and low-income families.   In 2022, he also purchased the semi-pro basketball team, the Savannah  Hurricanes, yet another example of serving our local community.   Simply put, his impact on the First District of Georgia is  immeasurable.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Command Sergeant Major Streeter for his  continued service to not only our country, but, also, to our local  community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Sid  Nudelman, a World War II veteran who recently celebrated is 100th  birthday.   On July 21, 2023, Mr. Nudelman celebrated 100 years of life  surrounded by his family and friends in Savannah, Georgia. Mr. Nudelman  grew up in Chicago, and was the first of his family, who had recently  emigrated from Lithuania, to be born in America.   Mr. Nudelman enlisted in the Army on December 8, 1941, where he  served as a sergeant in the Army Air Corps. He flew over Normandy on D- Day three times, assisting other members by dropping supplies,  paratroopers, and parasails.   After retiring from the military, he got a job in a clothing store,  and he taught dance lessons at the Fred Astaire Dance Studios in his  spare time.   In 1948, Sid met the love of his life, Marilyn, at a dance, and they  were married shortly thereafter. He and Marilyn had two sons, Lee and  Jerry. After her passing, he moved with his sons to Savannah, Georgia,  where he still lives today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Sid for his service, and wish him a happy 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
