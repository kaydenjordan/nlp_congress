 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 3055, the Clerk be authorized to make technical and  conforming changes to reflect the actions of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 3351.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As chairman of the Financial Services and General Government  Subcommittee, I first want to thank Ranking Member   Tom Graves, the  gentleman from Georgia, who I now have had the privilege of working  with for a third year managing the bill. Our discussions have always  been both valuable and productive, and I thank him for his partnership  throughout this process.   Of course, I always like to take the opportunity to thank the staff  on both sides for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. In  my personal office, that includes Doug and Juan. On our committee staff  on the majority side, that includes Laura, Marybeth, Elliot, Aalok,  Parker, and Lisa, and for the minority, John Martens.  [[Page H5105]]    The committee staff, in particular, sacrificed many long nights and  weekends to get us to this stage. I am truly grateful, and I know  Members on both sides share the same sentiment.   The bill before us today provides $24.95 billion in total  discretionary resources, including $400 million in adjustments for tax  enforcement program integrity activities.   The FSGG bill encompasses a wide range of programs, everything from  the Internal Revenue Service to the Federal courts to the District of  Columbia to the Small Business Administration.   In total, the bill includes $12 billion for the IRS, an increase of  more than 6 percent above the President's request, a good first step  toward restoring cuts this agency has suffered for almost a decade.   Notably, the bill almost doubles the amount provided in FY19 to the  systems modernization account to support the IRS IT modernization  efforts.   Investing in the IRS will support more effective and efficient  enforcement activities to help close the tax gap, improve taxpayer  experience by reducing wait times, and increase support to those trying  to navigate the complex Tax Code.   My friend across the aisle speaks a lot about deficit reduction, and  as a fiscal moderate, I understand and agree. But underfunding tax  enforcement for all these years has been penny-wise and pound-foolish.  The IRS generates $4 in revenue for every $1 in enforcement expenses.  That is fiscally sound policy that we should all support.   On the national security front, the bill also provides increases  totaling $15.6 million for Treasury Department offices and programs  focused on combating money laundering, enforcing sanctions, and  countering the financing of terrorism.   The bill includes funding for numerous important independent agencies  critical to the operation of the entire Federal Government, as well as  communities throughout the country.   Let me highlight just a few of the many investments provided in this  bill.   One of the top priorities this year has been to help States and local  governments meet the challenge of restoring the security and integrity  of our elections. To this end, the bill includes $600 million in  funding the Election Assistance Commission.    Just last month, Special Counsel Robert Mueller described Russia's  concerted attack on our political system in 2016, saying, ``There were  multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.'' He  detailed the Russian efforts and specified that they were designed and  timed to interfere with and damage a Presidential candidate.   It was a purposeful strategy involving sophisticated cyber techniques  to influence the outcome of our election, the underpinning of American  democracy whereby American citizens alone decide who represents them in  government.   Mr. Mueller concluded with a call to action, that the efforts to  interfere in our election ``deserve the attention of every American.''   I couldn't agree more. This is not a partisan matter. If anything,  the challenge of securing our election systems should unite all  Americans.   Another major priority in this bill has been to support the  regulatory agencies funded in this bill, especially the financial  regulatory agencies that protect consumers, taxpayers, and investors,  and to help police Wall Street and prevent another financial meltdown.   We boost funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission by $148  million above 2019, $104 million above the budget request.   We also provide increases for the Federal Trade Commission to help  refocus on preventing anticompetitive practices and for various  inspector general offices that deal with financial matters.   We give an $8.5 million increase to the Consumer Product Safety  Commission to better protect our families from potentially dangerous  products.   The bill also makes targeted investments to make sure that small  businesses on Main Street and low-income communities in too-often  forgotten neighborhoods, both urban and rural, have access to the  capital and assistance needed to thrive.   For instance, this bill increases entrepreneurial development  programs at the Small Business Administration by $34 million above  2019, to $280 million.   Just as significant, this bill rejects the President's proposal to  eliminate grant programs under the Community Development Financial  Institutions Fund, which directly supports the expansion of affordable  housing, small business creation, and infrastructure growth in  underserved and rural areas, in addition to supplying credit to  revitalize neglected communities. Instead, the bill boosts funding by  $50 million for this extremely successful and broadly bipartisan  program.   Ultimately, I am a capitalist who believes in the power of the free  market economy. But I also believe there needs to be reasonable  measures and checks in place to make sure our economy is benefiting  everyone and not just a select few at the top.   If you believe, as I do, that fraudsters shouldn't be able to  manipulate markets and scam seniors of their hard-earned savings, and  that you shouldn't have to be a Fortune 500 company to access  affordable financing for your business, then you should support the  investments this bill makes to empower everyday investors, consumers,  and entrepreneurs.   Finally, the bill takes significant steps toward reducing undue  congressional interference in local D.C. affairs and eliminating  restrictions on the District that do not apply to other parts of the  Nation.   Importantly, it ended the uniquely restrictive prohibition on the use  of locally raised funds for abortion, thereby placing the District in  the same position as the 50 States, in that regard.   It also discontinues the ban on Federal funds for local needle  exchange programs and allows the District to implement local law  legalizing marijuana, as has been done in most States.   In closing, I would like to reiterate how grateful I am to all the  staff who helped put this product together. It is a bill that we all  can be proud of, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Lowey), the distinguished chairwoman of the full  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Serrano), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee and a member of the Financial  Services and General Government Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee and a member of the Financial Services and General  Government Subcommittee.     Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.  Torres of California) having assumed the chair, Mr. Keating, Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3055) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), a member of the Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), a member of the Financial Services  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    Mr. Chairman, again, I want to restate that it has been a pleasure to  work with my colleagues across the aisle, particularly the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Graves).   In response to a couple of the ranking member's comments, if all we  did was write a bill that we were convinced the President of the United  States would support, we would just say: Well, what do you want us to  introduce and what do you want to us approve?   These are separate branches of government. It is our purpose to work  on a bipartisan basis, recognizing where the President of the United  States is on the issues, but to put together the best product we  possibly can. When the Senate does the same, there will be differences,  and that is what conference committees are all about. That is what,  unfortunately, is somewhat lost in this town, is this sense of  compromise and working together.   I want to stress a few things. Special counsel has only spoken to  this country directly once since he revealed his 2-year work product.  And that was to tell us that we need to protect this country from  further attack by the Russians on a democratic process. I think this  bill does that in an extraordinarily appropriate fashion.   As it references the school children of Washington, D.C., all we are  suggesting in doing what we are doing, and providing extraordinary  amounts of funding to do so, is that all the schools of Washington,  D.C. that get Federal tax dollars have to follow the same rules. They  have to play on the same level playing field. That is only fair to  those children. It doesn't deny anyone access to the best education  that is possible.   So with those things in mind, I think, in referencing the District of  Columbia, the last thing we can say is, just because we can micromanage  them doesn't mean we should micromanage them. Nobody here was elected  to the D.C. City Council. Unless it has extraordinary national policy  implications, let them run their own government.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment.   USF is an important and effective funding mechanism to ensure that  all Americans have access to the broadband services necessary to fully  participate in modern life. Not only does the USF subsidize broadband  build-out in areas that would otherwise be too expensive to serve, but  it includes Lifeline, a support program that ensures that communication  services are not just accessible, but affordable.   This FCC proposal was nothing but an unpopular and ill-advised effort  to undermine the USF, even as the country continues to face deep and  lasting disparities and access to modern communication service.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment offered by Mr. King.    Mr. Chair, this provision ensures that money from the  Treasury Forfeiture Fund can continue to flow to other departments and  agencies that rely upon this funding to augment critical operations and  support emerging operational needs, such as computer, forensic  equipment, title III wiretap intercepts, and anti-money laundering  investigation.   It also ensures that the bipartisan, bicameral funding levels enacted  by Congress and signed into law by the President are not clouded by  executive action.   Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states: ``No money  shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations  made by law.'' Any construction of border infrastructure should be  based on bipartisan agreement between both Chambers of Congress that is  enacted in law, not by an impulsive directive from 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue that disregards the will of Congress and undermines the ability  of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Homeland  Security to address known threats against our financial system and the  Nation.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose this amendment and urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment states that no funds may be  used to force the SEC's conflict mineral rules which were required by  section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act. Section 1502 was enacted to help support peace in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo and combat a deadly conflict minerals  trade that threatens the security of men, women, and children in  eastern Congo.   This rule requires that SEC-regulated firms that use tin, tantalum,  tungsten, or gold in their products to publicly report whether they  obtain their supplies of these key minerals from the Central African  Republic region. If so, these companies must report the due diligence  they exercised to ensure that these purchases did not benefit armed  groups in the Congo.   The conflict in this region has spawned numerous militias, some  politically oriented and some primarily criminal, but all of which have  been characterized by extreme human rights abuses.   Since the rule was adopted, we have seen a significant reduction in  armed group activity in many mining areas in eastern Congo and  unprecedented improvements in the transparency of corporate mineral  supply chains. This amendment would reverse that progress while  allowing some of the world's deadliest armed groups to profit from  lucrative conflict minerals.   Let us not forget that conflict minerals are commonly used in the  manufacturing of cellphones, jewelry, and airplanes. The goal of the  rule is to prevent companies from buying these minerals from armed  militant groups that kill and rape people in Congo and neighboring  countries.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Pascrell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Keating, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3351) making  appropriations for financial services and general government for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
