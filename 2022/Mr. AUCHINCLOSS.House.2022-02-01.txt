 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight how on-demand  transit is a force multiplier for public transportation and a driver of  lower costs in Massachusetts and across the Nation.   For example, Via has partnered with the city of Newton in my district  to provide an on-demand transit service called NewMo, which provides  low-cost rideshares for all residents. During a recent ride-along, I  saw firsthand the transformational power of on-demand transit,  especially for youth, seniors, and people with disabilities, who gain  autonomy from the ability to independently access and safely connect to  jobs and services.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will bring significant  funding to the Bay State to modernize transit, including expanding on- demand transit. This innovation can increase economic mobility, create  new jobs, and reduce our carbon footprint.   I look forward to working with the Biden administration to leverage  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to expand on-demand transit  throughout Massachusetts and across the country.                            ____________________
