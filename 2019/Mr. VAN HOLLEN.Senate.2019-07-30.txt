 Mr. President, I am here on the Senate floor today  with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from the State of  Maryland, Mr. Cardin, and I think we both agree that we would rather  not be here today to talk about this subject. But I feel compelled to  come to the Senate floor today because, in my view, we have a duty to  speak out when the President of the United States of America engages in  conduct that brings dishonor and disgrace to the Office of the  Presidency. That is what we witnessed, once again, over the weekend  when President Trump unleashed a torrent of personal, nasty, and racist  attacks on Congressman Elijah Cummings and the city of Baltimore, and  President Trump has continued his poisonous barrage for days.   Congressman Cummings can defend himself. He grew up having to  confront racist bullies. In the face of these attacks, he has shown  great strength and great integrity--the same strength and integrity he  has brought to his efforts to fight for his dear city of Baltimore, his  entire congressional district, and his constituents over many years.   Baltimore is a great American city with great people, great spirit,  and great heart. Yes, of course, Baltimore faces many challenges. It is  facing those challenges with determination, with unity, and with grit.  The President's attacks on this great American city have only served to  rally the people of Baltimore, the people of Maryland, and, in fact,  the people of the United States of America to support the city and the  people of Baltimore.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an op-ed that appeared in the Baltimore Sun today entitled ``Baltimore  leaders: `Proud not only to be in Baltimore, but of Baltimore.' ''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Baltimore Sun, July 30, 2019]       Baltimore Leaders: `Proud Not Only To Be in Baltimore, but of                                 Baltimore'                   (By Ronald J. Daniels and Kevin Plank)         We are proud and privileged to call Baltimore home.       Baltimore is a city of creativity, optimism, and       determination. Home to leading public and private research       universities, world-class medical institutions, and a diverse       business community, Baltimore is a city where both artists       and start-ups thrive. From creating one of the nation's first       racially integrated library systems to producing today's       modern medical and technological breakthroughs, our city has       a proud legacy of leadership in improving lives and setting a       national example for a stronger tomorrow. It's no wonder we       are often named as a place where millennials are moving and       staying. This is a city where people not only want to live,       but love to live.        That is why we, as leaders of 10 of Baltimore's anchor       institutions, reject the recent unfair and ungenerous       characterizations of our great city and its region. Like so       many cities across America, Baltimore is a place of paradox,       at once vibrant and full of promise and yet also burdened by       the weight of generations of racial and economic inequities,       deindustrialization, and disinvestment. Like other cities of       our size and history, we face urgent challenges with crime,       housing equity and our education system. But like all       Americans, Baltimoreans deserve respect, support and       steadfast partnership from elected officials at every level.        Baltimore is not and will not be defined by our challenges.       What defines us is that we continually meet those challenges       with resilience and persistence, that we invest in innovation       for Baltimore and for the nation, and that we harness the       talent of so many exceptional individuals to create       opportunity not for the few, but for the many.        Baltimore's remarkable people include icons past and       present like Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall; the       longest serving woman in Congress, Sen. Barbara Mikulski; and       Rep. Elijah Cummings, outspoken advocate for all his       constituents, from west Baltimore to Catonsville and beyond.       These leaders are known not only for their deep commitment to       our city and communities, but for their stature and public       service on the national stage.        We see the promise of Baltimore because we are fortunate to       work, serve and live here, alongside our colleagues,       employees, students and neighbors. Such promise is proven       daily in our shared commitment to our city's growth and the       success of its residents. Baltimore fosters talent in its       strong academic institutions and has seen rising venture       capital investment in its businesses--a testament to the       dynamism and innovative spirit of our businesses large and       small. Our leading businesses and non-profits, called upon       and supported by our vibrant faith community, launched       BLocal, a targeted economic investment and community       development plan that over three years has invested more than       $280 million and hired more than 1,700 Baltimore residents in       underserved neighborhoods. BLocal expresses to the fullest       the deep and long-term investment of the city's anchor       institutions.        We never move forward as a community--or indeed, a nation--      by denigrating each other. Nor does it serve any of us to       demean a vibrant city and its citizens who exemplify those       most American of qualities: can-do optimism, grit and       creativity.        Justice Thurgood Marshall wisely counseled that ``In       recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay       ourselves the highest tribute.'' And as this city has shown,       time and again, when we work together, we rise together. For       this and so many reasons we are proud not only to be in       Baltimore, but of Baltimore.     This is signed by many of the leaders in our  community, including the President of Johns Hopkins University; the  head of Under Armour, a great American company; the head of a number of  major companies in the city of Baltimore; the Casey Foundation; Morgan  State University, a great HBCU; Eddie Brown, one of our great civic  leaders; and many other leaders of Baltimore--diverse leaders who have  come together to stand up with pride for the city of Baltimore.   I would like to read to the Senate what they say in the first  paragraph:         We are proud and privileged to call Baltimore home.       Baltimore is a city of creativity, optimism, and       determination. Home to leading public and private research       universities, world-class medical institutions, and a diverse       business community, Baltimore is a city where both artists       and start-ups thrive. From creating one of the nation's first       racially integrated library systems to producing today's       modern medical and technological breakthroughs, our city has       a proud legacy of leadership in improving lives and setting a       national example for a stronger tomorrow.    I want to pay particular attention to these next sentences:         It's no wonder we are often named as a place where       millennials are moving and staying. This is a city where       people not only want to live, but love to live.    If you come to Baltimore today, you will, in fact, find lots of young  people from other parts of the country coming to settle, work, and  raise their families in this great American city. The President may say  that nobody wants to live in Baltimore, but the facts show a very  different story about young people--young people who understand that  they have a great future in Baltimore and are moving to that great  city.   Of course, it is true that Baltimore faces a series of problems. In  Baltimore we have had a legacy of racial discrimination and  segregation.   I would like to read from yesterday's editorial in the Baltimore Sun.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the editorial from the Baltimore Sun, dated July 29, 2019.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S5168]]                       [From the Baltimore Sun, July 29, 2019]  Cummings Didn't Cause Baltimore's Woes; It Was People Who Profited From                     Racism. Sound Familiar, Mr. Trump?                     (By Baltimore Sun Editorial Board)         It's not our job to defend Rep. Elijah Cummings from       President Donald Trump's Twitter rants. For one thing, he's       quite capable of doing it on his own, and for another, our       role isn't to offer blind loyalty to political leaders of any       party but to hold them to account. Likewise, we're not in the       business of defending Baltimore from any and all criticism.       Our city has problems, big ones, and we don't shy away from       them, nor do we give any politicians a pass for failing to do       as much as humanly possible to fix them. But we are sticklers       for facts and perspective, and in case anybody is still       interested in those things, we have a few that are worth       mentioning.        Mr. Cummings has not single-handedly solved Baltimore's       racial and class inequities, its injustices, its blight, its       epidemics of lead poisoning and asthma, its violence or,       indeed, its problems with rats. And he has been in office for       a long time, more than 30 years between Congress and the       Maryland House of Delegates. But Baltimore's problems go back       a lot farther than that.        President Trump, whose early career was marred by a federal       housing discrimination suit, may be interested to know that       Baltimore was something of a pioneer in that regard. It       enacted the first housing segregation ordinances, which were       soon invalidated by the Supreme Court, leading to subtler and       more nefarious tactics. Racially restrictive covenants,       privately enforced, prevented the sale of homes in certain       neighborhoods to minorities. Redlining prevented minorities       from getting financing to buy homes in white neighborhoods.       And blockbusting made rich the unscrupulous men who       capitalized on racism and fear to drive white flight. They       profiteered on blacks who sought security and better       opportunities but instead found themselves exploited and       impoverished.        Those days aren't nearly so far in the past as we might       like to think. Just seven years ago, Baltimore settled a       landmark lending discrimination suit against Wells Fargo,       which steered minority borrowers into subprime mortgages--the       sort of abuse the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which       Mr. Trump has eviscerated, might have prevented. Landlords in       Baltimore continue to take advantage of rules stacked in       their favor to evict low-income (and frequently minority)       tenants; in a particularly egregious example, the Kushner       Cos. (as in Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner) has aggressively       sought to jail tenants who fall behind on their rent.        As whites moved to the suburbs, sped along the way by       massive investments in new highways, water and sewer systems,       schools and other public amenities, Baltimore City's       infrastructure began to crumble. Neighborhoods like those in       the East and West Baltimore portions of Mr. Cummings'       district became increasingly isolated from economic and       educational opportunities. (Mr. Cummings was among the       Baltimore leaders who sought to address that problem through       the development of a new light rail line connecting those       neighborhoods to employment centers including the Social       Security Administration and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical       Center, but Gov. Larry Hogan, who over the weekend responded       to Mr. Trump's tweets by calling Baltimore ``the very heart       of the state'' and on Monday by asking why politicians aren't       ``focused on solving the problems and getting to work,''       killed the project.)        Meanwhile, back in the '90s, Democrats and Republicans both       discovered that espousing zero-tolerance policing was great       politics, so long as it was enforced disproportionately       against blacks and Hispanics in the nation's cities and not       against whites in suburban and rural communities. Plenty of       people share blame for that, including former Vice President       Joe Biden and former Maryland Gov. (and former Baltimore       mayor) Martin O'Malley. But not a lot of them continue to       espouse the notion that locking more people up for minor       offenses or stopping and frisking people on the streets are       good ideas, as the Trump administration has done.        The Obama administration tried to do something about the       pockets of concentrated poverty in American cities (and       Baltimore specifically) by using federal housing policy to       affirmatively foster desegregation, something the Fair       Housing Act had called for 50 years before, but Mr. Trump's       HUD secretary, Baltimore's own Ben Carson, has been working       to dismantle those efforts.        We will agree with President Trump on one thing, though. We       wish Mr. Cummings weren't so focused on investigating the       Trump administration. We wish, for example, that immigrant       children weren't being held in inhumane conditions at the       border, that the White House complied with congressional       subpoenas, that administration officials weren't conducting       public business on private email accounts or that the       president of the United States didn't look on the office as a       giant profit center for himself and his family. If not for       things like that, Mr. Cummings' role as chairman of the House       Committee on Oversight and Reform would probably take up much       less of his time.     Here is what yesterday's Baltimore Sun editorial  states:         President Trump, whose early career was marred by a federal       housing discrimination suit, may be interested to know that       Baltimore was something of a pioneer in that regard. It       enacted the first housing segregation ordinances, which were       soon invalidated by the Supreme Court, leading to subtler and       more nefarious tactics. Racially restrictive covenants,       privately enforced, prevented the sale of homes in certain       neighborhoods to minorities. Redlining prevented minorities       from getting financing to buy homes in white neighborhoods.       And blockbusting made rich the unscrupulous men who       capitalized on racism and fear to drive white flight. They       profiteered on blacks who sought security and better       opportunities but instead found themselves exploited and       impoverished.    They go on to make the point:         Those days aren't nearly so far in the past as we might       like to think. Just seven years ago, Baltimore settled a       landmark lending discrimination suit against Wells Fargo,       which steered minority borrowers into subprime mortgages--the       sort of abuse the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which       Mr. Trump has eviscerated, might have prevented. Landlords in       Baltimore continue to take advantage of rules stacked in       their favor to evict low-income (and frequently minority)       tenants; in a particularly egregious example, the Kushner       Cos. (as in Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner) has aggressively       sought to jail tenants who fall behind on their rent.    We do have a legacy of discrimination in Baltimore City to overcome.  The President, instead of challenging that legacy, has decided to pile  on in the manner he did with his comments.   I know that Baltimore will rise above this. I know the city is  resilient, and I know this great city's greatest days are still ahead  as we tackle that legacy and move on to the future. But I think we as a  body--both Republicans and Democrats alike--have an obligation to also  stand up for our country. We cannot allow these kind of remarks out of  the Oval Office to go unanswered. We cannot allow silence when the  President of the United States challenges the very idea of what it  means to be American, which is a place where people of all different  backgrounds, all different races, and all different religions can come  together: ``E pluribus unum.'' The President wants to drive a stake in  that idea. He wants to divide the country, and we cannot be silent  while he soils the Oval Office.   I ask all of us to speak out, wherever we are, when we see this kind  of attack by the President of the United States. It is wrong for our  country. It is bad for our country. It is a disgrace to the Oval  Office.   The one thing I can say is that, in the face of that disgrace,  Baltimore has shown great dignity, incredible dignity, the dignity of a  city of people who see a wonderful future ahead, and we should all work  together to make that future as bright as possible.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article from today's Baltimore Sun editorial board.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [July 30, 2019]                  Better To Have a Few Rats Than To Be One                     (By Baltimore Sun Editorial Board)         In case anyone missed it, the president of the United       States had some choice words to describe Maryland's 7th       congressional district on Saturday morning. Here are the key       phrases: ``no human being would want to live there,'' it is a       ``very dangerous & filthy place,'' ``Worst in the USA'' and,       our personal favorite: It is a ``rat and rodent infested       mess.'' He wasn't really speaking of the 7th as a whole. He       failed to mention Ellicott City, for example, or Baldwin or       Monkton or Prettyboy, all of which are contained in the       sprawling yet oddly-shaped district that runs from western       Howard County to southern Harford County. No, Donald Trump's       wrath was directed at Baltimore and specifically at Rep.       Elijah Cummings, the 68-year-old son of a former South       Carolina sharecropper who has represented the district in the       U.S. House of Representatives since 1996.        It's not hard to see what's going on here. The congressman       has been a thorn in this president's side, and Mr. Trump sees       attacking African American members of Congress as good       politics, as it both warms the cockles of the white       supremacists who love him and causes so many of the       thoughtful people who don't to scream. President Trump bad-      mouthed Baltimore in order to make a point that the border       camps are ``clean, efficient & well run,'' which, of course,       they are not--unless you are fine with all the overcrowding,       squalor, cages and deprivation to be found in what the       Department of Homeland Security's own inspector-general       recently called ``a ticking time bomb.''  [[Page S5169]]         In pointing to the 7th, the president wasn't hoping his       supporters would recognize landmarks like Johns Hopkins       Hospital, perhaps the nation's leading medical center. He       wasn't conjuring images of the U.S. Social Security       Administration, where they write the checks that so many       retired and disabled Americans depend upon. It wasn't about       the beauty of the Inner Harbor or the proud history of Fort       McHenry. And it surely wasn't about the economic standing of       a district where the median income is actually above the       national average. No, he was returning to an old standby of       attacking an African American lawmaker from a majority black       district on the most emotional and bigoted of arguments. It       was only surprising that there wasn't room for a few classic       phrases like ``you people'' or ``welfare queens'' or ``crime-      ridden ghettos'' or a suggestion that the congressman ``go       back'' to where he came from.        This is a president who will happily debase himself at the       slightest provocation. And given Mr. Cummings' criticisms of       U.S. border policy, the various investigations he has       launched as chairman of the House Oversight Committee, his       willingness to call Mr. Trump a racist for his recent attacks       on the freshmen congresswomen, and the fact that ``Fox &       Friends'' had recently aired a segment critical of the city,       slamming Baltimore must have been irresistible in a Pavlovian       way. Fox News rang the bell, the president salivated and his       thumbs moved across his cell phone into action.        As heartening as it has been to witness public figures rise       to Charm City's defense on Saturday, from native daughter       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Mayor Bernard C. ``Jack''       Young, we would above all remind Mr. Trump that the 7th       District, Baltimore included, is part of the United States       that he is supposedly governing. The White House has far more       power to effect change in this city, for good or ill, than       any single member of Congress including Mr. Cummings. If       there are problems here, rodents included, they are as much       his responsibility as anyone's, perhaps more because he holds       the most powerful office in the land.        Finally, while we would not sink to name-calling in the       Trumpian manner--or ruefully point out that he failed to       spell the congressman's name correctly (it's Cummings, not       Cumming)--we would tell the most dishonest man to ever occupy       the Oval Office, the mocker of war heroes, the gleeful       grabber of women's private parts, the serial bankrupter of       businesses, the useful idiot of Vladimir Putin and the guy       who insisted there are ``good people'' among murderous neo-      Nazis that he's still not fooling most Americans into       believing he's even slightly competent in his current post.       Or that he possesses a scintilla of integrity. Better to have       some vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one.     With that, I yield to the senior Senator from  Maryland, my friend, Ben Cardin.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Cardin,  for talking about some of the highlights of Baltimore City and the  storied history of Baltimore City. It is a history of much good but  also a lot of challenges that I recounted earlier. It doesn't do  Baltimore City or any city in this country any good when the person in  the highest office in this country launches these nasty, personal,  racial diatribes.   I know the President had a history of these kinds of comments before  he came to the Oval Office. But now that he is in the Oval Office, all  of us have an obligation and responsibility to speak out when he fouls  the office in that way.   If the President really wants to help cities like Baltimore, he can  do some of the things Senator Cardin talked about. On a bipartisan  basis in the Appropriations Committee, we are working to make  investments that will help that city and many other cities with things  like the CDBG--community development block grants--things like economic  development administration proposals, things like financing through  CDFIs, and things like minority business enterprises. Those are four  investments. They don't solve the problems, but they certainly help.   Here is the thing. In President Trump's budget, zero--he zeroed out  every single one of those programs.   I propose a major additional investment in our schools throughout  this country, including title I schools, which are schools in lower  income areas. That would be a huge boost to education throughout the  country and to the city of Baltimore.   As Senator Cardin said, we need to make investments in our national  infrastructure. We have a great, thriving port in Baltimore with good- paying jobs, so we need to expand it.   There are so many things we can and should be doing, but the  President, apparently, according to many, has this political strategy  where he doesn't want to talk about those things. It is a political  strategy that seeks to divide this country, not to unite this country.  If you think about that, that is a pretty sick political strategy. It  is sick for the country, sick for Maryland, and sick for Baltimore.   So I hope all of us will work to focus on the things we can do to  make Baltimore and Maryland and this country stronger and end this kind  of divisive rhetoric. Part of ending it means speaking out against it  when we see it. We need everybody in this body to join us in doing it.   Again, I think when it comes to the city of Baltimore, it is going to  rise way above the President's comments. It understands it has  challenges, but it also understands it has a great future. Let us--all  together--be part of a great future for Baltimore and this country, and  that means coming together to serve the interests of all of our  constituents.   I thank the Senate for the time Senator Cardin and I have had here.   I yield the floor.
