 Madam Speaker, for too long, healthcare providers  struggling with mental illness have suffered in silence, intimidated by  stigma and afraid of being penalized for seeking treatment.   Even before the pandemic, 42 percent of the physicians reported  experiencing burnout, and 40 percent reported a reluctance to seek  treatment for a medical health condition. This is far too many people  suffering in silence.   How can we expect our doctors to take care of us when they feel they  can't take care of themselves?   The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, named for a  doctor who lost her life to suicide after fighting on the front lines  of the pandemic, will help reduce and prevent suicide, burnout, and  mental health conditions of healthcare professionals. It does so by  supporting training to prevent suicide and burnout; creating a national  awareness campaign encouraging healthcare professionals to seek support  for mental health concerns; and establishing a comprehensive study on  healthcare professional mental health and burnout, including the impact  of the pandemic.   Our healthcare professionals have been serving on the front lines,  taking care of us amid an unprecedented global pandemic. It is time we  take care of them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation.
