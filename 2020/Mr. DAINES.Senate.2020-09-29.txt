 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to use props during my speech.    Madam President, water is the most basic element of human  life. In Montana, we depend on a steady supply of water to drink, to  irrigate our crops, to water our livestock, and to provide energy  through hydropower. Water is a precious resource, but there are still  rural communities in Montana that face challenges to access and that  are in dire need of Federal assistance. The health and economic risks  associated with the lack of reliable water have increased because of  the current pandemic.   I stand here today to highlight three bills that would ensure rural  Montana communities have access to water.   S. 1882 would allow the 130 family farms in the Kinsey Irrigation  Company and Sidney Water Users Irrigation District to continue the use  of Pick-Sloan power, which they have reasonably relied on for more than  74 years. Thankfully, this bill has been passed out of the U.S. Senate  and now awaits House consideration. I thank both Senate and House  leadership for getting this bill to the finish line, and I urge my  colleagues in the House to pass it.   Another Montana water priority is the bipartisan St. Mary's  Reinvestment Act, which supports the St. Mary and Milk River Project by  allowing the reconstruction and restoration of the over 100-year-old  infrastructure. I am proud to be working with the entire Montana  delegation on this important bill that supplies over 18,000 water users  and municipalities along the Hi-Line, including the Blackfeet  Reservation and Fort Belknap.   The catastrophic failure of a drop structure this past summer is  proof that Congress must pass this bipartisan legislation. I spent time  out there in July and saw firsthand the catastrophic failure of that  drop and why it is so important to get this legislation passed. This  bill is critical for Montana's families and Montana's farmers and  ranchers along the Hi-Line.   I would also like to highlight my bipartisan bill, the Clean Water  for Rural Communities Act. It is hard to believe that there are  approximately 40,000 Americans across 12 counties in both Montana and  North Dakota who currently do not have access to water that is safe to  drink. In fact, I have brought with me today some examples of the  drinking water that Montanans in the central and eastern parts of our  State have shared with me.   Here is a sample that literally came from the tap of the Arnesons. It  is hard to believe we are in 2020 and that a Montanan can open up a tap  and see water like this.   This example came from the Good family. Again, it is yellow water,  and this is black water. This is water that has literally come from the  taps of Montanans who live in the eastern part of our State.   You see, iron content in these impacted areas is nearly five times  the  [[Page S5921]]  Safe Drinking Water Act's standard, and nearly all residents must rely  on bottled water. This water is so contaminated that it is corrosive to  appliances, which requires residents to operate water softeners to  avoid damage.   My bill would allow two regional, rural water systems to be rebuilt  in order to provide Montanans access to reliable, safe water in central  and eastern Montana. I don't think that is asking for too much. All we  are asking for is reliable and safe water for thousands of Montanans.  Both of these rural drinking water projects have been working with the  Bureau of Reclamation for over 15 years to gain Federal authorization,  and they can't wait any longer.   I rise on behalf of the 40,000 Montanans who lack access to clean  water, and I urge the swift passage of the Clean Water for Rural  Communities Act as well as the St. Mary's Reinvestment Act   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Laura Nowlin of Teton County for her compassion and  dedication to her community.   Since 1986, Laura has devoted her time to working at the Teton County  Food Pantry as both a volunteer and a member of the executive board.  Over the course of her 33 years at the food pantry, she ensured  families in the community had healthy and hearty groceries with no  exceptions. Rain or shine, Laura was always there to help the people of  Teton County get the nutrition they needed.   Recently named the board member emeritus of the pantry, Laura will be  dearly missed by her colleagues. Her unwavering selflessness was an  incredibly valuable asset to both the pantry and her community and will  continue to be in her new capacity.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Laura for her tireless service  to the people of Teton County. Her kindness and charitable approach to  work serves as an inspiration to all Montanans who serve our  communities.                            ____________________
