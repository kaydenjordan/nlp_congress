 Madam Speaker, I have the honor of representing El Paso,  Texas, a critical hub for commerce and trade with one of the busiest  land ports of entry in the country.   Today, I am proud to have voted for the passage of the America  COMPETES Act to strengthen supply chains, U.S. competitiveness, and  create good-paying STEM jobs at home. It will build on policies  championed by congressional Democrats and President Biden that have led  to a historic year of job creation, as shown in today's jobs report.   The bill includes my amendments to address many El Paso priorities on  local job creation, addressing the climate crisis, and optimizing our  ports of entry.   One of my amendments creates a mandatory set-aside specifically for  small businesses, the backbone of our local economy, to move into the  solar component manufacturing sector.   Additionally, I included amendments that respond to the climate  crisis by ensuring that we reduce deforestation and carbon dioxide  emissions in developing nations and allow environmental defenders to  assist in developing our climate-resilient strategy.   My amendments also address the needs of our ports of entry, El Paso's  major artery for trade and commerce.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have also addressed inflation.                            ____________________
