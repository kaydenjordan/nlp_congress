 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party poses a generational  threat to the United States and our freedom-loving allies around the  world.   They are brutally oppressing their own people. They are committing  genocide against ethnic and religious minorities. They are expanding  their military reach and carrying out territorial aggression against  their neighbors. We cannot wait any longer to address these issues.   Madam Speaker, I stand before you, quite frankly, disappointed. We  had a great opportunity here, and this bill that passed the House is  not the bill. I am very hopeful we can get to a good place in our  conference committee.   Unfortunately, the Democrat leaders chose not to work with  Republicans to pass a substantive, meaningful bill to counter this  malign influence. Instead,  [[Page H4051]]  they jammed the partisan COMPETES Act through the House.   The COMPETES Act, in my judgment, is a Trojan horse filled with  unserious, dangerous, and wasteful provisions.                                time  1630    Those provisions include fringe, progressive priorities, like $8  billion worth of taxpayer money into an unaccountable U.N. slush fund.  This U.N. slush fund has already provided at least $100 million  directly to China, a country that this Congress, former Republican  administration, and current Democrat administration have all agreed is  committing genocide.   In fact, it is worse. The Xinjiang Province--you get this money to  make solar panels and batteries in the Xinjiang Province where they  commit genocide itself. That is not good for America and it is  certainly not good for the U.S. taxpayer.   Secretary Kerry admitted before our committee that the CCP is using  slave labor to make these green energy products--like solar panels and  batteries--that could be used by this U.N. fund. In effect, the bill  would fund their slave labor and prop up their forced abortions. We  tried to stop this from happening--to stop U.S. taxpayers from funding  slave labor in my motion to recommit, and shockingly, we were outright  rejected by the Democrats.   The motion to recommit prohibited taxpayer money going to slave  labor, genocide, and the Wuhan Lab, and every Democrat voted against  that measure. This is a test of our time.   Madam Speaker, so I remain the eternal optimist and hopeful that this  conference process will be able to rectify these glaring issues that I  have outlined. We can start today by supporting this motion that will  block billions of dollars going to the CCP military PLA companies and  human rights abusers.   Congress owes it to the American people to pass a bill that takes  this threat seriously. That includes tough export controls, outbound  investment screening and funding for the CHIPS for America Act, which I  introduced, to give us a competitive edge, bring manufacturing to the  United States to make advanced semiconductor chips and protect our  national security at the same time.   This is vitally important to our national security, and it keeps  critical U.S. technology out of the hands of the Chinese military, like  hypersonics. It ensures U.S. taxpayers are not subsidizing their  genocide.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to  instruct. I hope we can all work together in a bipartisan manner on  what could be the most important legislation of this Congress.
