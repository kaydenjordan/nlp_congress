 Mr. Speaker, today Washington is once again kicking the  can down the road. We are adding nearly $2 million in debt per minute.   What is this institution doing about it? Kicking the can down the  road, while at the same time the Democrats across the aisle want to  spend trillions more.   By borrowing another $480 billion, Speaker Pelosi and President Biden  are simply kicking the can down the road. We can't continue to avoid  our responsibilities and spend ourselves into oblivion.   Those across the aisle are not being honest with the American people  who are going to have to ultimately pay for this.   This is not responsible. Prices for workers, families, and seniors  continue to rise because of Washington's out-of-control spending. Yet,  Washington refuses to take accountability for its spending problem.   Today's vote will simply kick the can down the road once again and  fail to get our spending here in Washington under control.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. We must stop the out- of-control spending in Washington.
