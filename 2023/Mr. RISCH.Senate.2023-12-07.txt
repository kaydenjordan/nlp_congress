 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this resolution.  First, this resolution obscures the facts and alleges that American  troops are involved in hostilities in Syria.   American troops have remained in Syria across multiple  administrations to ensure the lasting defeat of the Islamic State. Our  presence is authorized under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of  Military Force, the legal cornerstone of our counterterrorism  operations around the world. The Islamic State remains a threat to  Americans and our partners. According to the State Department's latest  reports on terrorism, the Islamic State ``remains resilient and  determined to attack.''   Senator Paul no doubt recalls the Islamic State's attacks across the  region--the depraved videos of slaves, beheadings, the Yazidi genocide,  and the attacks against civilians in France and into the heart of  Europe. As recently as last year, we saw the Islamic State conduct a  prison break in northern Syria and witnessed an uptick in attacks.  Despite the fact that we shattered their caliphate, the group is down,  but not out. Our troop presence is a critical element to maintaining  pressure on the Islamic State and keeping Americans safe.   Senator Paul's resolution points to the numerous Iranian-sponsored  attacks against our troops in Iraq and Syria. I share these concerns  and urge the administration to do more to establish deterrence against  Iran.   The House went through this exercise as recently as March and voted  down a similar effort to pull our troops by a wide margin.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
