 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for  organizing this Special Order hour tonight to talk about the Bible.   When we have so much reverence for the Bible--and even though from  this very city we have been ridiculed for clinging to our guns and our  Bibles--I find it so unusual in a country that has been so blessed, a  Nation that has been so blessed by God that we would actually at times  ridicule His Word.   President Franklin Roosevelt, as we have been told, first declared  National Bible Week in 1941. Why did he do that? It was on the eve of  World War II. Throughout history, the Bible has been our source of  hope, inspiration, and strength for many. In times of peril, adversity,  and tragedy, its words provide even greater comfort.   President Lincoln said, ``I have been driven many times upon my knees  by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My own  wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.''   And that is when we turn to our Bibles, that is when we fall to our  knees. That is when we know, as men, we are not able on our own to  change the things that need to be changed, and we have to cling to our  Bibles. That is where we find solace. That is where we find faith. That  is where we find trust.   What a wonderful opportunity not only for this House but for the  people of the United States of America to stop and take survey of where  we are and where we are going, and then go back and reference in the  greatest book ever written to find out what it is that we need to do.   It is when we turn away from God that America fails, and it is when  we do fall to our knees when it seems like there is no other place to  go that we find great solace, great faith, and great confidence in our  God, through the Bible.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for what he did tonight. This is  the time for the United States of America to open her Bibles and follow  what is written there. It comes directly from God.
