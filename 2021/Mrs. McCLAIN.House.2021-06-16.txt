 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  Marine Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest, a St. Clair County native who  was killed while serving his country 11 years ago today.   Corporal Standfest was only 23 years old when an IED struck and  killed him and his K-9 partner, Sergeant Rupert, in Afghanistan.   Like all of our fallen heroes, Jeff was not just a soldier in war. He  was a son, a brother, a nephew, a grandson, and a friend. A star runner  at St. Clair High School, Jeff was an all-American kid who loved his  country and followed in the footsteps of his grandfather by serving in  the Marine Corps. This is who he was, and this is how he will be  remembered.   I recently introduced bipartisan legislation to rename the St. Clair  County Post Office after Corporal Standfest. Renaming this post office  would serve as a permanent reminder of his selfless service to our  country. To his friends, family, and loved ones, it will demonstrate  that the United States will never forget his bravery and ultimate  sacrifice.   It is the courage of Corporal Standfest and all of those who have  worn the uniform that protects the freedoms we hold so dear.   Today, on the anniversary of his tragic death, I hope all of those  who knew and loved him find comfort knowing that Corporal Jeffrey  Robert Standfest will forever be remembered in history as a patriotic  American hero. I am hopeful my colleagues in Congress will join me in  honoring this courageous American.                            ____________________
