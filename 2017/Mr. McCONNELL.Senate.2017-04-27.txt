 Mr. President, yesterday, the administration  introduced a plan to serve as the guideline for modernizing and  simplifying America's Tax Code. This process is long overdue, and it is  a priority that is shared by the Republican House, Senate, and the  administration. By bringing down tax rates for individuals, we can help  ease the burden on middle-class families, and by lowering taxes for  American businesses, both small and large, we can foster job creation  here at home, while making our country more competitive in an  increasingly competitive international economy. I commend the President  and his team for taking this critical first step, and I look forward to  working with the administration and our House colleagues to finally  overhaul our tax system.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, despite much  unnecessary obstruction, the Senate has continued to move forward with  the confirmation process for administration nominees.   Just this week, we have confirmed two more impressive individuals-- Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein. Today, we will have the opportunity to confirm a third.  That nominee, Alexander Acosta, understands the difficult task ahead of  him as the next Secretary of Labor. Fortunately, he has an impressive  background that will serve him well as he takes on these tough issues.  It explains why Acosta has earned high acclaim from numerous pro-job  groups, like the National Association of Manufacturers, which called  him an ``exceptional choice to lead the Department,'' and the chamber  of commerce, which noted his ``extraordinary history of government  service and refined skills.''   He has also earned support from across the political spectrum,  including from people like Lafe Solomon, a National Labor Relations  Board Acting General Counsel in the Obama administration, who said  Acosta is ``very open-minded and fair'' and ``deserves to be Secretary  of Labor.''  [[Page S2566]]    We have also heard from unions that have backed him as well. In their  words, Acosta is an ``advocate for the middle class,'' a nominee with  ``strong credentials and an impeccable reputation,'' and someone they  can work with ``to protect and make better the lives of working men and  women across America.''   Acosta's leadership at the Labor Department will serve as a much  needed change from what we saw under the previous administration, when,  too often, onerous regulations that stifled instead of encouraged  growth were given high priority, which came at a disadvantage to the  very workers the previous administration claimed to be helping.   Of course, much work remains when it comes to providing relief to  middle-class workers, but today's vote to confirm Acosta represents  another positive step in that direction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final issue, as we know, talks  on government funding legislation have continued throughout the week on  a bipartisan, bicameral basis. The House has introduced a short-term  funding bill that we expect to pass before Friday night's deadline so  that a final agreement can be drafted and shared with Members for their  review prior to its consideration next week. This extension will also  protect thousands of retired coal miners and their families from losing  the healthcare benefits I have fought for throughout this entire  process, as I continue to lead the fight to secure them on a permanent  basis.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, colleagues, it is my understanding that  the four corners who are working on the omnibus appropriations are  very, very close to agreement. We still need a few days to process the  larger bill. The House has posted a 1-week CR to keep the government  open. We are prepared to clear the 1-week CR on this side of the aisle.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a joint  resolution, which is at the desk--that is, a 1-week continuing  resolution--be printed in the Record; further, that if the Senate  receives a joint resolution from the House, the text of which is  identical to the text of the joint resolution printed in the Record,  the joint resolution be considered to have been read three times and  passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered to have been  made and laid upon the table; provided further, that if the language is  not identical, then this order be vitiated.    Mr. President, I would only add--not to prolong the  discussion, but I don't think the failure to pass the 1-week CR  necessarily impacts in a positive way the concerns the Democratic  leader has. But that is his call to make. This 1-week CR is cleared on  our side.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to make sure my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle know that if we don't pass the 1-week  extension, the miners' healthcare expires, but it is in the 1-week  extension. If we don't pass the 1-week extension, the miners'  healthcare revision expires.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I  move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m., Friday,  April 28; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a period  of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to  10 minutes each.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Sullivan.
