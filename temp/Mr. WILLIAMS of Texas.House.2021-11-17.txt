 Madam Speaker, the Biden inflation crisis has  hit the poor and middle-income families the hardest.   Inflation just reached a 30-year high, and consumer prices have  increased to an astonishing 6.2 percent compared to 12 months ago. This  has serious impacts on hardworking families as they try to make ends  meet and prepare for the holiday season.   Are you planning on buying a 16-pound turkey? Be prepared to pay 18  percent more this year. That does not even include the stuffing.   Are you planning on driving to visit family for the holidays? Plan on  paying 61 percent more in gas prices than last year.   Instead of taking action to rein in wasteful government spending and  address rising costs, the White House is claiming a vote for the Build  Back Better plan will solve the inflation crisis, which is a complete  lie any way you look at it.   Their socialist spending plan will add more fuel to the inflation  crisis and worsen their self-made supply chain crisis.   It is no wonder a majority of Americans disapprove of President  Biden's handling of the economy, and it gets worse every single day.   Americans cannot afford to fund the Democrats' liberal wish list, and  it is  [[Page H6327]]  time that Washington bureaucrats take real action to get back to fiscal  responsibility and save our country.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
