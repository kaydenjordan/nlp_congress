 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Miami  Bridge on its 33rd anniversary. Located in my congressional district,  Miami Bridge works to provide a safe haven for teens who are abandoned,  neglected, and homeless in Miami-Dade County.   Miami Bridge is the only emergency home in south Florida which  shelters children from ages 10 to 17. This organization provides and  promotes positive youth development programs and strengthens families  to enable children and teens to become productive members of our  community.   Annually, Miami Bridge houses more than 600 children and teens and  provides counseling to more than 550 families. From assisting families  in developing the necessary skills to comfort at-risk children to  empowering youngsters with opportunities to make positive life choices,  Miami Bridge's many services help children overcome the challenges that  confront them and realize their full potential.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to represent Miami Bridge, and I  congratulate its wonderful staff, its board members, and its volunteers  for their tremendous efforts to save at-risk youth from a life of  victimization and homelessness.                            ____________________
