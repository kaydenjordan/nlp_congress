 Mr. Speaker, the members of the January 6th  Commission have turned this body into a star chamber, using the powers  of Congress to persecute and bankrupt their political opponents.   Using political power to destroy your political opponents is evil and  un-American. We are not a banana republic.   Right now, the American people are suffering under the harsh economic  realities of the Biden administration: Record-high inflation, record- high gas prices, record-high home heating bills, empty shelves at  Christmas. COVID mandates and lockdowns continue to threaten our  economy and our children's future.   What is the January 6th Commission's response to the suffering of the  American people under Biden's policies? A never-ending political witch  hunt against President Trump.   The January 6th Commission hates President Trump because he exposed  the corruption of the D.C. establishment here in the swamp.    This January 6th Commission is a disgrace, and anyone who voted for  it should be ashamed of themselves.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule.
