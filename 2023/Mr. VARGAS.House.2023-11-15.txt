 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Linda Kay Mitrovich, a  beloved friend, leader, and mentor.   Linda was born on May 18, 1947, in Whittier, California.   She was a dedicated public servant. She served on the Poway City  Council and was deputy mayor from 1986 to 1988.   She committed her life to the betterment of others. She took on many  important causes, including environmental protection and Native  American sovereignty.   She played a significant role in creating the first wildlife corridor  in California, the Coal Canyon Wildlife Reserve, which supported the  ecological well-being of over 22 million people in southern California.   Linda also created the first national conference on Native American  sovereignty in 2000.   The California State legislature recognized her accomplishments by  naming her Woman of the Year in 1988 and in 1991.   Linda's legacy is remembered through her husband and five children.  Her memory is cherished by those fortunate enough to have met her.                            ____________________
