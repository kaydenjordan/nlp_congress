 Madam Speaker, I stand in favor of  removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights  amendment, and I ask the following question: What do the following  women have in common?   Teacher Melissa Falkowski, who saved 19 children during the massacre  at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School;   Senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs in a combat mission  in Iraq;   Chemist Alice Ball, who revolutionized the treatment for leprosy;   Joy Harjo, who was the first Native American poet laureate;   Dolores Huerta, civil rights activist;   The nearly 9 out of 10 nurses and two-thirds of the workers at  grocery store checkouts and fast-food counters who are women.   What do they have in common? No matter the sacrifice or contribution  to society, if you are a woman or a girl in the United States of  America, you are not guaranteed equality under the law.   After 245 years since the birth of our Nation, it is time to pass the  equal rights amendment.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, consider this: Your spouse or partner calls you names,  he insults you, puts you down.   He discourages you from going to work or school or seeing family  members or friends.   He tries to control how you spend your money, where you go, or who  you can see, what medicines you take.   He acts possessive, gets angry when drinking alcohol.   He tries to control when you can see a doctor; threatens you with  violence; and may hit, kick, shove, slap, choke, or otherwise hurt you,  your children, your pets.   He forces you to have sex against your will. He blames you for his  violent behavior and tells you that you deserve it.   And this comes from someone you love.   You are in pain and embarrassed to ask for help. You are one in four  women. The Violence Against Women Act is critical for your safety and  economic independence.   Madam Speaker, I urge its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, my sister in good trouble.   This is Women's History Month, a time to reflect the gains women have  made; the struggles we continue to face; and the strong, fearless, and  selfless women who have and continue to pave the way.   I have often lamented, as have many of my colleagues here, that for  women to reach their full potential, we must be in charge of our own  reproductive destiny. No one should have to call their Governor or  Member of Congress for permission to access contraception or abortion.  And even after the landmark decision Roe v. Wade, it is a constant  battle to protect a hard-fought right to legal abortion.   We have seen Republican administrations and Republican States  legislatures create obstacle after obstacle to prevent women from  achieving reproductive freedom, blocking access to legal abortion and  even contraception.   We have seen private citizens, under the guise of protecting lives,  threaten abortion providers, including assassinating physicians that  provide abortions.   And then there are the angels on the ground who, day in and day out,  protect our precious right to reproductive freedom.   With this background, I want to highlight a courageous woman in my  hometown of West Palm Beach, Florida, who has made and continues to  make history as a great champion of women's reproductive rights. She is  one of the bravest people I know, someone I am proud to call a friend.  Her name is Mona Reis.    Mona's mission began early on in life, as a teenager. Six years  before Roe v. Wade, she participated in a Florida's Girls State program  that gives teen girls an opportunity to run the Florida State  Legislature, and she actually introduced a bill to legalize abortion in  the State. Of course, it didn't pass.   But this was just the beginning of a lifelong career and a commitment  to protecting a woman's right to choose, from working at the first  outpatient abortion clinic established in Florida in the 1970s to, now,  building her own outpatient clinic, the Presidential Women's Center, 41  years ago.   She has been fighting to make sure that all women, no matter their  age, race, or economic status, are able to access full reproductive  care, including abortion.   Her clinic has treated more than half a million women for things like  prenatal care, HTDs, family planning, and pregnancy termination.   This has been a fulfilling but sometimes dangerous mission. Every  week for 40 years, the clinic is surrounded by protesters who taunt  patients as they enter for care.   In 2005, her clinic was burned to the ground in an arson attack, but  she has continued to provide high-quality and compassionate care  despite the fact that she has had to endure so much.   Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to talk today.   It is an honor to recognize Mona Reis, an unsung heroine who  continues to make our communities a safer and a healthier place for  women and girls. It is an honor to know her, to thank her, to celebrate  her as we recognize Women's History Month.                                time  2000
