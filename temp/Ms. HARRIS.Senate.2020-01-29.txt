 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Harris is for the House  managers:         President Nixon said, ``When the president does it that       means that it is not illegal.'' Before he was elected,       President Trump said, ``When you're a star, they let you do       it. You can do anything.'' After he was elected, President       Trump said that Article II of the Constitution gives him       ``the right to do whatever [he] want[s] as president.'' These       statements suggest that each of them believed that the       president is above the law--a belief reflected in the       improper actions that both presidents took to affect their       reelection campaigns. If the Senate fails to hold the       President accountable for misconduct, how would that       undermine the integrity of our system of justice?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S658, January 29, 2020, second column, the following  appears: President Nixon said, ``When the president does it that  means that it is not illegal.'' Before he was elected, President  Trump said, ``When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do  anything.'' After he was elected, President Trump said that  Article II of the Constitution gives him ``the right to do  whatever [he] want[s] as president.''

If the Senate fails to hold  the president accountable for misconduct, how would that undermine  the integrity of our system of justice?      The online Record has been corrected to read: President Nixon  said, ``When the president does it that means that it is not  illegal.'' Before he was elected, President Trump said, ``When  you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.'' After he  was elected, President Trump said that Article II of the  Constitution gives him ``the right to do whatever [he] want[s] as  president.'' These statements suggest that each of them believed  that the president is above the law--a belief reflected in the  improper actions that both presidents took to affect their  reelection campaigns. If the Senate fails to hold the President  accountable for misconduct, how would that undermine the integrity  of our system of justice?    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I think this is  exactly the fear. I think, if you look at the pattern in this  President's conduct and his words, what you see is a President who  identifies the state as being himself. When the President talks about  the people who report his wrongdoing--for example, when he describes a  whistleblower as a traitor or a spy--the only way you can conceive of  someone who reports wrongdoing as committing a crime against the  country is if you believe that you are synonymous with the country,  that any report of wrongdoing against the President--the person the  President--is a treasonous act. It is the kind of mentality that says  that under article II, I can do whatever I want, that I am allowed to  fight all subpoenas.   Counsel has given a variety of explanations for the fighting of all  subpoenas. They might have had a plausible argument if the  administration had given hundreds of documents but reserved some and  made a claim of privilege or if the administration has said: We will  allow these witnesses to testify, but with these witnesses, with these  particular questions, we want to assert the privilege.   Of course, that is not what was done here. What we have, instead, is  a shifting series of rationales, of explanations, and duplicitous  arguments--some made in court and some made here--the argument that the  subpoenas aren't valid before the House resolution, and then with  respect to subpoenas issued after the House resolution, like to  Mulvaney, they are no good either. You have the argument made that, we  have absolute immunity, and the court that addresses this says: No, you  don't; you are not a King. That argument may have been thought of with  favor by various Presidents over history, but it has never been  supported by any court in the land, and there is no constitutional  support for that either.   There are documents that are being released right now, as we sit  here, and it is a mystery to the country, and it is a mystery to some  of us. How are private litigants able to get documents through the  Freedom of Information Act that the administration has withheld from  Congress? If they were operating in any good faith, would that be the  case? Of course, the answer is no. What we have instead is, we are  going to claim absolute immunity, although the court says that doesn't  exist.   They said: You know, the House withdrew the subpoena on Dr.  Kupperman. Why would they withdraw the subpoena on Dr. Kupperman when  he was only threatening to tie you up endlessly in court?   Now, we suggested to counsel for Dr. Kupperman that, if they had a  good-faith concern about testifying--if this were really good faith and  it were not just a strategy to delay; if it were not just part of the  President's wholesale ``fight all subpoenas''--they didn't need to file  separate litigation because there was actually a case already in court  involving Don McGahn on that very subject that was ripe for a decision.  Indeed, the decision would come out very shortly thereafter. We said:  Let's just agree to be bound by what the McGahn court decides.   They didn't want to do that, and it became obvious once the McGahn  court decision came out because the McGahn court said: There is no  absolute immunity. You must testify.   By the way, if you think people involved in national security--i.e.  Dr. Kupperman and John Bolton, if you are listening--are somehow  absolutely immune, they are not.   So did Dr. Kupperman say: ``Now I have the comfort I need because the  court has weighed in''? The answer is, of course not.   Counsel says: Well, we might have gotten a quick judgment in  Kupperman.   Yes--in the lower court.   Do any of you believe for a single minute that they wouldn't appeal  to the court of appeals and to the Supreme Court and that if the  Supreme Court struck down the absolute immunity argument, they wouldn't  be back in the district court, saying: ``OK. He is not asking for  absolute immunity anymore, but we are going to claim executive  privilege over specific conversations that go to the President's  wrongdoing''?  [[Page S659]]    That is the sign of a President who believes that he is above the  law, that article II empowers him to do anything he wants.   I will say this: If you accept that argument--if you accept the  argument that the President of the United States can tell you to pound  sound when you try to investigate his wrongdoing--there will be no  force behind any Senate subpoena in the future.   The ``fighting all subpoenas'' started before the impeachment. If you  allow a President to obstruct Congress so completely in a way that  Nixon could never have contemplated, nor would the Congress of that day  have allowed, you will eviscerate your own oversight capability.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess     Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from California.    Thank you. I send a question to the desk on behalf of  Senator Patty Murray and myself.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Harris and Murray ask the House managers:         The House of Representatives is now in possession of a tape       of President Trump saying of Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch,       ``Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her       out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.'' President Trump       gave this order to Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two men who       carried out Trump's pressure campaign in Ukraine at the       direction of Rudy Giuliani. Does the discovery of this tape       suggest that if the Senate does not pursue all relevant       evidence--including witnesses and documents--that new       evidence will continue to come to light after the Senate       renders a verdict?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The answer is yes.   What we have seen, really, over the last several weeks, since the  passage of the articles in the House of Representatives, is that every  week--indeed, sometimes every day--there is new information coming to  light.   We know there is going to be new information coming to light on March  17, when the Bolton book comes out; that is, if the NSC isn't  successful in redacting it or preventing much of its publication.   On that issue, I do want to mention one other thing in response to  the question about the Bolton manuscript and what the White House  lawyers knew. I listened very carefully to the answer to that question,  and maybe you listened more carefully than I did. What I thought I  heard them say in answer to the question ``What did they know about the  manuscript and when did they know it?''--their statement was very  precisely worded: The NSC unit reviewing the book did not share the  manuscript.   Well, that is a different question than whether the White House  lawyers found out what is in it, because you don't have to circulate  the manuscript to have someone walk over to the White House and say:  You do not want John Bolton to testify. Let me tell you, you do not  want John Bolton to testify. You don't need to read his manuscript  because I can tell you what is in it.  [[Page S664]]    The denial was a very carefully worded one. I don't know what White  House lawyers knew and when they knew it, but they did represent to you  repeatedly that the President never told a witness that he was freezing  the aid to get Ukraine to do these investigations.   We know that is not true. We know that from the witnesses we have  already heard from, but we also know--at least if the reporting is  correct, and you should find out if it is--that John Bolton tells a  very different story.   There are going to continue to be revelations, and Members of this  body on both sides of the aisle are going to have to answer a question  each time it does: Why didn't you want to know that when it would have  helped inform your decision?   In every other trial in the land, you call witnesses to find out what  you can. Again, we are not a court of appeals here. We are the trial  court. We are not confined to the record below. There is no ``below.''  In answer to the Senator's question about whether Donald Trump ever  brought up the Hunter Biden problem with President Poroshenko in the  past, counsel says: Well, we are confined to the record before us.   You are not confined to the record in the House, nor is the  President. The President could call witnesses if they existed. There is  nothing to prevent them from saying: As a matter of fact, tomorrow we  are going to call such and such, and they are going to testify that,  indeed, Donald Trump brought up Hunter Biden to President Poroshenko.  There is nothing prohibiting them from doing that.   At the end of the day, we are going to continue to see new evidence  come out all the time. Among the most significant evidence, we know  what that is going to be. And the effort to suggest, well, because this  President was stronger in Javelins than his predecessor--when we know  from the July 25 call, the moment that Zelensky brings up the Javelins,  what is the very next thing the President says? He wants a favor.   The question is, Why did he stop the aid? Why did he stop the aid  this year and no prior year? Was it merely a coincidence? Are we to  believe it was merely a coincidence that it was the year that Joe Biden  was running for President? Are we to believe that, of all the companies  in all the land--of all the gin joints in all the land--of Ukraine,  that it was just Hunter Biden walking into this one; that was the  reason why; that he was interested in Burisma was just a coincidence  that involved the son of his opponent?   But, look, more and more is coming out. Let's make sure that you  learn whatever you feel you need to know to render a judgment now, when  it can inform your decision, and not later.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Nebraska.
