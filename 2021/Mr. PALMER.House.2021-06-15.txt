 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate a life well-lived.   Frederick Aurelius ``Rele'' Evans passed away last month at the age  of 94. After graduating high school in Tuscaloosa, he joined the Navy.  After his service, he enrolled at Tulane University and earned a  bachelor of science in electrical engineering.   Following his college graduation, he joined the Air Force and became  a fighter pilot, protecting Strategic Air Command while stationed in  Sioux City, Iowa.   Following his time in the military, he became employed as a test  pilot for Hughes Aircraft and later worked for TRW. While working for  TRW, he earned a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering at UCLA, specializing  in control systems theory.   Rele was the lead guidance engineer at Cape Canaveral when John Glenn  was put into orbit, and he designed the on-board computer's guidance  system for the lunar lander. He also coauthored the formula to put  Apollo on the Moon and was present at Mission Control when Neil  Armstrong took one giant leap for mankind. He eventually returned to  Alabama.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the contributions Rele made to our  military, our space program, and the State of Alabama. I wish his  family the best as they mourn the loss of this modest man who  accomplished much.                            ____________________
