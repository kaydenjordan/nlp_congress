 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Master  Sergeant Roy Benavidez. On the occasion of the Roy P. Benavidez  Memorial Highway dedication, my district is proud to claim this Medal  of Honor recipient as our own.   Sergeant Benavidez answered the call to serve his country in Vietnam.  At one crucial time while overseas, he voluntarily boarded a rescue  helicopter and put his own life on the line to save his fellow  soldiers.   During the rescue effort, he was shot multiple times, bayoneted, and  hit by grenade fragments as he fought for 6 hours to protect his  wounded comrades. He saved the lives of at least eight men.   After returning home, he went before Congress to advocate for better  veteran healthcare. He then devoted the rest of his life to service,  speaking to students about the importance of education and inspiring  American troops around the world.   May this highway serve as a memorial to this brave and selfless  American, Master Sergeant Roy Benavidez.                            ____________________
