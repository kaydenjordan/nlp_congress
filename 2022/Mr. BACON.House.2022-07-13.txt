 Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to this  amendment and the extreme damage it would do to our national security.  Need I mention that a nuclear-armed power just invaded its neighbor, a  country that has modernized its ICBM force. Defunding the modernization  of the land-based leg of our nuclear triad in this global environment  should be unthinkable.   Here are the facts.   First, China is our pacing threat. It is on track to double its  nuclear stockpile in the next decade, matching our ICBM force. At that  rate, it may acquire the ability to strike all 400 US ICBM sites in one  wave.   Meanwhile, Russia is rattling its already modernized nuclear saber to  coerce the U.S. and our allies. Defunding the ICBM modernization at a  time like this sends a terrible message to our adversaries and to our  allies. To our allies, can they trust us with the nuclear umbrella when  we have ICBMs that are 50 years old?   Secondly, our military leaders have stated there is zero margin left  to delay modernization of this ground-based leg of our triad. The  Minuteman III was built in the 1970s and had a designed lifespan of 10  years. Our airmen have worked miracles to sustain these weapons, but  they have become far more expensive to maintain than to replace. The  price tag for replacement is high, but it pales in comparison to a  catastrophic consequence of failing in deterrence.   Finally, the ground-based leg of our triad has never been more  important. New technology is likely to end the invulnerability of our  stealthy nuclear submarines, while advanced air defenses and air-to-air  missiles threaten our bombers' ability to strike.   ICBMs are always on alert. They are ready to strike anywhere,  anytime. I recommend that we vote ``no'' on this amendment.
