 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly great  American, Mrs. Catherine Rosalie McFaddin Beaty, who passed away on  April 27, 2019, at the age of 94.   Mrs. Beaty was born in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and was the  daughter of the late Roy D. McFaddin and the late Eulalie Boykin Cook  McFaddin. She was also preceded in death by her husband, Cherry Beaty,  and brother, First Lieutenant Robert Eli McFaddin, who was killed in  action during World War II.   Mrs. Beaty was a 1941 graduate of Rock Hill High School, where she  was a member of the following clubs: the National Honor Society, the  Glee Club, the Public Speaking and Drama Club, and the Latin and French  Club. She was a junior assistant of the Bearcat publication.   She graduated from Winthrop College in 1945, where she received a  bachelor's degree in business and, later, a teaching degree.   Upon graduation from Winthrop, she first worked as a paralegal and  secretary before beginning her career as a teacher, where she taught at  Rock Hill High School, Ebinport Elementary, Riverview Elementary, Fort  Mill Elementary, McCelvey Elementary, and Richmond Drive Elementary.   During her teaching career, she was a member of the NEA and the SCEA  as a representative of Richmond Drive Elementary School and Delta Kappa  Gamma International Society of Teachers, along with Alpha Delta Kappa,  where she served for over 30 years.   Mrs. Beaty was a dedicated member of Oakland Avenue Presbyterian  Church, volunteering for the Providence Presbytery for over 20 years in  the resource library.                                time  1015    She rang handbells in the Memorial Handbell Choir and sang in the  Chancel Choir for over 59 years.   In recognition of her dedicated and tireless service to the church,  Mrs. Beaty was awarded the Presbyterian Woman of the Year in 2015.   Rosalie Beaty was an icon with the very people who knew her the best,  her family. She delighted in family gatherings, where she would provide  bottled Coke, hot tea, and cheese rings for everyone who attended.   She had the uncanny ability to remember family birthdays and  anniversaries with cards and special mementos.   Rosalie Beaty will be remembered for her fierce independence, her  sharp  [[Page H3507]]  mind, her amazing memory, and her loyalty and strict attention to  detail.   During her memorial service held on May 1, 2019, the description  stated by Reverend Jeff Bryan was that she was simply the mother of  Cathy Rose, and the legacy left behind by her life was epitomized by  these words: While she was alive, she lived, and the 94 years she lived  on this Earth were spent serving her God, her family, and her fellow  man, in that order.   The indelible mark she left on her family and community will remain  for years to come. The world is truly a better place by having the  person of Rosalie McFadden Beaty as a shining example of dedication to  a higher calling and, truly, a life well lived.                            ____________________
