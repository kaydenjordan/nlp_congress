 Mr. Speaker, in 1925, the American Legion erected a  memorial in Bladensburg, Maryland, to honor the 49 men who were killed  in World War I. The mothers of those who died decided to erect a large  cross to mirror the cross-shaped grave markers in the foreign  cemeteries where their sons were buried. The 40-foot-tall memorial  became known as the Peace Cross.   Even though the monument is secular, and after almost 100 years, an  agnostic Federal court ruled the historic monument must be torn down,  all because it is in the shape of a cross.   The wrong-headed decision to tear down the 93-year-old monument is  proof that this Federal court has no respect for the sacrifices of  Americans killed in World War I. Instead of destroying monuments, we  should erect more.   What is next? Are Federal judges going to chisel off the crosses on  grave markers at veterans' cemeteries?   We will see.   Keep the Memorial Peace Cross memorial. Heaven forbid, don't remove  the cross.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
