 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Pat Pecora, Pitt-Johnstown's wrestling coach, on his  fourth NCAA Division II National Wrestling Coach of the Year Award.   This award is presented to the coach who has demonstrated outstanding  effort throughout the season in developing and elevating their program  on campus and in the community. Pat has previously received this award  in 1995, 1999, and 2019 for his efforts at Pitt-Johnstown.   This season, Pat led the Mountain Cats to a 13-1 dual-meet record and  the program's 24th NCAA regional title. This year's team won a share of  the PSAC dual-meet title for their sixth straight conference  championship.   This recognition is well-deserved for Pat; and he is the all-time  winningest coach in college wrestling at all divisions of the NCAA. In  his 46 years at Pitt-Johnstown, he has recorded 631 victories.   Madam Speaker, Pat is an incredible coach and a great role model for  the Pitt-Johnstown community.   Congratulations again on this well-deserved recognition and award.   Go Mountain Cats.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank my  colleague from Virginia for hosting and coordinating this time tonight  on an incredibly important issue for rural America.   Madam Speaker, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the 340B  Federal drug pricing program. I am very familiar with this program,  having worked for 28 years in rural hospitals where this 340B program  was incredibly important for consumers, for patients, to be able to get  access to the medications that they require but also equally important  as a lifeline for our rural hospitals.   Rural hospitals today, in my experience, having worked within these  facilities for almost three decades, most hospitals are lucky to break  even, especially rural hospitals. It is very challenging financially,  but we know how important they are.    We know that these tend to be the economic engines within our rural  communities. These are the source of great jobs. This is access to  quality healthcare. When these rural hospitals close, the economic  impacts, the healthcare impacts, the health impacts are significant and  negative for those communities.   I can't tell you how many times, Madam Speaker, I have seen the 340B  program be the difference between a red, losing year, where you bleed  money, you lose money--and you can do that for only so long until a  hospital has to shutter its doors and lay people off--and perhaps  breaking even or even just a slight margin.   In rural healthcare, a rural hospital, a 1 to 2 percent margin is a  banner year. It is a great year. That is hardly enough to invest in  modern, lifesaving technology or to invest in your staff to recruit and  retain those qualified providers that are the key part of all  healthcare. It really comes down to the providers, having those folks  and retaining them.   The 340B program, I can tell you in all the decades of my healthcare  experience where I have seen it, has made the difference of having a  margin to be able to keep the lights on; to be able to invest in  lifesaving advances, technology, equipment; and, quite frankly, retain  and recruit the best and the brightest.   This was enacted in 1992, originally. The 340B drug pricing program  requires pharmaceutical companies to provide certain healthcare  organizations, like federally qualified health centers and rural  hospitals, discounts on their drugs in exchange for having their drugs  covered by Medicaid.  [[Page H5327]]    The program was created with a purpose to ``stretch scarce Federal  resources to reach more eligible patients and provide more  comprehensive services''--a worthy cause, a worthy mission.   As the Member representing Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District--it includes 14 counties, nearly 25 percent of the land mass  of the Commonwealth--I am a strong advocate for the 340B program as it  is a lifeline to many of my constituents. As I said before, I have  worked within those systems. I have seen it firsthand.   Sadly, the 340B program is under attack. Some drug manufacturers have  stopped honoring the 340B discounts. In other words, if a health center  receives 340B savings, it is usually unable to keep them because third  parties have found creative ways to pick the 340B savings out of the  center's pockets. This is simply unacceptable and hurts those who truly  need these medications.   For these reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 4390, the  PROTECT 340B Act, which prohibits these types of practices and ensures  340B savings remain where Congress meant them to go: with the safety- net providers and the medically underserved patients that they care  for.   Madam Speaker, I am going to continue to support policies that  strengthen the 340B program. I am going to work to ensure any  developments that threaten the ability of safety-net providers to  provide critical health services, including the many in my  congressional district, are stopped in their tracks.   I really very much appreciate the gentlewoman from Virginia for her  leadership on this and all of my colleagues who have come together  tonight to defend a program that is about access for healthcare  consumers and access to healthcare in rural America.
