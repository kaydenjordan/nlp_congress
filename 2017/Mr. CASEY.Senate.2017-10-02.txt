 Mr. President, I commend the words and the determination  for action that were expressed by the Senator from Connecticut and the  Senator from Illinois. Like them, and like so many people across the  country, I start with condolences and prayers and commendations. I  offer condolences to the families--the names and the families we don't  know yet--of this most recent tragedy, but we do know they are not only  worthy of our expressions of condolence but will be in need of our  prayers. Then, I offer commendations, of course, to the first  responders and the law enforcement officials who responded as they  always do, running toward the danger, running to help. We can't say  enough about the work they do.   If we stop at expressing condolences and offering prayers and  commending those who take action, like first responders and law  enforcement--if we stop there, I don't think that is an adequate  response to this tragedy, just like it wasn't an adequate response in  connection with the Pulse Night Club or the tragedy in December of 2012  in Newtown, CT. It is nowhere near an adequate response when we  consider the enormity of this problem.   I believe we have to take action. I will talk about that in a moment.  Action must start with what happens on this floor. It is difficult to  take action necessarily if there isn't time for debate, time for  collaboration on legislation, and ultimately consideration of  legislation on the floor of the Senate and I would hope in the U.S.  House of Representatives.   The enormity of this tragedy is almost hard to comprehend when we  think about it, not just in terms of the number, which at last count  was 58 killed and over 500--over 500--injured. Those numbers are almost  too large to comprehend; that one person with one weapon or maybe  several weapons was able to inflict that kind of carnage in one place  at one time. I don't know how long it took, but he wasn't shooting for  many hours to kill that many people. He did it in a short timeframe.   When we consider those numbers, I have to ask--I don't know if we  went back and compared a similar day or a similar timeframe, comparing  the loss of life in the context of war, but I am sure there were plenty  of days of conflict where Americans were on foreign soil in a battle,  in a war, where we would have lost even less lives on a particular day  or a portion of a particular day. The scale of this is almost  unimaginable.   Then, we need to consider what has been happening on our streets.  Every State, every community has their own numbers. I can point to  Pennsylvania. Just since 2014, thousands of shootings--by one estimate  I think over 7,700--but then, of course, the more ominous number is the  number of people killed as a result of those shootings. In  Pennsylvania, since 2014, some 2,072 people have died as a result of  that larger number of shootings.   I think for the Nation, and I think, certainly, undoubtedly for me,  maybe the most important or the most seminal day in this debate was in  December of 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT. The  distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who joins us on the floor and  started tonight with his remarks, remembers it better than probably any  other Member of the Senate, other than his colleague in Connecticut and  others who lived through it.   One of the questions I asked myself at the end of that weekend, after  watching hours and hours of television coverage and reading a lot about  it and then watching a news report on Sunday evening which tracked the  pathway of the killer going to one classroom and killing 20 children-- 6-year-olds, 7-year-olds, first graders--after he had done that, he was  on his way to another classroom. So I concluded from that, if he had  more time, in addition to the 20 killed in one classroom and the adults  who were killed, we would have been reading about potentially hundreds  of children killed in one school in even less--a lot less than a day,  maybe an hour or two or three, but that didn't happen. He took his own  life.   So I began to ask myself not only what should we do in response to  this--and I had concluded at that point to support legislation--but a  larger question kept coming to mind. If one person, with one weapon or  a few weapons and unlimited ammunition--if one person cannot only kill  20 children in Connecticut, I guess almost 50 people in Florida, and  now we know from Las Vegas at least 58, and I am sure some who were  injured will die--but if one person can do that, we have to ask  ourselves, Is there nothing we can do? Because that becomes part of the  debate, right?   One side says: Let's take action by way of legislation or take some  action that would reduce the likelihood that we have more tragedies  like this, more mass shootings, but the response immediately comes back  that the other side says: We agree it is tragic, we agree we want to  prevent it, we agree we want to reduce the likelihood, but there is  nothing we can do legislatively to reduce the likelihood or to prevent  it.   I don't think anyone would argue that a law that passes in the  aftermath of this Las Vegas tragedy or a law that passes even in the  aftermath of Sandy Hook Elementary School--if the law, the proposals,  the bills, really, that were voted on in the Senate in 2013, if they  had passed, no one can argue with certitude or with scientific  precision  [[Page S6255]]  that if you pass this law, this many lives will be saved. After Newtown  and after this tragedy, I come back to the same question: Is there  nothing we can do legislatively? We are the most powerful country in  the world. We led the world in winning World War II, a war that was not  on its way to winning until we got involved, until we were forced to  respond because we were attacked. We are the country that has cured  disease and built the strongest Republic in the history of the human  race; that has the strongest military, without a doubt; that has the  strongest economy, without a doubt; that has so much in ways that we  can point to of American exceptionalism and strength and achievement-- achievements that are unmatched anywhere in the world in almost any  part of American life that one can point to. Is that same country  completely disabled from taking an action that would reduce the  likelihood--and we would hope substantially reduce the likelihood--that  we will not have another Las Vegas or another Orlando or another  Newtown, and go on and on from there, all of these tragedies in all of  these places? Is that really what our answer is going to be?   We take action when we are attacked, to fight back and to prevent it  from happening again. We take action when there is an epidemic. We take  action when there is a crisis. We take action when there is a natural  disaster. We are seeing some of that most recently. We take action as a  government. The Congress takes action. The executive takes action. Yet,  in this circumstance, what can only be described as an epidemic--that  might be an understatement--where we are losing more than 30,000 people  a year, are we saying that there is nothing we can do legislatively to  reduce that likelihood? I don't think any American, if they think about  it, would conclude there is nothing we can do.   So when I considered that in the context of Sandy Hook, I had to ask  myself: Are you saying to yourself that you are going to vote no on  what became three bills, vote no on them because you believe there is  nothing you can do? That is what your vote is going to be? That is  going to be your response? As a legislator with the opportunity to cast  a vote in a body of 100 people, you are going to say no three times, as  it turned out in 2013, to legislation because you believe there is  nothing your vote and nothing this legislative body can do?   Well, I decided to vote yes, at least, but even that is not enough.  We haven't had votes in years on these issues. Here we are, almost 5  years later--in December it will be 5 years, half a decade--since  Newtown, CT, since the massacre at Sandy Hook.   I have a page from the Wall Street Journal that was printed within a  couple days of that tragedy. It had very small color pictures and very  small biographies of those very small people, those 6-year-olds and 7- year-olds. It has been on my desk all of these years, and it is a very  yellowed copy of a newspaper article. I often think about what those  families have gone through all of these years.   The great recording artist Bruce Springsteen had a song after  September 11. The name of the song is ``You're Missing.'' The refrain  in that song, of course, is ``You're missing,'' talking about someone,  of course, who lost a loved one on 9/11. He says: ``You're missing when  I turn out the lights, you're missing when I close my eyes, and you're  missing when I see the sun rise.'' The same could be said of those  Newtown families, the same could be said of those families in Orlando,  and now, unfortunately and tragically, the families in the Las Vegas  area--and maybe well beyond Las Vegas--who were there for that concert.   I hope this will be an occasion not just for speeches and expressions  of condolence and commendation for those who showed such bravery in  this tragedy, or prayers and solidarity, but that this will be a time  for action, meaning action in the context of debate and action in the  context of legislation.   I think there are a number of steps we can take--I will not outline  them all now--a number of commonsense steps we can take that are  entirely consistent with the Second Amendment but would reduce the  likelihood over time of having more and more of these tragedies or  maybe, just maybe, taking action that will reduce the number of deaths.  Even that would be substantial progress. I just cannot accept the idea  that there is absolutely nothing we can do legislatively to reduce the  likelihood--and I would hope substantially reduce the likelihood--of  these tragedies so that we can prevent or at least reduce the number of  tragedies.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________
