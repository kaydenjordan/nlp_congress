 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I came here tonight prepared to talk about  the place I represent and how well the Democratic and Republican county  officials ran our election. I wanted to point out that in my home  county of Allegheny County, in the place they were counting the votes,  there were 31 video cameras--31--in the same place, just showing people  counting votes, every single one of them on paper, with representatives  from both campaigns watching.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to point out to all these great lovers and  supporters of the Pennsylvania legislature that it was the Republican  Pennsylvania legislature that passed a Republican bill that they all  voted for and supported that set up the system under which we just ran  the election, and that the reason the President lost was because he was  not as popular as other Republicans in our State. He got fewer votes  than all of them.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to lay out all this evidence because I  thought it was a sign of respect for my colleagues and for all the  Americans out there who don't know who to trust. I was raised on that.  I was raised on that respect, which makes this a hard speech for me to  give. Because to do this with any kind of honesty means admitting and  declaring in this House that these objections don't deserve an ounce of  respect--not an ounce.                                time  0140    A woman died out there tonight, and you are making these objections.   Let's be clear about what happened in this Chamber today. Invaders  came in for the first time since the War of 1812. They desecrated these  Halls and this Chamber and practically every inch of ground where we  work. For the most part, they walked in here free. A lot of them walked  out free. There wasn't a person watching at home who didn't know why  that was--because of the way that they look.   My point, Madam Speaker, is this: Enough has been done here already  to try to strip this Congress of its dignity, and these objectors don't  need to do anymore.   We know that that attack today didn't materialize out of nowhere. It  was inspired by lies, the same lies that you are hearing in this room  tonight. And the Members who are repeating those lies should be ashamed  of themselves. Their constituents should be ashamed of them.   We know what is going to happen as soon as I walk away, what has  happened all night tonight, what will continue to happen. They will  take these same symbols, these same concepts, smuggle them into their  arguments, and make the same arguments. I want people at home, anyone  who is still watching, to know that these arguments are not for them;  they are for you.   None of the evidence we wanted to discuss here tonight will change  their opinions or what they are about to say. But you need to know that  is not the end. It is not as if there is nothing we can do because of  that. And if there was, I don't think this Nation would have made it to  almost 250 years.   The fact is, Madam Speaker, that at the end of the day, people--                                Point of Order     Madam Speaker, the fact is, at the end of the day, it  hurts. It hurts them; it hurts this country. It hurts all of us. But  the fact is that the people have made this country work by not giving  in.   Go ahead. Shout it out.   One last thing to say, Madam Speaker. And I thank you for your  patience. All people need to know tonight, Madam Speaker--   Madam Speaker, the truth hurts. But the fact is this: We want this  government to work more than they want it to fail.   After everything that has happened today, we want that more than  ever. Know that. Know that, the people watching at home. We want this  government to work. We will make it work. They will not make it fail.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
