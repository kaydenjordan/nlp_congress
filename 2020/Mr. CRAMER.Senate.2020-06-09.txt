 Madam President, I want to congratulate Kara Four  Bear, the principal at the New Town, ND, Middle School, for being one  of two educators in the Nation to be presented with the Presidential  Cybersecurity Education Award.   The U.S. Department of Education received nominations for 43  educators from 23 States for this inaugural award. Kara Four Bear's  selection was based on her passion for developing digital literacy and  safety skills in her students and then helping them make real-world  connections with what they learn.   She has led her school in establishing robust, global, and relevant  education programs using curriculum provided from the National  Integrated Education Research Center. This curriculum challenges  students to put into practical use their lessons in topics such as  cyber ethics and cyber law. They start this curriculum as sixth graders  and continue through middle school and high school. Through various  class projects and State, regional, and national competitions, they  explore science, technology, engineering, and mathmetics and the  careers available in these fields.   This Presidential Cybersecurity Education Award was established on  May 2, 2019, by President Trump's executive order on America's  Cybersecurity Workforce. The Department of Education was charged with  creating this award within 1 year and in consultation with the Deputy  Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism  at the National Security Council and the National Science Foundation.   Because the demand for STEM careers continues to grow in my State,  our Nation, and around the world, there is a critical need for students  to excel in these subjects. Because women continue to be  underrepresented in careers focusing on computer science and  cybersecurity, the challenge is even greater to encourage girls to  develop the creative thinking and problem-solving skills needed in  these careers at an early age.   The New Town students joined young North Dakota women from Bismarck,  Fargo, Grand Forks, West Fargo Sheyenne, and Williston schools last  month in the Girls Go CyberStart competition, sponsored by the SANS  Institute. North Dakota had the highest nationwide participation per  capita for the second year in a row, and I commend all who participated  in this competition.   Inspirational educators like Kara Four Bear are leading the way to  increase opportunities for North Dakota students to prepare for careers  in the field of cybersecurity. I thank her for her passion for cyber  education and for being an inspiration to what can be done to  successfully create this level of excellence in schools across the  Nation.                            ____________________
