Determination of budgetary effects.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Burmese military.--The term ``Burmese military''--        (A) means the Armed Forces of Burma, including the army,       navy, and air force; and        (B) includes security services under the control of the       Armed Forces of Burma such as the police and border guards.        (2) Crimes against humanity.--The term ``crimes against       humanity'' includes the following, when committed as part of       a widespread or systematic attack directed against any       civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:        (A) Murder.        (B) Forced transfer of population.        (C) Torture.        (D) Extermination.        (E) Enslavement.        (F) Rape, sexual slavery, or any other form of sexual       violence of comparable severity.        (G) Enforced disappearance of persons.        (H) Persecution against any identifiable group or       collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic,       cultural, religious, gender, or other grounds that are       universally recognized as impermissible under international       law.        (I) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical       liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international       law.        (3) Executive order 14014.--The term ``Executive Order       14014'' means Executive Order 14014 (86 Fed. Reg. 9429;       relating to blocking property with respect to the situation       in Burma).        (4) Genocide.--The term ``genocide'' means any offense       described in section 1091(a) of title 18, United States Code.        (5) Transitional justice.--The term ``transitional       justice'' means the range of judicial, nonjudicial, formal,       informal, retributive, and restorative measures employed by       countries transitioning out of armed conflict or repressive       regimes, or employed by the international community through       international justice mechanisms, to redress past or ongoing       atrocities and to promote long-term, sustainable peace.        (6) War crime.--The term ``war crime'' has the meaning       given the term in section 2441(c) of title 18, United States       Code.             TITLE I--MATTERS RELATING TO THE CONFLICT IN BURMA       SEC. 101. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Since 1988, the United States policy of principled       engagement has fostered positive democratic reforms in Burma,       with elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020, helping to bring       about the partial transition to civilian rule and with the       latter 2 elections resulting in resounding electoral       victories for the National League for Democracy.        (2) That democratic transition remained incomplete, with       the military retaining significant power and independence       from civilian control following the 2015 elections, including       through control of 25 percent of parliamentary seats, a de       facto veto over constitutional reform, authority over       multiple government ministries, and the ability to operate       with impunity and no civilian oversight.        (3) Despite some improvements with respect for human rights       and fundamental freedoms beginning in 2010, and the       establishment of a quasi-civilian government following       credible elections in 2015, Burma's military leaders have,       since 2016, overseen an increase in restrictions to freedom       of expression (including for members of the press), freedom       of peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of       religion or belief.        (4) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military and security       forces launched a genocidal military campaign against       Rohingya, resulting in a mass exodus of some 750,000 Rohingya       from Burma's Rakhine State into Bangladesh, where they       remain. The military has since taken no steps to improve       conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine State, who remain at       high risk of genocide and other atrocities, or to create       conditions conducive to the voluntary return of Rohingya       refugees and other internally displaced persons (IDPs).        (5) The Burmese military has also engaged in renewed       violence with other ethnic minority groups across the       country. The military has continued to commit atrocities in       Chin, Kachin, Kayah, and Shan. Fighting in northern Burma has       forced more than 100,000 people from their homes and into       camps for internally displaced persons. The Burmese military       continues to heavily proscribe humanitarian and media access       to conflict-affected populations across the country.        (6) With more nearly $470,000,000 in humanitarian       assistance in response to the crisis in fiscal year 2021, the       United States is the largest humanitarian donor to       populations in need as a result of conflicts in Burma. In May       2021, the United States announced nearly $155,000,000 in       additional humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs       of Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh and       people affected by ongoing violence in Burma's Rakhine,       Kachin, Shan, and Chin states. In September 2021, the United       States provided nearly $180,000,000 in additional critical       humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, bringing the       total fiscal year 2021 to more than $434,000,000.        (7) Both government- and military-initiated investigations       into human rights abuses in Burma involving violence between       ethnic minorities and Burmese security forces have failed to       yield credible results or hold perpetrators accountable.        (8) In its report dated September 17, 2018, the United       Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on       Myanmar concluded, on reasonable grounds, that the factors       allowing inference of ``genocidal intent'' are present with       respect to the attacks against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and       acts by Burmese security forces against Rohingya in Rakhine       State and other ethnic minorities in Kachin and Shan States       amount to ``crimes against humanity'' and ``war crimes''. The       Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar       established by the United Nations Human Rights Council       recommended that the United Nations Security Council ``should       ensure accountability for crimes under international law       committed in Myanmar, preferably by referring the situation       to the International Criminal Court or alternatively by       creating an ad hoc international criminal tribunal''. The       Mission also recommended the imposition of targeted economic       sanctions, including an arms embargo on Burma.        (9) On December 13, 2018, the United States House of       Representatives passed House Resolution 1091 (115th       Congress), which expressed the sense of the House that ``the       atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Burmese       military and security forces since August 2017 constitute       crimes against humanity and genocide'' and called upon the       Secretary of State to review the available evidence and make       a similar determination.        (10) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 2019, the       United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission       on Myanmar found that the Burmese military's economic       interests ``enable its conduct'' and that it benefits from       and supports extractive industry businesses operating in       conflict-affected areas in northern Burma, including natural       resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals  [[Page H4205]]       and gems and argued that ``through controlling its own       business empire, the Tatmadaw can evade the accountability       and oversight that normally arise from civilian oversight of       military budgets''. The report called for the United Nations       and individual governments to place targeted sanctions on all       senior officials in the Burmese military as well as their       economic interests, especially Myanma Economic Holdings       Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation.        (11) On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military conducted a       coup d'etat, declaring a year-long state of emergency and       detaining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win       Myint, and dozens of other government officials and elected       members of parliament, thus derailing Burma's transition to       democracy and disregarding the will of the people of Burma as       expressed in the November 2020 general elections, which were       determined to be credible by international and national       observers.        (12) Following the coup, some ousted members of parliament       established the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu       Hluttaw, which subsequently released the Federal Democracy       Charter in March 2021 and established the National Unity       Government in April 2021. In June 2021, the National Unity       Government included ethnic minorities and women among its       cabinet and released a policy paper outlining pledges to       Rohingya and calling for ``justice and reparations'' for the       community.        (13) Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the Burmese       military has--        (A) used lethal force on peaceful protestors on multiple       occasions, killing more than 1,500 people, including more       than 100 children;        (B) detained more than 10,000 peaceful protestors,       participants in the Civil Disobedience Movement, labor       leaders, government officials and elected members of       parliament, members of the media, and others, according to       the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners;        (C) issued laws and directives used to further impede       fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression       (including for members of the press), freedom of peaceful       assembly, and freedom of association; and        (D) imposed restrictions on the internet and       telecommunications.        (14) According to the UNHCR, more than 440,000 people have       been internally displaced since the coup, while an estimated       39,000 have sought refuge in neighboring countries.       Nevertheless, the Burmese military continues to block       humanitarian assistance to populations in need. According to       the World Health Organization, the military has carried out       more than 286 attacks on health care entities since the coup       and killed at least 30 health workers. Dozens more have been       arbitrarily detained, and hundreds have warrants out for       their arrest. The military continued such attacks even as       they inhibited efforts to combat a devastating third wave of       COVID-19. The brutality of the Burmese military was on full       display on March 27, 2021, Armed Forces Day, when, after       threatening on state television to shoot protesters in the       head, security forces killed more than 150 people.        (15) The coup represents a continuation of a long pattern       of violent and anti-democratic behavior by the military that       stretches back decades, with the military having previously       taken over Burma in coups d'etat in 1962 and 1988, and having       ignored the results of the 1990 elections, and a long history       of violently repressing protest movements, including killing       and imprisoning thousands of peaceful protestors during pro-      democracy demonstrations in 1988 and 2007.        (16) On February 11, 2021, President Biden issued Executive       Order 14014 in response to the coup d'etat, authorizing       sanctions against the Burmese military, its economic       interests, and other perpetrators of the coup.        (17) Since the issuance of Executive Order 14014, President       Biden has taken several steps to impose costs on the Burmese       military and its leadership, including by designating or       otherwise imposing targeted sanctions with respect to--        (A) multiple high-ranking individuals and their family       members, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese       military, Min Aung Hlaing, Burma's Chief of Police, Than       Hlaing, and the Bureau of Special Operations commander,       Lieutenant General Aung Soe, and over 35 other individuals;        (B) state-owned and military controlled companies,       including Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company, Ltd.,       Myanmar Economic Corporation, Ltd., Myanmar Economic Holdings       Ltd., Myanmar Ruby Enterprise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co.,       Ltd., and Myanma Gems Enterprise; and        (C) other corporate entities, Burmese military units, and       Burmese military entities, including the military regime's       State Administrative Council.        (18) The United States has also implemented new       restrictions on exports and reexports to Burma pursuant to       Executive Order 14014; and        (19) On April 24, 2021, the Association of Southeast Asian       Nations (ASEAN) agreed to a five-point consensus which called       for an ``immediate cessation of violence'', ``constructive       dialogue among all parties'', the appointment of an ASEAN       special envoy, the provision of humanitarian assistance       through ASEAN's AHA Centre, and a visit by the ASEAN special       envoy to Burma. Except for the appointment of the Special       Envoy in August 2021, the other elements of the ASEAN       consensus remain unimplemented due to obstruction by the       Burmese military.        (20) On March 21, 2022, Secretary of State Antony Blinken       announced that the United States had concluded that ``members       of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against       humanity against Rohingya''.       SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to support genuine democracy, peace, and national       reconciliation in Burma;        (2) to pursue a strategy of calibrated engagement, which is       essential to support the establishment of a peaceful,       prosperous, and democratic Burma that includes respect for       the human rights of all individuals regardless of ethnicity       and religion;        (3) to seek the restoration to power of a civilian       government that reflects the will of the people of Burma;        (4) to support constitutional reforms that ensure civilian       governance and oversight over the military;

       (11) to ensure the protection and non-refoulement of       refugees fleeing Burma to neighboring countries and       prioritize efforts to create a conducive environment and       meaningfully address long-standing structural challenges that       undermine the safety and rights of Rohingya in Rakhine State       as well as members of other ethnic and religious minorities       in Burma, including by promoting the creation of conditions       for the dignified, safe, sustainable, and voluntary return of       refugees in Bangladesh, Thailand, and in the surrounding       region when conditions allow;        (12) to support an immediate end to restrictions that       hinder the freedom of movement of members of ethnic       minorities throughout the country, including Rohingya, and an       end to any and all policies and practices designed to       forcibly segregate Rohingya, and providing humanitarian       support for all internally displaced persons in Burma;        (13) to support unfettered access for humanitarian actors,       media, and human rights mechanisms, including those       established by the United Nations Human Rights Council and       the United Nations General Assembly, to all relevant areas of       Burma, including Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Shan, and Kayin       States, as well as Sagaing and Magway regions;        (14) to call for accountability through independent,       credible investigations and prosecutions for any potential       genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, including       those involving sexual and gender-based violence and violence       against children, perpetrated against ethnic or religious       minorities, including Rohingya, by members of the military       and security forces of Burma, and other armed groups;        (15) to encourage reforms toward the military, security,       and police forces operating under civilian control and being       held accountable in civilian courts for human rights abuses,       corruption, and other abuses of power;        (16) to promote broad-based, inclusive economic development       and fostering healthy and resilient communities;        (17) to combat corruption and illegal economic activity,       including that which involves the military and its close       allies; and        (18) to promote responsible international and regional       engagement;        (19) to support and advance the strategy of calibrated       engagement, impose targeted sanctions with respect to the       Burmese military's economic interests and major sources of       income for the Burmese military, including with respect to--        (A) officials in Burma, including the Commander in Chief of       the Armed Forces of Burma, Min Aung Hlaing, and all       individuals described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of       section 202(a), under the authorities provided by title II,       Executive Order 14014, and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability  [[Page H4206]]       Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114-328;

      and        (C) state-owned economic enterprises if--        (i) there is a substantial risk of the Burmese military       accessing the accounts of such an enterprise; and        (ii) the imposition of sanctions would not cause       disproportionate harm to the people of Burma, the restoration       of a civilian government in Burma, or the national interest       of the United States; and        (20) to ensure that any sanctions imposed with respect to       entities or individuals are carefully targeted to maximize       impact on the military and security forces of Burma and its       economic interests while minimizing impact on the people of       Burma, recognizing the calls from the people of Burma for the       United States to take action against the sources of income       for the military and security forces of Burma.

(3) The United Nations Secretariat and the United Nations       Security Council should take concrete steps to address the       coup and ongoing crisis in Burma consistent with the UN       General Assembly resolution 75/287, ``The situation in       Myanmar,'' which was adopted on June 18, 2021.

TITLE V--STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO ACT       SEC. 501. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5497, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA  Act of 2022, which I have introduced, alongside Representative   Steve  Chabot, the ranking member of the Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and  Nonproliferation Subcommittee, who I want to thank for working in a  bipartisan way.   I also want to thank Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member    Michael McCaul for working with me in a bipartisan way on this very  important and very timely bill.   Mr. Speaker, democracy is under severe strain across the globe, and  the current crisis in Burma is a stark reminder of this challenge.   It has been just over a year since the Burmese military staged an  illegal and illegitimate coup d'etat, seizing control of the Union  Government and detaining a broad cross section of democratically  elected civilian leaders. As the military upended Burma's fragile  transition to democracy, it began a widespread suppression of  fundamental freedoms.   Over the past 14 months, the military's brutal and senseless violence  has resulted in more than 1,700 people killed, including over 100  children. Thousands have been unjustly detained, and nearly half a  million people have been displaced by the military's violence.   Congress cannot, cannot and must not, stand idly by as the military  brutally kills its people. As the war in Ukraine has reminded us,  America must stand up with freedom-loving people everywhere.   The Burmese people have courageously resisted the military's  repression and violence. They have organized a civil disobedience  movement to erode the military's ability to govern. A shadow  government, the National Unity Government, has emerged to restore  democratic civilian rule. All they are asking of us is that the world  come to their aid and their cause.   The Biden administration has taken critical steps to stand with the  Burmese people, and I want to commend Secretary Blinken's formal  determination last month that the Burmese military committed genocide  and crimes against humanity against Rohingyas, something that was long,  long overdue, and which I advocated for in this current bill.   But now it is Congress' turn to act. The important resolutions,  statements of condemnation, and letters of solidarity this body has  sent over the past 14 months are important, but not sufficient. The  people of Burma need us to do more. Frankly, the Burmese military's  gross abuses demand that we do more.   H.R. 5497 is a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that holds the Burmese  military accountable through targeted sanctions, puts pressure on the  junta by urging greater action at the United Nations, and calling for a  Special Coordinator for Burmese Democracy.   It authorizes humanitarian assistance for the hundreds of thousands  of Burmese citizens that have been internally displaced or fled across  the border. It calls on the State Department to document the genocide  and the crimes against humanity committed against Rohingyas and other  Burmese ethnic minorities.   The same military leaders which perpetuated a genocide against  Rohingya are now using the same tactics to unleash unprecedented  bloodshed across the entire country. We must end the impunity of the  Burmese military and make it harder for it to enact its brutality.   And to every member of the Burmese ruling elite that does not support  the pathway taken by General Min Aung Hlaing, let me say to you loud  and clear: Now is the time for you to think about your country's future  and defect, defect, because the Burmese people and the international  community will remember which side you stood on.   The economic and diplomatic pressure that this bill applies is  essential to changing the junta's calculus and forcing it to the  negotiating table. By passing this legislation, we will take a  meaningful step, not just to stand up with the Burmese people, but also  to help bring this crisis to an end.   Therefore, before this bill becomes law, I look forward to working  with my colleagues in a bipartisan way to refine the sanctions in this  bill so that they remain relevant and effective.   Thus, I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can  move it one step closer to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, April 5, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 5497, the       BURMA Act of 2022. In order to permit H.R. 5497 to proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 5497 in light of our       mutual understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration       of H.R. 5497 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward with regard to any matters in the Committee's       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       that involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 5497.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, April 5, 2022.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       5497, the BURMA Act of 2022, as amended. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 5497 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment       of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any       House-Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I don't think I have any further speakers, so  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, Congress must do more to address this crisis in Burma,  and H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2021, will do just that. It will take  concrete steps to hold the Burmese military accountable for its coup  and for the perpetration of gross human rights violations and other  unspeakable atrocities.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, sends a strong and unequivocal message that  there are severe consequences for subverting democracy, and that the  United States of America stands firmly with the Burmese people in their  struggle for human rights and their democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues, all 435 of us, will join me  in supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 7276) to direct the President to submit to Congress a report on  United States Government efforts to collect, analyze, and preserve  evidence and information related to war crimes and any other atrocities  committed during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine since  February 24, 2022, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7276         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Invasion War Crimes       Deterrence and Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and       unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine that commenced on       February 24, 2022, the military of the Government of the       Russian Federation under the direction of President Vladimir       Putin has committed war crimes that include but are not       limited to--        (A) the deliberate targeting of civilians and injuring or       killing of noncombatants;        (B) the deliberate targeting and attacking of hospitals,       schools, and other non-military buildings dedicated to       religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, such as the       bombing of a theater in Mariupol that served as a shelter for       noncombatants and had the word ``children'' written clearly       in the Russian language outside;        (C) the indiscriminate bombardment of undefended dwellings       and buildings;        (D) the wanton destruction of property not justified by       military necessity;        (E) unlawful civilian deportations;        (F) the taking of hostages; and        (G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse;        (2) the use of chemical weapons by the Government of the       Russian Federation in Ukraine would constitute a war crime,       and engaging in any military preparations to use chemical       weapons or to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain chemical       weapons is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, to       which the Russian Federation is a signatory;        (3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of committing acts of       aggression, systematic abuses of human rights, and acts that       constitute war crimes or other atrocities both at home and       abroad, and the brutality and scale of these actions,       including in the Russian Federation republic of Chechnya,       Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine, demonstrate the extent to which       his regime is willing to flout international norms and values       in the pursuit of its objectives;        (4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanctioned the use of       chemical weapons at home and abroad, including in the       poisonings of Russian spy turned double agent Sergei Skripal       and his daughter Yulia and leading Russian opposition figure       Aleksey Navalny, and aided and abetted the use of chemical       weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and        (5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian Federation       initiated its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine       which resulted in its illegal occupation of Crimea, the       unrecognized declaration of independence by the so-called       ``Donetsk People's Republic'' and ``Luhansk People's       Republic'' by Russia-backed proxies, and numerous human       rights violations and deaths of civilians in Ukraine.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7276, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7276, the Ukraine  Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act introduced by my  good friend and the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, Mr. McCaul.   I want to thank Mr. McCaul for working collectively across the aisle  as we do on many bills, but on this important bill, for his leadership  on it. It is very timely and very important.   Mr. Speaker, each day we see a growing body of horrifying evidence of  atrocities that Russian troops have wreaked on Ukrainian citizens. Mr.  McCaul and I traveled to Poland, and we saw with our own eyes the  refugees fleeing Ukraine because of Putin's war; not knowing whether  they would see their husbands or fathers or uncles ever again; not  knowing what their tomorrow would be.   This week, the images, the videos, and the firsthand accounts from  Bucha were nothing short of chilling, and as it did seeing the refugees  cross the border in Poland, it pains my heart to know that this is  likely just the tip of the iceberg of what Ukrainians have suffered.                                time  1245    In attempting to justify his war of choice on Ukraine, Putin's  relentless dehumanization of Ukrainians has laid the foundation for  atrocities so vile it churns one's stomach.   We have seen this before, Mr. Speaker. It is the same dehumanization  that has led to every genocide before. I fear what we have seen in  Bucha is happening throughout Ukraine right now, and it will only get  worse.   Nothing we do on this floor today will erase the generational trauma  that Putin's forces have inflicted on Ukrainians, but we can and must  ensure that the United States of America is doing everything in its  power to collect evidence that can be used to prosecute Russian war  crimes and other atrocities. Hopefully, that will deter further  systemic human rights abuses in this conflict.   H.R. 7276 would require the administration to detail efforts to  collect, analyze, and preserve evidence of war crimes, and to describe  the process through which a domestic, foreign, or international court  or tribunal could request and obtain information related to war crimes  or other atrocities from the United States.   Every day of this illegal and unprovoked war further unites the  global community against Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The images  that we continue to see day in and day out are shocking to the  conscience and also a call to action.   To the leaders of the nations who have yet to condemn this barbaric  war of choice, I ask them to please watch these videos of civilians  being bombed and, as we did both in Poland and with those who visited  us here in the House of Representatives, listen to the survivors who  witnessed their neighbors and their friends shot in the streets or in  their homes, some bound with their hands behind their backs.   The camera of history is rolling, Mr. Speaker, and it will remember  those countries that remain silent.   Russia's aggression in Ukraine must stop. We must unequivocally  condemn the atrocities that are being carried out by Putin and his  Russian invading forces. Those who are responsible, Mr. Speaker, must  be brought to justice, no matter how long it takes or how hard it may  be.   The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act  will help in collecting the necessary evidence so that we can do just  that: Hold those individuals accountable for the atrocities that they  have committed.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join and support this  crucial legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time at this  moment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, what we are witnessing Russian troops do in Ukraine  represents some of the worst of humankind. Right now, the world is  watching horrifying war crimes taking place. The world is watching the  extent to which Putin is willing to flout international norms and  values in the pursuit of its brutality, and the world is also watching  what we as a nation are going to do about it.   The Department of State has officially concluded that Russian forces  have committed war crimes in Ukraine which were made vividly clear by  the horrifying images emerging over this past weekend from Bucha.  Investigations into these war crimes are already beginning and must  continue.   I am saying today, as chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  working along with my friend and partner, the ranking member,  Mike  McCaul, we will work tirelessly to make sure that justice is delivered  and that the administration works strenuously in concert with partners  and allies to this end because meaningful justice for these crimes  helps prevent such atrocities in the future.   This legislation requires the administration to detail efforts to  preserve evidence and hold perpetrators accountable for the atrocities  that are committed and to detail the means for domestic, hybrid, or  international courts and their tribunals to request access to such  information.   This legislation, the Ukrainian Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and  Accountability Act, will ensure that victims and perpetrators alike  know that the United States of America and the world, we have got to  get those off the seat, those who abstain in the U.N., they see the  same thing. We need them to stand and have a voice.   The world is watching. The world will hold Putin and the Russian  Armed  [[Page H4216]]  Forces and those who are in their duma and those who keep pushing this  war that is caused by one man, Vladimir Putin--these abhorrent war  crimes which continue to go on--accountable. It is a war of choice that  Putin has decided to place on Ukraine.   That is why, Madam Speaker, I am so proud to partner with  Mike  McCaul in bringing H.R. 7276 to the floor today so that my children, my  grandchildren, my great-great-grandchildren, will know how I stood at  this time in history and how the United States Congress stood at this  time in history.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
