 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in  opposition.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, nearly 7 million  Pennsylvanians showed up to vote in the 2020 elections. They cast their  votes for Democrats and Republicans up and down the ballot, including  the entire U.S. House delegation, the entire State house, half of the  State senate, and other State and local races.   Since the election, there have been allegations of widespread  election fraud in Pennsylvania; but, remarkably, the 20 suits filed by  the Trump campaign, Pennsylvania Republicans, and others challenging  the results in Pennsylvania have never claimed that there was voter  fraud.  [[Page H101]]                                     time  0040    Perhaps that is because attorneys could lose their licenses when they  make unsubstantiated claims in court. That is where the rubber really  meets the road.   So if these lawsuits didn't claim election fraud, what did they  claim?   Most of the legal challenges to the Presidential election in  Pennsylvania question relatively small numbers of ballots that were  allegedly tainted by technical violations. Even assuming that all of  these ballots had been cast for Joe Biden, throwing them out wouldn't  have changed the result of the election.   Now, one exception is the lawsuit filed by one of our colleagues from  Pennsylvania, Kelly v. Commonwealth, which would have thrown out all  the mail-in votes cast in the 2020 general election on the grounds that  Act 77, the State law allowing those votes, was unconstitutional. That  suit would have disenfranchised 2\1/2\ million Pennsylvanians. Let's  let that sink in, 2\1/2\ million Pennsylvanians would have had their  votes nullified.   Now, I want to provide my colleagues with some background about the  State law at the heart of this challenge. In 2019, the Republican- controlled State legislature approved Act 77, a bipartisan bill to  reform the State's election laws, which instituted no-excuse mail  balloting. Act 77 was supported almost unanimously by Republicans in  the State House and State Senate. In fact, it was unanimous in the  State Senate and all but two Republicans in the State House.   Moreover, once this Act was passed, Act 77 had a 120-day period where  challenges could be filed against the Act if people thought it was  unconstitutional. Well, 4 months went by, nobody files a challenge. On  June 3, Pennsylvania had their primary under this new system. Nobody  challenged the primary election. It was only challenged in November,  when Republicans didn't get the result they wanted at the top of the  ticket. Not surprisingly, this case was dismissed by the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court and an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.   Another exception is Texas v. Pennsylvania. They asked the court to  reject the results of the Pennsylvania Presidential contest in  Pennsylvania and several other States, disenfranchising tens of  millions of the voters. Seven Republican members of the Pennsylvania  U.S. House delegation signed the U.S. House Republican brief in support  of Texas v. Pennsylvania.   While I feel compelled to point out to my colleagues that the same  voters who sent them to the 117th Congress cast their votes for the  President by marking the very same ballots, which were read by the very  same ballot scanners and monitored by the very same election workers.  Yet our colleagues who signed the brief only want to invalidate the  Presidential votes. This is illogical and inconsistent, colleagues, and  I am pleased to note that the Supreme Court rejected it as well.   The fact is, the election has received unprecedented scrutiny in the  courts. I believe it is irresponsible and undemocratic to argue today  that the U.S. Congress ought to relitigate the 2020 Presidential  election and second-guess the will of the voters in multiple States,  the decisions of numerous State and Federal courts, including the  Supreme Court, and the counts and recounts conducted by State election  officials.   There were 20 lawsuits filed in Pennsylvania challenging aspects of  the Presidential election. In 19 of them you got laughed out of court.  The one case you won affected roughly 100 votes. Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris won by over 80,000.
