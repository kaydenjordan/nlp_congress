 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the big middle of  this House to come together to support immediate passage of fiscal year  2024 funding for U.S. Government operations, including the interests of  national security.   Without fiscal year 2014 funding in place, which should have begun on  October 1 of this year, our military faces uncertainty in its funding  and resource allocation.   Funding delays waste time, leading to impaired military operations,  decreased training, delayed procurement, and reduced vehicle  maintenance, yielding lower readiness. These unnecessary delays  undermine our military's ability to respond to threats effectively at  home and abroad.   I hope the American people are noticing which extremist Members of  this House are responsible for this long-delayed funding compromise.  Vladimir Putin is applauding them.   They, and we, take an oath to defend America against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. Let's do it.                            ____________________
