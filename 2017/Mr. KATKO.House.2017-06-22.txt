 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dutiful service  of the United States Secret Service. The Secret Service protects the  President and Vice President, their families, and foreign dignitaries,  while also investigating cybercrimes and preventing fraud. These men  and women place their lives on the line daily to protect some of the  most highly targeted individuals in the world.   Further, they continue to conduct counterfeit interdiction operations  despite the increasing need for protective details and low retention  numbers.   While the Secret Service is often in the news for personal  shortcomings, the organization has had a storied history in protecting  the United States. It is a remarkable fact that, within the last year,  they have successfully conducted security operations for multiple  Presidential candidates, the U.N. General Assembly, a visit to New York  City by Pope Francis, and countless foreign dignitary visits to our  soil.   So from all of us here in Congress, I would like to thank the Secret  Service for their service to our Nation and for their sacrifices. In  the coming months, I plan to routinely honor this great example of  American exceptionalism.                            ____________________
