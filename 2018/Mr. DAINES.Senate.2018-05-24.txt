 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Chris Kolstad of Liberty County for his years of dedication  to Montana agriculture.   Chris is a fourth-generation farmer in Montana's Golden Triangle. For  the past 100 years, wheat has paid the bills for his family and put  food on people's plates, and that will continue moving forward with his  son Cory as a partner on the family farm. Chris and his wife, Vicki,  have four children, and Chris's father Allen Kolstad served as  Montana's Lieutenant Governor from 1989-1991.   While Chris runs an impressive and successful operation on the farm,  it is his involvement in the community that makes him stand out. He has  been an active member of the Montana Grain Growers Association, as well  as the Montana Farm Bureau. In February of 2016, Chris was elected  secretary-treasurer of U.S. Wheat Associates. Most recently, Chris was  elected chairman of the U.S. Wheat Associates.   Chris works hard to ensure that U.S. wheat is the best in the world.  While pushing for that, he proudly represents Montana's farmers and  ranchers. I congratulate and thank Chris for his years of hard work and  dedication to Montana's farmers and ranchers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am glad to introduce a resolution to  designate May 2018 ``National Brain Tumor Awareness Month.'' It is my  hope that this resolution will show our support for the patients  battling brain tumors, as well as their families, and friends who fight  alongside them. It is estimated that 78,980 new cases of primary and  non-malignant tumors in the brain and central nervous system will be  diagnosed and 16,616 people in the United States will lose their battle  with a primary brain tumor this year alone. This resolution will  increase public awareness and honor those who have suffered, or are  suffering from a brain tumor, while encouraging researchers to redouble  their efforts in the search for a cure. I thank Senator Markey and our  bipartisan colleagues for their support for this important cause.                            ____________________
