 Mr. Speaker, it is good to be here today, but what I feel  and what I believe as I am listening and I am hearing the debate is  this is not really about words said by Mrs. Greene before she was ever  elected overwhelmingly in her district.   If it was about language and that we were disciplining because of  language,  [[Page H353]]  we would have disciplined somebody else on this side, on the Democrat's  side, who said: ``Israel has hypnotized the world. May Allah awaken the  people and help them see the evildoings of Israel.'' ``It is all about  the Benjamins, baby.''   That would invoke some discipline, I would have thought.   How about this one comparing Jewish Israeli settlers to termites.  That guy didn't get disciplined. He is still on the committees I sit  on. He said: There has been a steady stream, almost like termites can  get into a residence and eat. And before you know that, you have been  eaten up, and you fall in on yourself.                                time  1715    It goes on and it goes on. The Speaker of this House has said that  Republicans are enemies of the state. All of these incite violence. All  of these demean. All of these dehumanize. All of these are statements  that just should not be accepted, but they were accepted. There was no  condemnation. And as the last speaker just said, no condemnation is an  endorsement. So I guess there is endorsement from all of them on those  statements.   So here today you are doing something that is unprecedented. You are  taking somebody for things she said before she got into this body, and  you are saying that we are going to control the minority choice of  committee assignments. This has never happened before, but here it  goes. I am afraid it is going to cascade, because that is not the way  we should do this. You can't take away the rights of the minority  leader and the minority conference. That is the problem that we have  here.   No one endorses what Mrs. Greene said, but we endorse her election  and the right of the leader to make her committee assignments and not  to have those be taken away by the majority.
