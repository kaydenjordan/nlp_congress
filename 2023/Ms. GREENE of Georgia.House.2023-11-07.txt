 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment uses the Holman rule  to reduce the salary of Secretary Pete Buttigieg to $1.   Pete Buttigieg has failed to serve the American people as the  Secretary of Transportation. He has been busy calling roads racist,  enforcing equity action plans, and implementing climate change  initiatives rather than strengthening our Nation's transportation and  infrastructure systems and responding to emergencies like the train  derailment in East Palestine.                                time  1745    He stated there is racism physically built into some of our highways.  ``Every transportation decision is inherently, in many ways, a decision  about equity.''   I would argue, people driving on dirt roads every single day in rural  America may feel that way, but our Secretary of Transportation, Pete  Buttigieg, doesn't care about Americans in rural America. He is more  interested in declaring that roads are built on skin color and racism.   He also stated, ``Ensuring equity and accessibility for every member  of the traveling public is one of the Department of Transportation's  highest priorities.''   Again, I will point to rural America.   In the same month he was sworn in, his Department introduced racial  equities and barriers to opportunities as a consideration for awarding  discretionary grants, as if that is how funds should be awarded.   In June 2022, he launched a $1 billion pilot program aimed at helping  reconnect cities and neighborhoods racially segregated or divided by  road projects. Under this program, over $100 million was awarded to  tear down and rebuild a freeway in Detroit because it was considered  racially divisive. Taxpayer dollars are being used to cover 80 percent  of the project's funds.   He has also intentionally tried to deceive the American people, as  shown when a video surfaced of him faking a bike ride to a White House  Cabinet meeting. The video showed Secretary Buttigieg driving to the  White House but stopping in just enough time for his security detail to  unload his bike from the back of the gas-guzzling SUV. He then rode his  bike for the cameras to the White House as if he had been riding it all  along. What a hypocrite. What a liar.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, deserving a taxpayer-funded  paycheck is about job performance, not about personalities or identity  politics. Let's all recall that Pete Buttigieg was formerly a mayor and  was well known as ``Pothole Pete'' for not repairing all the potholes  in the roads in the town that he served. I assure you; this is about  defunding his paycheck to $1, which I think is $1 too high for a  Secretary of Transportation who is failing the American people when it  comes to transportation.   While implementing his tyrannical climate agenda through his office  and preaching for the government to curb carbon emissions, Pete  Buttigieg has reportedly taken at least 18 taxpayer-funded flights on  private jets managed by the FAA.   One of these flights was taken to receive an award from a Canadian  gay rights organization for advancing LGBTQ rights. American taxpayers  don't want to pay for Pete Buttigieg to get awards for the way people  have sex. That is not what the Secretary of Transportation should be  doing.   These fraudulent actions of Secretary Buttigieg illustrate that he is  not to be trusted in leading our Department of Transportation. While  Secretary Buttigieg was taking taxpayer-funded, carbon-emitting private  jets to receive LGBTQ awards, he failed to serve the Americans in East  Palestine who were devastated by the train derailment and chemical  spill earlier this year.   In response to why he hadn't visited the community, he stated that he  would visit when the time is right. It turns out, the time was only  right after President Trump visited, brought thousands of bottles of  water, and pressured Secretary Buttigieg into visiting and maybe doing  his job. It took our Secretary of Transportation almost 3 weeks to  visit after this unbelievable toxic catastrophe.   Furthermore, under his watch as Secretary, the FAA was forced to  order a ground stop for all air traffic in the U.S. due to a system  outage. This was the first time in history the NOTAM system has ever  failed, and it was the first time since 9/11.   Mr. Chair, my time has expired, and I urge my colleagues to vote for  my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits funding for  the Climate Change Center at the Department of Transportation. This  Center has recently been reinstated and expanded under the Biden  administration to meet the DOT's goals in responding to the climate  crisis.   The Climate Change Center creates comprehensive and multimodal  approaches to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gases and to  improve the resilience of the transportation system to climate change  impacts. This Center announces and promotes woke grant programs that  gives U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to woke universities and  nonprofits to research the decarbonization of the transportation sector  and to address adverse environmental impacts created by the  transportation system.   Never forget, the goal of the Democrats is to take away every single  gas and diesel engine, every single combustion engine, and force  Americans to drive electric vehicles if they can afford them. While  they claim they care about the climate and the environment, they do not  care about toxic batteries and where they will be disposed, but they  want to use unlimited taxpayer funds to address a climate crisis that  does not exist because the climate has always changed. It is not  something new.   This Center also works with DOT agencies to implement climate change  criteria for grant programs, to devise climate training programs and to  facilitate climate change education campaigns for its 50,000 employees  across the Department.   For example, the Center is working with the Department of Commerce's  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to deliver climate  information and support to transportation planners and stakeholders to  enhance the safety, effectiveness, equity, and resilience of the U.S.  transportation infrastructure. These climate educational training  programs are for the  [[Page H5516]]  USDOT employees to develop a standard of language for use in  performance plans for staff engaged in climate change activities.   The entire Center is a complete abuse of U.S. taxpayer dollars and  should be defunded immediately.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, the DOT Climate Change Center is nothing more than an  extension of the Green New Deal and just another waste of hard-earned  taxpayer money to enforce the Green New Deal, forcing Americans to be  transitioned over to electric vehicles, which they do not want.   I thought this was the land of freedom. I thought this was the land  where Americans can pick and choose what they would like to buy and  what they do not want to buy.   The Green New Deal and the Democrats' willingness to use the  government to force Americans against their will to transition over to  electric vehicles is nothing more than tyranny.   Here is an example of what comes out of this Climate Change Center-- the Biden-Harris administration making $100 million available to  improve EV charger reliability. That was announced on September 13,  2023.   Here is a perfect example about how the Climate Change Center is  being used to force Americans to drive electric vehicles, which is  their goal the entire time.   The Federal Government's role is not to change how people spend their  dollars and what they choose to buy for transportation.   The Federal Government's role, especially when it comes to the  Department of Transportation, should be making sure that our roads are  drivable and that our bridges are in good condition.   By the way, electric vehicles are heavy. That would put an undue  burden on our bridges and on our roads. This is what they should be  focused on, not the lie that, all of a sudden, climate change is real.   We have had tornadoes since the beginning of time. We have had  earthquakes since the beginning of time. We have had hurricanes since  the beginning of time.   This is not a new change in weather patterns. It is not a climate  crisis. It is just called weather, and it has to do with seasons.   Another thing. The Biden administration has no right to lie to the  American people and make the American people fund their lies.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, my amendment prohibits funds  from being used for the Department of Transportation Climate Change  Center because it is a complete waste of taxpayer money.   We are over $33 trillion in debt, Mr. Chair. The American people  cannot afford their money to be wasted and spent on lies.   We need the Federal Government to spend the Americans' hard-earned  taxpayer dollars on good roads, good bridges, and good infrastructure.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
