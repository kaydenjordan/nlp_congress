 Mr. President, the world is on fire because of Joe Biden's  failed leadership and ongoing weakness. Our enemies are on the march.  Our servicemembers are under attack by Iran-backed proxies. And our  country is under greater threat than it has been in years.   Innocent lives are on the line here at home and abroad. At home, the  Biden DOD is waging a war on the unborn--a war that is immoral and  unlawful.   I am a mother. I have carried a baby girl in my womb who is now a  second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and my baby girl is now carrying a  baby of her own. And I am proudly, adamantly, and unabashedly pro-life.  I always will be. That is why I have--I have--led the legislation to  overturn this woke Dodd policy and will not rest in this fight for  life, especially as we work through this year's Defense bill.   Abroad, our friend and ally Israel is under assault by ruthless Iran- backed Hamas. Jewish babies have been murdered, burned in ovens, and  some even stripped from their mothers' wombs.   As a 23-year combat veteran and retired lieutenant colonel of our  great U.S. Army, I firmly believe the Pentagon should be focused on  protecting innocent life, not destroying it.   Joe Biden and Secretary Austin are weak and woke. The architects of  this immoral policy should be held accountable. Anyone trying to insert  their radical agenda into the military has no place in the Pentagon. No  Senator should support any person or dollar that threatens the  lethality of our warfighters.   Catering to the far left does not win wars or keep Americans safe.  Our servicemembers have been failed by their Commander in Chief, and we  must do right by them and the security and protection of our own  Nation.   For over 9 months now, Chuck Schumer has used our military men and  women as political pawns, refusing to allow the Senate to do its job of  vetting and voting on military nominees. Only when Republicans forced  the majority leader's hand did he finally relent and move on a few of  those nominees.   Tonight, we are once again standing up for valiant individuals who  have answered the call to selfless service. Unlike in the past, when  promotions were quietly approved en bloc with no discussion, tonight we  will be highlighting the distinguished careers of each and then putting  their nomination before the Senate for confirmation individually by  voice vote.   And with that, I will yield the floor.    Madam President, I know this is a frustrating exercise,  but we are going to flesh out some of these nominees tonight, truly  incredible individuals who have served our Nation through thick and  thin. These are folks who deserve to be promoted.   So I rise today to talk about Lt. Gen. Gregory M. Guillot on his  promotion to the grade of General and his nomination to be the next  Commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace  Defense Command, also known as NORAD.   General Guillot is from Tucson, AZ, and he is a proud graduate of the  United States Air Force Academy. I am sorry he could not get into West  Point. He has successfully commanded a flying squadron operations  group, two flying wings, a numbered Air Force, and has admirably served  on numbered Air Force, major command, and combatant command staffs.   He is an expert in his field, as demonstrated by having been an Air  Force Weapons School instructor and graduate of the National War  College.   General Guillot is a decorated warfighter and a senior air battle  manager by training who is currently the Deputy Commander of U.S.  Central Command. He has been instrumental integrating air, missile, and  drone defense systems across the Middle East--experience that is  applicable to the challenges facing NORTHCOM's air and missile  defenses.    I believe that General Guillot's qualifications, his record, and his  outstanding character make him the right nominee to serve in this  important role.   So we can confirm this nomination by voice vote right here, now, and  therefore I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 236, Lt. Gen. Gregory M. Guillot to be General; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Madam President, if I can just address this very briefly  before we move to my colleague from Indiana, I have a discharge  petition that was signed at our conference lunch the other day for Lt.  Gen. General M. Guillot. That discharge petition was signed by Senator  Tuberville, meaning that Senator Tuberville believed that we should be  voting on General Guillot. I was asking for a voice vote for General  Guillot this evening.   I am not sure how we remedy this situation, but I can tell you we  will keep working on these nominations, and we will get answers  someday, and they will be confirmed someday if we have the intestinal  fortitude to do what is right by our military men and women, who have  absolutely nothing to do with the policy that was put in place by  Secretary Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, we have got another incredible officer  that we are bringing to the floor this evening for a voice vote, and I  do hope my colleague from Alabama will explain to everyone out there  who is watching why he has asked for individual votes, and, when given  the opportunity, he is objecting to individual votes. I feel like we  are in a holding pattern. But maybe he will care to explain that to us  in a moment.   But, right now, I do want to focus on this really incredible officer.  I have had the opportunity to work with this officer, and I will talk  about the most recent time that I interacted with him.   I am bringing to the floor right now VADM Brad Cooper on his  nomination to be the next Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command.   I just saw Admiral Cooper in Bahrain. The day I saw him in Bahrain  was October 7--October 7, the day that Hamas overran defenses that  separated the Gaza Strip and Israel; the day that Hamas went into  Israel and murdered babies, raped women, cut babies out of their  mother's stomachs, killed innocent elderly men and women, abducted  Americans and took them into the Gaza Strip. That is the last day that  I saw Brad Cooper--October 7, the terrorist strikes against Israel.   Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command--what region is that? That  is the region where Israel is located. They need fine men and women at  U.S. Central Command. This is an area where we have seen great  terrorist threats.   Our dear friends, the Israelis, are struggling under the weight of  Iran-backed terrorist proxies. At U.S. Central Command, we need  leadership.   I am bringing forward VADM Brad Cooper. I will remind the body, just  as I did with General Guillot, that I passed around the Republican  conference the other day a discharge petition, which means we would  have a vote on VADM Brad Cooper. One of the signatures on that petition  is of my colleague from Alabama. He agreed to vote on this nominee, and  we are giving him the opportunity to vote on this nominee, who will be  the Deputy Commander of U.S. Central Command, where we have what could  be World War III brewing. Our friends the Israelis need every last good  man and woman that the United States has serving in these important  positions.   A little bit about VADM Brad Cooper: He is the son of a career Army  officer. He attended high school in Montgomery, AL. Vice Admiral Cooper  joined the Navy and received his commission from the U.S. Naval  Academy. He is a career surface warfare officer. He served on guided  missile cruisers, guided missile destroyers, aircraft carriers,  amphibious assault ships, and successfully commanded both the USS  Russell and the USS Gettysburg.   If anyone knows Admiral Cooper, he is a very humble man. He is very  proud of the extraordinary men and women with whom he served on sea  duty during his 9 deployments and 13 real-world operations all around  our globe.   He has served in a variety of positions throughout his career, and he  has been nominated to serve in the U.S. Central Command as their Deputy  Commander.   He has been instrumental in maintaining the stability and security of  the Middle East regions' maritime environment through NAVCENT. His  skills and experience gained in this position at NAVCENT make him  absolutely the right choice to be the Deputy Commander of U.S. Central  Command, and I am excited to see him confirmed.   So, Madam President, we can confirm that nomination by voice vote  tonight--tonight. We will vote on this man: 9 deployments, 13 real- world operations. He is a warrior.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar  No. 196, Charles B. Cooper, II, to be Vice Admiral; that the Senate  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Madam President, we see another one bite the dust. It is a  good thing I still have that discharge petition, and we will see Vice  Admiral Cooper on the floor once again, and I hope that my colleague  will choose to support him.   So I served in the Iowa Army National Guard, and I am really proud of  that service. So I deployed overseas with the Iowa Army National Guard  as a young Company Commander. I was the first female to command my  unit. It was the same unit that my father had served in when he was a  young Sergeant in the Iowa Army National Guard. He was a mechanic. He  is the salt of the Earth.   And I was so proud to grow up and serve alongside some really  incredible Iowa Army National Guardsmen. They worked so hard. They  worked so hard on that deployment, Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Now, I was gone from 2003 to 2004. My daughter, she was 3 years old  when I deployed, and she was nearly 5 years old when I returned home.  So my daughter--again, she is a Second Lieutenant serving Active-Duty  U.S. Army. And she told me--it has probably been a year ago--she had  read an interesting statistic about children who have mothers that  served in uniform. And she told me that that statistic was that 80  percent of the children who have mothers that wore the uniform will go  into the service.   She said: Mom, I didn't have a choice. So she did; she went into the  U.S. Army. And I encouraged that, and I am so proud of her for her  service. Again, she is a young officer. I know she is disappointed by  what she sees today--in particular, this evening.   And what I want the folks to know--and in a roundabout way I am  coming to this. But all of these holds are affecting our men and women  in the military. They are affecting the families of these men and  women. Like I said, 80 percent of the children whose mothers wore the  uniform are more likely to go in than those who didn't have a mother  who served.   But right now, today, 37 percent of Active-Duty families are likely  to recommend military service--37 percent. They see what is going on  today.   And I have heard my colleague say we shouldn't be injecting politics  into  [[Page S5294]]  the military and that President Biden did that and Lloyd Austin,  Secretary of Defense, did that. But what are we doing to these military  men and women? Politics are being injected right here, today. We have  men and women who deserve to be promoted, to serve where their country  knows they are needed.   And our military families today are saying: You know what, I don't  want my kid serving in the military because they will be used as  political pawns.   That is dishonorable, and it is abhorrent. So I served. Col. Dan  Sullivan served. We understand the significance of service and being  willing to lay down your life for a fellow countryman.   This next gentleman that I am bringing forward, we have something in  common because this gentleman is a native of Spencer, IA. He enlisted  into the Iowa Army National Guard. OK? He enlisted in 1981. He also was  salt of the Earth, just like my father, who enlisted in the Iowa Army  National Guard.   This gentleman is LTG James J. Mingus. He has been appointed to the  grade of General and nominated to be the next Vice Chief of Staff of  the Army. Again, he enlisted into the Iowa Army National Guard in 1981.  He graduated from Winona State University in Minnesota, our neighbor to  the north, and he commissioned into the Army infantry.   During more than 38 years of service, Lieutenant General Mingus has  commanded at every echelon from company to brigade in addition to  working in key staff positions in both Army, Special Operations Forces,  and joint units. He is a decorated warfighter with extensive combat  service. He deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and  Operation Enduring Freedom 12 times from 2001 to 2012.   Lieutenant General Mingus has distinguished himself with honor,  having been awarded for meritorious achievement in a combat zone. He is  a hard-working public servant who knows the needs of our soldiers and  their families.   I have full confidence that he will continue to modernize the Army  and maintain our highly trained and lethal force to fight and win our  Nation's wars. The problem is, he can't do it if he is not serving in  that position.   I firmly believe that his qualifications, record, and character--and,  of course, his great home State of Iowa--make him the right nominee to  serve in this important role.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: War hero Executive Calendar No. 288, James J. Mingus, to be  General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; that the Senate vote on  the nomination without intervening action or debate; that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Madam President, now, I have the honor and privilege of  talking about MG John W. Brennan, Jr., on his appointment to the grade  of Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army and his nomination to be the  Deputy Commander of U.S. Africa Command.   Major General Brennan is currently serving as Special Assistant to  the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command.  This is no paper pusher, Madam President--and I have heard that phrase.   Army Special Operations play a crucial role in competition and  deterring great power war. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure this  deserving officer, who earned this promotion, is confirmed to this key  national security position.   The good Major General is a decorated warfighter with extensive  combat service in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the Inherent Resolve  Campaign, having recently served as Commander of Combined Joint Task  Force-Operation Inherent Resolve just last year. He distinguished  himself with honor, having been awarded a Bronze Star with ``V'' for  valor.   I firmly believe that Major General Brennan's qualifications, record,  and character make him exceptionally eligible for this promotion, and I  look forward to confirming him to be the Deputy Commander of U.S.  Africa Command, a very important position. Again, ``V'' for valor.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar  No. 130, John W. Brennan, Jr., to be Lieutenant General and Deputy  Commander, U.S. Africa Command; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, another great, decorated officer--and we  are going to keep going because these men and women deserve to be  confirmed.   Madam President, I am going to talk now about CAPT Frank Schlereth on  his appointment to the grade of Rear Admiral, lower half, in the U.S.  Navy. CAPT Frank Schlereth is currently serving as the Senior Defense  Official and Defense Attache within the U.S. Embassy, Israel.   It is crucial at this time in history to ensure this deserving  officer, who earned this promotion, is recognized for serving in a key  position to national security and regional stability. The Captain is a  two-time Naval Attache, having served in Athens, Greece; and Tel-Aviv,  Israel.   He has extensive experience within the Defense Intelligence Agency  Directorate of Operations, having served as the Chief of Operations for  the DIA, Defense Attache Service, and the East Asia Division Chief.   He is a decorated warfighter with extensive combat service, having  deployed to Afghanistan in direct support of Operation Enduring Freedom  as a team leader in support of a sensitive collection mission.   Captain Schlereth distinguished himself with honor, having been  awarded the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ``V'' for valorous  achievement in a combat zone during his deployment.   I also believe that the Captain's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this appointment and  promotion.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 103, Frank G. Schlereth, III, to be  Rear Admiral (lower half); that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, we will proceed to COL Peter G. Hart.   I call to the floor Executive Calendar No. 94, COL Peter G. Hart, to  the grade of Brigadier General.   Colonel Hart is currently fulfilling a crucial role as an Army  Strategist for the U.S. Central Command. As a 23-year combat veteran  and retired Lieutenant Colonel of our great U.S. Army, I am proud to  stand up for this valiant officer who has answered the selfless call to  service and earned this promotion in the U.S. Army.   Again, I want to talk about making these individuals political pawns  in the grand scheme. So the VFW had recently done a survey. And they  did surveys in every State and overseas territory of their members.   These are veterans. Polls indicate there is a growing wedge between  the veteran community and the colleagues on this side of the aisle and  ``political decisions that harm the troops will affect the decisions of  BFW members in upcoming elections.''   People don't like men and women who are used as political pawns,  especially those who are sworn to be apolitical. Those are the men and  women  [[Page S5295]]  who serve in uniform. There is a growing division. It will continue to  grow wider.   So, therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of the  following nomination: Colonel Peter G. Hart to be Brigadier General in  the U.S. Army, under Executive Calendar No. 94; that the Senate vote on  the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, we have another opportunity to vote on  another outstanding officer. This one is COL Scott D. Wilkinson, and he  has been promoted to the grade of Brigadier General.   As an Army veteran myself, I know and I understand the importance of  recognizing this deserving officer who earned his promotion in the U.S.  Army. He is a decorated warfighter. He distinguished himself with honor  for meritorious achievement in a combat zone during his deployment.   As a Captain--a young O3 is what we call them in the Army--Colonel  Wilkinson provided precision close air support over a 6-hour period  using night vision goggles, with zero illumination, in a complex urban  environment, enabling the assault and exfiltration of a combined joint  task force under heavy enemy fire.   I am proud to be here on this floor as well standing shoulder to  shoulder with my Marine Corps friend, Col. Dan Sullivan of Alaska.   You can read through this little, brief description of COL Scott D.  Wilkinson.   For those of us who have served and have been part of a team and have  been deployed, we understand the significance of having close air  support.   I served as a Transportation Company Commander when I deployed, and I  will tell you that having close air support--knowing they were a phone  call away--always made my drivers and me feel a lot better about  things. I know Colonel Sullivan, as an infantryman, also understands  what it is to have that close air support and how important those men  and women overhead are during battle.   So, COL Scott D. Wilkinson, I am really glad to give you close air  support tonight. Those of us who have worked on a team understand how  significant it is to have one another's back and make sure these men  and women are protected.   With this close air support, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of  the following nomination: COL Scott D. Wilkinson to be Brigadier  General in the U.S. Army under Executive Calendar No. 94; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; and  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Madam President, we are going to move next to COL Joseph  W. Wortham II.   I call to the floor Executive Calendar No. 94, COL Joseph W. Wortham  II to the grade of Brigadier General.   Again, we are seeing a pattern. We have Colonel Wortham. He is a  decorated warfighter and, again, as a Captain, as an O3, his brave and  decisive actions saved the life of a severely wounded American and  defeated a large enemy force in Iraq in 2005.   My colleague Colonel Sullivan, Senator Sullivan from Alaska--we have  been talking about what it is to serve and the way these heroes have  reacted in combat. Because of Colonel Wortham's actions in combat, he  saved the life of a fellow countryman, saved the life of an individual  willing to lay down his life for his country.   Colonel Wortham was willing to do the same. He saved the life of a  severely wounded American, and he defeated a large enemy force in Iraq  in 2005. Again, he was part of an incredible team. He didn't turn his  back on his teammate; he saved his life. It is crucial to ensure that  this deserving officer, who earned this promotion, is afforded the  opportunity to be recognized.   Colonel Wortham, again, is part of a glorious team and was first  commissioned into the Army in 1996 through Auburn University's Reserve  Officer Training Corps.   During his 25 years of service, he participated in operations in  Egypt, Israel, and Lebanon, as well as combat operations in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and Syria. His understanding of Kurdish culture and  training in the Turkish language proved essential for his repeated  deployments to the Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.   I firmly believe that Colonel Wortham's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this promotion, and by  the fact that he went through Auburn University's ROTC Program.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: War hero who saved  the life of a fellow soldier, COL Joseph W. Wortham II, to be Brigadier  General in the United States Army under Executive Calendar No. 94; that  the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Next, Madam President, we will move on to CAPT Thomas A.  Donovan--CAPT Thomas A. Donovan, for appointment to Rear Admiral (lower  half). Captain Donovan is currently serving as the Executive Officer to  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   I know Captain Donovan, and I know of his service. I will not go into  details tonight on this floor. I will explain it  [[Page S5298]]  to Members who are on this floor, off the floor, if they would like to  talk about Captain Donovan.   I truly believe that we must stand up for the security and protection  of our Nation, and I am proud to recognize this deserving officer, who  earned this promotion, and highlight his selfless call to serve.   I firmly believe that Captain Donovan's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this appointment and  promotion.   Now, again, I know Captain Donovan. I know him quite well. There may  be mumblings over some of these younger officers. We have spent just a  brief time talking about them on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Those  who are out watching on C-SPAN, or maybe in clips tomorrow, will  understand why some of these presentations are very brief.   For those in this Chamber that don't understand why these  presentations are very brief, they shouldn't be here objecting to these  nominations. I will let that sink in.   OK, CAPT Thomas A. Donovan.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  CAPT Thomas A. Donovan to be Rear Admiral (lower half) in the Navy,  under Executive Calendar No. 97; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    And I am very sorry to hear that.   Again, we have got another very short presentation here. I will have  to explain it to my colleagues that maybe haven't served why they are  brief.   Madam President, I call to the floor Executive Calendar No. 97, CAPT  Joshua Lasky, for appointment to Rear Admiral (lower half).   As a 23-year combat veteran myself and a retired Lieutenant Colonel  of our great U.S. Army, I am proud to stand up for this valiant officer  who has answered the selfless call to service and earned this promotion  in the U.S. Navy.   I firmly believe that Captain Lasky's qualifications, record, and  character make him exceptionally eligible for this promotion. And,  again, I will have to visit with folks off the floor to explain more  about Captain Lasky. He is fully deserving of this promotion, and I am  very sorry to acknowledge that he also will probably be objected to-- one more hero that will be objected to this evening.   So not only have we seen Senator Schumer dragging his feet on these  nominations, but tonight we have had the exceptional opportunity--I  think we have had maybe 40 of these nominations brought forward, but we  are still dragging our feet on these. We are voting on them one by one,  one by one, one by one--just as our colleague asked, one by one. These  are men and women of honor. They are sworn to uphold the Constitution,  the very Constitution that my colleague is saying he is protecting.  They are sworn to uphold, and they would do it with their blood. Some  of these men have done it with their blood. I am waiting.   So, Madam President, we can confirm this nomination by voice vote  right here, tonight, individually--individually brought up, just as my  colleague has asked.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: CAPT Joshua Lasky to  be Rear Admiral (lower half) in the Navy under Executive Calendar No.  97; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action  or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, our next nomination is a fine officer  serving in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Our colleague from Alaska,  Col. Dan Sullivan, also serves in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. I will  read a little bit about this gentleman, and we will take an individual  vote on the floor this evening, I am hoping, because this gentleman  does deserve to be promoted and placed into his next position.   So this gentleman is Maj. Gen. Leonard F. Anderson IV, U.S. Marine  Corps Reserve, to be Lieutenant General and Commander of Marine Forces  Reserves, Commander Marine Forces, South.   So here is a little bit about the good General. The Major General  most recently served as the Commanding General of the 4th Marine  Aircraft Wing. He does have some prior experience as well in serving as  the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations,  but Major General Anderson also served in a marine aviation logistics  squadron. So it is interesting that the Executive Calendar number for  Maj. Gen. Leonard F. Anderson is 248 as I also--not in the Marines, but  I served in an aviation support battalion, which is a logistics  battalion, supporting aviation, the 248th Aviation Support Battalion.  This gentleman has  [[Page S5301]]  served in the Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron, and his experience  has allowed him to support those men and women who are in the air,  similar to the circumstance we talked about prior with a pilot who  provided close air support during combat. These are the guys and gals  who keep those aircraft up, flying, fueled, maintained--ready to go.   So this is an important position he is going into. It is the Marine  Forces Reserves, Commander Marine Forces South, and I am hoping we will  be able to take a vote on him this evening.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 248, Leonard F. Anderson IV to be  Lieutenant General and Commander Marine Forces Reserves Commander,  Marine Forces South; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    OK, Madam President. We are just going to keep going. We  have quite a few exceptional men and women who are proud to defend our  glorious Nation. Many of them, again, have served in combat. We just  came out of 20 years of the Global War on Terror, and we know what  service is. Many of us know what service is. The Presiding Officer--her  father certainly knew what service was, so I thank him very much for  his service to our Nation.   So we will proceed to Executive Calendar No. 262, Timothy D. Haugh. I  apologize to the gentleman if I am mispronouncing his name. It is H-A- U-G-H. He is a member of the U.S. Air Force, and he has been nominated  to be the Commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director, National  Security Agency.   At a time when we see many nations around the world using grey-zone  techniques to infiltrate various infrastructures in the United States  of America and that of allied nations, we know how important Cyber  Command is to protect not only our military assets but then to track  and push back against those foreign agents who are going after civilian  infrastructure as well.   Lieutenant General Haugh's 32-year career has been exemplary, and he  has commanded intelligence and cyber commands at every level as the  Commander of 16th Air Force, Air Forces Cyber, and Joint Force  Headquarters-Cyber, where he was responsible for more than 44,000  personnel conducting worldwide operations.   The Lieutenant General most recently served as Deputy Commander of  U.S. Cyber Command. Anyone, if they are paying attention, understands  how important Cyber Command is. Again, the Lieutenant General has  served as the Deputy Commander of U.S. Cyber Command. We would love to  see him confirmed this very evening, with a single vote, into the  position of Commander, U.S. Cyber Command, and Director of the National  Security Agency--an extremely important position.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 262, Timothy D. Haugh, to be Commander, U.S.  Cyber Command, and Director of our National Security Agency; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; and  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.     Mr. President, our next nominee as well is hoping to be  confirmed this evening, again, by an individual vote on the floor of  the U.S. Senate. Just as my colleague has asked, has demanded, my  colleagues and I this evening are attempting to satisfy that demand for  single votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are providing that  avenue of opportunity this evening and are hoping that we will see the  confirmations of some of America's finest fighting men and women, who  have absolutely nothing to do with the policy that has been proposed by  Secretary Lloyd Austin.   In front of us, we have MG Charles D. Costanza. He is a member of the  U.S. Army. He is being nominated as Lieutenant General and Commanding  General of V Corps.   Over Major General Costanza's 32-year career--again, another plus 30  years of experience and decorations during war--he has served as the  Commanding General of the 3rd Infantry Division, the Deputy Chief of  Staff for U.S. Army Forces Command, and the Director of Training for  the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff. Major General Costanza's  deployments include to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  Major General Costanza has most recently served as Special Assistant to  the Commanding General, U.S. Army Forces Command.   Once again, as an individual vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I  ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for  the consideration of the following nomination of this fine individual:  Executive Calendar No. 290, Charles D. Costanza to be Lieutenant  General and Commanding General, V Corps; that the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate; and that if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    OK. We will move on to the next conferee, and we will  bring to the table now No. 291, James H. Adams III to be Lieutenant  General, and this is a fellow marine.    ``Oorah.''   OK. A fellow marine.   To my good friend and colleague, Col. Dan Sullivan, Senator Sullivan  of Alaska, we have Maj. Gen. James H. Adams III to be Lieutenant  General and Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources Headquarters  of U.S. Marine Corps.   Brigadier General Hanson has most recently served as the Mobilization  Assistant to the Director of Operations for Air Combat Command. A  number of us who serve in the Senate have worn the uniform of our  Nation and have deployed, and we understand how important these  activities are, especially when you have a good friend at Mobilization  and Operations for Air Combat Command.   Through the mobilization process, there are a lot of logistics there  in moving folks around. So we know that Brigadier General Hanson is  very well qualified to move into this position at Programs and  Resources at the Headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps. He has served  in numerous positions at the squadron, the group wing, and numbered Air  Force and Combatant Command levels as an Active-Duty and traditional  Reservist and individual mobility augmenting member.   General Hanson has flown the A-10 and F-16 in a variety of  operational assignments and is a command pilot with more than 3,400  flying hours and over 200 combat hours. He has deployed in support of  Operations Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Noble Eagle, Willing Spirit,  and Enduring Freedom.   Mr. President, I bring forward to you for an individual vote on the  floor of the U.S. Senate, as requested by my colleague. I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the  consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 291,  James H. Adams III to be Lieutenant General; that the Senate vote on  the nomination without intervening action or debate; and that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, so I am going to pick up where my colleague  is leaving off. We will keep on with the Space Force theme as we go  forward here.   I am bringing forward another really fantastic nominee, and this is  Maj Gen Douglas A. Schiess. And I apologize again if I am getting these  names wrong, but, heck, maybe we will get them confirmed tonight, and  we won't have to read it again on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   So Maj Gen Douglas A. Schiess, U.S. Space Force, to be Lieutenant  General and Commander, U.S. Space Forces--Space/Combined Joint Force  Space Component Commander--again, serving in a joint force, just as  Senator Sullivan and I are operating as a joint force here on the floor  of the U.S. Senate.   We have another really great nominee with a lot of years of service  to this incredible country. He has a 31-year career. And we have heard  a lot of these guys. They are 30-plus. We have seen some lower officers  just being promoted to Brigadier General. But let me tell you, these  men and women who have over 30 years of service are to be commended. As  my colleague from  [[Page S5304]]  Alaska has said, they have been put on the bench. I would think we  would want the players with the most experience, the most finesse, the  means to get a job done--I think we would want them in the game.   So Maj Gen Douglas Schiess has that 31-year career. He has commanded  4th Space Operations Squadron. He has been with the 45th Operations  Group, the 21st Space Wing, and the 45th Space Wing. He deployed to Al  Udeid Air Base in Qatar in support of Operations Enduring Freedom,  Resolute Support, and Inherent Resolve. Most recently, he served as the  Vice Commander for Space Operations Command, U.S. Space Force.   Those who have paid attention in the last handful of years as we have  developed our U.S. Space Force understand that this is a very important  domain moving forward. So not only do we have land, sea, and air; now  we have space as well.   I am very hopeful that we will move forward on this nomination-- again, 31 years of honorable service. He certainly deserves to be  placed in this position of authority, Mr. President.   So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 392, Douglas A. Schiess to be Lieutenant General and  Commander, U.S. Space Forces--Space/Combined Joint Force Space  Component Commander; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, we will move on to the next individual  vote, as requested by my colleague from Alabama. Here we are moving on  the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am glad to be joined by a number of  colleagues in the Chamber this evening to support our men and women in  uniform.   I do want to make the point--because we continue to talk about these  incredible nominees and their service to our Nation during times of war  and times of peace--I do want to bring it back to the reason that we  are here. It is because of the abhorrent policy that has been put into  our Department of Defense by a political nominee, Secretary Lloyd  Austin. He is the civilian in charge of the Department of Defense.  Again, it is about an abortion policy that has been placed in the  Department of Defense.    I will remind everyone once again that I am a pro-life woman. I am  also a veteran and a combat veteran, at that. I do believe in  protecting innocent life. I will continue to fight for innocent life.  It was my amendment that was taken up in the Armed Services Committee  earlier this year as we debated this policy during the debate on the  National Defense Authorization Act.   I have been a pro-life leader for well over 30 years now, since I was  a young woman going through Iowa State University; making my career in  the civilian workforce; then going into the Iowa Senate, where I was a  proud defender of life; and now into the U.S. Senate, where I continue  fighting for life in ways that make sense.   We have civilian nominees who can be held and held responsible for  this very, very bad policy at the Department of Defense. The men and  women who are being brought forward tonight by Senator Dan Sullivan, by  Senator Todd Young, by Senator Lindsey Graham, and myself, they have  nothing to do with the DOD abortion policy--nothing to do with the DOD  abortion policy.   I have joined in life marches. I have given life speeches. I have  objected to the practice of abortion, late-term abortion, in Western  Iowa, in Council Bluffs. I have done this, as I said, for three  decades--three decades. I challenge anybody in this Chamber to be more  pro-life than I am or more military than I am. I have served, and I  have borne a child.   So our next nominee is Michael Guetlein. He is a Lieutenant General,  U.S. Space Force, to be General and Vice Chief of Space Operations-- another incredible individual, a 32-year career. He also has served in  command, leadership positions, at the flight, squadron, division,  directorate, Program Executive Officer, and field command levels.   Lt Gen Guetlein's commands include the Director of Remote Sensing  Systems and the Commander for the Rapid Reaction Squadron. Lieutenant  General Guetlein most recently served as the Commander of Space Systems  Command.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 292, Michael A. Guetlein for appointment to the  grade of General with assignment as Vice Chief of Space Operation; that  the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President, we will continue again with the U.S. Space  Force theme.   We have another gentleman: Lt Gen Stephen N. Whiting of U.S. Space  Force to be General and Commander of U.S. Space Command--again, a very,  very important position to have. As we are working in the gray zone  areas, we need to know that our space assets are protected, and we have  the right man for the job.   So this is Lt Gen Stephen N. Whiting. He has a 34-year career as a  Space Operations Officer. He has commanded the 13th Space Warning  Squadron, the 614th Air and Space Operations Center and Joint Space  Operations Center, the 21st Space Wing, and the Combined Force Space  Component Command and 14th Air Force.   Lieutenant General Whiting most recently served as the Commander of  Space Operations Command--again, a gentleman who has absolutely nothing  to do with DOD abortion policy, a man who has honorably served his  country in uniform for 34 years.   We are probably going to see and witness the back-benching of Lt Gen  Stephen N. Whiting this evening, but, as my colleague from Alaska says,  maybe not. Maybe we will see a man of honor step forward and voice vote  on the confirmation of this officer by allowing us to move forward  individually, as requested, on votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 328, Lt Gen Stephen N. Whiting for appointment  in the U.S. Space Force to be General and Commander, U.S. Space  Command; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, this one hits home. It is another nominee  from the Navy. Hey, I am Army, but I love my Navy brothers and sisters.  I love them all. This one is a Navy sister.   This is Executive Calendar No. 347, Heidi K. Berg to be Rear Admiral.  RDML Heidi K. Berg has--and as I was reading through these nominees,  this struck me because she has an over 30-year career.   Now, I know--because I was commissioned over 30 years ago--I know  what a difficult climb it has been for women who were entering into the  U.S. armed services at that time. Those women who entered in the  seventies, eighties, nineties--they were trailblazers. They  increasingly were put into positions of authority.   This Rear Admiral, Heidi Berg, has commanded in some very significant  positions. She has commanded the Navy Information Operations Command in  Bahrain, the Navy Element of  [[Page S5305]]  the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Joint Military Intelligence  Training Center.   Rear Admiral Berg's operational tours include Navy Security Group  Activity in Rota, Spain, where Berg flew over 1,000 hours as a  Communications Intercept Evaluator on board EP-3E aircraft in support  of Operations Provide Promise/Sharp Guard, aboard the USS LaSalle,  Italy, and as Director of the International Security Assistance Force  Red Team at ISAF headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan.   Most recently, Rear Admiral Berg served as the Assistant Deputy Chief  of Naval Operations for Operations, Plans and Strategy. And, again, we  have had a number of women who have been brought up this evening in  this debate, many of them having decades-plus experience. And I can  tell you that women who were commissioned and have served over these  last number of decades, they are to be commended. They have broken down  barriers and allowed other women to see her and be her.   So for You, Admiral Heidi K. Berg, I commend you.   And I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session for consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 347, Heidi K. Berg, to be Rear Admiral; that the Senate  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    And there is another one that, as I said, you can see her;  you can be her. Unfortunately, young ladies won't see her, at least for  a while.   Mr. President, I have a couple here more before I turn it back over  to my colleague from Alaska.   We are on a Navy theme again. So we have in front of us Michael T.  Spencer, to be Rear Admiral Lower Half. He is a Navy 06, a Captain in  the Navy, to be Rear Admiral (lower half).   Captain Spencer's 30-year naval career has been exemplary. He has  commanded VFA-102 and CVW-11 and served in leadership positions for  Fighter Squadron VF-211 Carrier Air Wing CVW-1 and VFA-213. His  deployments include aboard the USS Nimitz, the USS John C. Stennis, the  USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and the USS George  Washington, and again, most recently, on the USS Nimitz.   Again, an admirable career. We are bringing him up for an individual  vote on the U.S. Senate floor, as requested by my colleague from  Alabama. So we will try once again.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar  No. 327, Michael T. Spencer, to be Rear Admiral (lower half); that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Another one that I have known for a number of years now-- this one is in the U.S. Army--and I am very proud to be able to bring  forward this nomination this evening--again, an individual vote on the  floor of the U.S. Senate, as asked by our colleague from Alabama. I  hope that we can get this one over the finish line tonight.   So this nominee is Executive Calendar No. 390. It is Douglas A. Sims  II. And he has been nominated to be Lieutenant General and Director of  the Joint Staff.   We have brought up so many incredible individuals this evening. All  of them are incredibly important positions.   Now, if you are familiar in the military, we do have a Joint Staff.  And as a Director, this gentleman would be making sure that that Joint  Staff operated seamlessly. Things just don't happen in the military,  especially when you don't have the right leadership in the right  positions.   So we have Lieutenant General Sims. He has a 32-year career. He has  served as the Commanding General of the First Infantry Division, the  Deputy Director for Regional Operations and Force Management, and the  Deputy Commanding General for Operation Freedom's Sentinel in  Afghanistan.   Let me say that again: the Deputy Commanding General for Operation  Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan. The weight of his authority.   Lieutenant General Sims has completed three deployments to  Afghanistan and two to Iraq. Most recently, Lieutenant General Sims, an  exemplary man serving in the U.S. Army, served as the Director for  Operations of the Joint Staff J-3.   Mr. President, I am going to try again. I ask unanimous consent that  the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of the  following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 390, Douglas A. Sims II,  to be Lieutenant General and Director, Joint Staff; that the Senate  vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Mr. President, we have just a couple more to go as we wrap  up the evening. We have been reading off these nominations as fast as  our staff could get them to us, and I guarantee that my colleague,  Senator Sullivan of Alaska, and I would go all night if we could. We  won't keep you in the Chair, Mr. President.   But we have seen a number of really incredible human beings come in  front of us. Before I move on these nominations, that is what I want  all of us to remember.   For those who might be viewing this evening, those who will read  through this tomorrow, I want them to understand that these are human  beings. They are men and women who serve our country for all different  reasons.   I can't speak for Col. Dan Sullivan, but I know that when I decided  as a young woman to serve my country, it was truly because I wanted to  serve my country because I believe that our country provided great  opportunities for kids like me who came from nothing.   I literally came from nothing in Southwest Iowa. I am the first in my  family to graduate from a 4-year school. My brother did not have the  opportunity to go to college. He went into the workforce. My sister has  an associate's degree from a community college. My parents are both  high school educated, and I am blessed that they were high school  educated.   I had the great opportunity to attend an agricultural exchange while  I was at Iowa State University, and that ag exchange took me to the  USSR in 1989, to a place we now know as Ukraine. After living on that  collective farm with my Ukrainian brother and sister and their family-- no running water, no refrigerator, no car, no telephone. The kids I  lived with had never traveled off of the collective farm.   After that experience and coming back to the United States, I  understood that, growing up on a tiny little farm in Southwest Iowa,  that I was so very blessed to be an American.   My country afforded me all kinds of opportunities. Even though I came  from a family without means, I could do anything. And I tell you what,  when I was that kid, that 19-year-old kid who had traveled to the  Soviet Union and back, I can tell you that my grandparents, at that  time, would have never believed that that little kid would grow up and  become a U.S. Senator.   But what I took from that experience was that I was blessed. Dan was  blessed. Coach is blessed. I think all of us are blessed by virtue of  our birth and our citizenship here in the United States.   So it was that experience that led me into the U.S. Army ROTC Program  at Iowa State University because I didn't come from wealth or means,  but what I did have was my service. And I knew that I needed to give  back to my country and protect the values that we all hold dear. And I  do not question anyone who serves in this U.S. Senate. We are all sent  here for a purpose.   But I do know that many of these men and women whom we have talked  about tonight, they believe in their country as well. They are human  beings. Many of them have backgrounds just as I do. They are flesh and  blood, and they have chosen to wear the uniform and the flag of our  United States.   They have done that without any mental reservation. They have stepped  forward to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. And they do it because they believe in our  country. And it is really unfortunate that tonight these men and women  have been denied their promotions. We have done the best that we can to  honor the request of a fellow Senator that these nominations be brought  to the floor and voted on individually.   And I really respect men of their word. I do not respect men who do  not honor their word. We have brought forward nearly 60 nominees. Every  one of them have been denied an opportunity to move forward.   They have given more than most of us have. Certainly, they have given  more than I have in this Chamber. They have given more than Dan has  given in this Chamber. We talked about many that had over 30 years of  honorable service, and we are punishing them for what all of us here  believe to  [[Page S5308]]  be a very bad policy at the Department of Defense--a policy that they  have absolutely nothing to do with.   There are 379 nominations as of the end of October, concerning 375  general and flag officers here in the Senate for consideration. Of the  375 officers, 362 are currently impacted by a blanket hold as they wait  here on the Senate floor pending confirmation.   We gave opportunity to nearly 60 of them this evening. These military  families are in limbo. The families of 172 officers have been disrupted  by these holds. Again, these are men and women. They have families who  are being impacted. Their salaries are being impacted. Their  retirements are being impacted. They had forced cancelations of coast- to-coast moves with homes that were sold. Many of them are now living  in temporary housing and paying out of pocket for storage without any  clarity about the length of time that they will be in this hold.   Many of their children were disenrolled from current schools and-- and--again, these are innocents--they are unable to reenroll in school  or enroll in a new school since they do not have a permanent address.  And there were many spouses who had employment that was terminated.  That is a kick in the seat. I was a military spouse. I understand how  difficult it is doing those PCS moves from duty station to duty station  because your country demands it and having to start your life all over  again.   So I am going to bring up these last two nominations, and maybe we  will see a result, again, bringing the nominations individually to the  floor of the U.S. Senate to be voted on. I anticipated a man of his  word would honor his word. We haven't heard an explanation. But I will  tell you, this was not time wasted tonight. I will do this all over  again. I will do it all over again.   I am bringing forward now Capt. Frederic C. Goldhammer to be Rear  Admiral (lower half) in the U.S. Navy, under Executive Calendar No. 97.  Captain Goldhammer has a 28-year career, actually over 28 years now,  and he has held several command positions, including while deployed  aboard USS Enterprise, USS Nimitz, and USS Eisenhower, supporting  Operation Southern Watch, Joint Endeavor, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi  Freedom.   Captain Goldhammer also completed Individual Augmentee assignments as  an Air Planning Officer for the Coalition Combat Air Operations Center  in Saudi Arabia, Liaison Officer to the U.S. Army's 18th Airborne Corps  in Afghanistan, and as a Combat Search and Rescue Watch Officer for the  U.S. Navy 5th Fleet staff in Bahrain.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  for the consideration of the following nomination: Capt. Frederic C.  Goldhammer to be Rear Admiral (lower half) in the U.S. Navy,  under Executive Calendar No. 97; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.     And our final nomination this evening--so I mentioned that  I was a former military spouse, and Senator Sullivan had brought up  First Ranger Battalion. And those who have served around many of those  in the Rangers, they understand that there is a--there is a stanza of  the Ranger creed that is ``I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall  into the hands of the enemy.''   We have talked about those who have saved the lives of other men and  women in uniform. We heard about the marine who saved a life of many  other men and women in uniform and went to retrieve those who have  fallen so that they wouldn't forever be in the hands of the enemy.   We have heard about women who led the way, as well, with their  service and showing other young women that they could serve and do  great things for the Nation that has given them so much. We have heard  so many stories about heroics and combat, ``V'' for Valor, Silver Star.  We have heard brief resumes of warriors we really can't go into on the  floor of the U.S. Senate. Again, those of us who served understand why  we can't do that.   But these are people. They are human beings. They are flesh and  blood. They have done everything they possibly can and given more than  most for their country: duty and honor, their service, sacrifice for  this Nation.   And what is this body, this Nation doing to them? This will be  remembered. It is a dark evening. This will be remembered. I want to  thank them so much for their service to our country. We will continue  pressing forward because we will not leave them to fall. We will not  leave them to fall.   So, with that, I will turn the floor back over to my colleague and  thank you--oh, excuse me, I haven't completed this final nomination.    Oh, we have more. We could go all night, Dan. We have done  it before.   But I am going to move on Col. Kevin J. Merrill to be a Brigadier  General in the U.S. Air Force. Col. Kevin Merrill most recently served  as the Deputy Director of Strategic Plans, Programs and Requirements  for Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command.   Previously, Col. Merrill was the Mobilization Assistant to the  Director of Operations for the Air Force Special Operations Command,  AFSOC.   Col. Merrill conducted around-the-clock HH-60G battlefield and  medical evacuation for coalition forces during Operation Enduring  Freedom. He most certainly did not leave a man behind. He led rescue  operations in response to the aftermath of Hurricane Rita and provided  24-hour combat search-and-rescue coverage for coalition assets during  Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  Col. Kevin J. Merrill to be Brigadier General in the U.S. Air Force  under Executive Calendar No. 86; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
