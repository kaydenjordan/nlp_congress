 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Mr. Chabot; his  staff; and all the members of the Small Business Committee for working  in a bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, we continue to hear about cyber breaches and  unauthorized data collection. Cybersecurity must be our Nation's top  priority, especially as it pertains to the health of our small business  community.   The Small Business Committee has taken steps to leverage the Small  Business Administration's network of resource partners to assist in  education and development of cyber infrastructure. Clearly, we must do  more to combat rogue nation-states and cybercriminals.   The key lies in a properly trained workforce at our small business  development centers who are tasked in educating, developing, and  implementing cybersecurity measures for small companies of all kinds.   H.R. 3170, the Small Business Development Center Cyber Training Act  does this by creating a certification program at SBDCs to develop staff  who are prepared to combat cyber attacks. Therefore, I urge my  colleagues to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee  on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access.    Mr. Speaker, does the chairman have any further  speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, expanding access to a skilled cyber workforce focused on  small businesses has been a top priority for both sides of the aisle.  We cannot let our Nation's job creators go without the assistance they  need to develop, implement, and monitor their online presence.   H.R. 3170 will help boost SBDC's ability to engage and protect their  small-business clients, and, therefore, also protect the interests of  American workers and consumers.   This legislation ensures that our national efforts combating cyber  attacks can be utilized by our Nation's most vulnerable businesses. I  urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4754, the Change Order  Transparency for Federal Contractors Act.   As this body seeks ways to foster small business growth and  expansion, we must always carefully consider what is being done to  maximize entrepreneurs' participation in the Federal marketplace.   As we all know, when small companies are awarded Federal contracts,  the result is a win-win. Small businesses provide quality goods and  services at affordable prices, meaning a better deal for the government  and the taxpayer. At the same time, it can mean significant growth  opportunity for small businesses and even the need for new employees.   Yet one longstanding barrier remains to small business participation  in the Federal marketplace. The practice of contract modifications  drastically delays the payment to contractors  [[Page H3801]]  while increasing the risk they take on, and processing change orders  slows down other parts of the project, jeopardizing the ability of  contractors to meet their obligations.   All of this results in significant financial burdens on contractors,  often ending in bankruptcy. This is particularly true when liquidity is  slim and the burden of insurance and licensures is high.   H.R. 4754 provides much-needed certainty to prospective Federal  construction contractors and subcontractors so they can appropriately  plan their operations before submitting their bid for Federal work.  This level of transparency is vital to securing the survival of small  construction contractors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of the Members to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson), who is the lead cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, it is obvious that we must take this historic step in  providing transparency in the contract modification process. As we  contemplate ways to bolster our infrastructure with the goal of  employing millions, H.R. 4754 provides certainty to the many small  firms potentially involved in that process.   By requiring Federal agencies to prospectively notify contractors of  the agency processes they would be subject to if awarded a contract,  the Federal marketplace is once again attainable to small construction  contractors.   It is critical that this Congress work to remove barriers preventing  small firms from successfully performing Federal work and getting paid  for all of the work they perform.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1680, the Women's Business  Centers Improvements Act of 2018.   Small businesses are as diverse as our Nation, and the SBA  entrepreneurial development initiatives are no different.   Women's business centers, or WBCs, are a critical initiative for  female entrepreneurs. WBCs provide in-depth counseling, training, and  mentoring to small firms, resulting in substantial economic impact.   Women businessowners have used this program to develop business  plans, obtain financing, and expand their operations. As more women  turn to entrepreneurship as a career path, it is critical this  initiative remain in place to close these gaps.   Women are the fastest growing sector of entrepreneurs, and as more  women establish home-based businesses, downsize from corporate  executive positions, these centers are crucial in addressing the whole  range of women's entrepreneurial needs.   The Women's Business Centers Improvements Act builds upon their  success by creating uniformity through accreditation for WBCs and  increasing maximum grant levels to ensure they have the resources to  meet the growing demand for their services.   We all agree that women businessowners offer invaluable contributions  to our economy, so we must step up to help them, and this legislation  achieves that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Lawson), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health  and Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has over 9 million women-owned firms,  over one-third of all firms. Our economy relies heavily on women-owned  small businesses, as they generate over $1 trillion in revenues and  employ over 8 million workers. H.R. 1680 ensures that they have access  to the tools they need to succeed.   Because nearly half of aspiring women businessowners report a lack of  available mentors, we must take action to break down the barriers  hindering their success. That is why it is imperative for us to pass  this legislation today, ensuring access to mentorship and professional  guidance to the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs.   Today's measure is endorsed by the Association of Women's Business  Centers, along with other organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1702, the Small Business  Development Centers Improvement Act.   Whether it is helping to create a business plan, navigate the  procurement process, market a new product, or identify international  trade opportunities, the SBA's entrepreneurial development programs  provide an array of services to help small firms navigate obstacles,  grow, and thrive.   Entrepreneurs, therefore, significantly benefit from having tools to  identify, fiscally plan for, and maintain critical business  improvements.   Entrepreneurs located throughout the country, including in  underserved rural and inner-city communities, benefit from accessible,  affordable technical assistance. This reduces their isolation from  buyers and other businesses.   In addition to outreach, hands-on counseling is critical for  businesses to obtain information pertinent to their local market and  capacities. That is why SBDCs are so critical to our local communities.   Today's bill modernizes and strengthens the SBDC network by improving  data collection, streamlining collaboration, reducing paperwork, and  allowing additional outreach on marketing to be performed.   H.R. 1702 is a comprehensive bill providing necessary steps forward  to advance our Nation's entrepreneurial economic system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access and also a sponsor of the  bill.  [[Page H3808]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There is no question that we need to support the cornerstone of the  SBA's entrepreneurial programs, the small business development centers.  H.R. 1702 does just that by updating marketing strategies and requiring  more reporting so we can better understand the system provided to our  constituencies.   Today's bill is endorsed by America's SBDCs, an association  representing the 63 SBDC networks and their nearly 1,000 centers.   I would like to thank Representative Evans for leading this bill and  all his efforts to improve the program. I would also like to thank  Halimah Locke and Veena Srinivasa for their dedicated work on  this legislation.    I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4111, a bill that will improve access to  the Small Business Investment Company program in underserved  communities.   SBICs have assisted thousands of high-growth companies over the years  by ``filling the gap'' in the capital markets for businesses that have  outgrown the SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program but remain too small or  too risky for traditional private equity markets to bear.   SBICs operate in a unique public-private partnership with SBA. Once  managers raise enough private capital, the agency provides matching  funds which are pooled together and invested in high-growth small  businesses.   To maximize the impact of the program, it is essential that SBIC  licenses are processed in a timely fashion and also geographically  spread across the country. As it stands now, nearly three-quarters of  SBICs are located in just 10 States.   Today's bill will address these points by prioritizing those license  applications from managers that will invest in our underserved  communities.   The SBIC program has done a lot of good for the small business  community over the years. Enabling SBA to fast-track more capital into  the hands of small-business owners is a top priority for both sides of  the aisle in this committee.   I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5236, the Main Street Employee  Ownership Act, a commonsense measure to improve SBA's lending and  training programs to enable employees to purchase the companies they  work for.   As baby boomers near retirement, the country faces a substantial  dilemma: Roughly half of privately held companies are owned by baby  boomers, and fewer than 15 percent have a formal exit plan in place.  And while it is wonderful to think that family members will take over  the business, this is a relatively rare occurrence. Some will be bought  out; others will close. This will have significant secondary economic  impacts that will ripple through our local communities.   Mr. Speaker, I have been working with Senator Gillibrand's office to  help address this looming problem.   The bill before us will reward workers and invest in our Main Street  economy by improving the lending landscape for employee-owned  businesses, such as employee stock ownership plans and co-ops.   There are 7,000 such companies in existence all over the Nation,  contributing to our local communities and economies. However,  businesses seeking to transition to employee-owned status face  difficulty in obtaining adequate capital to cover the oftentimes  prohibitive costs.   The SBA was authorized to loan to ESOPs in 1979. Unfortunately, this  tool has rarely been used due to misunderstanding of the business  structure and cumbersome transition requirements.   This bill seeks to align common industry practices with SBA protocols  to encourage more lending to ESOPs and co-ops. By codifying current SBA  standards of practice and easing some burdensome guarantee  restrictions, it is my hope we will keep local enterprises in their  communities, saving jobs along the way and preventing economic  dislocation for many workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that we need to support our Main  Street small businesses, especially those that fall outside of  traditional business structures. H.R. 5236 does just that by requiring  more training and clarifying lending protocols.   Today's bill is endorsed by at least 25 organizations, including  America's SBDCs, the American Sustainable Business Council, the  Association for Enterprise Opportunity, ESCA, and a variety of co-ops  and employee-owner associations.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Justin Pelletier and Jon Cardinal  for their tireless work on this complex topic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4743, a bipartisan, bicameral  bill that will improve oversight of the 7(a) Loan Program, the SBA's  flagship lending product.   At the beginning of this Congress, our committee held a series of  hearings to take the temperature of the 7(a) program. We actively  investigated how it is being utilized, and we worked with stakeholders  to address the deficiencies that were identified.   Both lenders and the agency have said oversight could be improved and  transparency increased with legislative action. This bill is the  product of that feedback and will make long overdue reforms to the  program.   The legislation increases transparency and uniformity for both  lenders and the agency by codifying the Office of Credit Risk  Management and Lender Oversight Committee. It also requires the Office  to internally submit a budget to ensure there is justification of the  fees, salaries, and expenses used to carry out oversight functions.   We also heard that the credit elsewhere test--a bedrock of the  program--was not clear and lacked a verification component. This bill  better clarifies the credit elsewhere test and bolsters substantiation  of how it is fulfilled.   Finally, we all remember 2015, when the program ran out of authority  to lend before the end of the year. This created an artificial run on  the lenders to get loans approved, unfairly harmed small businesses  that needed credit, and ultimately required congressional intervention.   Today's bill incorporates provisions from legislation I introduced  earlier this year, empowering the Administrator to request additional  lending capacity from Congress to meet unexpected demands late in the  fiscal year.   H.R. 4743 strikes a meaningful balance between strong oversight and  protecting the interests of small businesses that need loans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in crafting H.R. 4743, the chairman and I worked closely  with our Senate counterparts, the SBA, and the lending industry.  Everyone had a seat at the table, and through debate and compromise, we  arrived at a legislative product we can all be proud of, and that, most  importantly, will help deserving small businesses access loans.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman  Chabot and Senators Risch and Cardin for their bipartisanship. And,  finally, I would like to thank our staff for working diligently on this  important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
