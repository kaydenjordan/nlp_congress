 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership. I thank the House Administration Committee, both the  chairman and ranking member. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  managing this rule.   I want to emphasize, particularly to the gentleman from Florida, for  his recitation of the number of hearings that were held, but I want to  emphasize that time is of the essence.   Right now, in many of our jurisdictions, there are local elections  going on. In just a couple of weeks or more, many will begin to engage  in either primaries or the signing up of candidates for the 2020  election. We have taken an oath to protect and serve and to uphold the  Constitution of the United States.   Everyone knows what happened in 2016. Everywhere you go, local  officials and State officials are asking us, the Federal Government:  What are you doing to protect the sanctity of the 2020 election?   There is no doubt that, in volume 1, there is clarity of the number  of Russian operatives contacting and interacting with the Trump  campaign in 2016. There is no conflict or disagreement with the bias of  those that participated, Russian operatives, in this campaign, Russian  bots.   Time is of the essence. One of the most important elements of this  bill that I applaud is the inclusion of my language in H.R. 2353, Duty  to Refuse and Report Foreign Interference in American Elections.   I don't think one American would disagree, not respecting any party  affiliation, that if an operative from another country came to you to  give you information, it is your responsibility to report it to the FBI  under the Federal election laws, which was my bill, Duty to Refuse and  Report Foreign Interference.   We don't disagree in that. I hope we don't disagree that it is  inappropriate to seek foreign assistance for a campaign, because one of  the things of the Founding Fathers that I think is very clear in the  Constitution and is very clear in the papers that surround it--the  Federalist Papers and the comments of Benjamin Franklin when the  audience was waiting, wondering whether we had a monarchy or a  republic, and he said a republic, if we can keep it--that is that this  Constitution and this process of elections was supposed to be  unfettered, one vote, one person.   That is why we have had to perfect it with the Voting Rights Act that  we are trying to reauthorize, certain aspects of it. That is why we  have written laws to protect voters and election laws wherein we  protect voters--one vote, one person.   So, I support the underlying bill, H.R. 4617, Stopping Harmful  Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy.   Remember, Benjamin Franklin said it is a republic, if we can keep it.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Rule for H.R. 4617,  the ``Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for A Lasting  Democracy Act,'' or SHIELD Act and the underlying legislation.   I support this legislation introduced by my colleague, the Chairwoman  of the Committee on House Administration, the gentlelady from  California, Chairwoman Lofgren, because it:   1. Creates a duty to report illicit offers of campaign assistance  from foreign governments and their agents;   2. Helps prevent foreign interference in future elections by  improving transparency of online political advertisements;   3. Closes loopholes that allow foreign nationals and foreign  governments to spend in U.S. elections;   4. Restricts exchange of campaign information between candidates and  foreign governments and their agents; and   5. Prohibits deceptive practices about voting procedures.   Madam Speaker, earlier this year FBI Director Christopher Wray  testified before the Congress that foreign interference in on our  democracy is ``a 365-day-a-year threat.''   This is outrageous; American elections are to be decided by  Americans.   That is why I am particularly pleased that H.R. 4617 incorporates the  key provisions of H.R. 2353, the ``Duty To Refuse And Report Foreign  Interference In Elections Act'' that I introduced in April of this  year.   Madam Speaker, our friends across the aisle voted against Republicans  voted against H.R. 1, the ``For The People Act of 2019,'' which, inter  alia, would secure our elections, and then against H.R. 2722, the  ``Securing America's Federal Elections Act'' or SAFE Act, which closes  dangerous gaps in our voting security into the 21st Century.   Today our Republican colleagues have another chance to demonstrate  that they take seriously their oath to defend the Constitution against  all enemies, foreign or domestic.   Madam Speaker, on January 6, 2017, representatives of the  Intelligence Community advised the President-Elect that the Russian  Federation conducted a sophisticated campaign to subvert our democracy  with the goal of electing Donald Trump and defeating Hillary Clinton.   The Report issued by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on March 22, 2019  revealed that the Russians effectuated their goals by selectively  disseminating stolen emails, with the end of maximizing the adverse  impact this would have on Secretary Clinton's electoral prospects.   The Mueller Report further indicated that Russia's misinformation  efforts also included the proliferation of fake online profiles on  social media platforms, with the goal of echoing and amplifying  politically divisive messages, so as to sow discord within the  electorate and suppress the vote for Secretary Clinton.   As the Mueller Report lays bare, the Trump Campaign knew what Russia  was doing and welcomed that assistance, did nothing to discourage it,  did not report it, denied its existence and knowingly and happily  accepted the benefits of the hostile foreign interference.   While some may tolerate this as awful but lawful conduct, none of the  bill's sponsors or supporters do because it is deeply corrosive of our  democracy.   In April of this year I introduced H.R. 2353, the ``Duty to Refuse  and Report Foreign Interference in American Elections Act of 2019,'' to  impose an affirmative duty to refuse any offer of election campaign  assistance from any agent or entity acting on behalf or in the interest  of a foreign government and to report to the Federal Bureau of  Investigation any such offer of assistance from an agent or entity  acting on behalf or in the interest of a foreign government.   This duty to refuse and report applies to candidates and any person  working for, or volunteering with, a candidate for election to federal  office.   The legislation also requires the Federal Election Commission to  require that a candidate for election to federal office must certify  quarterly that he or she is compliance with the above requirements on  penalty of not more than 5 years in prison and a fine of not more than  $250,000.   Madam Speaker, the threat to our country is real, as documented in  detail in the report issued by Special Counsel Mueller, confirmed by  the unanimous assessment of our nation's Intelligence Community, and  affirmed most recently by FBI Director Wray who testified in Congress  that foreign interference in on our democracy is ``a 365-day-a-year  threat.''   It is past time to write into the books of law the sensible and self- protective principle that  [[Page H8402]]  American elections are to be decided only by American citizens, and not  influenced by foreign adversaries.   I encourage all members to join me in voting to keep Americans in  control of our electoral process and elections by voting to pass H.R.  4716, the SHIELD Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York  for yielding, and I express my appreciation to the manager of our  friends on the other side of the aisle, my colleague from Arizona, and  my colleague on the Judiciary Committee.   Let me say, first of all, to Carolyn Maloney, if we go down memory  lane, we have been together on this issue from the very start. We know  when you had Debbie Smith come when she was willing to speak at a time  that, I would say, was most concerning in the early stages of this. She  was willing to come to the United States Congress and to share her  story.  [[Page H8406]]    And, Congresswoman Maloney, let me thank you for crafting the  legislation, working with any number of bipartisan cosponsors, some of  whom are no longer in the United States Congress, but I remember as a  member of the Judiciary Committee being very closely aligned and  supporting this bill. And so we have made great strides. And the over  140,000 cases that have been solved is a testament to the great need of  this legislation. There is no doubt.   And, of course, as we know from 2004--that is 15 years ago--that at  that time, and continuing to a certain extent, the enormity of the  backlog. Those of us who interact with law enforcement and interact  with our district attorneys, we know that that has been an atrocious  Achilles heel in providing comfort and justice to those who have been  violated.   I am reminded of the forensic lab that we had in Houston; we had to  do a completely massive overhaul for the Harris County lab to ensure  that we were in compliance or that we were going after the backlog.  That is the word that we should be focused on, the ``backlog.'' Backlog  means injustice or no justice.   And certainly, as I have heard stories--just as recently as last  night, I was on the phone with a constituent with a story that was just  overwhelming, and she was trying to craft her next direction.   And so this legislation is answering the pain of individuals who have  come forward--and even those who are not able to identify a person  immediately, and the DNA provides that opportunity--and it reauthorizes  the bill. It ensures that grantee states and localities prioritize DNA  analysis of crime scene samples, rape kits, other sexual assault  evidence, and also carries cases without an identified suspect.   I am glad that this bill is on the floor. But let me be very clear,  we wrote a Violence Against Women Act starting in 2017 that was a  monumental tribute to this month, in fact, which is Domestic Violence  Awareness Month.                                time  1330    We know that there are many around the Nation who have experienced  and suffered this. In fact, there was a recent trial in Houston with a  family that was killed in totality, except one member, because of  domestic violence.   We need the Violence Against Women Act. And I might take an exception  to the fact that this bill is a holistic bill. It is a law enforcement  bill. It is a bill of improving services to victims of domestic  violence and dating violence and sexual assault.    Madam Speaker, we have some very unique aspects in  that legislation. We have counseling for men and boys, something very  unique. I can't view that as controversial.   We, likewise, have extended the protection of the arm of justice to  Native American women.   And, let me just speak to law enforcement, because I speak to them  almost every weekend that I am at home: $291 million; and the  creativity of prosecutors, local prosecutors, and law enforcement is  amazing with those dollars.   So I believe that we can do both. We can continue to affirm and  complement the enormity of the work of Carolyn Maloney, the years of  work that we have worked with her and attacked the backlog, which none  of us ever want to hear or see. We want no backlog.   We hope that this bill moves in the Senate, but it is not accurate  that this bill, the Violence Against Women Act--there are active  supporters of this legislation in the Senate, and I am looking forward  to what we do best, working in a bipartisan manner to pass the Debbie  Smith DNA bill and pass, to give relief to victims of domestic violence  and others, the Violence Against Women Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask Members to vote for Debbie Smith.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of both the  Judiciary Committee and a co-sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R.  777, the ``Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019,'' which  reauthorizes the Debbie Smith Act and the Debbie Smith Backlog Grant  program for an additional five years, through FY 2024.   These grant programs to address DNA backlogs and provide DNA training  and technical assistance on local, state, and federal levels.   It is essential that these programs be reauthorized so that the  backlog of unprocessed rape kits can be reduced and then eliminated,  and perpetrators of sexual assault crimes can be prosecuted and  convicted.   There is an ever-present need to continue robust funding for programs  such as the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program in order to make  sure victims do not fall through the cracks of the system.   Women who have been raped have a right to expect police to thoroughly  investigate the case and prosecute the offenders; however, many rape  kits across the country are never even tested, and the perpetrators  never face justice.   Under the Debbie Smith Act, not less than 40 percent of the total  amount awarded in grants must be used for DNA analyses of samples from  crime scenes, rape kits and other sexual assault evidence, and in cases  that do not have an identified suspect.   Madam Speaker, the number of backlogged DNA samples was in excess of  100,000 nationwide as recently as January 2014.   H.R. 777 reauthorizes for five years (until the end of fiscal year  2024) the following programs:   1. ``Debbie Smith Reauthorization'' grants for state and local DNA  crime laboratories to address DNA backlogs and enhance their capacity.   2. DNA training and technical directed to law enforcement, courts,  forensic scientists, and corrections.   3. DNA training and technical assistance directed to sexual assault  nurse examiner/(``SANE'') programs.   In my congressional district, these grant programs have resulted in  forensic laboratories being hired to clear much of the Houston Police  Department's backlog of untested DNA benefit from this type of  legislation.   Just within the past year, decades-old rape kits that sat untested in  Houston have identified at least one-third of potential offenders in  cases where there was sufficient DNA, according to the Houston Police  Department.   In my district more than 6,600 rape kits have been cleared because of  the funding made possible by the grant programs that H.R. 777 will  reauthorize.   This record of success highlights the importance and continuing need  to provide adequate funding so law enforcement agencies can conduct  necessary DNA testing and training.   Madam Speaker, when enacted in 2004, the Debbie Smith Act was the  first piece of legislation aimed at ending the backlog of untested rape  kits and other unanalyzed DNA evidence.   Debbie Smith grants have played a critical role in states across the  country.   The importance of the Debbie Smith Act is highlighted by the fact  that delays in processing DNA evidence can result in delays  apprehending or prosecuting violent or serial offenders or it can  result in wrongfully convicted individuals serving time in prison for  crimes they did not commit.   Law enforcement has increasingly recognized that the backlog of DNA  evidence awaiting entry in state databases can prevent law enforcement  officials from solving many heinous crimes--which has made the Debbie  Smith Act recognized as such a crucial program.   Madam Speaker, the DNA Initiative is an invaluable tool for law  enforcement today, and it will continue to be a legislative priority of  mine. That is why I am pleased to co-sponsor H.R. 777 and urge my  colleagues to join me in voting to approve this critically important  legislation.   Why We Also Need the Enactment of the Entire Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act   Although the country needs the provisions of the Debbie Smith Act,  survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault need and deserve  more.   The Senate must pass the full VAWA Reauthorization, which includes:   Improving services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence,  sexual assault, and stalking;   Giving law enforcement enhanced tools to combat domestic violence and  sexual assault;   Making vital new investments in prevention;   Helping to better protect Native American women;   Preserving and improving housing protections for survivors;   Strengthening the health care system's response to domestic violence  and sexual assault.    Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   Maybe my friends have gotten a little bit of absentmindedness. This  is volume I and II of the Mueller report, a distinguished veteran of  the Vietnam war.   Page 174, volume I, it says specifically, well-documented: ``On  February 16, 2018, a Federal grand jury in the District of Columbia  returned an indictment against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian  entities--including the Internet Research Agency, IRA, and Concord  Management and Consulting LLC, Concord--with violating U.S. criminal  laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.  The indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud  the United States . . . three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire  fraud and bank fraud . . . and five defendants with aggravated identity  theft, Counts Three through Eight. Internet Research Agency Indictment.  Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One  conspiracy, entered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to  dismiss. . . . `'   They were indicted on the basis of their interference in the 2016  election.   Let me be very clear. I rise to support this legislation, grateful  that in  [[Page H8415]]  this bill is H.R. 2353. Duty to refuse or report foreign interference  was language that I had that said that you cannot accept information  from a foreign operative.   With that in mind, I thank the gentlewoman from California for her  leadership.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4617, the ``Stopping  Harmful Interference in Elections for A Lasting Democracy Act,'' or  SHIELD Act and the underlying legislation.   I support this legislation introduced by my colleague, the Chairwoman  of the Committee on House Administration, the gentlelady from  California, Chairwoman Lofgren, because it:    1.
