 Madam Speaker, recently, I had the chance  to meet with members of the Fraternal Order of Police while back home  in Pennsylvania, and the stories that they shared were shocking.   They talked about how illegal drugs, like heroin, methamphetamine,  and fentanyl, continue to be widely available on our streets.   Now, as overdose deaths continue to soar, our communities are seeing  the result of President Biden's open border policies that have allowed  these drugs to pour into our communities, bringing with them terrible  side effects that destroy our towns, our neighborhoods, and,  unfortunately, sometimes families.   It is time to do more than stand with law enforcement. It is time to  work with law enforcement and give them the tools they need to take  these drugs off of our streets.   We cannot allow our police officers to be defunded while this crisis  continues. It is time to work with law enforcement, to stand with them.  It is time to stop the drug crisis that each and every community in  America today is facing.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise today in opposition to this legislation that has been rushed  to the floor with no oversight, and without a single hearing in the  Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, the subcommittee of  jurisdiction.   It is clear that the majority is, once again, trying to score cheap  political points in the press and, in the process, the patients' and  their health outcomes have not been evaluated.   This type of political malpractice would be similar to a doctor who  prescribes a medication or recommends a surgery without doing the  evaluation of the patient, without doing the due diligence, and without  discussing the course of treatment which is best.   We cannot continue to rush to legislation without seeing the entire  picture.   As a doctor, and as a Representative, I urge my colleagues to reject  this bill and allow the committee of jurisdiction to do the work that  is necessary in order to bring effective legislation to the floor.                                time  1015
