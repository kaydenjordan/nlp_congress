 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing the retirement of one of the leaders in water policy from  the great State of Montana. Mr. Bill Mills is retiring after 57 years  as a giant in Montana's water industry and as a respected leader  nationally.   Bill retired from the Air Force in 1965 and spent the next 12 years  in the pump industry, focusing on the water business. In 1977, he  formed the 2M Company in Billings, MT, with a $10,000 loan from his  aunt and an SBA loan. His goal was to provide ``legendary'' service and  support to the water well contractors and pump installers that provide  water to homes, farms, ranches, and businesses throughout Montana. From  those humble beginnings, he formed a 14-branch operation that covered  the Rocky Mountain States and the Pacific Northwest. Bill served on the  Water System Council Board in the 1990s and was a force behind Federal  investment in programs to address rural residential and agricultural  water issues.   In 2006, Bill expanded his vision and focus globally by helping form  Water 4 Kids, an international organization that provides permanent,  safe drinking water solutions for at-risk communities. To date, Water 4  Kids International has positively impacted over 3,000,000 lives in  communities in Uganda, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Kenya, Liberia,  Rwanda, and the Philippines. In 2008, Bill was recognized as Montana's  Small Business Person of the Year.   In 2017, one of Bill's oldest and most trusted manufacturing  partners, Franklin Electric, acquired 2M and other leading water  equipment distributors around the country to form the Headwater  Companies. Bill served on Headwater's board of advisers until April of  this year.   Please join me in congratulating Bill on a remarkable career that has  positively impacted hundreds of employees, thousands of water industry  professionals and helped provide millions of people with clean,  reliable sources of water around the world.                            ____________________
