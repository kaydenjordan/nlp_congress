 Mr. Speaker, Michele Kernizan is an Air Force veteran and  a constituent of mine. After serving our country, she enrolled at  Kaplan University.   Kaplan misled Michele about her GI Bill benefits and persuaded her to  take out loans to cover tuition. They offered a so-called stipend for  books and supplies, but it wasn't a stipend. It was additional student  loans.   By the time Michele learned the truth, she had $42,654 in student  debt and no degree.   The 2016 borrower defense to repayment rule created a process to help  defrauded borrowers like Michele access student debt relief. Secretary  DeVos' rewrite guts protections for students and taxpayers in favor of  shielding bad-acting institutions from accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's CRA so veterans  like Michele have a fair process.
