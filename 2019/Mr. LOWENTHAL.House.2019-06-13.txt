 I rise today in support of this amendment to provide  protections for Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian people who came to  the United States as war refugees. I thank my colleagues, Mr. Rouda,  Mr. Correa, and Ms. Lofgren for their work on this crucial issue.   Decades ago thousands upon thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodia, and  Laotian refugees fled strife, war, and persecution in their own  countries and made America their home.   They started families, built businesses, and formed communities.   They have become part of the American tapestry--contributing to a  nation that welcomed them and is now their home.   My district is one of the most diverse in the nation, and home to  some of the largest Vietnamese and Cambodian communities outside of  both countries.   As the co-chair of both the Vietnam and Cambodia congressional  caucuses, I am intimately aware of the problems these refugees have  faced since arriving in America.   One of the most pressing problems since the current administration  took office is the deportation of members of the Vietnamese, Cambodian,  and Laotian communities across the nation.   Previous Democratic and Republican administrations put in place  safeguards to prevent these refugees from being forced to return to  countries that don't want them. These protections are now under attack  by the current administration.   These refugees fled war and persecution. America opened its arms and  accepted them. We cannot turn our backs on them now.   They are our neighbors, our friends, and our family. Often the case,  they also have spouses and children who are American citizens.   Deporting them back to countries ruled by authoritarian governments  is inhumane and will separate Americans from their loved ones.   I support this amendment to uphold and acknowledge these refugees'  contributions to our nation and to protect them from deportation.
