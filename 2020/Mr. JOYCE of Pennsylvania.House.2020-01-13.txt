 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the  many accomplishments of the Sheetz family. Their family-owned chain of  convenience stores, which began as a single storefront in Altoona,  Pennsylvania, in 1952, has grown to include more than 600 stores.   This weekend, Sheetz was recognized as one of America's favorite  restaurants. This business, which got its start in my hometown of  Altoona more than six decades ago, has received significant national  acclaim for its role as an American staple.   In addition to its business success, Sheetz is well-known for its  commitment to local communities. As a team, Sheetz employees are marked  by their commitment to community service and their dedication to local  organizations, such as Special Olympics, youth sports groups, and its  own employee-founded charity, For the Kidz.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to share a hometown with Sheetz, and  I am honored to congratulate the Sheetz family and their incredibly  hardworking team upon their achievement of being recognized as one of  America's favorite restaurants.                            ____________________
