 Mr. President, today, with our country facing an  inflation crisis, a violent crime crisis, and a functionally open  southern border, our Democratic colleagues are choosing to focus on  chilling Americans' First Amendment rights and enabling more harassment  of citizens for their private views.   Way back in 1958, the NAACP fought Alabama's attorney general, a  segregationist Democrat, all the way to the Supreme Court to defend the  bedrock American liberty of associational privacy--associational  privacy. Here is what Justice Harlan said for the majority back then:         Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many       circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of       association, particularly where a group espouses dissident       beliefs.    As the majority opinion put it, this was ``hardly a novel  exception,'' even back in 1958. And yet, for most of my career, I have  had to push back against Democrats' repeated attempts to unlearn this  fundamental constitutional lesson. I have repeatedly defended  Americans' right to join together and to voice their opinions.   Prior to McCain-Feingold, almost all money in politics ran through  candidates and party committees. I warned that placing unconstitutional  restrictions on speech in that bill was like putting a rock on Jell-O-- it wouldn't quash political speech; it would just displace it. And the  Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed that point in case after  case, upholding free speech.   Our Democratic colleagues' obsession with regulating political speech  is what created the environment they now disprove of. It is what drove  support for McCain-Feingold, and it is what spawned this perennial bill  in 2010.   Democrats want to pass a law that puts discourse in the hands of the  mob. But needless to say, they haven't always been very concerned with  compelling disclosure using laws on the books.   Existing law already requires disclosure of donations to PACs and  other outside groups with the intention of influencing Federal  elections. But even as our colleagues have introduced successive  versions of the DISCLOSE Act, enterprising activist liberals have taken  it upon themselves to name and shame conservatives by ``outing'' their  [[Page S3504]]  private contributions illegally. It was practically administration  policy during the Obama-Biden IRS.   And for those keeping score, Washington Democrats never seemed as  eager to publicize the donor rolls of groups whose political views they  happen to share. Somehow, donor privacy for organizations pursuing  liberal causes is sacrosanct, but donor privacy for groups with  conservative beliefs is a threat to democracy.   Somehow working for outside groups is practically a prerequisite for  a West Wing job under a Democratic President, but association with  groups Democrats don't like is a one-way ticket to picketing and  harassment. Sixty-four years ago, the Supreme Court said the link  between freedom of association and the freedom of speech was ``beyond  debate.'' But today's Democratic Party wants to make sure the threat to  associational privacy is every bit as real--as real--as it was in 1958.   The stakes are so clear; even liberal groups like the ACLU have  joined the NAACP and Senate Republicans in continuing to sound the  alarm--ACLU, NAACP, and Senate Republicans aligned, sounding the alarm.  They have been working together to fight State-level public disclosure  laws all the way to the Supreme Court.   Last year, the Court sided with those advocates to strike down  predatory disclosure practices out in California. Earlier this month,  the Ninth Circuit did the same to an unconstitutionally vague  disclosure law out in Montana.    Meanwhile, the Federal judiciary itself is contending with  particularly outrageous threats from the radical left to the privacy  and security of the judges themselves and their families.   The same liberal groups stoking mob intimidation outside the homes of  Supreme Court Justices are the ones most eager to put out private  citizens' political speech records.   The same Democrats who refused to condemn naked threats against  public officials earlier this summer once again want to expand the  Federal Government's power to threaten private citizens. That is not a  trade the American people or their Constitution can afford to make.
