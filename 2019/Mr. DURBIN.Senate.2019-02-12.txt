 Mr. President, today, the Senate will finish its work on  the Natural Resources Management Act. This is a bipartisan package  addressing over 100 public lands, natural resources, and water. It will  provide protection for a number of historical sites and treasured  landscapes across the country.   One of those sites is in my home State of Illinois. This lands  package would include a bill I have cosponsored with my colleague  Senator Tammy Duckworth to expand the Lincoln National Heritage Area.  It would expand the heritage area to include several areas in Central  Illinois that were a critical part of President Abraham Lincoln's life,  including the site of Lincoln's legal career within the eighth judicial  district, as well as the sites of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates.   By expanding the Lincoln Natural Heritage Area, we can give more  Illinois residents and visitors a chance to learn more about President  Lincoln's legacy to our State and Nation.   In addition, this lands package contains legislation that Senator  Orrin Hatch of Utah introduced in the last Congress to protect over  700,000 acres of land in Emery County, UT.   I have worked for many, many years to protect the stunning, fragile,  and amazing desert landscape in Utah through the Red Rock Wilderness  Act, which I have introduced and reintroduced over a period of time.  While I would like to have seen the Red Rock Wilderness Act included in  this package, Senator Hatch and I worked together to protect some of  the land covered by my bill in a bipartisan compromise that is, in  fact, included in this bill.   This lands package also contains an important tool for conservation  and recreation throughout the country, permanently reauthorizing the  Land and Water Conservation Fund, also known as LWCF.   In Illinois, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has invested more  than $213 million to protect outdoor spaces, public access to trails,  parks, and historic sites. Permanent reauthorization of this critical  program should have happened a long time ago, but I am glad we have  finally reached a bipartisan moment of achievement in passing it as  part of this legislation.   I look forward to the enactment of this legislation to protect these  important areas in Illinois and across the Nation.                        Sterigenics and Ethylene Oxide    Mr. President, there is often kind of a casual debate about  regulation and the power of government. Some basically start with the  premise that all regulation is bad, eliminating regulation is always  good, and the role of the government needs to be challenged and  questioned regularly.   I guess there is some truth in those statements, but there comes a  moment when we put things in perspective. Let me tell you that the  people who live in the community of Willowbrook in Illinois are putting  things in perspective when it comes to regulation.   Most people are not familiar with Willowbrook. It is a village west  of Chicago with a population of 9,000. It is in DuPage County, just  west of the downtown Chicago area. It is a middle-income community with  a lot of hard-working families, and many of them work hard to make sure  their kids have a better life than they do, as so many American  families do.   In the middle of this village at Willowbrook is a business known as  Sterigenics. It is a sterilization plant that uses a chemical, ethylene  oxide, to sterilize medical equipment, and they do it in great volume.   On any given day, they will be sterilizing thousands of catheters  that are being used across the country and certainly in the Midwest for  stents and for investigative medicine--absolutely essential to the  health of those who are being treated. They will approve over 1,000  surgical kits each day through their sterilization process. They put  through the sterilization process such things as knee replacements and  defibrillating devices that are implanted in people, so it is an  essential part of the medical picture in the Midwest at this moment,  but it also turns out that the chemical they are using, ethylene oxide,  is problematic, and that is where the issue of government regulation  becomes front and center.   I didn't know much about ethylene oxide. I was a liberal arts lawyer,  so I skipped all of those hard chemistry courses and tried to  understand other aspects of education. When it came to ethylene oxide,  I needed to be educated. Here is what we found.   We have learned that ethylene oxide is a dangerous toxin. It is  carcinogenic. To put it in layman's terms, it causes cancer. We learned  that ethylene oxide, a chemical in the form of gas, is more  carcinogenic to humans than we previously thought, and this facility  has been releasing ethylene oxide into the surrounding Willowbrook  community for 34 years.   Then we found out last August that the Willowbrook community is an  area with higher cancer risk due to ethylene oxide emissions from  Sterigenics, and we know that cancer-related ethylene oxide exposure  includes lymphoid cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, and others.   After we were told that this company, Sterigenics, was doing  everything it could to reduce the emissions of this carcinogenic toxic  gas and that it had installed pollution control measures, a local  television station--CBS in Chicago--revealed a few days ago through  interviews that this wasn't the case at all.   Ex-employees of Sterigenics came forward and reported to this  television station that ethylene oxide was often released directly into  the air surrounding the plant through open doors and vents, and,  instead of being directed through pollution control measures, it was  simply released.   According to these whistleblowers, employees at Sterigenics were  instructed to dump a toxic liquid byproduct of ethylene oxide called  ethylene glycol directly into the water drains that lead to the public  sewer system. Ethylene glycol is a chemical that is used in antifreeze.   Then, in the middle of last week, came a stunning revelation. We were  told by the Environmental Protection Agency--an Agency that is often  derided here in Washington by many--that the level of ethylene oxide  measured outside of the Sterigenics facility in Willowbrook, IL, was  350 times higher than what the EPA finds to be an acceptable risk and  50 times higher than what was found in the surrounding area.   Saying that the families--some of whom have lived in Willowbrook for  decades--are concerned is a dramatic understatement. Imagine for a  moment, if you will, that you have been raising a child in Willowbrook,  that your family has lived within sight of this Sterigenics plant, and  now you are learning that they were releasing this toxic gas into the  air at a level of 350 times beyond what is deemed acceptable for human  exposure. To say that the residents are concerned is a dramatic  understatement. They are demanding action, and they want answers.   For the record, this is not about Democrats making noise. This is a  bipartisan response. Dan Cronin is a friend of mine. He is the chairman  of the county board at DuPage County and a proud Republican. Both he  and Jim Durkin, who is the Republican leader of the Illinois House,  have come out publicly with the strongest possible statements about  this Sterigenics  [[Page S1183]]  emission and the danger it poses to their community. The same thing is  true for the Democratic side of public service in that county.   All of us have come out together, Democrats and Republicans, decrying  this terrible situation, this dangerous situation.   Members of this community should not have to divert time away from  their lives and their loved ones to try to research a chemical release  and to piece together answers. That is the responsibility of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency, an Agency which, sadly under this  administration, has been led by people who don't have sympathy for  families before business. They tend to lean toward the business side  before they look at the public health aspect. That is unfortunate.   The Clean Air Act was one of the first and most expansive  environmental laws ever created in the United States, but, as with most  laws, the Clean Air Act is enforced by a Federal Agency--in this case,  the Environmental Protection Agency--with broad power and authority to  act or to refuse to act.   In this case, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority  to use the new information that came off its own monitors--new  information about the concentrations and danger of ethylene oxide--to  develop new rules around the use of that chemical, including when it is  used for commercial sterilization in plants like Sterigenics. The EPA  has the authority to do this.   The EPA should quickly promulgate rules to establish safe limits for  ethylene oxide used in manufacturing and commercial sterilization. This  would protect not only the people in Willowbrook but also the people in  Gurnee and Waukegan, IL, which also have plants that use ethylene  oxide--plants that are located smack dab in the middle of these  populated communities.   Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is 4 years overdue to begin the  process of promulgating new rules for ethylene oxide commercial  sterilization. Yet when I called the Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler,  at the EPA last Friday, there didn't seem to be any sense of urgency to  take action on this issue beyond the further collection of data over  the next several weeks.   The EPA is under court order to review ethylene oxide emission  standards for manufacturing by 2020, but there is no official timeline  for commercial sterilization review--exactly what we have asked of Mr.  Wheeler and the EPA over and over again.   Waiting 1 year is unacceptable for the families who are affected by  these emissions. The health and safety of these families and their  children are at stake in this decision by the EPA. That is too long to  ask someone to wait when they sleep near this plant, work near this  plant, or take their kids to school near this plant. That is why today  I join my colleague Senator Duckworth, who has been my trusted ally in  this effort, and my colleagues in the House of Representatives,  Congressmen Schneider, Foster, Casten, and Lipinski. We are introducing  legislation requiring the EPA to promulgate these rules within 180 days  on the use of ethylene oxide in this manner. There is no excuse and no  logical explanation for delaying this kind of establishment of a rule.   But the EPA has to do a lot more than simply start a 6-month process  toward promulgating a rule for ethylene oxide. The EPA needs to treat  this matter like the public health crisis it is. Today Senator  Duckworth and I are calling on the EPA to immediately require  Sterigenics to work with an independent, third-party environmental  engineering firm to identify the source of these emissions and reduce  these emissions coming from that facility. We want a third party on the  scene. We don't trust Sterigenics to do this by themselves.   For their own credibility, they should invite a third-party  environmental engineering firm to do this work. If Sterigenics cares  about this community as much as they say they do, they shouldn't wait  for the EPA to issue an order for them to have this sort of inspection  and to make the repairs and changes necessary to protect the people in  the surrounding community. They should immediately hire an independent,  third-party expert to identify the source of the emissions and reduce  them as quickly as humanly possible.   The EPA should commit to continuous monitoring around the facility  instead of ending the monitoring as planned later this week. The EPA  should remain as a presence in this community to make sure we restore  the faith to the people living nearby that the situation is no longer  dangerous and threatening.   The EPA should commit to continuing to analyze and share the data  they collect with the public. No one should have to live in fear that  simply breathing the air around their home, their school, or their  workplace will give them cancer.   I am calling on the EPA to treat this with the urgency it deserves. I  am ready to work with them, and I am sure Senator Duckworth is as well.   Let me close by saying that there are many people who mock the EPA  and say that we would be better off if they stopped harassing  businesses like Sterigenics. Tell that to the people who live in  Willowbrook. Tell that to the people who live in Gurnee and Waukegan.  They are counting on us--those in Washington who work with the  Environmental Protection Agency--to keep this community safe for their  families. They are counting on us to understand the concern they feel  for themselves and their children. They are counting on us not to come  with bureaucratic delay but to come up with a timely response, to put  Sterigenics on the spot when it comes to the emissions that are coming  off their plant, and to put us as a government on the spot to respond  as quickly and as humanly as possible.   It is not a matter of bureaucracy; it is a matter of common sense. If  this were your family living next to this facility, would you want  business as usual, or would you want to make sure the government  responds in a timely fashion? I think the answer is obvious.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 458         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ETHYLENE OXIDE EMISSIONS STANDARDS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency (referred to in this section as the       ``Administrator'') shall amend--        (1) subparts O and FFFF of part 63 of title 40, Code of       Federal Regulations, to revise the standards for the emission       of ethylene oxide under those subparts based on the results       described in the report of the National Center  [[Page S1278]]       for Environmental Assessment of the Environmental Protection       Agency entitled ``Evaluation of the Inhalation       Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide'' and dated December 2016;       and        (2) subpart O of part 63 of title 40, Code of Federal       Regulations, to apply maximum achievable control technology       (within the meaning of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et       seq.)) requirements to chamber exhaust vents.        (b) Notification.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the       Administrator learns of a violation of the standards revised       under subsection (a), the Administrator shall notify the       public of the violation in a manner determined to be       appropriate by the Administrator.        (2) Failure to notify.--If the Administrator fails to       notify the public under paragraph (1) by the end of the       period described in that paragraph, the Inspector General of       the Environmental Protection Agency shall carry out an       investigation to determine--        (A) the reason or reasons for which the Administrator       failed to notify the public;        (B) the public health risks associated with the failure of       the Administrator to notify the public; and        (C) any steps the Administrator should take to ensure the       Administrator meets the requirements described in paragraph       (1) in the future.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr.          Perdue, Mr. Jones, Mr. Wicker, Ms. Harris, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr.          Kaine, Mrs. Hyde-Smith, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Booker,          Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Braun):   S. 461. A bill to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of  historically Black colleges and universities through robust public- sector, private-sector, and community partnerships and engagement, and  for other purposes; considered and passed.                                   S. 461         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``HBCU Propelling Agency       Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act''       or the ``HBCU PARTNERS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) As many colleges and universities across the country       kept their doors closed to African American applicants,       historically Black colleges and universities (referred to in       this section as ``HBCUs'') played a central role in ensuring       that African Americans could attain an excellent education.        (2) Today, HBCUs continue to play a critical role in       ensuring that African Americans, and those of all races, can       access high-quality educational opportunities.        (3) HBCUs enroll nearly 300,000 students, an estimated 70       percent of whom come from low-income backgrounds and 80       percent of whom are African American.        (4) According to the National Association For Equal       Opportunity In Higher Education, HBCUs make up just 3 percent       of American institutions of higher education but serve more       than a fifth of African American college students.        (5) A March 2017 report from the Education Trust concluded       that HBCUs have higher completion rates for African American       students than other institutions serving similar student       populations.        (6) In 2014, HBCUs generated a total direct economic impact       of $14,800,000,000 and created more than 134,000 jobs,       according to a study commissioned by the United Negro College       Fund (referred to in this section as ``UNCF'').        (7) According to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund       (referred to in this section as ``TMCF''), 40 percent of       African American Members of Congress, 50 percent of African       American lawyers, and 80 percent of African American judges       are graduates of HBCUs.        (8) According to UNCF, in 2013, HBCUs awarded a quarter of       all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics       bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans.        (9) According to TMCF, approximately 9 percent of all       African American college students attend HBCUs.        (10) According to UNCF, African American graduates of HBCUs       are almost twice as likely as African Americans who graduated       from other institutions to report that their university       prepared them well for life.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to strengthen the capacity and competitiveness of HBCUs       to fulfill their principal mission of equalizing educational       opportunity, as described in section 301(b) of the Higher       Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1051(b));        (2) to align HBCUs with the educational and economic       competitiveness priorities of the United States;        (3) to provide students enrolled at HBCUs with the highest       quality educational and economic opportunities;        (4) to bolster and facilitate productive interactions       between HBCUs and Federal agencies; and        (5) to encourage HBCU participation in and benefit from       Federal programs, grants, contracts, and cooperative       agreements.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

A bill to require the treatment of a lapse in appropriations  as a mitigating condition when assessing financial considerations for  security clearances, and for other purposes; read the first time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 458         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ETHYLENE OXIDE EMISSIONS STANDARDS.
