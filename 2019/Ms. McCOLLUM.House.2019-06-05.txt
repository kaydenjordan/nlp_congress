 Madam Speaker, there are more than 9,800 local  recycling programs following different standards in the United States.  There is no coordination.   Cities and counties are struggling, and recycling is at risk of  collapsing. Increasingly, recyclable plastics and papers are going to  landfills and incinerators, and poisoning our oceans and waterways.   It is time for a national recycling strategy to harmonize standards  across the country, strengthen markets, and reduce contamination in the  recycling system.   Leadership is needed from Congress to work with stakeholders to make  recycling environmentally and economically sustainable.   For example, it is time for a standardized national system of  labeling. Every household, business, school, park, and stadium should  be using a universal, standardized labeling system that reduces  contamination in the recycling stream and enhances the market viability  of recyclable materials.   As citizens and consumers, Americans want recycling to work. It is  time for Washington to get to work to make recycling work.                            ____________________
