 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to House  Republicans' lack of good faith negotiations to avoid a devastating  default on our Nation's debt.   The Congressional Budget Office shows that extending the Trump tax  cuts would add $3.5 trillion to the deficit. Yet, House Republican  leaders have introduced legislation to make these tax cuts for the rich  permanent and increase the Federal deficit, while at the same time they  are holding our economy hostage by demanding disastrous funding cuts to  air traffic and rail safety.   As we approach Memorial Day, Republicans are breaking the promise to  our veterans.   President Biden already lowered the deficit by $1.7 trillion. His  budget would cut the deficit by another $3 trillion by eliminating  wasteful spending on Big Oil and Big Pharma, closing tax loopholes for  corporations, and ensuring everyone pay their fair share.   House Republicans created this crisis, and they can prevent this  devastating default.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  report from the Senate Committee on the Budget.
