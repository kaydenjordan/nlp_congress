 Mr. Speaker, hard work pays off. Rasul Douglas, a graduate  of East Orange Campus High School in East Orange, New Jersey, is now a  cornerback for the Philadelphia Eagles. This Sunday he will play in the  Super Bowl.   Rasul is one of seven siblings raised by his grandmother. He spent  his first 2 years of college at Nassau Community College where he  trekked 50 miles from home to class and practice every day, slept on  the floor, and sometimes went hungry in pursuit of his dream.   Rasul transferred to West Virginia University and was then selected  by the Eagles in the third round of the 2017 NFL draft.   Mr. Speaker, Rasul Douglas' success is a testament to how far a good  work ethic can take you. Rasul is a shining star for young people in my  district. Even a Giants fan like me can recognize talent like his.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Rasul and the Eagles good luck in  this weekend's Super Bowl.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Congressman Scott for  hosting tonight's Special Order hour and his continual dedication to  making sure that working families are represented by his great  leadership.   Tonight, the Janus-Council 31 case and the value of unions is what we  are here to speak about. As we hold this Special Order hour, there are  efforts across the country working to trample workers' rights. The  Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, aims to take away the freedom and  the opportunity for working people to join together and strong unions  to speak up for them, their families, and their communities.                                time  2100    Any effort that threatens to undermine public sector collective  bargaining rights is an attack on working people and their ability to  negotiate with a strong voice in their workplace. We must be unwavering  in our support of workers' rights.   Over the decades, unions were vital in our communities, particularly  for women and communities of color. African-American women in unions  earn an average of $21.90 an hour, while nonunion women earn $17.04 an  hour. In addition, more than 72 percent of women in unions have health  insurance, while less than 50 percent of nonunion African-American  women do. The important work that unions do every day is improving our  economy and the lives of countless working families in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I had much more to say, but in the interest of time, I  will say I know how important it is to be represented. I, in my working  career, have been in two labor unions myself, and I worked at a company  and was fired. My uncle fired me. My father was the hearing officer  against me, and my grandfather was the witness against me. Mr. Speaker,  I know how important it is to be represented because the union got my  job back.   Thank you, Congressman Scott, for hosting tonight's Special Order  Hour on the Janus case, Council 31, and the Value of Unions.   As we hold this special order hour, there are efforts across the  country working to trample workers' rights.   The Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, aims to take away the  freedom and opportunity for working people to join together in strong  unions to speak up for themselves, their families and their  communities.   Any effort that threatens to undermine public sectors collective  bargaining rights is an attack on working people and their ability to  negotiate with a strong voice in their workplace. We must be unwavering  in our support of workers' rights.   Over the decades, unions were vital in our communities, particularly  for women and communities of color. African-American women in unions  earn an average of $21.90 an hour while nonunion women earn $17.04. In  addition, more than 72 percent of women in unions have health  insurance, while less than 50 percent of nonunion African-American  women do.   The important work that unions do every day is improving our economy  and the lives of countless working families across this country.   For example, in New Jersey, unions are helping train the next  generation of health care professionals. To address New Jersey's  nursing shortage, the AFSCME Local 1199J developed a system for union  members to develop and maintain the skills needed for career  advancement in nursing.   The union also supports programs like the Youth Transitions to Work  Certified Nursing Apprenticeship, which helps prepare Newark-area high  school juniors and seniors as they start a career in nursing.   As you can see, unions and strong union membership fill the gaps when  others drop the ball. Janus is the culmination of decades of attacks on  working people by corporations, the wealthiest one percent, and hostile  politicians. This right-wing attack against the middle class must not  stand.   The forces behind this case are the same forces that have pushed for  limiting voting rights, attacked immigrants, and undermined civil  rights protections.   In fact, this is the third instance where the Trump Solicitor  General's office is reversing that office's position, seriously  jeopardizing the Department of Justice's reputation before the court  and undermining the rule of law.   It is undeniable that unions have played a critical role in building  and protecting the middle class in America.   Unions provide hard working people economic stability and give them  the tools to build a good life, home, and education for themselves and  their children. We must stand together to ensure that America has  strong labor protections that work for everyone.
