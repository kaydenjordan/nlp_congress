 Mr. Speaker, I have long called for  Congress to take meaningful action to lower prescription drug costs by  allowing the direct negotiation of prescription drug prices by  Medicare.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, and I  am pleased to see it includes my legislation, the Respond Now Act, as  the basis for much needed funding to combat the opioid epidemic.   H.R. 3 provides $10 billion in direct funding, including investments  directly into our communities who are the front lines of this epidemic.  [[Page H10033]]    I am also grateful to see that H.R. 3 includes funding to support  children impacted by this crisis, so that they can access trauma- informed practices in schools.   I thank the Speaker for the inclusion of this critical funding to  help Granite State families and communities across this country. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.                            ____________________
