 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on the  Pro-Life Caucus.   Only 52 years ago, abortion was illegal in this country, just as it  was largely illegal throughout our country's history. It was illegal  before ultrasounds which made it so clear to everybody what was in the  womb. It was illegal when medical care was a fraction of what it is  today. It was illegal when families lived without electricity or  running water.   Despite these hardships, the public knew abortion should be illegal.   How have we responded to our material blessings? How have we  responded to these abortions? By saying that we cannot afford these  children.   I would like to thank Donald Trump for reinstating the Mexico City  policy. I would like to thank him for allowing States to not fund  Planned Parenthood with their title X funds. I would like to thank him  for defunding the United Nations Population Fund. I would like to thank  the March for Life people for coming up here this year and reminding  Americans about this important cause.   I hope that the American citizens stop and think: if abortion could  be illegal only 52 years ago in this country before we had ultrasounds,  if abortion could be illegal in the 1800s with minimal medical care  when people were living six or seven people in a room in a house  without air conditioning and without heat, then how did these people  keep abortion illegal and how do we respond to our blessings by saying  that we have to have one of the most liberal abortion laws in the  country?   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is the chairman of the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee.
