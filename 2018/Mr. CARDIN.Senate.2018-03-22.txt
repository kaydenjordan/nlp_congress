 Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the recent death  of my friend and colleague, Representative Louise Slaughter. We served  together in the House of Representatives and on the Helsinki  Commission, which monitors human rights commitments across the globe.  Her time on the Commission is one of the many examples of her  unwavering commitment to justice and human dignity.   Louise first became interested in the Helsinki Commission's work in  the early 1990s when she joined congressional efforts to address the  mass rape of women and girls as a deliberate and systematic part of the  ethnic cleansing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In her calls for  justice, she worked to ensure that rape wouldn't be considered as  unfortunate violence incidental to conflict, but as a war crime and  crime against humanity to be prosecuted as such. Her commitment to  peace, justice, and reconciliation in Bosnia and the Balkans extended  well beyond the period of conflict. In 2009, she joined a Helsinki  Commission delegation I led to Sarajevo, where she championed the  efforts of university students who saw the politics of ethnicity and  nationalism--and the corruption it perpetuates--as denying them  opportunities for a brighter future in a more prosperous Bosnia. She  also worked to ensure those guilty of war crimes in the former  Yugoslavia were prosecuted and to provide humanitarian relief to  victims of the conflict.   As part of her efforts to promote human rights around the world, we  traveled together on a commission delegation to Greece in 1998 to  advance the rights of Roma, Europe's largest ethnic minority population  that historically faced persecution, were the victims of genocide  during the Second World War, and continue to face disproportionate  levels of racism and discrimination to this day.   Few other Members of Congress, House or Senate, matched her ongoing  and effective engagement. During her time on the Helsinki Commission,  Louise represented the United States at numerous meetings of the  Organization for Security and Co-operation In Europe, OSCE,  Parliamentary Assembly, an interparliamentary body which has encouraged  diplomats to focus on issues of concern and importance to the United  States, especially human rights and fundamental freedoms. From 1993 to  2010, she participated in more than a dozen assembly meetings as a  member of U.S. delegations, helping to show the depth of our country's  commitment to transatlantic relations.   Louise was born in Kentucky. Her father was a blacksmith for a coal  mine. She had a sister who died of pneumonia as a child, which impelled  Louise to pursue degrees in microbiology and public health at the  University of Kentucky. She moved to New York to work for Procter &  Gamble and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1982 and then  to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986. We were House freshmen  together. She coauthored the Violence Against Women Act--VAWA--secured  funding for breast cancer research, and was responsible for  establishing an office of research on women's health at the National  Institutes of Health, NIH. In 2007, she became the first woman in U.S.  history to chair the House Committee on Rules.   Louise was legendary in the Rochester area as her constituents know  well. Her background as a microbiologist shaped her priorities in  securing infrastructure upgrades, research funding for local  universities, and bringing two manufacturing institutes to the area.  She most recently secured funding for Rochester's new Amtrak station,  which is rightfully being renamed in her memory.   Louise was universally respected, and it has been an honor to call  her a friend and colleague, as well as to have served on the Helsinki  Commission with her for two decades. My thoughts and prayers go out to  her children and the rest of her family, friends, and constituents  during this difficult time. She had an extraordinary life and her  myriad accomplishments on behalf of her constituents, other New  Yorkers, all Americans, and indeed all of humanity secure her legacy  and are a wonderful testament of her commitment to public service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to  congratulate J. Michael ``Mike'' Nussman, who is retiring next week  from the American Sportfishing Association, ASA, the trade association  that represents the recreational fishing industry. Mr. Nussman joined  the ASA's government relations team in 1992 and became president and  chief executive office of the association in 2001. I am proud to call  him a fellow Marylander.   Sportfishing provides outdoor recreation for more than 47 million  Americans each year. In Maryland, we are blessed with some of the best  fishing opportunities in the Nation. From fishing for striped bass-- ``rockfish''--on the Chesapeake Bay, to fly fishing for trout on the  Gunpowder, to fishing for smallmouth bass on the Potomac, we have great  waters and angling throughout our State. Whether casting for yellow  perch and pickerel on the Eastern Shore or trolling for tuna and white  marlin off Ocean City, fishing in Maryland provides opportunities for  young people and families to get into the great outdoors and enjoy our  public lands and waters.   Like many other outdoor industries, sport fishing is sometimes  overlooked as a significant job generator and economic engine. The U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that, nationwide,  [[Page S1943]]  recreational fishing generates $48 billion in retail sales, $115  billion in total economic activity, and 828,000 jobs. In 2016, Congress  passed the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act. Because of  that legislation, in 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of  Economic Analysis included outdoor recreation's impact, including  fishing and boating, in our Nation's gross domestic product, GDP, for  the first time.   Possibly the most important aspect of recreational fishing is that  sportfishing manufacturers, anglers, and boaters pay for most of State  fish and wildlife agencies' fisheries conservation and boating  programs. Through special Federal excise and fishing license sales,  anglers and boaters are providing more than $1.2 billion each year in  funds that are allocated to the States   Much of this progress is due to the leadership of Mr. Nussman, who  hails from Crownsville, MD. While ASA has been a trade association  since 1933, it has really been in the past 25 years--a period that  coincides with his tenure--that the organization has assumed more of a  leadership role in the angling community.   With the support of ASA, the aforementioned excise taxes have been  expanded to cover programs such as wetlands restoration, boating safety  and infrastructure, and the establishment of the Recreational Boating &  Fishing Foundation, RBFF. In fact, Mike Nussman led the effort to  establish RBFF to turn around a decline in recreational fishing  participation, which started to appear in the 1990s. The most recent  data indicate an upward trend in recreational fishing, including among  more diverse and urban communities.   Mr. Nussman's success should come as no surprise. He worked for the  Senate Commerce Committee and then-Chairman Fritz Hollings of South  Carolina. Mr. Nussman was the lead professional staff member for the  subcommittee that oversees fisheries policy, the National Ocean and  Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Prior to  that, Mr. Nussman worked for the South Carolina Sea Grant Program,  earning undergraduate and graduate degrees in science, and an MBA from  the University of South Carolina.   Mr. Nussman's tenure at the ASA also has improved the organization's  business operations. The sportfishing industry's annual trade show is  now the largest in the world. His leadership has made the organization  financially strong, helping it weather economic downturns. He has also  served on numerous boards of directors and advisory groups, from the  Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership to the Blue Ribbon Panel on  Sustaining America's Diverse Fish and Wildlife Resources. He has served  as a U.S. Commissioner on the International Commission for the  Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.   Trade associations serve a unique role by allowing companies in the  same industry to come together to express their views on issues  affecting the entire industry. They are an important segment of our  U.S. private sector and provide a legal, accepted mechanism to allow  small and large companies in an industry to have a common voice when  working with the Congress, the Executive, the States, and local  governments. When Mr. Nussman joined the ASA, he brought special  expertise as a former Senate staffer to the recreational fishing  industry and conservation communities. So upon the occasion of his  retirement, I think it appropriate that he be recognized and  congratulated today for a job well done. Anglers and sportfishing- related businesses in Maryland and across our Nation can be thankful  that he has been at the ASA helm.   I wish him all the best as he begins the next chapter in his life  which will include, presumably, even more time for fishing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate's  attention to Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Fairness  Act of 2018, the common sense legislation I am introducing with the  junior Senator from Maryland today. This legislation seeks to eliminate  a barrier that potential college students with difficult personal and  financial circumstances face when applying for Federal financial aid.   This body has worked to improve the college application process for  students and their families over the last several years and  successfully lobbied the Department of Education to allow students and  their families to submit their FAFSA application in October and utilize  prior-prior year tax data. These changes provide future college  students and their families with several months to submit their  financial information instead of a short time frame between January and  February to meet State and institutional based deadlines for need- and  merit-based financial aid programs. These steps have made it easier to  students to sit with their families and make informed financial  decisions on which college or university will provide the student with  the highest quality yet least expensive college education.   Despite our work, a number of our students are being left behind and  cannot take advantage of these changes. Those students, who face  difficult personal and financial situations, including those who have  left home due to abusive family environments, have parents who are  incarcerated, or are unable to locate their parents are unable to fill  out the FAFSA application. Rather than fill out one universal Federal  financial aid application form, a potential college student must  contact each institution they are applying to and undergo a  ``dependency override'' process before a college or university will put  together an estimated financial aid package for the student. Under this  process, a student applying to one university in my state must submit  nine different pieces of financial information, personal statement, and  references in order to verify their independent status. These students,  often first generation students unfamiliar with the process for  applying to school, may give up on the dependency override process and  fail to finish the college application process or leave significant  Federal financial aid on the table.   The FAFSA Fairness Act would seek to correct this inequity for some  of our most vulnerable students. If enacted, my legislation would allow  students in these difficult personal and financial circumstances to  fill out a FAFSA as a ``provisional independent'' student that colleges  and universities would be able to provide those students with an  initial financial aid award package. Once the student has had the  opportunity to review the financial aid award packages from the schools  they applied to and selected the school of their choice, that school's  financial aid administrators will work with the student to complete the  ``dependency override'' process and finalize the student's financial  aid award package.   I'm proud to lead the Senate efforts with my seatmate from Maryland  and appreciate the work of my colleague from Maryland's 7th  Congressional District to lead this effort in the House of  Representatives. I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to help  students achieve their dream of higher education despite their  difficult family and financial circumstances.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint  resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was  ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2596         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
