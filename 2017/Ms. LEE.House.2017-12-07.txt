 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm against the  Federal Communications Commission's misguided proposal to repeal net  neutrality rules.   Now, let me be clear. Net neutrality rules protect Americans' access  to an open, free, and fair internet. The rules prevent internet  companies from blocking websites or slowing down their load time simply  because they disagree with what the website says. Repealing them would  be undemocratic and very dangerous.   What is worse, we know that gutting net neutrality would have a  detrimental impact on communities of color. From entrepreneurs to  social justice advocates, the internet has been a powerful tool for  communities of color to help draw attention to injustices in our  society.   This new proposal will essentially kill this free expression and  innovation. This is ridiculous. We can't allow democracy and access to  the internet to be restricted in the name of corporate profits.   I urge the FCC to reject this plan and stand with the vast majority  of Americans who want to keep the internet open and free.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentlewoman for  yielding time to me and also for her tremendous leadership on so many  issues, especially on the Rules Committee.   As a members of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I rise in  strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill, H.J. Res. 123,  the fiscal year 2017 continuing resolution.   This bill kicks the can down the road for 2 weeks just so Republicans  can continue focusing on the greatest tax scam in history.   As Ranking Member Lowey has said: What do Republicans think that they  can accomplish in the next 2 weeks that they haven't accomplished in  the last 2 months?   Well, I say: Except, of course, trying to give tax breaks to their  wealthy donors, millionaires, billionaires, and corporations, and  raising taxes on middle-income and low-income families. That is what  this is about.   This reckless, short-term resolution ignores many of our critical  year-end priorities, like passing a clean Dream Act, a temporary  protective status provision we need in the CR; raising budgetary caps;  and emergency disaster funding for hurricanes and wildfires, children's  health insurance programs, and community health centers. I could go on  and on. That is what we should be debating and what should be in this  resolution. Now is not the time for Congress to be asleep at the wheel.  We need action, Mr. Speaker, and we need it now.   Despite the fact that Republicans control the House, the Senate, and  the White House, once again, they refuse to do their job. It is so  wrong to string people and communities out not knowing whether their  government will function or stay open.   How irresponsible can you get?   We need to fully fund the government. Across the country, millions of  people are living on the edge. Forty million Americans are living in  poverty. Millions more are struggling to put food on the table and keep  a roof over their head.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). The time of the gentlewoman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. We are passing a short- term funding bill that underfunds education and workforce training at a  time that Americans need it the most.   Instead, once again, what are they doing?   They are taking time to give tax cuts to corporations to send jobs  overseas.   The American people expect us to create jobs, to strengthen our  economy, to provide a basic standard of living for all. With sequester  cuts looming, it is past time that we focus on our spending here at  home and stop these increases to a bloated military budget, which  really does nothing for our national security.   Instead of bringing our Nation to the brink of self-inflicted crisis,  Republicans should work with us to meet the needs of our Nation and a  strong national security, which requires resisting these cuts to our  State Department and to our foreign assistance. Unfortunately, this 2- week continuing resolution does just the opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and  ``no'' on the underlying bill, and let's do our job. Let's do what the  American people expect us to do, and that is to fully fund  [[Page H9727]]  the government and look out for them in terms of not giving tax cuts to  millionaires and billionaires and raising their taxes, because they  deserve better from us.
