 Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my friend  and colleague from South Dakota to oppose the Democrats' reckless tax- and-spending spree.   There are 18 days left until Christmas. So who is on the Democrats'  shopping list this year?   Well, it is the same people who are on the list every year: illegal  immigrants, union bosses, professional activists, and the donor class  of millionaires.   In the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending bill, they all get big  presents from the government. The rest of America gets more spending,  more taxes, more debt, and higher prices as they are already struggling  and suffering under the largest, highest inflation in the last 30  years.   Democrats call the bill Build Back Better. For most Americans, it is  a break-your-back bill.   In this bill, Chuck Schumer's hometown will get tens of billions of  dollars to bail out their public housing authority.   Joe Biden likes to say, if you want to know somebody's values, he  says, look at their budget.   Well, let's look at the budget that the Democrats are putting forth,  because the second most expensive item in this bill is a tax break for  millionaires and billionaires in New York, in New Jersey, in  California, and in Chicago.   The cost of that sole component: $275 billion, which will have to be  paid by the hard-working men and women in this country.   This is one of the bill's top expenses because it is a top priority  for Democrat elites. Under the Democrats' bill, the bottom 60 percent  of Americans would get zero of those dollars; $275 billion to the  richest of the rich.   In 2016, nearly half of the money went to just four States:  California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey.   Rural States like Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and  West Virginia received the lowest amounts of tax relief. Democrats want  the people in States like Wyoming and West Virginia to pay for these  tax cuts for the millionaires of California and New York.   Under this legislation, low-tax States would essentially subsidize  high-tax States. What is this going to do to the high-tax States? Well,  it will encourage them to raise State taxes, which is probably another  reason that Democrats support it.   Democrats also have lots of Christmas presents in this bill for  people who come to this country illegally. The Parliamentarian said  Democrats can't pass amnesty for illegal immigrants in a previous  version of the bill, but Democrats want illegal amnesty so badly that  they are going to try all over again.   Let me remind you: This is a spending bill; it is not an immigration  bill. Democrats know that they don't have the votes to pass the  immigration bill that they would like to see. Frankly, they know they  will never have enough votes in the Senate for an amnesty bill for  illegal immigrants. So they are trying to cram it into a spending bill.  Democrats are hoping that the American people won't notice.   If Democrats have their way, this spending spree would be the most  consequential immigration bill in half a century. The bill would give  amnesty to 6\1/2\ million people in the country illegally. It would  also give them five new entitlements.   The bill includes new permanent welfare programs. There would be no  work requirements--not a single one--and no citizenship requirements.  This includes free childcare, free preschool, and even free money for  college. Now, this is in addition to the $300 check every month for  every child Democrats already send to illegal immigrants that they have  sent earlier this year.   So it is shaping up to be a long December for American workers and  taxpayers, and people know it because we already had the most expensive  Thanksgiving ever.   On Friday, we saw one of the most disappointing jobs reports in a  disappointing year. The jobs report says we created less than half the  number of jobs that the experts predicted we would produce last month.  Still, there are almost 4 million fewer Americans working than before  the pandemic. At the same time, inflation is only getting worse.   People in all our States are wondering if they are going to be able  to afford to have presents under the tree this year; wondering if they  can afford a tree at all because, of course, the cost of Christmas  trees are up 30 percent--30 percent more this year than last.   More and more Americans find they are heading to shop at the dollar  stores. Yet many dollar stores, you have seen in the press, aren't  dollar stores anymore. Dollar Tree is selling more and more items for  $1.25. Dollar General is opening new stores with a $5-or-less business  model. Prices are going up everywhere you look.   One of the reasons for inflation in Joe Biden's economy is the rise  in cost of energy. Natural gas is at a 7-year high. Winter is almost  here, and prices are up dramatically. The price of gas at the pump is  at a 7-year high as well. Yet Biden and the Democrats say everything is  fine.   It is just fascinating. Last week, the Democrats' headquarters sent  out a  [[Page S8943]]  tweet. It was a graph showing gas prices had dropped by 2 cents over a  week. The caption was ``Thanks, Joe Biden.'' I actually thought it was  a joke. It was serious. They actually said: Hey, good, the price of gas  is up $1.25 since he took office, but it dropped 2 cents last week, and  let's celebrate the success of Joe Biden.   This is just another example of Democrats' bad math. It is an example  also of Democratic leaders who are completely out of touch. Gas is up  $1.25 a gallon since Joe Biden took office. A 2-cent drop is hardly  enough.   So here is my 2 cents' worth: The American people don't want pennies  from Joe Biden; they want a refund from the last election. That is what  they deserve. They want affordable, available, reliable American  energy.   Joe Biden said last week:         I have used every tool . . . to address price increases.    On the contrary. President Biden has used every tool to drive up  prices. He has attacked American energy. He has driven up costs for all  Americans. He has shut down the Keystone Pipeline. He is threatening  other pipelines. He has blocked oil and gas leases on Federal land. He  has threatened to raise taxes on the production of natural gas. We are  now producing about 2 million barrels of oil a day less than before the  pandemic.   The Secretary of Transportation thinks he has a simple solution to  the energy crisis. This is what Pete Buttigieg said. He said it is  easy. He said last week that families who buy electric cars ``never  have to worry about gas prices again.'' Well, it is simply false. You  would think somebody as educated as the Secretary of Transportation  would intuitively say: Gas prices affect grocery prices. Gas prices  affect retail prices and the price of just about everything else.   Look, even for the Biden administration, this is really out of touch  with mainstream America or people who live anywhere outside the bubble  of the beltway. People who are struggling with inflation can't afford  to go out and buy an electric vehicle. Seniors and families just  starting out aren't going to go out and buy an $80,000 electric  vehicle.   We know who buys these luxury vehicles. More than 80 percent of the  Federal subsidies for electric vehicles go to people making more than  $100,000 a year, and, unlike the rest of the people on the roads, these  drivers use the roads for free. Yet Democrats make sure to include  electric vehicle owners on their shopping list this year.   This bill would give $12,500--$12,500--to couples making up to half a  million dollars a year if they buy a luxury electric vehicle. This  includes vans, SUVs, and trucks costing up to $80,000. The bill also  includes $900 payouts to people who buy electric bicycles.   It has already been a long December for the American people, and we  are only at December 7. Yet it must be an exciting time for the  Democrats' favorite groups. Democrats have always liked to play Santa  Claus, and this year, they have a list of who they consider America's  good little boys and girls. Who is on the list? Well, as I said a few  minutes ago, it is illegal immigrants, union bosses, professional  activists, and the millionaires who live in the penthouses of New York  and the mansions of San Francisco and Hollywood. Working-class, Middle  America, those families--they are the ones who are going to get stuck  with the bill.   I yield the floor.
