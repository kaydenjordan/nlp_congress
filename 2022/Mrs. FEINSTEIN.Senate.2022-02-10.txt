 Madam President, I was proud to support and cosponsor  S. 2342, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual  Harassment Act of 2021. This bill is critically important in supporting  survivors who have experienced sexual assault and sexual harassment in  the workplace.   Forced arbitration clauses have become increasingly common in  employment contracts. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 56.2  percent of private sector, nonunion workers are subject to forced  arbitration. That means approximately 60 million workers in the United  States are denied the right to have their employment cases heard by a  court.   When it comes to matters of sexual assault and sexual harassment,  forced arbitration clauses protect predators and prevent survivors from  seeking justice in the courts for the wrongs they have experienced.   This practice of forced arbitration is deeply concerning. Employees  are often not aware that their employment contracts contain arbitration  clauses, and they often do not understand their effect. Scholars have  estimated that 98 percent of workers will abandon their legal claims  instead of pursuing them through the arbitration process. Employees who  choose to arbitrate are then forced to use company-appointed  arbitrators and are not able to appeal the decisions.   Even more troubling, forced arbitration clauses have been used to  silence survivors of workplace sexual assault and sexual harassment,  and that is unacceptable.   This bill will help protect the rights of survivors by allowing  courts to invalidate forced arbitration clauses when the case involves  sexual assault or harassment. This will ensure that survivors can bring  their claims in court if they choose to do so.   I am proud to cosponsor this bipartisan bill, and I am happy to see  my colleagues overwhelmingly support it on the floor today.                            ____________________
