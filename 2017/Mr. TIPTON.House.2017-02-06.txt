 Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my thanks to my  colleagues, Mr. Polis and Mr. Lamborn. I think among our three  congressional districts, we hold the vast majority of public lands in  the State of Colorado. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to work  with you on these significant bills, to be able to address many of the  challenges that we have, and to be able to work together in a  bipartisan manner as well.    Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me time to be able to discuss  this important legislation. H.R. 698 is a very straightforward bill,  which Congressmen Lamborn and Polis and I have reintroduced this year  that confirms private ownership of 148 acres of land in my  congressional district.   The lands concerned were patented into private ownership via the  United States land patents issued in 1914, 1917, and 1957, but their  ownership came into question by virtue of a 1949 government  [[Page H983]]  survey which erroneously showed them to be National Forest land rather  than private land. A long-held U.S. law specifically states that a  government resurvey cannot take away private property or private  property rights.   Mr. Speaker, the Forest Service and the private landowner of the  Elkhorn Ranch only became aware of the potential title issue in the  early 2000s, and thereafter, the Forest Service conducted a lengthy and  thorough review of the matter. Upon completion of their review in 2014,  both the supervisor and the surveyor of the White River National Forest  concluded the ownership of the 148 acres should be confirmed in the  successors in interest to the original patentee; namely, the Elkhorn  Ranch.   In reaching this conclusion, the Forest Service noted that the land  has never been managed as National Forest land and, indeed, has been  fenced and occupied with stock ponds, developed springs, roads and  other private improvements, and has been used as private land for  ranching and agriculture for the better part of the past 100 years.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a simple matter of fairness and equity to a  private landowner to honor government land patents that were granted by  the Federal Government to the landowner's predecessors 60 to 100 years  ago. The bill is supported by both the surveyor and supervisor of the  White River National Forest; the Garfield County surveyor; the Garfield  County Commissioner; the city of Rifle; Colorado Club 20, which  represents 20 Colorado counties; and Piceance Energy, which has a lease  on part of the area.                                time  1700    In addition, the legislative hearing that was held on the same bill  in 2015, the administration testified that this bill is a practical and  workable way to address this longstanding issue. This bill is identical  to the one that passed out of the House by voice vote in the last  Congress, and I once again urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Once again, I extend my thanks to my colleagues Congressman Lamborn  and Congressman Polis for all of their hard work on this legislation.
