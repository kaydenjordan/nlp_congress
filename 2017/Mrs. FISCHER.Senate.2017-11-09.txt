 Madam President, I rise today to share my strong  support  [[Page S7139]]  for Steve Grasz, who has been nominated by President Trump to fill a  vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The junior  Senator from Nebraska and I asked Nebraskans to express their interest  in this position, and we conducted a thorough process of the  applicants. I must say that, with more than 5,700 lawyers, Nebraska  proved itself to have a talented legal community that has demonstrated  an unwavering dedication to the rule of law.   However, in our search, one candidate stood out above the rest, and  that was Steve Grasz. He is an outstanding Nebraskan and a talented  legal mind. The President agreed. That is why he accepted our  recommendation in August, and he nominated Steve for the Eighth  Circuit.   Like so many other Nebraskans I have heard from during this process,  the President recognized Steve's temperament, intellect, and skill as  worthy on the Federal bench.   Steve excelled in his education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln  and the University of Nebraska College of Law. He then built a  distinguished legal career, practicing appellate litigation over the  past three decades. For 12 years, Steve served Nebraska as the chief  deputy attorney general. He did so with dedication to justice,  passionately defending our citizens and upholding the laws of our  State.   Steve has handled numerous constitutional litigation matters in the  Nebraska Supreme Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the  U.S. Supreme Court. In doing so, he has earned the respect of the  Nebraska legal community.   For many years Steve has earned the Martindale-Hubbell ``AV  Preeminent'' peer review rating, the very highest available. This peer- reviewed rating is based on legal knowledge and ethical standards, a  nonpartisan litmus test.   Steve also serves on the executive committee of the appellate  practice section of the Nebraska Bar Association, and he was selected  as a fellow by the Nebraska State Bar Foundation, an honor reserved  only for the top lawyers in my State. Nebraskans agreed that Steve has  the extensive legal experience needed to serve on the Eighth Circuit.  Yet the American Bar Association has rated Steve as ``not qualified''  for this position on the Federal bench.   As someone who spent months reviewing Steve's extraordinary  qualifications for this judgeship, I was shocked when I heard the  assessment. Something didn't add up.   But after a review of how the evaluation was conducted, things became  more clear. The ABA rating of Steve Grasz appears to be based on his  work defending Nebraska's pro-life laws as well as his personal views,  which he shares with a majority of Nebraskans. Both evaluators  discounted his remarkable legal career, choosing instead to focus on  innuendo in their report because he associates with political  organizations they disagree with.   There is nothing wrong with participating in the democratic process.  Indeed, Steve's own evaluators have done just that. Steve's first  evaluator, Cynthia Nance, has received several awards from the  Democratic Party of Arkansas. His second evaluator, Laurence Pulgram, a  San Francisco attorney, works as a liberal activist and has donated  thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party. Again, the fact that  these Americans have decided to engage in the political process is not  shameful. They have every right to do so, just like everyone else. But  here is the problem. They claim to be leading an impartial evaluation  of Steve, when in fact they are really trying to take down his  nomination and further their own political agenda.   A deeper review of the ABA evaluation shows a report that is long on  anonymous sources and short on substantiated evidence.   This is not the first time that the ABA has been criticized for using  anonymous sources, either. In 2006, while discussing Vanessa Bryan's  ABA rating, the senior Senator from Connecticut stated:         I have even greater concern with the credibility of       anonymous sources when those sources are used as evidence for       a subjective characteristic such as judicial temperament. . .       . I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to only consider       anonymous criticisms when such criticisms can be verified       from other sources.    Even worse, the sourced evidence the ABA produced for their report  doesn't hold up to scrutiny, either. One of the Nation's leading  experts on judicial appointments also agrees that the facts are few  when it comes to Steve's ABA rating. In his examination, Ed Whelan, the  president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the ABA  evaluation ``feeble beyond the point of incompetence'' because it  ``selectively quotes'' portions of an article written by Grasz to  misrepresent his views. Whelan concludes that ``it would thus seem that  . . . the ABA . . . is unable to distinguish between its role as  advocate and its role as adjudicator of the merits of judicial  nominees.''   As we learned more about this evaluation process, it is clear that  the ABA uses its power as a reviewer of judicial nominees as a way to  support its partisan agenda, instead of making a determination based on  the merits of judicial temperament.   During Steve's confirmation hearing last week, my colleagues on the  Judiciary Committee asked good questions that brought even more details  to light. That is how we discovered that Steve was asked a number of  inappropriate, leading questions during his ABA evaluation. These  questions had no relevancy toward his ability to serve our Nation as a  judge. He was asked for his personal opinion on social issues,  including abortion, and he was later questioned about where his  children went to school.   In response to a line of questions from the junior Senator from  Arizona, Steve explained that his ABA evaluator continued to use the  term ``you people'' during the interview. When Steve finally asked what  he meant by ``you people,'' the evaluator told him he meant  ``conservatives and Republicans.''   Steve also told the committee:         At least a half hour of that time was devoted to discussing       a white paper that I had written on the judicial selection       process for state judges in Nebraska. There was one paragraph       in that rather lengthy article [where] I had criticized the       oversized involvement of the American Bar Association in that       process, and I had mentioned some of their political       activities including their role in the debate over abortion       rights as well as Second Amendment rights of individuals.    He continued:         It seemed to be a topic of great concern to the       interviewer.    These tactics used by the ABA are not right. They show contempt for  ideas that do not fit the interviewer's personal beliefs and in no way  portray an attempt to consider carefully whether or not Steve Grasz is  capable of being a fair judge. This wasn't an evaluation. It was a  partisan, shameful attack. It was intended to further the political  agenda of the two evaluators and damage Steve's sterling legal  reputation.   In the days since the biased ABA rating was released, Nebraskans have  spoken out, and I couldn't be more proud of them. In letters, online,  on Facebook, and in the pages of our State's newspapers, our citizens  have come to Steve's defense.   Richard Kopf, a senior U.S. district judge for Nebraska said he was  ``stunned'' reading the ABA assessment of Steve. The ABA interviewed  Judge Kopf about Steve, and although he did not know Steve personally,  on two occasions he told the evaluator he believed Steve was ``well  qualified.''   Judge Kopf wrote in the Omaha World-Herald:         One can only speculate, and my speculation was that Mr.       Grasz, who is by all accounts a brilliant and honorable       person, would do his best. I certainly have and had no       evidence to the contrary. . . . I respectfully suggest that       the committee got it wrong when it gave Mr. Grasz a ``not       qualified'' rating.    Additionally, the president of the Nebraska State Bar Association,  Timothy Engler, quickly responded to the evaluation by noting that his  organization did not participate in the report or the ABA's grade. Mr.  Engler also noted that his own personal view was that he always found  Steve ``to be professional, civil, and ethical in all respects'' and  that Grasz ``would have no questions regarding his judicial temperament  as a member of the Judiciary.''   We received numerous letters of recommendation on Steve's behalf.  Nebraskans from across the political spectrum have pointed to Steve's  thoughtfulness, fairmindedness, high ethical standards, and brilliant  abilities as a jurist.   The respect and admiration for Steve is also bipartisan. This  includes former  [[Page S7140]]  Democratic Governor and U.S. Senator Ben Nelson, who wrote that Steve  was ``an asset to our state and Nebraskans benefitted from having such  a capable and thoughtful professional in public service. Today, he is  unquestionably one of the foremost appellate lawyers in the state,  making him an obvious choice for this seat on our federal appeals  court.''   Debra Gilg, the former U.S. attorney for Nebraska and a Democrat  appointed by President Obama, wrote:         Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty,       impeccable integrity, and dedication to the rule of law. He       possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and       always acts with respect to all that interact with him.    Those who have known Steve his entire life have vouched for him as  well. For example, Bill Lydiatt of Bellevue, NE, wrote a letter to the  editor to the Omaha World-Herald that said:         As a classmate of Grasz in Chappell, Nebraska, from       kindergarten through high school and as a lifelong friend, I       can personally vouch that Steve holds all of the attributes       to be a successful judge.    Furthermore, pointing to his integrity and fairness, he concluded:         I don't share all his political views, but I can say       without any hesitation that Steve Grasz is exactly the kind       of person we need as a judge and is perfectly suited to the       high honor of joining the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.    In Nebraska, the truth holds more value than partisanship. Madam  President, everyone serving in this Chamber swears an oath to support  and defend the Constitution. One of the ways we do that is by  confirming judges who we know will faithfully honor that pledge while  serving our Federal court system. The Constitution states that we in  the Senate, not the American Bar Association, are to advise and consent  when it comes to judges. We have a duty to do so thoroughly, without  bias, and through the use of all the information available to us.   Both the junior Senator from Nebraska and I trust Steve Grasz to  support and defend the Constitution. So do those who know him best--the  people of Nebraska who have worked with him for nearly three decades.  The Senate should as well.   I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to advance his nomination. The  American people deserve to have talented and fair lawyers like Steve  Grasz on the Federal bench.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
