 Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on a dark day in  Georgia's recent history.   One year ago today, a hateful act of violence shook Metropolitan  Atlanta and reverberated across our State, our country, and indeed the  world. In the span of just a few hours, our sense of safety and  sanctuary was pierced by bullets of hate and fear. Eight precious  people lost their lives--eight people who were loved by their families,  their friends, their children; eight people with their own successes  and struggles, hopes, and dreams.   We speak their names: Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim,  Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie  Tan, Daoyou Feng.   My heart aches for these Georgians and their families for whom I am  sure the wounds are still fresh. They were the victims of  unconscionable, senseless hate.   As a pastor, I believe in the sacred worth of every human being--that  we are a strange admixture of dust and divinity, of sod and sky, of  beauty and possibility.   So I will ask now for all of my colleagues and everyone who can to  join me in taking a moment of silence to remember these eight Georgians  and to pray, each in our own way, for their families.   (Moment of silence.)   Thank you.
