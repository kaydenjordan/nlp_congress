 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my  [[Page H4727]]  amendment to the division C Defense appropriations of H.R. 2740.   I applaud my colleagues for including expanded authorities in the  fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act that would allow  the Defense Department's Space-Available Flights program to benefit  veterans with 100 percent service-connected disability.   As you may know, the Space-A program offers free military air travel  to eligible participants if there is available space on a flight  heading to a destination within the continental United States.   Prior to the fiscal year 2019 NDAA, the Space-A program provided  Active Duty, reservists, retirees, and certain family members with this  benefit.   Space-A is an example of programs operated by the military that can  and do work for the American people.   Expanding the benefit to include 100 percent disabled veterans was  common sense, and will help those veterans visit their family, old  friends from the service, and even seek services for medical and mental  health treatment with the best possible healthcare providers.   For 100 percent disabled veterans in Delaware, the expansion of  Space-A offered an especially convenient travel alternative due to the  Dover Air Force Base's central location within the State.   Many such communities across the country are similarly improved  thanks to this program.   While the effort to expand access to this program to some of our  Nation's veterans was well-intentioned, I have heard from some veterans  that there may have been an unintended consequence.   The new authorities do not allow caregivers or spouses to travel with  eligible veterans as part of the program. For many veterans that are  rated as 100 percent disabled, the inability to have their caregiver or  spouse join them on the flight effectively disqualifies them from  utilizing this incredible program.   We must ensure that all eligible veterans have equal and fair access  to the benefits they have earned.   President Lincoln made it clear that it is our country's duty to care  and assist those that had borne the battle on behalf of the country,  and it is our duty as a country to follow through on that promise.   That is why I request that the Department of Defense provide to  Congress an assessment of feasibility or possible issues in expanding  eligible participants to include spouses and caregivers when traveling  with 100 percent disabled veterans.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues on improving this benefit  afforded to these veterans.                                time  1700     I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
