 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 150th  anniversary of the Saint James Presbyterian Church of Greensboro, North  Carolina.   As the third oldest African American church in Greensboro, Saint  James is rich in history and tradition. Under the leadership of  Reverend Dr. Diane Givens Moffett, Saint James embraces the theme: 150  Years, Celebrating Our Walk-in Faith and Service.   It is rare but wonderful to find a group of individuals who have  thoroughly enriched their community through dedicated service and good  works. It has been my unique honor to represent the good people of  Saint James Presbyterian both in North Carolina and in the Congress for  more than 30 years. Saint James has helped make Greensboro a more just  and peaceful community, and for that, I am immensely proud.   Congratulations, once again, Saint James, on your anniversary--a  century plus five decades. I look forward to witnessing the many ways  in which Saint James will continue to thrive during its next 150 years.                            ____________________
