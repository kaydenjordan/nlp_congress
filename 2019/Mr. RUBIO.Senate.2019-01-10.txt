 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a few minutes here--in 45 minutes or  so--the Senate is going to vote to decide whether we want to begin  debate on the bill that is before us, S. 1, Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act of 2019. I remind everybody of why we  began with this bill.   I don't know what the number is, but I would say the overwhelming  majority of the Members of the Senate did not agree when the President  decided to pull us out of Syria for various different reasons.  Everybody was asking us: Well, why don't you guys do something about  it? As you know, it is difficult. The Congress cannot order the  President to take military action. It can authorize it, it can fund it,  and it can defund it, but it cannot compel it. That is the role of the  Commander in Chief. There are some things we can do. However, because  there are things we were concerned about with his decision, there are  things we can do to sort of deal with the consequences of what, I  believe, would be a mistake, and this bill endeavors to do that.   We went through and said: Let's find some bills that would help our  allies in the region--Israel, Jordan--and that deal with the human  rights catastrophe in Syria. Let's find things that are bipartisan and  have widespread support so that we are not starting with something  controversial. Then let's put it all together in one bill so that the  country will be able to see that the Senate is engaged in the foreign  policy of this country and is acting out its constitutional role as a  check and balance on the Executive.   That is what we did. No good deed goes unpunished, though, because as  that bill was filed, apparently, the Democratic leader and others in  the leadership asked their Members to vote against even beginning  debate on a bill that an overwhelming number of them supported, that a  majority of the Democrats supported. They asked them to vote not to  proceed on the bill, and the argument is because of the government  shutdown.   I still don't know how it makes any sense to respond to a government  shutdown by shutting down the Senate. In essence, why did we even come  up here this week? It appears they are not making any progress on the  negotiations, and we are not moving on any bills or legislation. I  don't know if it gives people any comfort to know that at least the  Senate is shut down too. I don't know how that fixes the government  shutdown situation. This should be a place that can walk and chew gum  at the same time, meaning a place that works on solving and ending this  shutdown, which is bad for everybody, that works on securing our  borders, which is something we need to do for our country, but that  also works on dealing with something like this, especially as timely as  the decision is that was just made last month and the threats that are  facing our allies in the region. That is what this bill is about.   We are going to have another vote here for the second time this week.  So  [[Page S126]]  that everybody understands, this vote is not even in favor of or  against the bill; it is just to the question of whether we can start  debate on this bill. I hope a few more Democrats will join us so that  we can get the 60 votes we need just to begin debating the bill. If you  still want to make your point at the end of the day, then go ahead and  vote against it or whatever. I hope you don't, but let's at least begin  debate on it. We will see what happens here in about 30 minutes. My  sense is that we still won't have the votes to do that, and it is  unfortunate.   I do want to address two things that have been brought up with regard  to this bill--one thing that has been brought up and one element of the  bill that I hope will change people's minds in terms of beginning the  debate on it.   First, let me talk about a provision in this bill that deals with  BDS. BDS--boycott, divestment and sanctions--is an international effort  to wage economic war on Israel in order to punish it for its supposed  treatment of Palestinians. It boycotts companies that do business in  Israel until they cut ties. It boycotts or pressures banks and  investment firms until they divest of any investments that help Israel.  It then asks governments to impose sanctions on Israel. That is BDS.   Some people support it. There are two newly elected Members of the  House who openly support it. I assume that is their right. I think they  are wrong, but that is their right. The vast majority of people do not  support it.   What has happened across America is that there are States and  counties and cities that have decided they don't support BDS. It is not  illegal and we are not going to make it illegal if you want to be a  company that participates in BDS. Yet we--the government, the cities,  and the States--are not going to buy services or goods from any company  that is boycotting Israel. All this bill does is protect them from  lawsuits if they make that decision.    The argument against this has been--and I have seen this now in  numerous statements from those on the other side of the aisle--that it  infringes on the First Amendment rights of individuals. I don't know  what bill does that, but it isn't this one.   To begin with, this bill doesn't even apply to individuals.  Individuals can do whatever they want. If you don't want to buy stock  in a company that does business in Israel, I think it is shortsighted,  but no one is stopping you from doing that. If you want to divest your  investments from companies that do business in Israel, no one is  stopping you from doing that. If you don't want to shop at or buy from  companies that do business with Israel, that is not illegal. This  doesn't apply to any individuals.   By the way, it doesn't even make it illegal for companies to make  that decision. This is not banning participating in BDS. You have every  right to support it. You are wrong, but you have every right to support  it. You have every right to carry it out if you are a company or an  individual.   This bill does not apply to individuals. Any time people say they are  protecting the individual First Amendment rights of Americans by  opposing this legislation, I don't know what they are talking about  because this does not apply to individuals.   All this says is to go ahead and do it. If you, company X, want to  boycott Israel or divest investments from Israel, you can, but the  people who disagree with you can boycott and divest from you. You see,  free speech is a two-way street. If you want to proclaim something or  say something, you have every right to do it, but the people who  disagree with you have a right to do that as well. If there is a First  Amendment right to companies to boycott or divest from Israel, then  there has to be a First Amendment right to boycott or divest from those  companies.   If you oppose this bill, then you are in favor of shielding from  counter-boycotts anyone who decides to take these actions. That is what  you are for, which is de facto support for BDS, because what you are  basically saying is to go ahead and boycott Israel and divest from  Israel, but no one can do that to you. That is not what the First  Amendment is. The First Amendment protects your right to speech, and it  protects from government infringement an individual's right to speak.  It does not protect you from people who disagree with you. It does not  protect you from people who speak out against you. So if you are a  boycotter, you yourself can be boycotted. If you are a divestor, people  can divest from you. I am talking about the elected representatives of  our cities and counties. If the members of that community do not agree  with that decision, they can vote them out of office.   Why does a city or a county have to be forced to buy products from  companies that are undertaking a foreign policy action, which is what  this is? This is not an effort to influence domestic policy; this is an  effort to influence the policies of a foreign country. Why should a  city or a county be forced by law to have to do business with those  that a city or a county or a State disagrees with? That is all this  bill is.   When people go around talking about how this infringes on the First  Amendment rights of individuals, it is just not honest. It is just not  true. This doesn't even apply to individuals. In fact, the bill says  very clearly in writing--right there--that nothing under this act shall  be construed to infringe upon the First Amendment rights of any  American.   As they continue to say that, just know that this bill only applies  to cities, counties, and States being able to not buy things from  companies. This doesn't give you the right to fire an employee who  posts a pro-BDS thing on Facebook. This doesn't give you the right to  refuse to sell a home to or provide housing for or discriminate in any  way against individuals who support BDS. This doesn't give anyone the  right to put you in jail for supporting BDS. It doesn't do anything to  infringe on anyone's First Amendment right. All it does is protect the  First Amendment right to be against BDS and to do to the boycotters  what the boycotters are doing to Israel. It is a two-way street. Those  are the facts. If you are hiding behind that in order to oppose this  bill, you are not being frank about what the bill does.   The second part of this bill that I wanted to talk about today  shouldn't be controversial at all because we are all now painfully  familiar with the grave humanitarian crisis we have seen in Syria. I  would say and most would agree that what we have seen over the last 8  years of this conflict is the worst humanitarian crisis since the end  of the Second World War. It began as anti-government protests, but it  led to the fighting for political freedoms that has now escalated into  a bloody civil war with a bunch of foreign fighters flowing in. It is a  mess of all kinds of different groups from foreign countries and of  radical jihadists.   Caught in the middle are innocent people who have been bombed and  gassed. In fact, this administration has had to take action to punish  militarily the Assad regime for dropping chlorine bombs and chemical  weapons on civilian populations. We have seen these images of children,  babies, and everyday people--bakers and plumbers and small business  owners and professionals--who 1 minute were walking around and the next  minute were choking to death because their own government, with the  support of Russia and Iran, dropped chemical weapons on their  communities and killed countless people.   Not only is this sort of activity horrifying, it is a war crime. It  is a war crime to deliberately target civilian populations, and it is  particularly cruel to do it with a gruesome form of death--that is,  death by chemical weapon. That is what we have seen.   That is what we have seen supported, by the way, by Vladimir Putin.  He knows for a fact what they are doing and doesn't care. He gives them  cover, and he makes up these ridiculous stories about how it is the  opposition that has done it. Everyone knows who has done it. There is  zero doubt about it. That is why they don't allow inspectors to go in  and find evidence and point it out. But it is abundantly clear who is  doing it, and they have done it.   Even as this administration is deciding to pull out, the prospects  grow and the likelihood grows every day that the people who have made  these decisions will never be held accountable for what they have done.  These war criminals--these savages--will never be held accountable for  what they have done if trends continue the way they are going. This  bill tries to address that.   The now chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the Senator from  [[Page S127]]  Idaho, Mr. Risch, filed a bill last year, called the Caesar Syria  Civilian Protection Act, that is now included in this bill. I believe  he will be here shortly to speak about it. It is called the Caesar  bill--it has nothing to do with Rome--because it is named after a  Syrian military defector. It is named after someone who was in the  Syrian military whose code name was ``Caesar'' who smuggled out tens of  thousands of pictures of what was going on inside of Syria, the images  of the thousands of people who were killed while being detained in  Syria. They were images of the torture, of the brutalization of women  and innocent men and even sometimes children by the Assad regime and by  those who supported them.   The pictures show the true face of what we are dealing with here--the  face of an evil and criminal regime, a regime that needs to be held to  account. All those who support them and are allowing them to do it  should also be held accountable.   What Senator Risch's bill does is it provides the Trump  administration new legal authority to bring some accountability for the  people who have done this.   First, it requires a determination and a report by the Treasury on  whether the Central Bank of Syria is a financial institution of primary  money laundering concern. Why does that matter? Because they are using  that bank to clean and launder money to fund their operations, to  remain in power, and, ultimately, to gas and kill their own people.   The other thing it does is it imposes new sanctions on anyone who  does business with or who provides financing to the Government of  Syria, including Syrian intelligence and security services, or the  Central Bank of Syria; who provides aircraft or spare aircraft parts  that are used for military purposes in Syria; who does business with  transportation or telecom sectors controlled by the Syrian Government;  or who supports Syria's energy industry.   These aren't just about punishing them. It is about hurting them in  their pocketbooks so they can't afford to put those planes up there to  drop these bombs on innocent people. It gives the administration the  authority to do this.   By the way, this bill also requires the administration to brief  Congress. You hear them talking about holding the administration  accountable and conducting oversight. This bill requires them to come  before us and tell us what their plan is to deliver humanitarian aid.   By the way, I want to know how we are going to deliver humanitarian  aid if there is no U.S. presence on the ground and the only people left  are the Russians, the Turks, the Iranians, and the Assad regime. It  would be interesting to be briefed on that plan with us not there, but  it requires them to come forward and either tell us what their plan is  or admit that there isn't a plan because we are not there anymore.   That is what this bill does. I would love for everyone here to  support it, but before you can even vote for it, we have to start  debate on it through the rules of the Senate. In about 15 minutes, we  are going to vote on this thing, and there are going to be people who  vote against even starting a debate on it, and the argument is that it  is because of the shutdown.   I hope people reconsider. I don't understand the logic of it, but  when you talk about the threats that are facing Israel, which the  overwhelming majority of the Senators here say they are strong  supporters of, and when you talk about the importance of Jordan and our  alliance with Israel, something that every single person here basically  agrees with, for the most part, and when you talk about these  horrifying war crimes for which there should be some accountability,  which I believe everybody here was outraged by, how does stopping a  bill or refusing to move on to debating a bill that deals with those  things help end the shutdown? It doesn't. It makes no sense, but,  apparently, that is what some are willing to do.   They probably aren't watching at this point. They are probably off at  their caucus lunches or doing something else, but I hope that over the  last 48 hours, some of my colleagues on the Democratic side have  thought about it and have said to themselves that it really doesn't  make any sense to deal with the government shutdown by shutting down  the Senate.   I hope they will reconsider and vote differently this time. If they  don't, then, I am just not sure how we can explain to people why it is  that we will not agree to even begin debate on something almost all of  us agree on for reasons completely unrelated to it. In essence, that is  what happened earlier this week and what could potentially happen here  very shortly.   I actually, oftentimes, wonder what must go through the minds of  visitors to the Capitol. I understand most people in America aren't  watching this. Very few people probably are. I wonder. You come up  here, and these groups from Close Up were here. It is a great  organization. It brings high school kids up here. You try to explain to  normal, regular human beings that there is a bill that 90 of the 100  Senators support, but we are not even going to be able to debate it  because they are voting against debating it. They would look at you  like you have three heads and say: What are you talking about? They  support the bill, but they don't want to have a debate on the bill yet?  Why? Because of the government shutdown. Well, what does that have to  do with it?   There are no other aspects in our lives where we would do that. I  have never heard that in my life. I have never heard someone say: I am  not going to work today because I am upset that my favorite team lost  the game yesterday, or I am not paying my bills this month because I  don't like the fact that they charged me too much for changing my  tires. If you did that in any part of your life, people would think you  were crazy. Yet that is what is happening here.   What kind of leverage is this--that you are going to hold up a bill  we all agree on as leverage to force us to negotiate? The Democratic  leader and the Democratic Members know that in order for a bill to  become law, it needs the support of the House, which their party  controls, 60 Senators, which they can keep us from getting, and the  President who will sign it. They know full well that this has nothing  to do with that, but, nonetheless, a majority of them seem to be  prepared to vote against even debating it.   I don't know how to explain that. I certainly don't know how to  explain it to high school students up here visiting from Close Up or to  anyone else, for that matter, but that is what happened earlier this  week, and that is what might happen today here in a few minutes.   I hope I am wrong. I hope people have reconsidered because, honestly,  this is an issue that deserves our earnest attention.   I will close with this. Please do not go around saying that Congress  needs to do more to hold the administration accountable or to conduct  oversight of our administration policy, when we started this Congress  trying to do that and you decided to keep us from doing it for some  other reason. Don't say that Congress needs to be more involved in the  foreign policy of the United States, when this is exactly what we are  trying to do here today and you will not let us for reasons unrelated  to it.   This country needs a strong Senate more than ever before, not one  that is shut down. I hope people will change their minds so we can get  to work on this right now.   The Senate should be able to walk, chew gum, write, and read at the  same time--or a lot of us. There are 100 people here. We should be able  to do multiple things at the same time. We do it all the time.   You don't need to shut down the Senate, and you don't need to stop  debate on this bill to solve the government shutdown. One has nothing  to do with the other. Everyone knows that. Americans understand that.  Normal people recognize that.   Let's act normal. Let's stop being weird about these things, and  let's move on something like this and get the debate going, even as we  work on the government shutdown and on border security.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Each week this Congress, I  will honor a small business that exemplifies the hard work and  perseverance of the American entrepreneur. The great State of Florida  is home to businesses of all types, from family-run farms in Ocala to  aerospace machinists in Cape Canaveral. Today, it is my distinct  pleasure to honor a small business with a strong commitment to the  quality of its products and a desire to give back to its community. As  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize Oceana Coffee Roasters  as this year's first Small Business of the Week.   Amy and Scott Angelo founded Oceana Coffee Roasters in 2009 with only  a $35 coffee roaster, converted from a popcorn machine, and the goal of  bringing freshly roasted coffee to their area. Located in Tequesta, FL,  Amy and Scott founded the company after they were unable to find a  local coffee roaster that produced fresh, small-batch coffee. Seeing an  opportunity, the Angelos began by roasting just a quarter-cup of coffee  at a time, experimenting with different types of beans and roasting  techniques.   From a popcorn popper in their kitchen, to roasting 50,000 pounds of  beans a year, the Angelos have remained focused on the details of  producing high-quality, small-batch, whole bean and ground coffee. In  order to meet their high standards, Scott and Amy learned all they  could about how coffee beans are grown, where the best beans originate,  and how to bring out the best flavor in each type of bean. They also  researched the fair trade coffee process, how coffee is harvested and  transported, and the logistics of importing beans to their Florida  small business. Through their diligent study and a trial and error  process, the Angelos harnessed their entrepreneurial spirit to  understand their customers' desires and make a product they are proud  of. In 2016, the Palm Beach North Chamber of Commerce recognized Oceana  Coffee as the Small Business of the Year and SCORE of Palm Beach County  recognized them for entrepreneurial excellence. Also in 2016, they were  the overall winner for the Golden Bean North America Award, which is  the world's largest coffee roaster competition.   As the business has grown, the company has periodically added new  coffee  [[Page S141]]  varieties from around the world to its product line. Instead of  focusing on large production runs of one type of coffee, Oceana  produces small batches of shade-grown, Guatemalan, Ethiopian, and Costa  Rican coffee for all types of coffee consumers. Their success has also  led to expansion, with Amy and Scott adding a second location in Palm  Beach County while increasing e-commerce sales and direct shipments to  reach approximately 100 wholesale customers.   The Angelos are committed to their community and doing right by the  people they do business with. Every quarter, Oceana makes a donation to  a charitable organization voted on by its customers under an initiative  they call Cup of Kindness. Oceana Coffee also gives back by offering  internships to adults with autism by partnering with Jupiter, FL-based  Els for Autism so that affected individuals can gain workforce  experience. Additionally, the Angelos provide a platform to local  artists, authors, and other small businesses in the area. Each month,  the shop hosts a showcase to help these entrepreneurs gain exposure.   The Angelos care about the community of growers they work with, as  they purchase their coffee beans from small, fair-trade farmers that  they interact with directly and visit regularly. They have also made a  commitment to reduce waste through the use of reusable straws and  recyclable cutlery and containers.   Oceana Coffee Roasters has found its niche and expanded as a company,  while keeping its commitment to quality and principles. The Angelos'  love of quality coffee, commitment to their community, and painstaking  review of the coffee making process has made the company a leader in  its community and created a loyal customer base. Again, I would like to  congratulate Scott, Amy, and all of the employees at Oceana Coffee  Roasters for being named the Small Business of the Week. I wish you  continued success in your future endeavors.                            ____________________
