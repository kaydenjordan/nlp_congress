 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at the end of each Congress, we have the  bittersweet task of saying good-bye to some of our retiring colleagues,  and today I want to talk a little bit about our departing Members of  Team Texas.   When I came to the Senate, succeeding Senator Phil Gramm, Senator Kay  Bailey Hutchison, now our Ambassador to NATO, always schooled us on  Team Texas and said: We may be Democrats, we may be House Members, we  may be Republicans, we may be Members of the Senate, but when it comes  to Texas, we are all part of Team Texas.   And I tried to carry that tradition on as well.   Our delegation is losing six incredible statesmen, including three  ranking Members in the House, whose contributions have notched  countless wins for our State during their time in Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the first name I want to mention is Mac  Thornberry. Mac is the dean of the Texas delegation. His district is  the second largest in Texas, and comprises parts of 41 different  counties. It stretches from the suburbs of Dallas, across Wichita  Falls, Amarillo, and most of the Texas Panhandle.   The folks throughout Texas 13 couldn't have asked for a stronger  advocate over these last 26 years than Mac. His background as a  rancher, a former Capitol Hill staffer, and a State Department official  under the Reagan administration, then brought him to Congress with a  well-rounded view of the problems facing our country. He possessed the  leadership characteristics needed to address each of those.   He spent his time here consistently fighting to rein in government  spending--something that, as the Presiding Officer knows, sometimes  seems like a futile task but necessary.   He has consistently fought to protect our freedoms and liberties and  ensure that all Texans have a shot at the American dream.   We have worked together many times over the years on everything from  protecting the property rights of folks along the Red River to renaming  the Amarillo courthouse after a trailblazing Texan, Mary Lou Robinson.   There is no question that some of his greatest accomplishments are  related to our national defense. Mac has served on the House Armed  Services Committee throughout his time in Congress, and he became the  first Texan of either party to chair that committee. He has used this  important and powerful post to ensure that our servicemembers have what  they need to defend our freedoms abroad and the training and the  equipment to make it home safely.   He has done a lot--more than most--to improve military readiness,  including through needed improvements at our Texas military  installations. I remember visiting Sheppard Air Force Base in Mac's  district with him a couple of years ago and being taken aback by the  look of admiration and appreciation on the faces of those airmen we  encountered who knew of Mac's incredible advocacy on their behalf.   It is appropriate that the National Defense Authorization Act that  just passed both Chambers of Congress carries his name--the Mac  Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act. There could not be a  more fitting tribute to the countless ways our friend from Clarendon  has improved our great country.   I want to thank Mac for his incredible leadership, as well as his  service and his friendship over the years. The halls of Congress won't  be the same without him, but I know he is eager to spend more time with  his wonderful wife Sally and the rest of their extended family.   Mac has done what we all aspire to do, and that is to leave Congress  better than he found it, and I thank him on behalf of all Texans for  the true patriot that he is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we like to say, everything is a little  bit bigger in Texas than the rest of the country, and that is true not  only of Mac's district but also the largest congressional district  represented by another one of our departing colleagues, Will Hurd. Will  was a former CIA officer when he was elected to the House of  Representatives in 2014. One Texan aptly observed: ``He has been  running a marathon like a sprint for seven years.''   I think Will's last congressional race he won by 900 votes in this  sprawling border district.   His expertise is in cyber security, as well as intelligence matters.  He has helped steer our efforts to bolster our national security,  counterterrorism, and strengthen our intelligence community and  capacity.   Considering his district includes 800 miles of our southern border,  you can imagine that he has been a strong advocate for our border  communities. We have worked together on cross-border trade, modernizing  our ports of entry, and ensuring communities along the border are safe  and prosperous.   We have also been working together on establishing a national museum  of the American Latino here in Washington, and I hope we will be able  to push this authorization bill over the line here in the coming days.   Unlike some folks whom we meet in Washington who seem to be all talk  and who never seem to listen, Will understands the importance of  sitting down for a conversation with his constituents and actually  listening to what they have to say. He launched the highly popular ``DC  to DQ tour,'' where he met with constituents at local Dairy Queens in  all 29 counties in his district in only 5 days.   For everything from healthcare to education, to veterans affairs,  Texans can sit down with their Congressman and have a real conversation  about the things that counted for the most in their lives and the  things they would like to see him pursue on their behalf here in  Washington, DC.   I would hate to know how many Blizzards Will ate during that time,  but these conversations certainly drove his policymaking and ensured  the people of the Texas 23rd were truly heard here in Congress.   Last year, Will and I both took part in San Antonio's annual Martin  Luther King, Jr., March, which is one of the largest in the country.  Will happens to be the only Black Republican in the House of  Representatives and has become a trusted voice for those whose  experience and ideas are too often overlooked or underrepresented.   That has been especially true over the last several months, when we  have  [[Page S7582]]  had an honest national conversation about racial reconciliation and  injustice in this country, and I know that he will continue to use his  voice as a force for good long after leaving Congress.   Will has been a steady hand in reminding our colleagues alike that  good policies should always come before partisan politics, and it is  fair to say we need more leaders like that in Congress these days, not  fewer.   I am grateful for his friendship and service to our country, and I  know this isn't the end of the road for Will Hurd. I am eager to see  where his next career takes him, and I will be happy to cheer him along  the way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, much of the area that is sandwiched  between Mac and Will's two districts is represented by another retired  Member of our delegation, Mike Conaway. Before finding his way into  public service, Mike served our country in the Army and was stationed  at Fort Hood. But he quickly made his way to the Permian Basin and  built a successful career in the private sector before getting involved  with politics.   During his 16 years in Congress, he has represented the folks of  Texas 11 and burned the candle at both ends in the process of doing so.   Mike is a man of faith, believes in the right to life, and is an  advocate for a strong defense and has been a champion for our Nation's  veterans.   His background as a CPA--we could use a few more of those, maybe less  lawyers. But his background as a CPA has helped drive debates on our  Nation's spending habits, and I know his expertise in this area will be  deeply missed.   I believe Mike would agree that at the top of his mountain of  achievements are those for our farmers and ranchers. He authored the  2018 farm bill, which provides the support, certainty, and stability  for our farmers that they need in order to operate in a modern economy.  This legislation strengthened crop insurance, created seed cotton  eligibility for the farm bill safety net, and helped counter cattle  tick fever and other animal risks.   It would have been tough for Texas farmers and ranchers and producers  to make it through these times but for Mike as the lead agriculture  policymaker in Congress. The halls of Congress will not be the same  without him, but Mike's contributions, his leadership, and devoted  service will never be forgotten.   I know he and his wife Suzanne are eager to spend more time at home  with their extended family, and I wish them a happy and well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it seems like we have a lot of Texans  leaving Congress, and one of those is   Kenny Marchant.   Kenny is a genuine statesman, quiet but serious and effective, and he  has devoted almost his entire career to public service. He started out  on the Carrolton City Council and then became mayor and then spent nine  terms as a State representative, and, finally, eight terms in the U.S.  House of Representatives. And he proudly represents North Texans and  has for the last four decades.   As a Member of the Ways and Means Committee, he has played an  integral role in the effort to keep taxes down, including passage of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018, which was part of the spur of our  great economic growth leading up to the pandemic.   He has been a staunch supporter of efforts to reduce government waste  and ensure that Congress is a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars.  He has fought for our servicemembers, veterans, and for strong national  defense.   As the top Republican on the House Ethics Committee, Kenny helped to  strengthen transparency and public confidence in our government, and  there couldn't be a more important time for such a lofty goal.   I know Kenny is eager to spend more time at home with his wife Donna,  their kids, and a growing gaggle of grandkids. Most of their children  are grown now, but the number of grandkids seems to be increasing in  pace.   I want to thank him for his incredible contributions to our State and  wish him the best in the next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the House will lose a true class act and  the epitome of a self-made success with the retirement of Congressman  Bill Flores. At just 9 years old, Congressman Flores began tending to  cattle with his dad in the Texas Panhandle, and he hasn't quit working  since.   He is a ninth generation Texan, representing Waco, College Station,  and parts of North Austin and Pflugerville. You would be hard-pressed  to find a more deeply divided district than Texas 17, and I don't mean  divided in terms of politics or geography. You have the Aggies, the  Bears, and the Longhorns--three of Texas's proudest fan bases--squeezed  into one congressional district. Ever the diplomat, Bill considers  himself tripartisan. Although he is an Aggie himself, he would gladly  throw up the ``Hook `em Horns'' or the ``Sic `em Bears.''   Throughout his time in Congress, I have been proud to work with Bill  on a number of shared priorities. We teamed up on legislation to  designate the Waco Mammoth site as a national monument. We worked  together to rename the Waco Veterans Affairs Medical Center after World  War II Hero Petty Officer Doris Miller.   We both had the pleasure of attending the long overdue Purple Heart  ceremony honoring the victims of the Fort Hood attack after a long  fight here in Congress to give these heroes the recognition and the  benefits they deserve. Bill has been a reliable advocate for our  veterans and servicemembers, as well as our energy industry and our  free enterprise system, in general.   I want to thank him for his service to our State and to our Nation  and wish him and Gina the best in the next chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, I would say last, but certainly  not least, is my friend, my former chief of staff, and proud  Representative of Texas 22, Pete Olson. As the old saying goes, Pete  wasn't born in Texas, but he got there as fast as he could.   His family moved from Washington State to Texas when Pete was only 10  years old. He grew up in Seabrook. He went to Rice for his  undergraduate degree and UT for law school and hardly left the Lone  Star State until he enlisted in the Navy.   As a Navy pilot, he flew missions all over the world, and he was  eventually brought to the U.S. Senate as a naval liaison.   I had the good fortune of meeting Pete because he worked for Phil  Gramm, my predecessor, and he had a stellar reputation, likely due to  his Navy days of making the ships run on time.   Pete served as my first chief of staff for several years and made it  back home to Texas before making his own run for congressional office.   His district is literally one of the most ethnically diverse in the  State and one of the most diverse in the country. Pete has consistently  prioritized connecting with folks of different backgrounds and cultures  to learn about the challenges they are facing and to figure out how to  lead positive changes in Congress.   Pete has been a reliable helping hand during some of our toughest  times. Following the Deepwater Horizon accident, Pete and I flew  several hours into the Gulf of Mexico to a drilling rig rooted in 9,000  feet of water to learn more about the rigors of working on offshore  rigs.   After Hurricane Harvey, Pete and I joined Team Rubicon's veteran  volunteers to muck out some of the flooded homes in the Houston area.  We fought alongside one another to secure the funding from Congress to  recover and rebuild after Hurricane Harvey.   It was common then to see Pete around Capitol Hill with a Houston  Astros jersey over his dress shirt to draw attention--by any means,  whatsoever--to the need for additional funding for the folks in his  district and folks in that region.   It is safe to say that Pete Olson's presence has been a constant  throughout my time here in the Senate, and I will miss having him just  across the dome.  [[Page S7583]]    Like the others I have mentioned, I know Pete is eager to spend more  time at home in Sugar Land with his wife Nancy and his extended family,  but I hope he knows how much we will miss him in Congress.   If it isn't already obvious, the Texas delegation is losing some  truly outstanding Members, and our new additions will have some big  boots to fill. But I just want to tell you how much I appreciate the  opportunity to express my gratitude to each of these six outstanding  Congressmen for their friendship and service to our State and wish them  and their families well as they take on new challenges ahead.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
