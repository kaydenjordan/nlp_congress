 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the economic crisis  that is pummeling Florida's families. This week's financial report  showed that inflation continues to hammer Americans, growing by 8.3  percent over April of 2021.   When coupled with workforce shortages and supply chain disruptions,  the result has been catastrophic for small businesses--every sector of  our economy is impacted. I am also gravely concerned that we are  spiraling toward a recession, and yet, many of my colleagues seem to  think the only answer is to spend more.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we cannot spend our way out of this  crisis. We must stop the reckless spending that is fueling this problem  and make tough choices about our priorities, just as each and every one  of our constituents are being forced to do.                            ____________________
