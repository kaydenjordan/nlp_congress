 Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and  Brain Awareness Month.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States,  and it has reached crisis proportions. There is no effective treatment  and no means of prevention and no method for slowing the progression of  this disease. Sadly, one in three seniors will die of the disease of  Alzheimer's.   Today, on the longest day of the year, the Alzheimer's Association is  raising awareness to outshine the darkness of Alzheimer's disease.   Approximately 50 million people, worldwide, are living with  Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. This not only has a  devastating impact on those who are diagnosed with the disease, but  also their caregivers and their loved ones.   More than 15 million Americans provide unpaid care to families and  friends living with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Compared with  caregivers for people without dementia, twice as many caregivers for  people with dementia indicate substantial emotional, financial, and  physical stress.   Madam Speaker, the time to act is now. Let's join the fight. Let's  take the pledge to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and to  never stop searching for a cure.                            ____________________
