 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is a war raging in Ukraine, killing thousands and  thousands of innocent people.   Gasoline, diesel, and grocery prices are through the roof.   For all practical purposes, we don't have a southern border anymore,  so hundreds of thousands of immigrants continue to flood into the  United States, and the situation there is about to get much worse.   Rampant inflation is making short work of the hard-earned money of  all Americans, but the main priority for the Democrats this week isn't  Ukraine, skyrocketing gasoline prices, 8 percent inflation, or the  border crisis. No. Instead, it is marijuana.   It has been obvious for years that at some point, marijuana was going  to be formally legalized. What is deeply and truly disturbing, however,  about this bill is its failure to address the clear consequences of  legalization--such as what this drug does to children, to drivers on  our highways, to the mental health of up to 30 percent of those adults  who choose to use marijuana, to communities inundated with hundreds, if  not thousands, of foreign cartel-operated, unlicensed, and out-of- control marijuana growers, and finally, to those who actually try to  produce cannabis, marijuana, legally.   Let's take a closer look at Oregon, my State, to see what really  happens when marijuana is legalized without careful and necessary  thought.   The picture behind me is a hoop house. It is about 100-feet long and  50-feet wide. At current retail, it will produce about $6 million worth  of marijuana a year.   The next picture is a picture of a grow consisting of 30 to 40 hoop  houses. By the way, these are all in my district in southern Oregon.  And if each of these hoop houses is in full production, 40 hoop houses  would generate $240 million, at retail, of marijuana each year.   To put this in perspective, there are currently 180 grows like this  in Jackson County, Oregon, alone, many of which are illegal. Hundreds  upon hundreds of hoop houses.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that a video taken from a  helicopter of approximately 180 grows in Jackson County be entered into  the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I will move on.   These operations are, in large part, unlicensed, uncontrolled,  unregulated, operated on stolen water, ignoring building codes,  ignoring land use laws, ignoring labor laws, and importing thousands  upon thousands of immigrants to work in squalor and in fear.   Why? Because the Federal Government has refused to help the  overwhelmed local law enforcement officers meet the huge challenge  these cartels present.   In fact, months ago, I directly asked Attorney General Garland and  again, several weeks ago, for his assistance in getting the FBI,  Homeland Security, and the DEA to help us in southern Oregon, and I  have heard nothing, absolutely nothing, back from him.   This is why it is essential that any bill dealing with legalization  include significant money for law enforcement. We are certainly not  getting any help from the Attorney General.   This picture behind me is what the living conditions are like for the  immigrants working for the cartels.   We are experiencing one of the worst droughts in the history of the  western United States. Water is gold in my district. Cartels are  stealing water and using it to grow marijuana.   Water regulators in southern Oregon have been threatened with death  by cartel members when they have tried to stop water theft. Here is a  picture of some of the stolen water.   When the crop is harvested, hoop houses are abandoned, the migrant  laborers disappear, and the mess is left for someone else to clean up.  Here is what that looks like.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record the Politico article labeled ``.  . . Why Legal Weed Didn't Kill Oregon's Black Market,'' dated January  14, 2022.   ``Talk About Clusterf---': Why Legal Weed Didn't Kill Oregon's Black                                   Market         Cave Junction, Ore.--The first unlicensed cannabis grow       popped up near Gary Longnecker's remote Southern Oregon home       seven years ago. Now there are six farms surrounding the       densely-forested property. ``Last night I woke up at 12:30       with gunshots. [Then again] this morning, seven o'clock,''       Longnecker said as he and I walked his land in November.       ``That's them intimidating all of us neighbors to keep out of       their face.'' A Vietnam veteran and former firefighter,       Longnecker retired to the woods of southern Oregon almost 30       years ago to get some peace and quiet, but that's not exactly       what he's found. Historically a logging community, the       residents of the Illinois Valley near Cave Junction are still       drastically outnumbered by trees--and they prefer it that       way. In most places, you could yell at the top of your lungs       from your front door without another soul hearing. Many       people in the county own a gun, and typically aim them at       deer or bears--not their neighbors. But since the cannabis       farmers moved in (none of whom appear to be licensed based on       state records), Longnecker says he's had bullets whiz by his       head when working outside, and regularly hears gunshots in       the middle of the night. Trash and toilet paper are littered       around the thin wire fence that separates his forested land       from each cannabis farm. As Longnecker gave me a tour of his       property, a few people could be seen moving around on the       property through the scattered pine trees and partially-      deconstructed hoop houses. Longnecker's partner called out to       them in broken Spanish, since she believed  [[Page H4089]]       most of the workers were Hispanic. No one answered. A few       moments later, shots rang out. ``So that's called       intimidation,'' Longnecker said as we hurried away. It's a       word that I heard often when I spoke with residents about       their marijuana-growing neighbors. Over the last two years,       there's been such an influx of outlaw farmers that southern       Oregon now rivals California's notorious Emerald Triangle as       a national center of illegal weed cultivation. Even though       marijuana cultivation has been legal in Oregon since 2014,       Jackson County Sheriff Nate Sickler says there could be up to       1,000 illegal operations in a region of more than 4,000       square miles. The Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission,       which oversees the state's $1.2 billion legal cannabis       industry, estimates the number of illicit operations is       double that. Local law enforcement officials believe that       people from every U.S. state and as many as 20 countries have       purchased property in Jackson or Josephine counties. Cartels       roll in and offer long-time residents as much as a million       dollars in cash for their property, and hoop houses follow       soon after the sale is complete. Residents have become       accustomed to hearing Bulgarian, Chinese, Russian and even       Hebrew spoken at the grocery store. ``Two weeks ago, we took       down a Bulgarian operation and in the same week an       Argentinian operation,'' said Josephine County Sheriff Dave       Daniel, adding that they've also recently dealt with Chinese-       and Mexican-run oufits. ``A lot of these organizations,       before the legal market came into effect, would grow in the       forest lands--they'd be up in the hills,'' explained Obie       Strickler, a licensed cannabis grower in Josephine County.       ``Now they're . . . right out in the open.'' What is       happening in the woods of the southern Oregon represents one       of the most confounding paradoxes of the legalized marijuana       movement: States with some of the largest legal markets are       also dealing with rampant illegal production--and the problem       is getting worse. Oklahoma, where licenses to cultivate       medical marijuana are some of the easiest to get in the       nation, has conducted more than five dozen raids on illicit       grows since last April. In California, meanwhile, most of the       state continues to purchase cannabis from unlicensed       sources--straining legal operators already struggling with       the state's high taxes and fees. It wasn't supposed to be       this way. One of the underlying promises for legalizing       cannabis was that legalization would make the illegal drug       trade, with all its attendant problems of violent crime and       money laundering, disappear. But 25 years into the       legalization movement, as 36 states have adopted some form of       legalized marijuana, the black market is booming across the       country. Legal states such as Oregon and California--which       have been supplying the nation for nigh on 60 years--are       still furnishing the majority of America's illegal weed.        Oregon's weed is some of the cheapest in the nation, and       Oregonians predominantly purchase weed from licensed       dispensaries. Economist Beau Whitney estimates that 80-85       percent of the state's demand is met by the legal market. But       most of the illicit weed grown in southern Oregon is leaving       the state, heading to places where legal weed is still not       available for purchase `such as New York or Pennsylvania--or       where the legal price is still very high, like Chicago and       Los Angeles. In Illinois, which legalized medical marijuana       in 2013, only about a third of the demand for cannabis is       satisfied by legal dispensaries, according to Whitney.       Differences in tax rate and regulations plays the major role       in differences from state to state, Whitney explains.       Unlicensed growers aren't paying any fees or taxes, and they       can afford to keep their prices at least 20 percent lower       than legal weed--the benchmark Whitney says is the difference       in consumers purchasing legal versus illegal products.        ``It all comes down to economics,'' said Whitney. ``If you       reduce the price, then there's no, or little, or less,       incentive [for consumers] to participate in [the] illicit       market because you're getting the price that you want . . .       that's the tipping point.'' The macro-economics of the       marijuana market are small consolation to residents of       Oregon, who say they are caught in a regulatory gap between       state law, which fully legalized cannabis in 2014, and       federal law, which still considers cannabis to be as illegal       as heroin. The one exception in federal law is for hemp, a       low-THC cannabis plant which looks virtually identical to the       naked eye. Officials say that some of Oregon's illegal farms       are masquerading as hemp producers to escape federal       oversight. There are just more than 1,000 licensed marijuana       and hemp farms in Jackson and Josephine counties, but a       recent test of the region's hemp farms found that more than       half were illegally growing marijuana--not the low-THC hemp.       ``[They] easily danced into the hemp program and got       administrative protection,'' said Oregon Liquor and Cannabis       Commission Executive Director Steve Marks. ``They inundated       that program.'' On top of that, there could be a thousand or       more unlicensed grows that never bothered with a hemp       license. The impact of the booming illegal trade is being       felt by overburdened law enforcement that can't keep up with       the illegal operations that seem to sprout with abandon, but       it is also exhausting the patience of residents who were key       to making Oregon one of the first states to legalize medical       marijuana in the late 1990s. ``The danger of what's going on       and the fear and worry folks in southern Oregon are feeling       about their safety cannot be overstated,'' Sen. Ron Wyden (D-      Ore.), the influential chairman of the Finance Committee,       told POLITICO in December. ``And it's all the more reason why       federal cannabis prohibition is just not working.'' Nicole       Rensenbrink, a 62-year-old social worker, travels daily along       a curving two-lane road that weaves between groves of tall       trees and dozens of farms before finally passing the local       high school. Along her seven-minute commute to work, she       passes 14 marijuana cultivation or processing sites. She's       not an expert, but she can tell that many of them are illegal       by the lack of proper signs and the number of hoop houses       that exceed the legal limits. But it's the unforeseen       consequences--the damage to the environment, not to mention a       general fear for her safety--that most troubles her. ``I and       my husband both voted for cannabis legalization. I'm liberal,       [an] old hippie type. I don't want people to go to jail for       smoking pot or dealing a little weed.'' Rensenbrink said.       ``But I regret it. At this point, I really regret it. People       have grown marijuana illegally in southern Oregon for at       least half a century. It was easy to conceal illicit activity       in private woods and national forests when the nearest human       could easily be a few miles away. But there's nothing hidden       about what's going on now. The Red Mountain Golf Course, a       24-acre plot of land just outside Grants Pass, the county       seat, sold for just over half a million dollars in June 2021.       Three months later, Josephine County Sheriffs and Oregon       State Troopers raided the former golf course and seized more       than 4,000 marijuana plants and arrested two people on       charges of felony marijuana manufacture. It wasn't an       isolated incident. Around the same time, law enforcement       seized 380 pounds of processed marijuana stuffed in a car       abandoned at the scene of a crash. Cops also seized 7,600       marijuana and hemp plants, 5,000 pounds of processed       marijuana and $210,000 in cash from two grow operations just       outside Cave Junction. Two men were arrested and held for       unlawful manufacture of a marijuana item and other       charges. While these eyepopping figures draw headlines,       the raids are just a cost of doing business for the       cartels, according to law enforcement officials. Many buy       or lease six or seven properties, knowing that some might       get shut down by the police. Like any smart entrepreneurs,       the cartels budget for those losses. ``They know that the       resources for law enforcement and our ability to combat       this issue [are such that] they can overwhelm us,'' Daniel       said. The proliferation of unlicensed cannabis farms is       scaring local residents and scarring the landscape.       Personal wells have run dry and rivers have been illegally       diverted. Piles of trash litter abandoned grow sites.       Locals report having knives pulled on them, and growers       showing up on their porches with guns to make demands       about local water use. Multiple women say they've been       followed long distances by strange vehicles. Locals       regularly end conversations with an ominous warning: ``Be       careful.'' Debbie, who retired from the Napa County       Sheriff's Department in California, has little faith in       Josephine County's law enforcement. Debbie, who requested       her last name not be used for fear of reprisal from the       drug dealers, says that officers didn't show up when ten       gun shots whizzed past her husband's head while he was       sitting on the porch, or when the neighbor's pit bulls       chased her from the mailbox back up to her own home. When       Debbie reported her neighbors to the sheriff's department,       they asked her to photograph the license plates of the       growers next door, but she was spotted taking pictures.        ``[The growers] stalked me and chased me all the way down       Placer Road,'' she said.        The problem has gotten so bad that residents and local       officials have called for the Oregon National Guard to be       called in. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown hasn't taken that step       yet, but in December she called a special session in which       lawmakers approved $25 million to address Oregon's illicit       grows. $20 million of that funding is designated for law       enforcement to increase staff and resources, while $5 million       is dedicated for oversight of water use and water theft.       Earlier in the year, the legislature passed a bill, sponsored       by Republican state Rep. Lily Morgan, that increased       penalties for growing cannabis illegally and gave state       regulators the authority to investigate hemp growers. Jackson       County Sheriff Nate Sickler says the tougher rules for hemp       cultivation and the money lawmakers funneled to local       enforcement efforts are an excellent start.        ``If we're able to get our positions funded, I really think       we can make a significant impact [on] illegal marijuana,''       said Sickler. ``Are they going to go away? It's probably       never going to happen.'' The illicit market isn't just a law       enforcement problem, however; it's actually having an effect       on the environmental health of the region.        Chris Hall has spent months surveilling cannabis farms in       Josephine County's Illinois River Valley from the air. The       community organizer with the Illinois Valley Soil & Water       Conservation District is compiling a map of illicit grows       checked against state licensing information.        On a weekday afternoon in November, Hall explored the       debris-filled Q Bar X Ranch site, taking photographs for his       records. In August, it took about 250 law enforcement       officers--called in from state and federal agencies--to raid       the ranch. Officials seized 200,000 marijuana plants and       found more than 130 workers at the site, according to the       Josephine County Sheriff's department. At the main site, a       new fence with ``no trespassing'' signs warned off curious       visitors.  [[Page H4090]]       Behind that fence were the ruins of a massive cannabis       operation: multiple white hoop houses, now in tatters;       ramshackle buildings where workers likely lived; PVC pipes,       tarps, buckets, and empty containers of fertilizer and       pesticides.        Down the road, the second site was in an even greater state       of disarray. Huge gashes had been cut into the earth, and a       crevice was filled with bottles of fertilizer and pesticides.       The banks of a stream were laden with what seemed like the       contents of an entire convenience store snack and soda       section. ``You want to talk about clusterf---, here it is,''       Hall said, shaking his head as he saw that the creek       bisecting the grow site was lined with plastic. ``The [creek]       bed is the most sensitive natural habitat that we have,''       Hall said. ``To line it with plastic, particularly black       plastic, is to kill everything underneath it.'' Hall was       hired because the soil and water district was inundated       with complaints from local residents about the negative       impacts on their water sources. The $5 million that       Morgan's bill recently allocated for water-resource issues       is meant to address this problem.        Reclaiming land and waterways after illicit growing occurs,       though, is an expensive and complex undertaking. A U.S. House       member proposed allocating $25 million in last year's federal       budget for shuttering and reclaiming grow sites on national       forest land, though it was removed from the final bill. Even       if that funding eventually gets approved, it could only be       used to target a small sliver of the illicit grows in       Josephine and Jackson counties, since most are on private       property.        ``If this was going on [closer to Eugene or Portland], you       better believe the state of Oregon would stomp this out in a       hot second,'' Hall said--but added that many of the region's       residents are famously resistant to government intervention,       especially from the state capitol four hours north. ``You       know, sometimes you get what you asked for. . . . [Southern       Oregonians] have been telling [the state government] to leave       you alone, so we're gonna just leave you alone.''        There are as many suggested solutions to southern Oregon's       weed problem as there are factors creating it. Some say       tweaks to federal and state hemp regulations--and more money       for law enforcement--will get the illicit grows under       control. Others argue that only federal decriminalization       will solve the problem, because it would reduce the market       for illicit weed.        Anti-legalization advocates, meanwhile, point to Oregon's       woes as proof that legalization doesn't live up to its       promise of eliminating the illicit market.        ``Legalization exacerbates the issue of illicit growing       operations because it increases the demand for the product,''       Kevin Sabet told POLITICO. ``With more users emerging       throughout the state, more sellers--both legal and illegal--      begin working to match the supply. The state has done little       to curb demand because it has little incentive to do so.''        On the last point, John Hudak of the Brookings Institute       says that the rampant illicit operations in Oregon aren't       likely to be replicated in more densely-populated states like       Connecticut or Rhode Island. ``I don't think there's a direct       connection between legalization and this situation       happening,'' said Hudak, an expert on cannabis policy who       also volunteers as part of the Coalition for Cannabis Policy,       Education, and Regulation--a think tank funded in part by       Molson Coors and Constellation Brands (which owns Corona).       Constellation Brands has already entered the cannabis       beverage market. ``There's sort of geographic aspects to why       it thrives in certain states,'' Hudak added. ``This is more       likely to happen on a large scale in larger states with rural       spaces than it would be in smaller, urban states.'' Instead,       Hudak argues that the illicit market will continue to thrive       in legal states as long as cannabis remains federally       illegal. It isn't clear when full legalization could happen,       though--if ever. A federal decriminalization bill proposed in       2021 by Wyden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen.       Cory Booker (D-NJ) has only been seen by the general public       in draft form, and it isn't clear when it will be formally       introduced in Congress. The draft version of that       decriminalization bill would levy high taxes against the       cannabis industry, which Whitney, the economist, argues would       push prices higher and give illicit growers continued market       access.        Cautionary tales like Oregon's won't move the federal       needle, either, Hudak cautions. The lawmakers who understand       the impact of the federal-state cannabis policy gap, he says,       are the ones who already support legalization. Moreover,       there have already been many other stories about the problems       created by the policy gap--such as the impact siloed markets       have on the environment or the inability of cannabis farmers       and store owners to get reliable insurance to cover looters       or forest fires--and federal policy has remained the same.        The problem, cannabis advocates say, is not that       legalization has failed. Rather it's that the country hasn't       legalized enough. Until many more states--and the federal       government--decide to legalize cannabis, those advocates say,       the illicit weed problem is going to continue, even in legal       states. The patchwork of still-illegal states--including some       of the country's most populous--creates tootempting a       market for illicit growers.        ``We don't have a [moonshine] business in the country . . .       that is challenging Budweiser or Grey Goose,'' Hudak said.       ``Alcohol is widespread legal. And until we get on that same       page with cannabis, this is going to be a continuing       problem.''        The OLCC's Marks, though, argues that blanket legalization       won't solve all of the problems because hemp and marijuana       will still be regulated separately at the federal level--hemp       through the Department of Agriculture and marijuana through       the FDA or the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.        ``Frankly, the federal government has plenty of       responsibility and accountability for the regulation of legal       hemp and THC,'' Marks said. ``Making regulators bifurcate the       plan under an old federal definition of marijuana and a newer       one of hemp is creating unaccountability, craziness and a bad       market.'' Oregon tweaked its hemp rules this year to make THC       testing more enforceable. Meanwhile, the 2023 farm bill is up       for discussion in Washington, D.C. this year, but there has       not been much chatter on Capitol Hill about making hemp       oversight more stringent.        Economist Beau Whitney argues that focusing on hemp       regulations is a misplaced solution because many cartels       don't bother to hide behind hemp licenses.        ``They're focusing in on small hemp farmers instead of the       real problem, which is international cartels,'' Whitney said.       ``Until there's some way in which to have a coordinated       enforcement against the illicit cartels, this is going to       perpetuate.''        While experts and lawmakers in Salem and Washington, D.C.       go back and forth over the solutions, southern Oregonians       will continue to live with the impact of divergent cannabis       laws. ``The people in Salem and the people in Grants Pass       don't understand that we're living under this intimidation,''       Gary Longnecker said, talking about the Oregon state capital       and his county's seat of government. ``To sit here and be       ignored by the people who are supposed to represent you, not       even get a staff member to call you back, is so, so       frustrating,'' he said. He's glad that Oregon's legislature       adopted tougher rules for hemp growers, but doesn't think       it's nearly enough to solve the problem. ``You can't just       keep throwing a little bit of money out [here], because . . .       it's like whack a mole. Take this one out, and four more pop       up over here.''     Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely essential that any bill  legalizing marijuana include significant funding for law enforcement  which will be absolutely and predictably necessary to control the  cartels that will flood into the farming areas such as southern Oregon.   Simply setting up a penalty, as this bill does, for failing to  register will not work without the concurrent means of enforcement. Do  not let the defunding-the-police thinking that currently is in this  bill lead the Nation into the same ecological human and social disaster  we now face in Oregon.   The bill fails to address impairment. It fails to address the ever- increasing potency of the drug. It fails to address the age at which  marijuana could be legally used.   It fails to address the impact the bill's 5 percent and quickly  rising to 8 percent gross receipts tax, when added to the State and  local taxes, will have in driving the black market sources of  marijuana. The Federal tax, when added in, will make legal marijuana  almost 30 percent more expensive than that which is on the black  market.   The bill fails to correctly clarify the differences between marijuana  and hemp. This is essential if the hemp market is to be protected from  the policies and regulations associated with marijuana.   This bill is the wrong approach.   We should be addressing the crises created by the Biden  administration, not passing an incomplete, inadequate, and damaging to  our children and communities stimulus marijuana bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to mention that I have read the  bill very carefully, and there is nothing in the bill allocating money  to law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Good).    Mr. Speaker, I just want to mention that there is about  $400 million that would have been raised last year under this bill had  this tax been in place, and none of that money goes to public safety.  It goes to rebuild community space but not public safety.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In response to this bill helping farmers, I just want to say it does  not. What it does is it puts a tax on top of their product. When added  to the Oregon tax, it would be almost 30 percent. That does not  encourage farmers to raise the crop because they can't compete against  the black market. There has to be far more thought given to what will  be an 8 percent additional cost.   By the way, it is a gross receipts tax. It is on top of the gross  receipts, not that net profit that you are supposed to get.   Secondly, the bill, as written, fails to distinguish between hemp and  marijuana. This must be done if the folks in each space are going to  grow properly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that it was noted that we  never asked the people if they would support legalization of marijuana.  That is not correct. North Dakota Measure 3 failed. Missouri  Proposition C to legalize marijuana failed. Ohio Issue 3 failed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to my friend and former law school classmate,  Representative Blumenauer--he was a few years ahead of me--I just want  to draw attention to the bill, page 15, where it calls out the  expenditures. It says: The amounts in the trust fund shall be  available, without further appropriation, only as follows. And then it  reflects section 3052(a) part 00 of the Omnibus Crime Control Safe  Streets Act of 1968, which I dug out and read through three times,  looking unsuccessfully for an allocation of money to local law  enforcement agencies, such as the ones in southern Oregon. It is not  there. That money is going for very limited and very narrow purposes.   How much money? Well, if this 8 percent tax had been applied to the  amount of marijuana sold last year in the United States, the total is  $400 million. That is not the total sold; it is the total tax, $400  million, half of which would go to this narrow piece of work. I am not  saying it is unimportant, but narrow.   There is 50 percent called out here, then 10 percent, then 25  percent, but none to police. What I am trying to say is, yes, you have  taken this up--do it right. Get it right. And you have a whole bunch of  work that needs to be done to get this bill right.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say again, I went down to southern Oregon  and I asked the law enforcement folks what we needed to do to try to  head off the cartels which are generating this huge sum of money for  themselves. What could we do? And the answer was, law enforcement. If  you don't have force, you can't control the cartels.   To get law enforcement it requires people and that requires money and  this bill doesn't allocate any for that purpose. Since we know this  bill is going to drive up the cost of legal marijuana, thus driving  more people into the black market, why isn't there more money for law  enforcement? Why isn't there any money for law enforcement?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to assure everyone that the police in Oregon  are not chasing those who are using marijuana. Oregon legalized  marijuana. What we are having trouble with are the consequences of that  legalization. That is what I am trying to bring to the attention of  folks today that if we are going to legalize on a national scale then,  for goodness' sake, don't make the mistakes we made in Oregon, get it  right.   Put into the bill appropriate funding for law enforcement. By the  way, we should put in a lot of other things that I previously  mentioned. One of the things that absolutely has to be there is funding  for local police because this bill is going to drive up the demand for  marijuana and up the cartels across the United States. It is bad and  local law enforcement can't take care of it.   The assertion that the FBI and Homeland Security and DEA are going to  do so is incorrect. I know because I have asked. We have nothing from  the Attorney General helping us in that space. So what I am saying is,  if you are going to do this, get it right.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to mention in response to the assertion that  once this bill passes, if it does, that suddenly the cartels will  disappear. Sadly, that is not going to be true. That is because legal  marijuana will be 30 percent more expensive than that which is raised  on the black market. That is why one has to be aware when one puts this  kind of additional cost into this bill, 8 percent on a gross basis,  that people need to understand the difference between net profit and  gross.   What is going to happen is the cartels will have a 30 percent benefit  advantage over privately raised marijuana. What I am trying to say is:  Get this bill right. This isn't my thinking. This is people who looked  into this extremely carefully and those that are trying to do this  legally. I am saying this bill is incorrectly crafted on that level and  many others.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

[From the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]                           Marijuana Legalization         The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry       (AACAP) advocates for careful consideration of potential       immediate and downstream effects of marijuana policy changes       on children and adolescents. Marijuana legalization, even if       restricted to adults, may be associated with (a) decreased       adolescent perception of marijuana's harmful effects, (b)       increased marijuana use among parents and caretakers, and (c)       increased adolescent access to marijuana, all of which       reliably predict increased rates of adolescent marijuana use       and associated problems. Marijuana use during pregnancy,       occurring at increasing rates, raises additional concerns       regarding future infant, child, and adolescent development.        AACAP is aware that, among hundreds of chemical       constituents, marijuana contains select individual compounds       that, if safely administered in reliable doses, may       potentially convey therapeutic effects for specific       conditions in specific populations. Advocacy regarding       potential cannabinoid therapeutics, alongside social justice,       public policy, and economic concerns, have contributed to       marijuana policy changes. Amid these factors, AACAP remains       focused on concerns regarding adolescent marijuana use.        Adolescents are especially vulnerable to marijuana's many       known adverse effects. One in six adolescent marijuana users       develops cannabis use disorder, a well characterized syndrome       involving tolerance, withdrawal, and continued use despite       significant associated impairments. Selective breeding has       increased marijuana's addictive potency and potential harm to       adolescents. Heavy use during adolescence is associated with       increased incidence and worsened course of psychotic, mood,       anxiety, and substance use disorders. Furthermore,       marijuana's deleterious effects on adolescent cognition,       behavior, and brain development may have immediate and long-      term implications, including increased risk of motor vehicle       accidents, sexual victimization, academic failure, lasting       decline in intelligence measures, psychopathology, addiction,       and psychosocial and occupational impairment.        Marijuana-related policy changes, including legalization,       may have significant unintended consequences for children and       adolescents. AACAP supports (a) initiatives to increase       awareness of marijuana's harmful effects on adolescents, (b)       improved access to evidence-based treatment for adolescents       with marijuana-related problems, and (c) careful monitoring       of the effects of marijuana-related policy changes on child       and adolescent mental health. Finally, AACAP strongly       advocates for the involvement of  [[Page H4098]]       the medical and research community in these critical and       highly impactful policy-related discussions.                                   ____                             Marijuana and Teens         Many teenagers try marijuana and some use it regularly.       Teenage marijuana use is at its highest level in 30 years,       and today's teens are more likely to use marijuana than       tobacco. Many states allow recreational use of marijuana in       adults ages 21 and over. Recreational marijuana use by       children and teenagers is not legal in anywhere in the United       States. Today's marijuana plants are grown differently than       in the past and can contain two to three times more       tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the ingredient that makes people       high. The ingredient of the marijuana plant thought to have       most medical benefits, cannabidiol (CBD), has not increased       and remains at about 1 percent.        There are many ways people can use marijuana. This can make       it harder for parents to watch for use in their child. These       include:        Smoking the dried plant (buds and flowers) in a rolled       cigarette (joint), pipe, or bong        Smoking liquid or wax marijuana in an electronic cigarette,       also known as vaping        Eating ``edibles'' which are baked goods and candies       containing marijuana products        Drinking beverages containing marijuana products        Using oils and tinctures that can be applied to the skin        Other names used to describe marijuana include weed, pot,       spliffs, or the name of the strain of the plant. There are       also synthetic (man-made) marijuana-like drugs such as ``K2''       and ``Spice.'' These drugs are different from marijuana and       are more dangerous. Additionally, the products being sold in       dispensaries currently are not subject to Food and Drug       Administration standards and are not purely isolated       cannabinoids; they are therefore not reliable in their       potency/concentration of CBD or THC, or the inclusion of       other ingredients.                            Parents and Prevention         Parents can help their children learn about the harmful       effects of marijuana use. Talking to your children about       marijuana at an early age can help them make better choices       and may prevent them from developing a problem with marijuana       use later. Begin talking with your child in an honest and       open way when they are in late elementary and early middle       school. Youth are less likely to try marijuana if they can       ask parents for help and know exactly how their parents feel       about drug use.        Tips on discussing marijuana with your child:        Ask what they have heard about using marijuana. Listen       carefully, pay attention, and try not to interrupt. Avoid       making negative or angry comments.        Offer your child facts about the risks and consequences of       smoking marijuana.        Ask your child to give examples of the effects of       marijuana. This will help you make sure that your child       understands what you talked about.        If you choose to talk to your child about your own       experiences with drugs, be honest about why you used and the       pressures that contributed to your use. Be careful not to       minimize the dangers of marijuana or other drugs, and be open       about any negative experiences you may have had. Given how       much stronger marijuana is today, its effect on your child       would likely be much different than what you experienced.        Explain that research tells us that the brain continues to       mature into the 20s. While it is developing, there is greater       risk of harm from marijuana use.        Sometimes parents may suspect that their child is already       using marijuana. The following are common signs of marijuana       use:        Acting very silly and out of character for no reason        Using new words and phrases like ``sparking up,'' ``420,''       ``dabbing,'' and ``shatter''        Having increased irritability        Losing interest in and motivation to do usual activities        Spending time with peers that use marijuana        Having trouble remembering things that just happened        Carrying pipes, lighters, vape pens, or rolling papers        Coming home with red eyes and/or urges to eat outside of       usual mealtimes        Stealing money or having money that cannot be accounted for                             Effects of Marijuana         Many teenagers believe that marijuana is safer than alcohol       or other drugs. When talking about marijuana with your child,       it is helpful to know the myths and the facts. For example,       teenagers may say, ``it is harmless because it is natural,''       ``it is not addictive,'' or ``it does not affect my thinking       or my grades.''        However, research shows that marijuana can cause serious       problems with learning, feelings, and health.        Short-term use of marijuana can lead to:        School difficulties        Problems with memory and concentration        Increased aggression        Car accidents        Use of other drugs or alcohol        Risky sexual behaviors        Worsening of underlying mental health conditions including       mood changes and suicidal thinking        Increased risk of psychosis        Interference with prescribed medication        Regular use of marijuana can lead to significant problems       including Cannabis Use Disorder. Signs that your child has       developed Cannabis Use Disorder include using marijuana more       often than intended, having cravings, or when using       interferes with other activities. If someone with Cannabis       Use Disorder stops using suddenly, they may suffer withdrawal       symptoms that, while not dangerous, can cause irritability,       anxiety, and changes in mood, sleep, and appetite.        Long-term use of marijuana can lead to:        Cannabis Use Disorder        The same breathing problems as smoking cigarettes       (coughing, wheezing, trouble with physical activity, and lung       cancer)        Decreased motivation or interest which can lead to decline       in academic or occupational performance        Lower intelligence        Mental health problems, such as schizophrenia, depression,       anxiety, anger, irritability, moodiness, and risk of suicide                              Medical Marijuana         Some teens justify use of marijuana because it is used for       medical purposes. Marijuana use with a prescription for a       medical reason is called ``medical marijuana.'' Laws for       medical marijuana are rapidly changing and are different from       state to state. In some states, children of any age can get       medical marijuana if they have a ``qualifying medical       condition.'' There is very limited research supporting use of       medical marijuana in children or teens for most conditions.       In most states that allow medical marijuana, the marijuana is       not regulated and therefore is not checked for ingredients,       purity, strength or safety. There is no evidence that medical       marijuana is any safer than other marijuana.                              Cannabidiol (CBD)         Many parents have questions about CBD and how it may be       helpful for their child. There is ongoing research on the use       of CBD-containing products for conditions such as epilepsy,       PTSD, Tourette's disorder, pain, and other diagnoses. For       now, the use of CBD is only FDA-approved in children for       specific forms of epilepsy and in adults for chemotherapy       induced nausea and vomiting. At this time, there is not       enough evidence to recommend CBD for other uses, in children       and adolescents including the treatment of autism and other       developmental disorders. The approved CBD requires a       prescription. Many stores sell CBD products. However, there       are no safety and quality requirements for non-prescription       CBD. They may have harmful additives or interfere with       prescription medication. If you are considering using CBD for       your child, please discuss this with their physician prior to       starting to prevent harmful effects.                                  Conclusion         Marijuana use in teens can lead to long-term consequences.       Teens rarely think they will end up with problems related to       marijuana use, so it is important to begin talking about the       risks with your child early and continue this discussion over       time. Talking with your child about marijuana can help delay       the age of first use and help protect their brain. If your       child is already using marijuana, try asking questions in an       open and curious way as your teen will talk more freely if       not feeling judged. If you have concerns about your child's       drug use, talk with your child's pediatrician or a qualified       mental health professional.                                   ____          [From the Insurance Information Institute, June 24, 2021]               Background On: Marijuana and Impaired Driving                                   overview         More states are passing legislation permitting medical and/      or recreational marijuana use, which raises concerns about       users driving under the influence of marijuana. This piece       will discuss:        Marijuana consumption and characteristics of marijuana       impairment; Marijuana legalization's impact on auto       accidents; Difficulties related to measuring user impairment;       and Insurance impacts.                            historical perspective         Marijuana is a type of hemp plant of the species Cannabis       sativa L., part of the genus Cannabis L. Unlike industrial       hemp, however, marijuana contains appreciable arnounts of       delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive       cannabinoid--it's the active chemical that induces user       intoxication. The plant also contains several other, non-      psychoactive cannabinoids such as ``cannabidiol'' (CBD).        There is evidence that cannabis has been consumed for       thousands of years, often for medicinal purposes. The plant       was used as a patent medicine in the U.S. since at least       1850, when the United States Pharmacopoeia described the       plant for the first time. Cannabis was first regulated under       federal law under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.        Marijuana was subsequently subjected to countrywide       prohibition under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970       (CSA), which established a schedule for substances regulated       under federal law. Marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug       under the CSA, which defines Schedule I drugs as substances       that have ``no currently accepted medical use in the United       States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical       supervision, and a high potential for abuse.'' Other       substances under Schedule I include heroin, LSD, and peyote.        Despite the treatment of marijuana under federal law, in       1996 California became the first state in the U.S. to pass       legislation permitting a medical marijuana program. By  [[Page H4099]]       April 2021, 36 states and the District of Columbia have       passed legislation permitting so-called ``comprehensive''       medical marijuana programs, which typically allow qualifying       patients to access marijuana and marijuana-related products.        Since 2012, 18 states and the District of Columbia have       passed legislation permitting anyone over the age of 21 to       possess and use marijuana, subject to certain limitations.       Most of those states also have or are developing regulations       for a commercial market to support recreational marijuana       sales.                             marijuana impairment         The THC in marijuana plants causes intoxication in a user.       (THC levels in other hemp plants are typically so low that       they cannot induce intoxication.)        Effects of marijuana consumption can vary. Marijuana can       affect users differently, depending on a variety of factors,       including user tolerance. Common experiences intoxicated       include feelings of euphoria and relaxation; some may also       experience heightened sensory perceptions and altered       perceptions of time.        Marijuana cannot cause overdose, but can potentially cause       temporary psychosis. There are no documented instances of an       adult dying from an overdose of marijuana alone. However in       rare instances a user may experience a psychotic reaction to       the drug or high levels of anxiety--in some cases, these side       effects could lead a user to seek medical treatment. Such       negative effects are often experienced after consuming edible       marijuana products, which are often more potent and take       longer to induce intoxication.        Method of consumption alters impairment profile. Several       factors influence intoxication onset, intensity, and       duration, including method of consumption, type of marijuana       product consumed, product potency, and user characteristics.        Marijuana and related products can be consumed in several       ways, including inhalation (either by smoking or vaporizing)       of dried plant matter or concentrates (such as hashish or       kief), oral ingestion (edibles, capsules, infusible oils),       sublingual ingestion (lozenges), or topical application       (lotions, salves, oils).        Smoking often causes almost immediate intoxication, with       impairment typically lasting 2 to 4 hours. Intoxication onset       is more delayed for other methods, sometimes up to two hours       for edibles--and impairment may last much longer.        Product potency is dependent on THC levels. Potency varies       considerably across marijuana products and can influence the       degree of impairment. Smokable marijuana plant matter can       range anywhere from 8 percent to 30 percent THC, whereas       high-quality hash oil up to 80 percent THC. There is evidence       that marijuana products have become more potent over time.        User characteristics will also influence impairment. For       example, chronic users may experience less acute impairment       than non-chronic users.                        marijuana and impaired driving         Marijuana intoxication can cause impaired driving, thereby       increasing the risks of accidents. Marijuana legalization is       associated with an increase in impaired driving.        Marijuana impairment degrades cognition and motor skills.       Marijuana alters a user's perception. As such, most studies       agree that marijuana use results in impaired coordination,       memory, associative learning, attention, cognitive       flexibility, and reaction time. Driving ability is thereby       degraded to some degree--but by how much remains a matter of       study and is subject to several factors, including the level       of impairment and user characteristics.        For example, there is some evidence that user impairment       may also result in limited ``compensatory defensive''       driving, in which a user drives more carefully to compensate       for a degradation in motor functioning--but this may only       mitigate degradation for some skills and may not apply to       non-chronic users.        Marijuana impairment increases the risk of accidents.       Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that acute impairment       increases the risk of traffic accidents--though the magnitude       of the increased risk is still a matter of study and can vary       widely, depending on the study.        One literature review found evidence that 20 to 30 percent       of crashes involving marijuana occurred because of the       marijuana use. (This compares to roughly 85 percent of       crashes involving alcohol that occurred because of alcohol       use.) The review estimated that the crash risk increased 22       percent while under the influence of marijuana, controlling       for concurrent alcohol use.        Another review found that someone driving under the       influence of marijuana is 1.65 times more likely to be       culpable in a fatal accident.        The greater the impairment, the worse the driving       abilities. As noted above, level of impairment can influence       the degree to which driving ability degrades. Indeed, there       is evidence that the more impaired the driver, the worse       their driving abilities.        Mixing marijuana and alcohol produces additive effects.       There is evidence that mixing marijuana and alcohol increases       impairment greater than the net effects of each individual       substance. There also may exist the possibility for alcohol       to increase THC levels. Potential compensatory defensive       driving is nullified when a user mixes alcohol and marijuana.        The number of crash rates could increase after       legalization. Researchers at the Insurance Institute for       Highway Safety (IIHS) and the Highway Loss Data Institute       (HLDI) since 2014 have been examining how legalization has       affected crash rates and insurance claims, and evidence is       emerging that crash rates go up when states legalize       recreational use and retail sales of marijuana. The most       recent of these studies released in June 2021 by the IIHS,       shows that injury and fatal crash rates in California,       Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington jumped in the months       following relaxation of marijuana laws in each state. The       five states experienced a 6 percent increase in injury crash       rates and a 4 percent increase in fatal crash rates, compared       with other Western states where recreational marijuana use       was illegal during the study period.        However, only the increase in injury crash rates was       statistically significant. These findings are consistent with       a 2018 IIHS study of police-reported crashes, most of which       did not involve injuries or fatalities. This study found that       legalization of retail sales in Colorado, Oregon       andWashington was associated with a 5 percent higher crash       rate compared with the neighboring control states.        Fatal crashes involving drivers who tested positive for THC       have increased. Some studies indicate that more people with       ``detectible'' levels of THC in their bloodstreams were       involved in fatal accidents after legalization. However, as       discussed below, the mere presence of THC does not       necessarily indicate marijuana impairment. Furthermore,       regarding fatal crash rates overall, at least one study found       no significant annual changes in crash fatality rates       forColorado and Washington when compared to 8 control states.        A 2020 study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety shows       that the percentage of drivers in Washington involved in       fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana increased 100       percent after the state made the drug legal for recreational       use. The study considered the presence of detectable THC in       the blood of fatal-crash-involved drIvers. In general, the       presence of detectable THC in blood suggests, but does not       conclusively prove, that a person has recently used cannabis.        Collision claim frequency appears to have increased.       Insurance records show an increase in claims under collision       coverage, which pays for damage to an at-fault, insured       driver's own vehicle, according to HLDI's latest analysis,       The legalization of retail sales in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon,       and Washington was associated with a 4 percent increase in       collision claim frequency compared with the other Western       states from 2012 to 2019. The 4 percent decline is down       slightly from the 6 percent increase HLDI identified in a       previous study, which covered 2012 to 2018.        Higher risk demographics also have higher rates of       marijuana-impaired driving. Younger drivers are at greater       risk of traffic accidents than older drivers. Younger male       drivers are at high risk of traffic accidents. Early evidence       suggests that younger male drivers are most likely to drive       under the influence of marijuana.        Use of recreational marijuana impairs driving even when the       driver is not high. A study published in the journal Drug and       Alcohol Dependence suggests that chronic, heavy use of       recreational marijuana impairs driving skills even when the       driver is not high. The researchers used a driving simulator       to evaluate the potential impact of cannabis use on driving       performance. The study concluded that driving impairment was       significantly worse among the study participants who began       using marijuana regularly before age 16. The study, by       researchers at Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital,       found that cannabis users hit more pedestrians, exceeded the       speed limit more often, and drove through more red lights       compared with non-users. At the time of the study, the       marijuana users had not used for at least 12 hours and were       not intoxicated.                Determining intoxication: ``THC persistence''         A key issue raised in many studies examining the effects of       marijuana-impaired driving and its risks is ``THC       persistence.'' Unlike alcohol, THC levels in a user's body       may not be an accurate indication of impairment.        Compared with marijuana, determining alcohol intoxication       is relatively straightforward. The human body processes       alcohol at a rate that allows blood alcohol concentration       (BAC) to closely correlate with intoxication, making it an       effective and accurate benchmark for measuring impairment.                                   ____                               [Feb. 17, 2022]                          Is Marijuana Addictive?                      (By Ashley Olivine, Ph.D., MPH)              (Medically reviewed by Isaac O. Opole, MD, PhD)         In light of the legalization of marijuana, many people have       wondered about the substance, its safety, and whether it's       addictive. Marijuana--also called weed, cannabis, and other       names--is a species of plant that is used as a medical and       recreational drug.        People can become addicted to marijuana. While it is       possible to try and use the substance without becoming       addicted, that is not the case for everyone. There are risks       of use, even medicinally, and addiction is one of them.        Like any drug used medicinally, the potential risks of use       are weighed against the potential benefits when deciding what       should  [[Page H4100]]       and should not be tried. Learn more about marijuana       addiction, risk factors, effects on the brain, and more.                           Is marijuana addictive?         While some people can try and use marijuana without       becoming addicted, it can also be addictive for some people.       Marijuana use disorder, also known as cannabis use disorder,       is when the use of marijuana negatively impacts a person's       health or life but they continue to use it anyway.        Although the numbers are not entirely known, it is       estimated that 6.3 percent of adults have experienced       marijuana use disorder, and that percentage is increasing. As       many as 30 percent of people who use marijuana may experience       marijuana use disorder. Marijuana use can also be associated       with addiction and dependency.                           Addiction vs. Dependency         Addiction and dependency are two terms that are often used       interchangeably. There are differences between the two.        Addiction happens when a person uses a substance such as       alcohol, marijuana, or another drug in excess. It is usually       marked by a change in behavior, where the person becomes       consistently focused on using that substance regardless of       potential negative outcomes. Addiction can be physical,       psychological, or both at the same time.        Substance dependence, also called chemical dependence, is       when a person experiences physical dependence on a substance       but is not addicted to it. One example is when a person who       has taken a prescription medication for a long time stops       taking that medication and experiences physical or mental       withdrawal symptoms. Dependence symptoms can be cognitive,       behavioral, and physical. Dependence presents as a pattern. A       person first uses a substance such as marijuana repeatedly.       After regular use over time, they build a tolerance, where       the effects of the substance are not noticed as much or at       all. The person experiences symptoms when they stop using the       substance, which makes them feel the need to use it again.                      Symptoms of Cannabis Use Disorder         Cannabis use disorder, or marijuana use disorder, is when a       person continues to use the substance even though they       experience negative health or life effects from use. Symptoms       include excessive focus on marijuana use; ignoring school,       work, or relationships; other problems caused by marijuana       use such as an inability to resist cravings; and more. These       can range from mild to severe depending on the person.                             Symptoms may include         Changes in sleep, appetite, or mood.        Cravings to use marijuana.        Decreased control of marijuana use.        Decreased fulfillment of responsibilities.        Decline in school, work, or athletic performance.        Headache, abdominal pain, chills, or sweating when not       using.        Needing to use more to get the same effect.        Negative feelings associated with use.        Overuse of marijuana and using more than intended.        Risk-taking behaviors.        Social withdrawal related to marijuana use.                                 Risk Factors         One of the biggest risk factors of marijuana addiction may       be age. People are up to seven times as likely to experience       marijuana use disorder when they start using before the age       of 18. Additionally, men are twice as likely as women to       experience marijuana use disorder.                          Other risk factors include         Family history of substance use disorder.        Friends and peers who use marijuana.        Adverse childhood experiences such as sexual abuse.        Use of cigarettes.        Teenage Drug Addiction: A Complete Guide.        Effect on the Brain.        Marijuana use has a negative impact on the brain. THC,       which stands for tetrahydrocannabinol, is the part of the       cannabis plant that causes the mental effect. THC can cause       changes to the brain that impact the structure and ability to       function, including learning, memory, cognitive ability, and       behavior--including future substance use. This is an       increased concern for younger people exposed to THC,       including babies during pregnancy.        The use of marijuana has also been found to be connected       with lower IQ scores, compromised memory and cognitive       ability, and decreased performance on tests. The negative       effects of use appear to be more of an issue for those who       use more often and over a longer period of time. However,       research is limited and the details of the negative effects       on the brain are not fully understood.                     Is recreational marijuana to blame?         The negative effects of marijuana are not limited to       recreational marijuana. Medicinal marijuana use comes with       risks too. Like other medicinal treatments for medical       conditions, medicinal marijuana can have negative effects       even though it is used to treat medical conditions.        Additionally, over 80 percent of people who use medicinal       marijuana also use it recreationally. This can lead to more       use and an increased risk of marijuana use disorder.        Medicinal Use of Marijuana.        Medicinal marijuana is used to treat and manage a variety       of medical concerns, including physical and mental health       challenges. Despite the risks, studies of medicinal marijuana       use have shown effectiveness. Nearly 90 percent of people who       use medicinal marijuana claim that it helps them to manage       their disease and symptoms, and many find that they are able       to decrease their use of other medications.        The Debate Over the Legalization of Marijuana for Medical Use         Conditions commonly treated with medical marijuana include:        Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS),       Anxiety, Cancer chemotherapy side effects, Crohn's disease,       Depression, Glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Inflammation, Multiple       sclerosis muscle symptoms, Nausea and vomiting, Pain, Post-      traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, Seizures and epilepsy,       Marijuana Addiction Criteria.        The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health       Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) classifies the diagnostic       criteria for cannabis use disorder. Use of the substance must       be associated with impairment or distress. Diagnosis of this       condition requires at least two of the 11 criteria within one       year.                     Cannabis Use Disorder DSM-5 Criteria         More use than intended.        Unable to decrease use despite desire or effort.        Excessive time spent on activities related to use,       including getting access and recovering.        Urges or cravings.        Work, school, or home obligations not fulfilled due to use.        A problem of social or interpersonal problems associated       with use and continued use.        Withdrawal from social, work, or recreational activities       due to use despite importance.        Physically hazardous use.        Knowingly experiencing problems associated with use and       continued use.        Tolerance, defined by either needing more to get the effect       or decreased effect with the same amount.        Withdrawal, defined by either DSM-5 cannabis withdrawal       symptoms or use of a substance to address symptoms of       withdrawal.                        Help for Cannabis Use Disorder         Cannabis use disorder is treatable. This condition can be       diagnosed by a healthcare professional such as a medical       doctor or psychologist. Treatment methods include       psychotherapy (talk therapy) and medications. More       specifically, motivational interviewing, contingency       management, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be       used. Medications to control cravings may be used alongside       nonmedicinal interventions.

Eisenstein)         There has been an increase by up to 6 percent in the number       of highway crashes in four of the states where the       recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, according       to a pair of new studies.        The new reports do not prove there's a direct risk caused       by the use of marijuana among motorists, but they raise       caution flags, especially since there is no easy way to test       drivers to be sure if they are, in fact, under the influence       of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, said David       Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway       Safety's Highway Loss Data Institute.        ``It's certainly early in the game,'' Harkey told NBC News.       But, he warned, ``We're seeing a trend in the wrong       direction.''        There are now 30 states that have legalized the use of       marijuana for medical purposes, with Oklahoma the most recent       to join the list. Nine states and the District of Columbia       now have legalized recreational use. With a Gallup poll       showing 64 percent public support, more states are set to       follow, including Michigan, where recreational use is on the       November ballot.        Since the legalization wave began, safety and health       experts have been trying to measure the potential influence       on highway safety, though the results so far have been       inconsistent and, in some cases, contradictory.        But this is the second year in a row where the IIHS found a       troubling trend. A year ago, the non-profit group looked at       three states, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. This year, it       added Nevada to the list. Harkey said the IIHS also looked at       highway crash data in surrounding states to try to control       for factors like weather and the economy.        The studies looked at police reports and insurance claims,       finding crashes rose between 5.2 percent and 6 percent in       states with legalized recreational marijuana compared to       neighboring states where such use remained illegal.        The IIHS also conducted a street-side study of marijuana       use and found something Harkey said he saw as particularly       concerning. While those under the influence of alcohol tend       to either be driving alone or with other adults, about 14       percent of those confirmed to be using pot had a child in       their vehicle. That reflects the fact, he added, that       marijuana use isn't confined to evenings and other times when       adults are more likely to drink--and abuse--alcohol.  [[Page H4101]]         What is unclear is whether that reflects the increasing use       of recreational pot or the consumption of medical marijuana       to deal with issues like pain or glaucoma, something a       patient may time to need.        Harkey cautioned there are limits to what the studies show.       There is a ``correlation,'' reflecting the fact that crashes       rose once pot became legal, but that is not the same as       ``causation,'' he added, meaning other, unseen factors could       be at work.        That could help explain why earlier studies have often       conflicted over the effects of marijuana on highway safety.       One, released by the University of Colorado in 2014, showed a       surge in fatalities involving stoned drivers. But a study       conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety       Administration in Virginia a year later found no clear       increase in risk.        Part of the problem is that it is difficult to accurately       measure how pot impacts drivers. ``Many studies, using a       variety of methods, have attempted to estimate the risk of       driving after use of marijuana,'' a NHTSA report advised       Congress last year. ``While useful in identifying how       marijuana affects the performance of driving tasks,       experimental and observational studies do not lend themselves       to predicting real-world crash risk.''        Police have a particularly difficult challenge because of       the way marijuana works in the body. Blood alcohol levels       provide a direct correlation showing how much a motorist has       had to drink, with those levels dropping rapidly as someone       sobers up. But while THC levels spike after smoking weed or       eating a consumable, the psychoactive ingredient remains in       the body for weeks, long after it has stopped having any       impact.        With so many more states set to permit the use of the drug,       Harkey said regulators, law enforcement, and medical       authorities need to address ``the challenge'' and come up       with better ways of determining when a driver might be       operating under the influence of marijuana.                                   ____                    [From the Denver Post, Aug. 25, 2017]   Are You High? The Science of Testing for Marijuana Impairment Is Hazy,  and Evolving. Lawmakers, Police, Prosecutors Grapple With How To Define                           Marijuana Impairment.                             (By David Migoya)         There was a time when marijuana was illegal everywhere and       testing for it was as easy as could be.        It didn't matter the level of cannabinoids found in a       person's body. If it was there, they were breaking the law.        It's different now.        The tests have changed from depositing a urine sample into       a cup to drawing blood or offering oral fluids. Also       different is the particular type of cannabinoid--the chemical       compound that reacts in the brain--detected by any of those       tests.        The evolving science of testing for marijuana, and the lack       of consensus over how to measure impairment, is a defining       feature of the drug. It separates marijuana from alcohol and       creates challenges for lawmakers, police and prosecutors, not       to mention users.        The issue is critical as the state moves forward in       determining how to handle driving under the influence of pot.       A Denver Post investigation found that the numbers of drivers       in fatal crashes testing positive for marijuana--though not       necessarily high--is rising sharply, and coroners are finding       higher levels of potency in their tests.        The cannabinoid most widely tested for in the past--known       as carboxy THC--is actually an inactive metabolite that only       indicates prior marijuana use, sometimes as long as a month       ago. In time, other metabolites of THC--short for       tetrahydrocannabinal, the psychoactive ingredient in       marijuana--were found to be better indicators of recent use       and, some say, impairment.        ``Urine testing was established many years ago, and, at the       time, a test was developed to look for carboxy THC since it's       what's there in the highest amount,'' said Sarah Urfer,       president and owner of ChemaTox, a Boulder lab that handles       DUI screening for about three quarters of the law enforcement       agencies in Colorado. ``Nobody thought it mattered what you       were looking for . . . . Early on, scientists didn't know for       sure which of the cannabinoids were responsible for       impairment. They'd measure carboxy and try to correlate it to       impairment.''        But THC is not the same as alcohol. It reacts differently       in the body, it metabolizes differently and its impairing       impact is different. Unlike the 0.08 blood-alcohol level       that's widely accepted as indicative of drunken driving,       establishing a credible level for THC has been elusive.        It is generally accepted that two standard drinks--about 1/      2 ounce of alcohol--in an hour will raise someone's blood-      alcohol level to 0.05, approaching the legal limit. One drink       is a 12-ounce beer, a 1.5-ounce shot of distilled spirit, or       a 6-ounce glass of wine.        For pot, the differences are striking since it depends on       the manner ingested--smoked, edible, concentrate--and how       much. A Johns Hopkins University study from 1995 found that       four puffs of smokable marijuana with 1.75 percent THC       content translates to 57 nanograms per milliliter, and 10       puffs as much as 99 ng/mL. The National Highway Traffic       Safety Administration says levels of 100-200 ng/mL are       ``routinely encountered'' after smoking but quickly       dissipate. Concentrate levels for vapor ingestion are       typically higher, as well as for edibles, although the rate       of distribution into the blood varies considerably.                             feds question tests         NHTSA last month acknowledged these gray areas in a report       to Congress that not only called into question the       reliability of tests to find THC but also noted the problem       with determining whether a driver is too stoned to be behind       the wheel.        In fact, the NHTSA report notes that even though ``research       has demonstrated the potential of marijuana to impair       driving-related skills,'' it lays out a number of other       studies that show pot might not be as bad as the better-      understood effects of alcohol on driving.        ``Many studies, using a variety of methods, have attempted       to estimate the risk of driving after use of marijuana,'' the       NHTSA report noted. ``While useful in identifying how       marijuana affects the performance of driving tasks,       experimental and observational studies do not lend themselves       to predicting real-world crash risk.''        Finding THC isn't so difficult. Making any kind of       universally accepted determination from the results, however,       seems to freeze the legal world in its tracks.        ``Testing for THC in whole blood isn't actually that       hard,'' Urfer said. ``Where the issue comes is with       interpretation and roadside testing.''        Some widely cited studies have offered differing       information about the impact of marijuana on driving. And not       all sides agree which studies are right and which are not.        In 2012, a medical study published in Clinical Chemistry       journal found ``cannabis smoking increases lane weaving and       impaired cognitive functions,'' and that certain THC       concentration levels ``are associated with substantial       driving impairment, particularly in occasional smokers.''        Then came a University of Colorado study--released in 2014,       the year recreational sales of the drug were launched in the       state--that found the proportion of drivers involved in fatal       crashes who tested positive for marijuana use had risen to 10       percent in 2011, up from 5.9 percent in 2009.        But in 2015, NHTSA released a study it conducted in       Virginia that concluded marijuana users had the same chance       of crashing as sober drivers. At nearly the same time, the       Washington Traffic Safety Commission said it believed       marijuana doubles the risk of being in a fatal crash.        Where experts say impairment becomes most noted and is most       alarming to law enforcement because of its prevalence is the       use of alcohol with marijuana, apparently heightening the       effects of each.        In Colorado last year, nearly 36 percent of all drivers       involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana       use also had consumed alcohol, according to the Colorado       Department of Transportation.        ``We're in the infancy with this, and it's very much an       unknown since we don't have the data.'' Greenwood Village       Police Chief John Jackson said. ``We spent 25 or 30 years       figuring out where we were are with alcohol, and finally got       to breathalyzers. There is no field test for marijuana yet.       You will not convince those who believe it's safer that it's       not. It becomes so emotional to the point of irrational.''                             differing approaches         Colorado has established that a THC level of 5 ng/mL is       enough to charge someone with DUI. Unlike alcohol, where a       reading of 0.08 is enough to convict someone of drunken       driving--known as per se evidence that a driver is impaired--      THC levels are only considered as ``permissible inference''       of impairment.        That means that despite the level of Delta-9 THC found in a       driver's blood, a Colorado jury or judge decides whether the       driver was impaired or not.        Washington and Montana, unlike Colorado, treat the same 5       ng/mL level of THC as if it were alcohol, where no other       proof of impairment is needed to convict a driver charged       with DUI. However, 12 states--including Arizona and Utah--      have zero-tolerance policies, so any detectable amount of THC       can lead to a conviction.        In its recent report to Congress, NHTSA questioned the THC       levels states use to charge someone with impaired driving,       calling them ``artificial.''        ``A number of states have set a THC limit . . . indicating       that if a suspect's THC concentration is above that level, .       . . then the suspect is to be considered impaired,'' the       agency said in its report. ``This per se limit appears to       have been based on something other than scientific       evidence.''        Urfer agreed.        ``Permissible inference is a government-derived number that       was part of the discussion around legalization.'' said Urfer,       who spoke before the committees that prepared for Amendment       64, the voter initiative that legalized recreational       marijuana use in Colorado. ``I've always said 5 (ng/mL) was a       bad number.''        That's because of how THC works its way through a person's       system, Urfer said, noting that if a single number had to be       used, then using none at all makes the best sense ``since       it's already illegal to drive when under the influence of a       drug.''        ``Impairment drops off over the next two to four hours,''       she said of marijuana use. ``The levels of THC drop off       astronomically fast. But that drop-off in blood is       distributing into the brain and the muscles of the body. And       impairment comes from the brain.''        That means blood levels of THC are probably far lower at       the time a test is done than  [[Page H4102]]       at the time of a crash or other traffic infraction. Yet, the       THC is still in the driver's system--just not in their blood.       That's led lawyers and others to contend that someone isn't       actually impaired if their THC level is below 5 ng/mL.        ``The public is misinterpreting the statement that you       can't tell if someone's high because of the THC level,''       Urfer said. ``You can't directly correlate a number to       impairment. The blood level for THC does not represent the       same as alcohol does.''        THC levels hit their peak nearly instantaneously at the       time someone uses marijuana and dissipate very quickly.       What's detected in the blood is typically much lower than it       had been at the time of use, especially when a sample is       taken long after a crash occurs.        ``The level in the blood is dropping, but the level in the       brain is not,'' Urfer said. ``The high is caused by the level       in the brain, not in the blood. And no one has published a       study that says it's safe to drive high.''        As expected, there has been strong push-back from the       marijuana industry, which says the only thing understood       about THC levels is that very little is understood.        ``There needs to be better understanding about what       constitutes impairment,'' said Kristi Kelly, executive       director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a Colorado trade       organization. ``The science on cannabis metabolism doesn't       support the legal 5 ng/mL limit in Colorado, which can be       present for days and weeks after consumption.''        Roadside testing could be improving, with the advent of a       saliva test that could bring more immediate and reliable       information about the level of active THC in a person's       system. The Colorado State Patrol has been using it in       preliminary tests to determine its reliability.        ``The inference is that at or above 5 (ng/ml.), you're       high, but there should be no inference that below 5 you're       sober,'' Urfer said. ``But people genuinely believe they can       use an impairing substance, feel high and still think they       can be safe to drive. They rationalize: `Marijuana is legal.       Why can't I drive on it?' They say it all the time. It's       odd.''                                   ____                     [From Bloomberg News, Jan. 24, 2022]      U.S. Grapples With How To Gauge Just How High Cannabis Users Are                             (By Tiffany Kary)                  Impairment tests are becoming big business         ``Walk a straight line'' isn't going to cut it anymore as       police and employers grapple with growing use of marijuana.        Earlier this month, a study in a peer-reviewed journal       became the latest sign that there's a paradigm shift going on       in the nascent business of detecting impairment levels. The       article, which appeared Neuropsychopharmacology, showed that       an imaging technique can detect cannabis impairment with 76%       accuracy. That's better than the 68% accuracy of field tests       that employ traditional law enforcement protocols such as       walking a straight line and examining a subject's pupils.        The technique, called functional near-infrared       spectroscopy, measures changes in the prefrontal cortex of       the brain. It shows that impaired brains look different than       non-impaired brains in a way that doesn't necessarily       correlate with the amount of THC in a person's system. THC       detection in saliva or on the breath has so far been the main       focus of tests. The study was carried out on 169 people at       Massachusetts General Hospital, which is part of Harvard       Medical School.        The study is a big deal for the cannabis industry, since       the lack of a clear test to gauge intoxication has become a       stumbling block for federal legalization. Though links       between marijuana and accidents have been hard to draw due to       factors such as the frequent mixing of alcohol with drugs,       the study estimates that THC, which is the psychoactive       ingredient in cannabis, at least doubles the risk of fatal       motor vehicle crashes.        The research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice has       acknowledged that field sobriety tests and THC levels are       unreliable measures of marijuana intoxication. Methods like       the ``one-leg stand'' and ``walk 11d turn'' weren't affected       by marijuana highs, and some people had poor functions even       when their THC levels were low.                               states' efforts         States have forged ahead nevertheless. According to New       Frontier Data, at least five opted protocols that set a legal       limit for driving based on the level of THC in the body. That       has sparked a lot of interest in tests that can actually       measure that level--a scientific challenge unto itself.        ``Everybody wants a cannabis breathalyzer--something like       what we have for alcohol where you breathe into a device and       it tells a THC level and whether that means you're impaired       or not,'' said Jodi Gilman, an associate professor in       psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the       imaging study. ``But that's not how it works for cannabis, we       need a new paradigm.''        Companies have been trying to crack the stoned-test for a       while. Hound Labs, which makes a marijuana breathalyzer, said       in September it had raised $20 million to scale its product.       Cannabix Technologies, Inc. recently reported it had made       headway creating a more portable device, while Lifeloc       Techtologies Inc. said it was finalizing the platform for a       rapid marijuana breathalyzer that could be used for roadside       testing.        There are concerns, however, that tests based on THC levels       may be unfair to those their system but aren't actually       impaired. This can be the case for some who consumed cannabis       days ago, or with frequent users who've built up a       tolerance--who may use it for medical reasons.        ``You wouldn't want to penalize that person,'' Gilman told       me. ``What this technology will do is differentiate impaired       from not-impaired, which is different than distinguishing       cannabis from no-cannabis.''                                Impairment app         One company that uses a similar approach is Cambridge,       Massachusetts-based Impairment Science, which has an app       called Druid to measure response times and motor skills       through a series of tests on a screen. The methods let the       app gauge impairment, regardless of whether the cause was       alcohol, marijuana, or something else. The company aims to       raise as much as $1.2 million in seed funding, according to       Chief Executive Officer Robert Schiller.        Druid is being pitched to construction companies, and       Impairment Science recently struck a deal with Anheuser-Busch       InBev SA's Grupo Modelo, which will promote the app in an       effort to reduce drunk driving in the Mexican state of       Zacatecas. Schiller said the company plans to announce more       corporate partnerships in the near future.        Still, there are no easy solutions. Druid's app requires       that people take the test more that once in order to gauge       impairment compared to a baseline score. The company is       researching a product where tests could be one-offs, which       would appeal to law enforcement.        The method used by Gilman also has its limitations. It       relies on an imaging device from NirX Medical Technologies,       which still costs around $40,000.        For better or worse, the techniques used by Gilman's study       and Druid's app will also pick up forms of impairment that       arise from issues other than marijuana, such as fatigue,       illness or chronic medical conditions. That could be a good       thing for public safety--especially at a time where       perception-altering drugs like psilocybin are on the rise,       and other drugs like opiates also create risks in driving and       high-risk industries--but it could create other problems.        It's not hard to envision a future where people could be       taken aside and wired up for a quick scan that checks their       brain for telltale signs of impairment. Then comes the real       work: Employers, insurers and police will have to figure out       what to do with the information.                              Number of the week         The number of U.S. states that have zero-tolerance laws       prohibiting driving with any amount of THC or its metabolites       in the body, according to New Frontier Data.                              Quote of the week         ``Cannabis definitely impacts areas of the brain that       affect decision making and impulse control. And that's very       much what driving is,'' said Rebecca Siegel, a clinical       psychiatrist and author of the book ``The Brain on Cannabis:       What You Should Know About Recreational and Medical       Marijuana.''                            What you need to know         Eleusis, a health-care company focused on using psychedelic       drugs as medicines, is going public through a merger with a       blank-check firm.        Thailand plans to remove marijuana from its list of       controlled substances, paving the way to decriminalization.        Mississippi could be the next state to put a cannabis law       on the books.        A New Hampshire court found that a worker who was fired       after he told his employer he started using cannabis when his       doctor prescribed it for PTSD may have a viable claim under       state disability bias law.                                   ____     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, as I mentioned previously, fails to  appropriately fund the police in all the States that will be facing the  challenges that we face in Oregon.   This is not a question of money. The bill, as drawn, will be raising  literally billions of dollars at 8 percent tax over the next how many  years--billions. Somehow, some of that money has to make its way into  law enforcement.   Without law enforcement, Mr. Speaker, you will see situations like we  have in southern Oregon replicated across the Nation, regardless of the  optimistic thought that somehow the cartels no longer have the monopoly  and, therefore, will go away. That is not going to be the case as long  as there is a higher price. In many cases, it is going to be a much  higher price for legally produced marijuana.   The bill fails to address impairment. My friends, many of them in the  law enforcement space, including my brother, a former county sheriff,  have said this is a huge problem where we don't know when people are  driving impaired. Studies are ongoing.   Why are we broadening this problem when we don't know how to charge  those who are driving under the influence?   Of course, as we have heard, it fails to address the ever-increasing  potency of the drug. It fails to address the age at which marijuana can  be legally used.   What is that about? We know this drug adversely affects particularly  young men's brain development all the  [[Page H4106]]  way up to age 26, yet this bill says nothing about it.   It fails to address the differences between marijuana and hemp. Some  would say, well, that is such a small issue. It is a huge issue. It is  a huge issue, and it needs to be addressed.   This bill is the proper vehicle to address these issues. I see that  there are some amendments being brought which perhaps will at least go  partially in that direction. But the bill itself and the legalization  are premature, given the nature of those amendments.   This is an untimely and incomplete bill. Its greatest failure is in  not recognizing and addressing the damage the drug will do to our kids  and our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would authorize $10 million to  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct a study  on how certain technologies can help law enforcement officers detect  whether a driver is impaired by marijuana.   Impaired driving is a serious issue that takes thousands of lives  every year. Unfortunately, the Democrats only want to address this  problem after they create it. Legalizing marijuana will undoubtedly  lead to more drivers being impaired by marijuana.   Democrats want to legalize marijuana and then provide law enforcement  with a study on how they might be able to detect drivers impaired by  [[Page H4107]]  marijuana. Why wouldn't we start with giving law enforcement the  resources they need?   This doesn't make any sense, and the lack of support for law  enforcement from Democrats in this bill shouldn't surprise us. Nowhere  in this bill is there any funding for law enforcement related to  marijuana. Let's fix the existing problems before making more.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am prepared to close, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the proposed  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment is a great example of how Democrats legislate: Make a  bunch of drastic changes and then consider the consequences.   The amendment calls for two studies to be conducted, after the  enactment of the bill, to evaluate how State legislation on marijuana  has impacted those States.   The first study will be conducted by the National Institute for  Occupational Safety and Health on the impact of State legalization of  recreational marijuana on the workplace. The second study will be  conducted by the Department of Education on the impact of legalization  to schools and school-aged children.   The amendment also requires the Department of Education to develop  best practices for educators and administrators to protect children  from negative impacts.   This amendment recognizes the fact that the majority is blindly  leading us down the path of marijuana legalization. The information to  be provided by these studies would better serve this body and the  children of America if we had it before legalization.   Last year, the percentage of American employees testing positive for  drugs hit a two-decade high. This jump was driven by an increase in  positive marijuana tests.   This amendment is merely window dressing on a bad and incomplete  bill. Rather than tackle the actual problem of marijuana abuse at the  workplace, which could have disastrous consequences, Democrats simply  want to study the issue.   This amendment is a tacit admission that they know this bill is  flawed, and it is a ploy by the majority to say they addressed one of  the flaws.   I fear the information that the studies will reveal may come too late  for many if this bill were to become law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to mention that I agree there has to be the  proper determination of when you are impaired after you have used  marijuana. I made that argument in my discussion of the bill.   The issue is one of timing. It is not just impairment. There are many  other things in the bill that need to be addressed that aren't.   In this rush to legalize, what we have is a lot of assuming, as was  just suggested, that everybody is already using it, so why bother?  Well, a lot of people are. But after it becomes federally legalized,  more will be using it. Thus, the danger level will increase.   We can't sit here and say there are no consequences of legalization.  By that, I mean the same number of people using it. The questions  become: When are we going to do this? Why wasn't it done earlier? Why  wasn't it done yet? One of the reasons is that it is really hard to  make this determination.   What I am saying is, it is a matter of timing. But it is not just  this issue; there are many others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is April Fools' Day, so maybe this is a joke.   This amendment would require Federal agencies to review every  decision to rescind or deny a security clearance since 1971 to  determine if it was based on marijuana usage. Then, the agency would  have to track down every person who was denied a clearance due to  marijuana use. The agency would then let them know that the decision  will be reassessed unless the person objects.   This is crazy. It creates a huge burden on Federal agencies for what?  Even if this bill were to become law, the denial of these security  clearances was based on a person's willful violation of a law at the  time.   When agencies are assessing whether these people should have access  to national security sensitive information, the consideration isn't  whether the person uses marijuana. It is whether the person is willing  to undermine the rule of law.   If they can't follow this Nation's laws, then we can't expect them to  follow the processes to protect our most sensitive information.   Further, this amendment reaches back more than 50 years. How many of  these people still need, want, or are even eligible for security  clearances?   No one gets a security clearance just because you want one. You can't  just walk up off the street and apply for it. You need to be employed  with the Federal Government or a government contractor, and your  employer must need you to have access to the information.   Very few people who were denied a security clearance in 1980 are  still employed in or even qualify for positions that would require  security clearances. Some of the people we are talking about may be  retirees in their eighties or nineties. Many of them may have  representative payees who are their children or grandchildren. Why  would we want to expose the fact that their father, mother,  grandfather, or grandmother was a marijuana abuser?   The gentleman from Maryland wants the Federal Government to re-create  the security clearance backlog that the Trump administration just  cleared up for unneeded reviews and to resurface private information.  This amendment makes little sense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just point out that I didn't concede  anything that I recognize. If you thought I did, please rethink it.   I want to point out that the security clearance isn't just for  Federal employees. It is for private contractors and people seeking  security clearances. All I am saying is, one can refer to our  ``bureaucrats'' as though they don't have other things to do. They do  lots of very important things. I would suggest this falls pretty low on  that list.   It is an interesting amendment, but I urge opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
