 Mr. President, my understanding is that the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act may be coming to the floor in the coming days,  and there are some people who think it is still worth supporting. There  are others who think that it is not. But whatever your views on this  bill may be, let us be clear. As currently written, this is an  extremely modest piece of legislation that does virtually nothing to  address the enormous crises that working families all across this  country are facing today.   This reconciliation bill falls far short of what the American people  want, what they need, and what they are begging us to do. Given that  this is the last reconciliation bill that we will be considering this  year, it is the only opportunity that we have to do something  significant for the American people that requires only 50 votes and  that cannot be filibustered. In other words, this is the opportunity,  because on anything significant, we are not going to get 60 votes. So  this, in my view, is a moment that should not be squandered.   Let us do what we too rarely do here in the Congress or in the  corporate media, and that is to take a hard look at the reality of what  is going on in our country today. Very often, we sit here, and we argue  about this, we argue about that, but we don't take a look at what is  going on in America today, especially among working people and low- income people who do not have paid lobbyists here trying to get us to  pass legislation to benefit them.   People back home are just too busy working 50, 60 hours a week,  trying to make it on Social Security, trying to deal with their student  debt. They don't have the lobbyists here that the drug companies and  the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry has.   What is going on in America today?   For a start, in the richest country in the history of the world, half  of our people live paycheck to paycheck, and because of inflation, a  bad situation has been made worse. Millions of people today are  wondering how they are going to pay their rent, how they are going to  buy the food to feed their kids, how they are going to pay off their  debt. That is what is going on for half of the people in our country. I  know we don't talk about it. They have no representation here, no  lobbyists, no nothing. But that is the reality.   Does this reconciliation bill address their needs? Does it raise the  minimum wage to a living wage or do we continue to allow so many  workers to try to get by on 10, 12, 13 bucks an hour?   Does this bill make it easier for workers who want to join a union to  be able to do so or they continue to be attacked by their employers,  making it hard to form a union? No, this bill does nothing to address  that reality.   At a time when, tragically, this country has the highest rate of  childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, does this bill  extend the $300-a-month-per-child tax credit that was so important to  millions of families last year? Does it address that issue? Does it say  that, maybe, there is something wrong when millions of children in this  country are dealing with hunger and with other basic human needs? No,  not a word in this bill addresses that.   In my State of Vermont and around this country, families are paying  on average about $15,000 a year for childcare, if they are lucky enough  to find a slot. And $15,000 a year is one-third of the salary of a  family making $45,000. I don't know how people can afford childcare.  And, meanwhile, childcare workers earn horrifically low wages and have  poor benefits.   At a time when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any  major country on Earth, does this bill address the dysfunctionality of  our childcare system? No, not a word. And, again, this is a  reconciliation bill, where we only need 50 votes to make these changes.   At a time when over 70 million Americans are uninsured or  underinsured, when we spend twice as much per capita on healthcare as  the people of almost any other major country while insurance companies  make tens and tens of billions of dollars a year in profit, when 60  million people a year die because they can't afford to get to a doctor  when they are sick because they are uninsured or underinsured, does  this bill do anything to help us create a rational, cost-effective  healthcare system that guarantees healthcare for all as a human right,  something that every other major country on Earth does? No, the bill  does nothing to address the extraordinary healthcare crisis that we  face.   At a time when 45 million Americans are struggling to pay student  debt and when hundreds of thousands of bright young people every year  are unable to fulfill their dreams, unable to get a higher education  because they cannot afford the high cost of higher education in this  country, does this bill do anything to make it easier for young people  to get a higher education? No, it does not. It doesn't do a thing. It  doesn't do a thing on student debt.   Fifty-five percent of senior citizens in our country are trying to  survive on incomes of $25,000 a year or less. It is just something hard  for me to understand. It really is. Think about being 80, 90 years of  age, trying to make it on $25,000 a year. Maybe your spouse has died. I  don't know how you do it, but more than half of our people in our  country who are seniors are trying to do that.   Many of these seniors cannot afford to go to a dentist, and in  Vermont--and, I suspect, in Arizona, as well--there are senior citizens  walking around without teeth in their mouth or with teeth that are  rotting. There are seniors all over this country who cannot communicate  with their kids or grandchildren because they can't afford a hearing  aid. They can't watch TV because they can't afford a decent pair of  glasses.   Is there anything in the currently written bill to expand Medicare to  do what some 75 or 80 percent of the American people think we should  do, and that is expand Medicare to cover dental care for seniors,  hearing aids, and eyeglasses? No, the bill doesn't touch that at all.   When we talk about our seniors and disabled Americans, does this  legislation do anything to help the millions who would prefer to stay  in their homes rather than be forced into nursing homes? It is an issue  I hear quite  [[Page S3995]]  frequently in Vermont: We cannot find help for someone to come to my  house to help my mother or my disabled father. Does this bill address  the crisis of home healthcare, a very serious crisis? No, not a word.   I think there is no disagreement that we have a major housing crisis  in America. Some 600,000 Americans are homeless, and nearly 18 million  households are spending an incredible 50 percent of their limited  incomes for housing. Everybody acknowledges that we have a major  housing crisis and that rents are soaring. Does this bill that  supposedly represents the needs of the American people even deal with  housing? In one word, no, it doesn't.   I understand that in our politics today, super PACs and billionaires  play an enormous role in what we do here and what we don't do. Just  yesterday, we saw the power of billionaire super PACs selecting  corporate candidates who represent their interests and defeating  candidates who represent working families. That is the way the  political system is, and it has been made worse since Citizens United.   But right now, in our country--and I know we don't talk about it very  much; I hear almost no discussion on the floor--we have more income  wealth inequality than at any time in 100 years. How do the American  people feel knowing that three people own more wealth than the bottom  half of American society? Does that sound like the America we believe  in, the America we think we should be?   We talk about Russia and Putin and the oligarchy over there. It is  true. An oligarchy robs the country blind.   We have an oligarchy here as well. Three people own more wealth than  the bottom half of American society. The top 1 percent owns more wealth  than the bottom 92 percent, and 45 percent of all new income goes to  the top 1 percent. And what we have seen during the pandemic is  billionaires becoming much richer while working people by the thousands  die because they have to go to work to make a living.   Today, CEOs of large corporations make 350 times more than their  average workers. That is what is going on in America. I know we don't  want to talk about it because we don't want to offend the people who  fund our campaigns. It makes them uncomfortable to talk about how much  inequality we have in this country, but that is the reality.   Not only do we have income and wealth inequality, but we have another  issue we don't talk about much--or maybe a little bit. We have more  concentration of ownership than at any time in the modern history of  this country. In sector after sector after sector, we have a handful of  giant multinational corporations, often engaging in price-fixing, that  control what is produced and how much we pay for it.   I think many Americans now notice that, at a time when we are paying  increased costs at the gas pump, increased costs at grocery stores for  food, surprise, surprise, surprise, these large corporations are making  recordbreaking profits. Paying five bucks for a gallon of gas? Well,  the good news is that ExxonMobil and these other corporations are  making huge profits.   Unbelievably, three Wall Street firms now control assets of over $20  trillion. That is the GDP of the United States of America being  controlled by three Wall Street firms. Is that of concern to anybody?  Think it might be something we might want to talk about in a  reconciliation bill? Nah, can't do that. These are very powerful guys,  and we are not supposed to offend the wealthy and the powerful.   These three Wall Street firms are the major stockholders in 96  percent of S&P 500 companies. Check out the companies of the products  that you buy. Find out who owns them. Find out who owns the companies  that you are familiar with. Time and time and time again, you will find  that the major stockholders are these three Wall Street firms:  BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard.   Does this bill do anything to even begin addressing the enormous  concentration of ownership in our country and make our economy more  competitive? Not a word.   So my point is that we are living in a moment of unprecedented  crises. This bill does virtually nothing to address any of them, and  this is the opportunity because, theoretically, it could be done with  50 votes here in the Senate. If all of the Democrats voted for it--if  any Republicans voted for it, it would be great--plus the Vice  President, we could do it. We could do it, but as currently written, it  is not being done.   Now, let me say a few words about what is in this legislation, a bill  which has some good features. There are some good things in it, but it  also has some very bad features.   The good news is that the reconciliation bill finally begins to  address the outrageous price of some of the most expensive prescription  drugs under Medicare. As you know, we pay, by far, the highest prices  in the world for our prescription drugs, and for those under Medicare,  this begins to address that issue.   Under this legislation, Medicare, for the first time, would be able  to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to lower drug prices.  That is the good news.   The bad news is that we will not see the impact of these negotiated  prices until 2026--4 years from now. Why? Got me. I don't know, but it  will not go into effect until 4 years from now.   By the way, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful entity  here in DC, and if you think, during those 4 years, that whatever  modest provisions are in this bill they will not attack and get out,  you would be mistaken. They will certainly work hard to do that, and  they have 4 years to do that--4 years to come up with an entire pricing  structure--because if you are not covering all of the drugs, they can  come up with me-too drugs that look alike, that sound alike, and that  can evade these price controls.   Moreover, with the possible exception of insulin--and that is not  clear yet--this bill does nothing to lower prescription drug prices for  anyone who is not on Medicare.   Under this bill, at a time when pharmaceutical companies are making  outrageous profits, the drug companies will still be allowed to charge  the American people, by far, the highest prices in the world for  prescription drugs.   Now, if we had the courage to seriously address this issue, we would  know exactly what to do. It is very, very simple. For over 30 years,  the Veterans Health Administration has been negotiating with the  pharmaceutical industry to lower the price of prescription drugs.  Moreover, for decades, virtually every major country on Earth has done  exactly the same thing. That is why, in Canada, drug prices and, in  Mexico, drug prices and, in Europe, drug prices are much lower than in  the United States.   The result of Medicare not negotiating prices has been that, today,  Medicare pays twice as much for the same exact prescription drugs as  the VA, and Americans, in some cases, pay 10 times more for a  particular drug than the people in Canada or in other countries.   How insane is it that you have one Federal Agency, called the VA,  that pays 50 percent of what Medicare pays? I mean, how crazy is that?   So, when it comes to reducing the price of prescription drugs under  Medicare, we don't have to reinvent the wheel. We could simply require  Medicare to pay no more for prescription drugs than the VA pays--end of  discussion. It is a rather simple solution. If we did that, we could  save Medicare some $900 billion over the next decade. That is nine  times more savings than the rather weak negotiation provision in this  bill--nine times more. They get $100 billion. We would save $900  billion.   By the way, that money could be used to add comprehensive dental,  vision, and hearing benefits to every senior in America; it could be  used to lower the Medicare eligibility age to at least 60; and it could  be used to extend the solvency of Medicare.   That is why I will be introducing an amendment to do just that and to  make sure that Medicare pays no more for prescription drugs than the  VA. It is not a very radical idea, and I would hope that that amendment  gets widespread support.   In terms of the Affordable Care Act, this legislation will extend  subsidies for some 13 million Americans who have private  health insurance plans, as a result of the ACA, over the next 3 years.  Without this provision, millions of Americans would see their premiums  [[Page S3996]]  skyrocket, and some 3 million Americans could lose their health  insurance altogether.    This is a good provision, and I support it, but let us not kid  ourselves. The $64 billion cost of this provision will go directly into  the pockets of private health insurance companies that made over $60  billion in profit last year and paid their CEOs exorbitant compensation  packages.   It would also do nothing to help the more than 70 million Americans  who are uninsured or underinsured, and it would do nothing to reform a  dysfunctional healthcare system that is not designed to make people  well but is designed to make the stockholders of private health  insurance companies even richer.   Let me talk about the issue of climate change for a moment as it is  dealt with in this bill.   This legislation provides $370 billion over the next decade to combat  climate change and to invest in so-called energy security programs.   The good news is that, if this legislation, as written, is signed  into law, it would provide far more funding for energy efficiency and  sustainable energy than has ever been invested before. Given the  existential crisis that we face--given the fact that we are fighting to  make sure that this planet remains habitable and healthy for younger  generations--this, clearly, is not enough of an investment, but it is a  step forward.   It provides serious funding for wind, solar, batteries, heat pumps,  electric vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, and low-income  communities that have borne the brunt of climate change. That is the  good news.   However, the bad news is that this legislation includes a huge  giveaway to the fossil fuel industry--the people who are causing the  climate crisis.   Now, it might seem a bit incongruous to people as to why we are  rewarding the people whose emissions are driving the temperature of the  Earth up and causing massive destruction, but that is, in fact, what  this bill does.   Under this legislation, the fossil fuel industry will receive  billions of dollars in new tax breaks and subsidies over the next 10  years on top of the $15 billion in tax breaks and corporate welfare  that they already receive every year. This is above and beyond what  they currently get.   In my view, if we are going to make our planet healthy and habitable  for future generations, which I would hope that every sane human being  believes we should, we cannot provide billions of dollars in new tax  breaks to fossil fuel companies that are destroying the planet. On the  contrary, we should end all of the massive corporate welfare that the  fossil fuel industry already enjoys.   Under this legislation, up to 60 million acres of public waters--60  million acres of public waters--must be offered up for sale each and  every year to the oil and gas industry before the Federal Government  could approve any new offshore wind development. To put this in  perspective, 60 million acres is the size of Michigan.   Let me read to you the headline that appeared in a July 29 article in  Bloomberg called: ``Exxon . . . Loves What Manchin Did for Big Oil in  $370 Billion Deal.''   According to Bloomberg, the CEO of ExxonMobil called the  reconciliation bill a ``step in the right direction'' and was  ``pleased'' with the ``comprehensive set of solutions'' included in the  reconciliation bill.   Barron's recently reported that ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Occidental  Petroleum are just a few of the fossil fuel companies that would  benefit the most under this bill.   Now, if the CEO of ExxonMobil--a company that, perhaps, has done more  than any other entity on Earth to cause climate change--is ``pleased''  with this bill, I think all of us should have some very deep concerns  about what is in this legislation.   Further, under this bill, up to 2 million acres of public lands must  be offered up for sale each and every year to the oil and gas industry  before leases can move forward for any renewable energy development on  public lands.   In total, this bill will offer the fossil fuel industry up to 700  million acres of public lands and waters to oil and gas drilling over  the next decade--far more than the oil and gas industry could possibly  use.   That is not all. The fossil fuel industry will not just benefit from  the provisions in this reconciliation bill. A deal has also been  reached to make it easier for the industry to receive permits for their  oil and gas projects.   This deal would approve a $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline--a  fracked gas pipeline that would span 303 miles from West Virginia to  Virginia and potentially on to North Carolina. This is a pipeline that  would generate emissions equivalent to that released by 37 coal plants  or by over 27 million cars each and every year. Well, to my mind, that  is a heck of a way to address the climate crisis.   Let me quote from a July 29 letter from over 350 environmental  organizations, including the Sunrise Movement, Food & Water Watch,  350.org, and the Climate Justice Alliance, addressed to the President  and the Senate majority leader, expressing concerns about this bill.   This is what they say:         Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or fast-tracking       of fossil fuel permitting is incompatible with climate       leadership. Oil, gas and coal production are the core drivers       of the climate and extinction crises. There can be no new       fossil fuel leases, exports, or infrastructure if we have any       hope of preventing ever-worsening climate crises,       catastrophic floods, deadly wildfires, and more--all of which       are ripping across the country as we speak. We are out of       time. Therefore, we're calling on you--  the President and majority leader--       to fulfill your promise to lead on climate, starting with       denying approvals for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting       all new federal fossil fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf of       Mexico, in Alaska, and everywhere else, and preventing any       fast-tracked permits for fossil fuel projects.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter by these 360 environmental groups written on July 29.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 29, 2022.      Re Hold the line against fossil fuel expansion.         Dear President Biden and Majority Leader Schumer: As       frontline communities and organizations with millions of       members and supporters, we thank you for your tireless       efforts to secure a climate deal with meaningful renewable       energy investments. At the same time, we respectfully urge       you to reject any handouts to the fossil fuel industry. Put       simply: you cannot address the climate emergency by       sacrificing communities, expanding fossil fuel production and       embracing fossil fuel industry scams like carbon capture,       fossil fuel hydrogen, and carbon offsets.        Any approval of new fossil fuel projects or fast-tracking       of fossil fuel permitting is incompatible with climate       leadership. Oil, gas and coal production are the core drivers       of the climate and extinction crises. There can be no new       fossil fuel leases, exports, or infrastructure if we have any       hope of preventing ever-worsening climate crises,       catastrophic floods, deadly wildfires, and more--all of which       are ripping across the country as we speak. We are out of       time. Therefore, we're calling on you to fulfill your promise       to lead on climate, starting with denying approvals for the       Mountain Valley Pipeline, rejecting all new federal fossil       fuel leases onshore, in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and       everywhere else, and preventing any fast-tracked permits for       fossil fuel projects.        Permitting new fossil fuel projects will further entrench       us in a fossil fuel economy for decades to come--and       constitutes a violent betrayal of your pledge to combat       environmental racism and destruction. Today's high gasoline       and energy prices cannot be solved with promises of future       oil and gas production. Climate chaos harms every person in       America, but our communities bear the brunt of the deadly       impacts of the toxic fossil fuel industry: primarily       Indigenous, Black, Latinx, AAPI and other communities of       color, as well as low-wealth communities. Young people,       women, and so many others that turned out to elect you and       gave you your mandate to govern need climate hope, not       climate setbacks. New fossil fuel projects will also lock       workers into a dying industry and delay the growth in sectors       that will support jobs of the future.        Critically, none of these negotiations affect the need for       President Biden to immediately declare a climate emergency       and use his existing authority to reject fossil fuel       projects. Declaring a climate emergency will unlock President       Biden's full set of powers to not only release Defense       funding to build renewable and just energy systems, but also       confront fossil fuels head-on by stopping crude oil exports.       With non-emergency powers, President Biden can reject new oil       and gas leases, and deny all fossil fuel infrastructure that       harms countless communities across the country. Unleashing       executive powers should be pursued in concert with--and not       instead of--passing critical climate legislation, and vice       versa.  [[Page S3997]]         We respectfully implore you to hold the line against any       new fossil fuel projects, reject handouts to oil and gas       companies, and use every tool available to advance a truly       just, renewable energy future that does not sacrifice our       communities.

Mr. President, here is what the Center for Biological  Diversity had to say on this bill:         This is a climate suicide pact. It's self-defeating to       handcuff renewable energy development to massive new oil and       gas extraction. The new leasing required in this bill will       fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country,       and it's a slap in the face to the communities fighting to       protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels.    In my view, we have got to do everything possible to take on the  greed of the fossil fuel industry, not give billions of dollars in  corporate welfare to an industry that has been actively destroying our  planet. And I will be introducing an amendment to do just that.   Finally, this bill has a tax provision in it. Under this bill,  corporations will be required to pay a minimum tax of 15 percent. That  is good news because we have many, many large, profitable corporations  in this country, including companies like AT&T, Federal Express, and  Nike, which, in a given year, make billions in profit and don't pay a  nickel in Federal income tax. This provision has been estimated to  raise $313 billion over the next decade.   Further, under this bill, the IRS will finally begin to receive the  funding that it needs to audit wealthy tax cheats. Each and every year,  the top 1 percent are able to avoid paying more than $160 billion in  taxes that they legally owe because the IRS does not have the resources  or staffing they need to conduct audits of the extremely wealthy. This  bill will begin to change that.   This bill would also make very modest changes to the so-called  carried interest loophole that has allowed billionaire hedge fund  managers on Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse, a  teacher, or a firefighter, and that is a good thing.   But the bad news is that this bill does nothing to repeal the Trump  tax breaks that went to the very wealthy and large corporations.  Trump's 2017 tax bill provided over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to  the top 1 percent and large corporations, and this bill does nothing to  repeal that.   Let's not forget, it is very likely that Congress will be doing a so- called tax extenders bill at the end of this year that could provide  corporations up to $400 billion over the next decade in new tax breaks.  If that occurs, that would more than offset the $313 billion in  corporate revenue included in this bill.   So that is where we are today. This legislation virtually ignores  every major crisis facing working families who are struggling so very  hard to stay alive today. It ignores childcare, pre-K, the expansion of  Medicare, affordable housing, home healthcare, higher education,  raising the minimum wage, and more. It ignores all of those issues.   This is legislation, which at a time of massive profits in the  pharmaceutical industry, takes a very modest step, which goes into  effect 4 years from now, to lower or control the price of medicine.   So this bill has, as I have indicated, some good and important  provisions. At the same time, it has some pretty bad provisions,  including massive giveaways to the fossil fuel industry.   This is a bill of more than 700 pages, which was made public after a  number of months of secret negotiations. In my view, now is the time  for every Member of the Senate to study this bill thoroughly and to  come up with amendments and ideas as to how we can improve it, and I  intend to play an active role in that process.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
