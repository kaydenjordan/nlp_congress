 Mr. Speaker, our country has  undoubtably been rocked by coronavirus. The pandemic has put a strain  on our physical, mental, and financial health.   As time has passed, it has been easy to focus on the negative;  however, I am encouraged by the work I have seen from my House  Republican colleagues.   Instead of playing partisan politics, I have seen a commitment to  America. I have seen a concerted effort to renew the American Dream,  restore our way of life, and rebuild the greatest economy ever.   America is worth fighting for, and while the pandemic is currently at  the forefront of our minds, there is a bright future ahead of us all.  We will rise from this crisis thanks to the resiliency, the grit, and  the determination of the American people.   Renewing the American Dream can mean a lot of different things. To  me, it starts with two things: broadband connectivity and a capable,  trained workforce.   In 21st century America, reliable connectivity is something many of  us take for granted. Just like flipping the switch to turn on your  lights, we have come to expect reliable, fast, uninterrupted access to  the internet.   Still, many communities across the country don't have reliable  broadband connectivity, particularly in rural America.   In time, the coronavirus will be a thing of the past, but our  national need for reliable broadband connectivity is not going  anywhere. Connectivity impacts every aspect of our lives: commerce,  education, healthcare, precision agriculture, and more. We can and must  invest in this critical infrastructure.   We must also invest in career and technical education opportunities.   Just prior to the pandemic, there were nearly 7 million job openings  across the country. Contrasting that figure with the potential of our  Nation's learners, whether they are entering the workforce for the  first time, learning a new skill, or reentering the workforce after  some time away, there is an obvious disconnect. This is often referred  to as the ``skills gap,'' and CTE is a proven way to bridge this  divide.   A one-size-fits-all approach to education is not an effective way to  prepare students for the workforce, and CTE should not be viewed as  plan B. It is a valuable educational option that empowers learners of  all ages to take control of their personal and their professional  futures.   Restoring our way of life includes defeating this virus and keeping  America healthy. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp  Speed has placed us light-years ahead in researching, developing, and,  soon, administering a coronavirus vaccine. The President has unleashed  the power of the private sector to partner with the Department of  Health and Human Services, as well as the Department of Defense, to  help eradicate the virus.   Prior to the pandemic, we had built the greatest economy this country  has ever seen, and we will rebuild it. We have done it once, and we can  do it again with America-first trade policies and by strengthening our  supply chain--that means a strong manufacturing sector that helps  America stay competitive--and supporting legislation that strengthens  the supply chain and bolsters our Nation's potential for a prosperous  future by keeping good-paying, family-sustaining jobs right here at  home.   Now I am confident that we can and will defeat this virus and renew  the American Dream, restore our way of life, and rebuild our economy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support of the Restoring Essential Service to Small Airports Act, a  bill introduced by Congressman Trone, which I am proud to cosponsor.   This bipartisan bill would reinstate several regional airports back  into the Essential Air Service program, which provides rural and  underserved communities access to the national air transportation  system.   The States that will benefit include my home State of Pennsylvania,  as well as Kansas, New York, South Dakota, Maryland, and Wyoming.   Many rural communities in these States were struggling prior to  COVID-19, and it is important that access to affordable commercial  flights to in-demand locations continue.   Without this lifeline, commercial service will cease to exist,  presenting a new set of challenges when it comes to economic  development and the long-term growth and sustainability of these  communities.   As a result of the reinstatement of these airports into the EAS  program, a long-overdue boost to local economies will occur.                            ____________________
