 Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing  Virginia State University, an esteemed historically Black college and  university founded in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1882.   I rise today to congratulate the Virginia State Trojan Explosion  Marching Band, which was recently recognized as the Nation's top  Division II HBCU band in 2023. The band was judged on important  components, including auxiliaries, drum majors, musicality, percussion,  and marching maneuvers. They will now compete in ESPN's inaugural HBCU  Band of the Year competition.   Throughout the year, the VSU Trojan Explosion was also invited to  perform at the White House, NBC's ``TODAY,'' and the National Battle of  the Bands competition in Houston.   I commend Dr. Taylor Whitehead, VSU's director of marching and pep  bands, and every member of the Trojan Explosion for their hard work and  dedication. They are proof that greatness happens at Virginia State  University. They have made their school, their community, and their  Congresswoman proud. I will be cheering for them in their upcoming  competition.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4468. I have listened  as the party that is actively trying to strip away America's personal  freedoms and rights is disguising its antiscience, anticlimate  legislation as protecting choice and personal freedom. That is rich.   House Republicans are putting polluters over people, yet again  prioritizing special interests over the health and well-being of  Americans.   This deeply harmful bill would undermine the EPA's authority to  finalize proposed emission standards and prevent the agency from taking  future action to protect the public from dangerous air pollution.   Their opposition to the rule has very real impacts for historically  marginalized environmental justice communities, most often low-income  communities of color, many of which I represent, who live near the  roadways.   We know greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants can cause a  host of adverse public health impacts, including higher rates of  cancer, respiratory illness, and preterm births, which is why we cannot  stand by while House Republicans work to curtail EPA's authority.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  irresponsible bill.
