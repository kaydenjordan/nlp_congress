 Madam Speaker, the people of Cuba are standing up  for freedom, and they are suffering horrific consequences for it. They  are getting murdered in the streets by the regime. They are getting  killed in the streets by the regime.   And what they are asking for are just a couple of things. And what I  am pleading for right now with the President of the United States is  for some solidarity. And, yes, he made a couple statements, but where  is his leadership?   What the Cuban people need right now is access to the internet that  has been cut off by the Cuban regime. The Cuban people are not asking  for remittances, they are not asking for aspirin, they are asking for  freedom.   This President ran saying that he was going renew a new era of  American diplomacy. Why is he not rallying the world? Why is he not  speaking about what is going on on the island of Cuba? Why is he not  talking to the democracies, making sure that everybody understands that  it is an illegitimate terrorist, murderous regime in Cuba, and the  United States stands with the people and is going to make sure that the  world stands with the people of Cuba, as well?  [[Page H3661]]    President Biden, this is a moment of leadership. Stand with the Cuban  people.
