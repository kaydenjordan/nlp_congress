 I think we should be fighting.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado sends a question  to the desk.   I would note just for the--as the hour tends to get late, I would  note for all counsel, as Chief Justice Roberts noted on January 21,  2020, citing the trial of Charles Swayne in 1905, all parties in this  Chamber must refrain from using language that is not conducive to civil  discourse.   The Senator from Colorado, Senator Bennet, has a question for the  House managers, and the clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Since the November election, the Georgia Secretary of       State, the Vice President, and other public officials       withstood enormous pressure to uphold the lawful election of       President Biden and the rule of law. What would have happened       if these officials had bowed to the force President Trump       exerted or the mob that attacked the Capitol?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers have 5 minutes.   Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. I want to take a minute and remind  everybody about the incredible pressure that Donald Trump was putting  on election officials in different States in this country and the  intimidation that he was issuing, and I want to remind everyone of the  background of Donald Trump's call to one secretary of state, the  secretary of state from Georgia, Mr. Raffensperger.   Donald Trump tried to overturn the election by any means necessary.  He tried again and again to pressure and threaten election officials to  overturn the election results. He pressured Michigan officials, calling  them late at night and hosting them at the White House.   He did the same thing with officials in Pennsylvania. He called into  a local meeting of the Pennsylvania Legislature, and he also hosted  them at the White House, where he pressured them.   In Georgia, it was even worse. He sent tweet after tweet attacking  the secretary of state until Mr. Raffensperger got death threats to him  and his family. His wife got a text that said:         Your husband deserves facing a firing squad.    A firing squad for doing his job.   Mr. Raffensperger stood up to him. He told the world that elections  are the bedrock of this society and the votes were accurately counted  for Donald Trump's opponent.   Officials like Mr. Sterling warned Trump that if this continued,  someone is going to get killed, but Donald Trump didn't stop. He  escalated it even further. He made a personal call.   He made a personal call. You heard that call because it was recorded.  The President of the United States told the secretary of state that if  he does not find votes, he will face criminal penalties.   Please, Senators, consider that for a second, the President putting  all of this public and private pressure on elected officials, telling  them that they could face criminal penalties if they don't do what he  wants.   And not just any number of votes that he was looking for--Donald  Trump was asking the secretary of state to somehow find the exact  number of votes Donald Trump lost the State by. Remember, President  Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes. In his own words, President Trump  said:         All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes.    He wanted the secretary of state to somehow find the precise number,  plus one, of votes that he needed to win.   As a Congress and as a nation, we cannot be numb to this conduct. If  we are and if we don't set a precedent against it, more Presidents will  do this in the future. This will be a green light for them to engage in  that kind of pressure and that kind of conduct.   This could have gone a very different way if those elected officials  had bowed to the intimidation and the pressure of the President of the  United States. It would have meant that, instead of the American people  deciding this election, President Trump alone would have decided this  American election. That is exactly what was at stake, and that is  exactly what he was trying to do. He intended, wanted to, and tried to  overturn the election by any means necessary. He tried everything else  that he could do to win. He started inciting the crowd; issuing tweet  after tweet; issuing commands to stop the count, stop the steal. He  worked up the crowd, sent a ``save the date.''   So it wasn't just one speech or one thing; he was trying everything.  He was pressuring elected officials. He was riling up his base, telling  them the election had been stolen from them, that it had been stolen  from him. It was a combination of things that only Donald Trump could  have done. For us to believe otherwise is to think that somehow a  rabbit came out of a hat and this mob just showed up here on their own,  all by themselves.   This is dangerous, Senators, and the future of our democracy truly  rests in your hands.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.
