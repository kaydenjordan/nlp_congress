 Mr. Speaker, in December we adopted one of the most  important tax reform laws in our Nation's history. It is producing  higher wages, better job opportunities, and greater economic expansion  than we have seen in a decade. But having cut taxes, we assumed an  urgent responsibility to restrain spending.   Taxes and debt are two sides of the same coin. A debt is simply a  future tax. Once we have spent a dollar, we have already decided to tax  it, either now or in the future. It is the spending that is the  problem. Three numbers--26, 29, and 46--tell the whole story. Over the  last 10 years, population and inflation have increased a combined 26  percent. Our revenues have more than kept pace, increasing 29 percent.  The problem is that third number. Our spending has grown 46 percent.   We are now approaching a trillion-dollar annual deficit with $21  trillion of total debt. This not only crowds out capital that would  otherwise be used for economic expansion; it also produces staggering  interest costs on that debt, which today amount to $475 billion a year.   Our total defense spending this year is roughly $675 billion. Every 1  percent increase in interest rates adds roughly $200 billion to our  annual interest costs. If capital markets believe we have no plan and  no inclination to control our spending, they could soon begin demanding  higher rates to compensate their added risk.   That is a debt spiral. It leads to a debt crisis. Pension systems  implode, basic services falter, the economy collapses, and the  population flees. Puerto Rico's debt crisis has left its Government  completely helpless to respond to last year's hurricanes.   The instrument required to prevent this from happening is the Federal  budget. It is supposed to set limits on discretionary and mandatory  spending and to provide a streamlined process to adjust statutes to  meet those levels. The deadline for Congress to pass such a budget was  April 15. To date, the House Budget Committee has done precisely  nothing to fulfill this statutory requirement and this fiscal  imperative. Nothing.   The Constitution gives to the House the power of the purse. A dollar  is not spent by this government unless the House says it gets spent.  Two months ago, having cut taxes, the House has approved a 20 percent  increase in discretionary spending, placing us on a path that will  inexorably lead to a sovereign debt crisis. And the House Budget  Committee, over the objections of myself and others, has done nothing  to produce a plan to get us off that path.                                time  1030    Fortunately, the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus in  the Congress, has stepped forward to offer a comprehensive budget for  fiscal year 2019. I chair the Budget and Spending Task Force of the  RSC, and I want to thank the many Members and staff who provided  countless hours to produce it.   The RSC budget is, at present, the only credible and comprehensive  plan in Congress to turn us back toward fiscal solvency before it is  too late, getting us back to balance by 2026. It combines the fiscal  reforms proposed by the members of the RSC over the last several  sessions, along with innovations and service delivery proposed by the  CBO, the GAO, the administration, and by think tanks like Heritage  Foundation and Mercatus.   It shows, program by program, how we can reform them in a manner that  produces more effective service delivery at a much lower cost, save  Medicare and Social Security from impending collapse, and fully fund  our Nation's defense.   Yes, it gores every sacred cow in the Federal bureaucracy, and we  will hear howls of protest from the partisans of the status quo; but we  are running out of time, and we are running out of options. Those same  voices have placed us on a collision course with bankruptcy, and  countries that bankrupt themselves aren't around very long.   A sovereign debt crisis is coming to America, and at our current rate  of spending and borrowing, it could be coming very soon. I implore the  House  [[Page H3582]]  leadership to allow this budget to be brought at once to the floor and  at least give the House the fleeting and perhaps final chance to avert  the fiscal crisis that looms before us.   Given the fact that there is no credible plan even being considered  to avert this crisis, the RSC budget may represent the last best hope  of restoring our government to solvency and assuring that we can  continue to provide for the common defense and promote the general  welfare for ourselves and our posterity.                            ____________________
