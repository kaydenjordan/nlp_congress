 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    I rise to respond to this unanimous consent request to  call up and pass a bill to make modifications to the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.   Over the past few months, through the enactment of both the Families  First Act and the CARES Act, Congress has provided both funding and  flexibilities for nutrition assistance during this pandemic emergency.  The funding from the Families First and CARES Acts has included the  following: $15 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program; $8.8 billion for the School and Child Nutrition Programs; $1  billion in food distribution programs, like The Emergency Food  Assistance Program, TEFAP, and the Food Distribution Program for Indian  Reservations; $500 million for the Special Supplemental Nutrition  Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or the WIC Program.   In addition, Congress provided emergency SNAP benefits, allotments,  and pandemic EBT benefits for children while schools are closed.   The Department of Agriculture has been steadily distributing both  food and benefits, and the Department has granted and extended many  flexibilities to State and sponsoring organizations to get food to  those in need.   The distinguished Senator from Michigan, for whom I have a great deal  of respect and friendship--we have a history of working together on the  Agriculture Committee to help those in need.   In fact, just last week, we wrote the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny  Perdue, about some of the WIC flexibilities, and the Department of  Agriculture has already acted to extend those flexibilities. This is  just a recent example of the good work we can accomplish together, but  I respectfully object to this unanimous consent.
