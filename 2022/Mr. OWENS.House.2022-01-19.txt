 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Louisiana for  his great leadership.   Madam Speaker, over the past year, I spent time throughout Utah's  Fourth District. I have heard from Utahns from all walks of life, and  month after month, they have shared the same concerns: soaring  inflation, skyrocketing prices, and decreasing wages.   That is no surprise because gas is up 49.6 percent. Used cars are up  37.3 percent. Gas utilities are up 24.1 percent. Meat, fish, and eggs  are up 12.5 percent. Electricity is up 6.3 percent.   On top of this, as real wages have decreased 8 out of the last 11  months, our economy is still missing millions of prepandemic jobs, and  employers are continuing to struggle with persistent labor shortages.   What is this administration doing to help? You can't make this up:  dismissing inflation as high-class problems and transitory; adding to  the national debt with money we don't have on programs we don't need;  and, just last week, advocating to nuke a filibuster the President  defended for decades to push through a radical Federal takeover of all  elections.   Our economy should be thriving right now, but inaction, on purpose,  by this administration has massively increased our national debt, which  still sits at $29 trillion, by the way; stifled growth; and financially  crippled American families and small businesses.   We are closing out the first year of Biden's Presidency with the  worst inflation of 40 years; open borders; emboldened adversaries; a  botched withdrawal from Afghanistan; and a repeated push to increase  the size, scope, and reach of the Federal Government.   This year, I encourage President Biden to start paying attention to  the real needs of real Americans. Maybe then we will start seeing real  results.
