 Mr. President, for the leader, is there a message at  the desk in reference to S.J. Res. 7?    Mr. President, for the leader, is the veto message with  the papers attached at the desk?    For the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the veto  message on S.J. Res. 7 be considered as having been read and that it be  printed in the Record and spread in full upon the Journal.    Mr. President, for 1 minute, I will speak to a piece of  history of the Senate.   I call to the Senate's attention this fact: When the Senate first  convened in 1789 at Federal Hall in New York City, one of the Senate's  first orders of business was to appoint a committee to recommend a  candidate for Chaplain. On April 25, 1789, the Senate elected the Right  Reverend Samuel Provost, Episcopal bishop of New York, as its first  Chaplain.   That means 230 years ago this week, the Senate elected its first  Chaplain, and since then the Senate has had 62 people serve in the  position as Chaplain of the Senate.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, additionally for 1 minute, I would like  to speak to the issue of healthcare. Some elected officials are  proposing radical changes to our healthcare system. These proposals  include Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, Medicaid for All, and  expansion of the Affordable Healthcare Act. All of these are versions  of completely government-run healthcare.   Americans don't support a government-run healthcare system when they  are told about the tradeoffs. Medicare for All would eliminate private  health insurance companies. Medicare for All would require middle-class  Americans to pay much more in taxes. Medicare for All would threaten  the benefits that current Medicare beneficiaries receive, and those  people who have paid into the system for a lifetime should not have  Medicare, which has been part of the social fabric of America, put in  jeopardy by loading more people into it.   Government-run healthcare is a slogan, not an answer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to call my colleagues' attention  to an issue that has affected many families in Iowa and throughout the  country, and that issue is the cost of prescription drugs. The cost of  prescription drugs is an issue that comes up at almost every Q and A I  hold with Iowans at my annual 99-county meetings. During the last  Easter break, which was just completed, I did 20 of those 99 counties.   In the last 2 months, I started a bipartisan investigation with my  colleague, Ranking Member Wyden of the Finance Committee, into the  pricing of insulin. That investigation extends to insulin manufacturers  and pharmacy benefit managers. We need to find out how manufacturers  price their insulin products, and we need to find out if pharmacy  benefit managers are negotiating the lowest drug price possible from  manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans.   This isn't my first drug pricing investigation. In recent years, I  have investigated Gilead's pricing of hepatitis C drugs. The names of  those drugs are Sovaldi and Harvoni. I have been investigating Mylan's  EpiPen price increase.   Let me tell you, oversight by Congress in doing our constitutional  job does accomplish things. I have said it before and I will say it  again because you can't say it too often: Congress has a constitutional  responsibility to engage in robust and aggressive oversight of the  Federal Government and its programs.   My EpiPen investigation is a perfect example. Several years ago, I  began to receive letters, phone calls, and emails from my constituents  about the rapidly increasing, high price of the EpiPen. In 2007, a pack  of two EpiPens cost $100. By 2016, it had skyrocketed to over $600. Of  course, anybody paying it or even anybody hearing about it knows that  to be a substantial price increase. I wanted to find out what was  happening and what could be done to fix this problem of dramatically  increasing prices and maybe unwarranted prices.   My investigative and policy focus soon turned to the Medicaid Drug  Rebate Program administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is a contributing factor  that has played a part in how much money the government and the  taxpayers pay for some drugs, and, as you will find out, the waste of  some taxpayers' money.   Now, as a condition for participating in the program, drug companies  have to pay a rebate to the Federal Government and the States for the  drugs they offer. Generally speaking, the rebate dollar amount is  contingent on whether the drug is considered a brand name drug or  generic drug. A brand name drug pays a rebate of the greater of 23.1  percent of the average manufacturer price or the difference between  that and the drug's best price.   In the rebate program, the dollar amount is raised if the average  manufacturer price has increased faster than the rate of inflation. A  generic drug's rebate is 13 percent of the average manufacturer's  price.   Unfortunately, the rebate program has not worked as it was designed  to work. Drug companies have been able to game the system by paying  smaller rebates than they are supposed to, and, of course, the taxpayer  foots the bill.   EpiPen is a perfect example of this gaming of the system. This is how  the scheme works. Mylan classified the EpiPen as a generic under the  Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rather than as a brand name drug. After I  asked those at CMS about that classification, they told me the EpiPen  should not have been classified as a generic. Of course, because of  this incorrect classification, Mylan only had to pay a 13-percent  rebate instead of the 23.1-percent rebate. That means less money was  returned by the company to the Federal taxpayers and to the States'  taxpayers.    According to CMS, from 2011 to 2015, total Medicaid spending on the  EpiPen was $960 million. After rebates, net Medicaid spending was still  approximately $797 million. As opposed to Medicaid spending, Medicare  spending on the EpiPen in those same years was  [[Page S2471]]  $335 million. Taxpayers and the States' taxpayers were also on the hook  for these exorbitant overpayments for the better part of 10 years.   When I saw what was happening, I asked the Health and Human Services'  inspector general to look into these practices. Based on data already  on file, the inspector general was able to calculate the potential lost  rebate value dating back to 2006. The inspector general found that the  taxpayers may have overpaid for the EpiPen by as much as $1.27 billion  over a 10-year period of time because of the incorrect classification.  Eventually, Mylan settled a False Claims Act case with the Obama  administration's Justice Department for $465 million. Now, that $465  million is a far cry from how much Mylan got from the taxpayers while  it was pulling off this charade--in other words, $800 million less.   Upon learning of the settlement, I expressed my extreme  disappointment to the Justice Department. It just didn't seem that the  taxpayers had been made whole. Obviously, they had not been. According  to Attorney General Miller of my State of Iowa, my home State received  $1.5 million from the settlement. However, after my having made  repeated requests to justify how much that amount has made Iowa whole,  I have not received an answer yet. So, not only did Mylan's steep price  hike for one of the most widely needed drugs in this country hit  families hard, but it also hit the taxpayers' bottom line. We shouldn't  have to depend on lawyers and lawsuits to get the taxpayers' money  back. Government Agencies should be responsibly overseeing any program  that they are in charge of.   During the course of my investigation, it became clear that CMS  didn't believe that it had the legal authority to require drug  companies to reclassify drugs and impose civil monetary penalties for  incorrectly classifying drugs. Except for a few emails sent from CMS to  Mylan's representatives that questioned EpiPen's classification, for  years CMS did nothing. In other words, CMS was not doing its job, and  Mylan was taking advantage of it.   The inspector general has also stated that he lacked the legal  authority to affirmatively pursue penalties for the submission of  inaccurate drug classification data. As a result, Mylan was able to  escape accountability for a long time, which cost taxpayers billions of  dollars. This is just one case. Other drug manufacturers are gaming the  system as well.   In a December 2017 report, the inspector general found that 885 drugs  may have been potentially misclassified. Specifically, the inspector  general found that from 2012 to 2016, Medicaid may have lost $1.3  billion in rebates for just 10 potentially misclassified drugs with the  highest total of reimbursement. It is clear that the law needed to  change to provide much needed clarity on who had what authorities and  in order to hold the government, as well as the private sector,  accountable.   As a result of the findings in my EpiPen investigation, I, along with  my colleague Senator Wyden, drafted--and Congress later passed--the  Right Rebate Act. That all happened just a short period of time ago.  The act, which passed with strong bipartisan support, fixes the  problems that I identified through my investigation.   It closes the loophole that has allowed pharmaceutical manufacturers  to misclassify their drugs and overcharge the taxpayers by billions of  dollars.   The bill provides the HHS Secretary the authority to require drug  manufacturers to reclassify their drugs and impose civil monetary  penalties when drugs are knowingly misclassified.   It provides HHS with additional authorities to monitor drug  manufacturers that participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and  the legislation provides the States the ability to recover incorrect  rebate amounts.   Finally, the bill imposes reporting and transparency requirements on  HHS. An example of additional reporting requires the Secretary to  submit a report to Congress on an annual basis that describes four  things: one, the covered drugs that have been misclassified; two, the  steps that have been taken to reclassify the drugs; three, the actions  the Secretary has taken to ensure the payment of any rebate amounts  which were unpaid; four, an accounting of how funds have been used for  the oversight and enforcement of this new law.   All of these fixes and updates are now in place because my  constituents contacted me about the real-world problems they were  paying for and that were affecting their health as well as their  wallets. I instructed my oversight staff to investigate the problem.  They acquired the evidence, uncovered the facts, and, obviously,  exposed the holes in the existing law. Then, I instructed my policy  staff to take those findings to plug the holes and solve the problem  with new legislation, which is now law. This is exactly the purpose of  oversight. This is exactly how oversight is done.   Pretty simply, this isn't like reinventing the wheel every time. This  is oversight 101. Oversight means to bring transparency, and  transparency is meant to bring accountability. Oversight works, plain  and simple, and the Right Rebate Act that Senator Wyden and I brought  to passage is proof that oversight is working.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
