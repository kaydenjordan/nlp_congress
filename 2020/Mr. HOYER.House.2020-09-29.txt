 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, and Mr. Walden, the ranking member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, for bringing this bill to the floor.   But, most of all, I want to thank my friend, Dr. Phil Roe from  Tennessee. He is a medical doctor. He and I, as Mr. Walden pointed out,  for many, many years have been focused on making sure that those  children with asthma are safer in the school than they otherwise would  be if the schools were not prepared to deal with an asthmatic or  allergic attack. I want to thank Dr. Roe, who has been such a steadfast  ally and partner in this effort.   I am hopeful that this bill will go to the Senate, and when we come  back in the lameduck, hopefully, we will pass this and we will have  another bipartisan bill that will help children and the school systems  of America.   I am proud to be joined by Dr. Roe. It is emblematic of when you have  a problem that is needed to be solved, Madam Speaker; it is not a  partisan problem. These are not partisan issues. These are issues that  kids have, families have, and schools have.   We stood together on this floor 7 years ago when the House passed our  School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act. President Obama signed that  bipartisan bill into law in November 2013. It encouraged States to  adopt policies that require schools to stock emergency epinephrine and  train staff how to use it in case a student experiences a severe  allergy or asthma attack. Those attacks can result in death.   This is not just an inconvenience; this is just not an illness; it is  a mortal challenge, and I am proud that we got that bill done together  and we do again, today, the same.   This new bipartisan legislation would build on that earlier success,  as the ranking member and chairman of have all explained, by providing  additional incentives for States to ensure that American schools create  asthma management plans for students who need them.   This is not a difficult task, I might say, and it is not an expensive  task, but it has a lifesaving result.   I know all too well how terrifying severe childhood asthma can be. I  was diagnosed with asthma at age 4 when I went to the hospital in  Mexia, Texas. My father was stationed at a POW camp in Mexia, Texas,  not too far from Galveston. So I know the consequences of asthma.   In addition to that, my granddaughter has experienced severe food  allergies, a peanut allergy which is so much more evident today than it  was, for whatever reason, and is life threatening. I have been with my  granddaughter twice in the emergency room. Luckily, she got there in  time so that her life was not in danger, but had she not gotten there  in a timely fashion, it would have been.   Like many families, we constantly have to be vigilant and always keep  asthma inhalers present. My granddaughter always keeps an EpiPen with  her. She is 18 years of age, and she does not go anywhere without an  EpiPen.   Very frankly, my daughter, her mother, every school that she went to,  counseled with the principal, with the teacher, and with the school  personnel to let them know, A, that Alexa had that challenge and, B,  how to help her deal with it.                                time  1500    Having a plan to manage asthma and peanut allergies makes a critical  difference. This legislation will help reduce school absenteeism, for  which asthma is one of the leading causes. I know that because as an  elementary school and junior high school student, I lost significant  time because of asthma.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank Dr. Roe for his leadership on this  issue and for working with me on these bills over the years. He is  retiring at the end of this Congress, and I will certainly miss working  with him. We will miss his expertise here in the Congress of the United  States, and I know the Committee on Energy and Commerce will miss his  advice and counsel as well. I believe that legislation like this and  the law we enacted in 2013 will be a fitting part of his legacy of  public service.   Madam Speaker, I hope that all of our colleagues will join us in  supporting this legislation and in thanking Dr. Roe for his efforts to  ensure that protecting our Nation's children against asthma  consequences remains a truly bipartisan effort.
