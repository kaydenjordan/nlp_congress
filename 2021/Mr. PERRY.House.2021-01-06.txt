 Mr. President, sadly, but resolutely, I object to the  electoral votes of my beloved Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on the  grounds of multiple constitutional infractions that they were not under  all of the known circumstances regularly given; and on this occasion, I  have a written objection signed by a Senator and 80 Members of the  House of Representatives.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is the objection in writing and signed by a  Senator?    Yes, Mr. Vice President, it is.   The VICE PRESIDENT. An objection presented in writing and signed by  both a Representative and a Senator complies with the law, chapter 1 of  title 3, United States Code.   The Clerk will report the objection.   The Clerk read the objection as follows:                                                   January 7, 2021.        We, a United States Senator and Members of the House of       Representatives, object to the counting of the electoral       votes of the State of Pennsylvania on the ground that they       were not, under all of the known circumstances, regularly       given.

Are there further objections to the certificate  from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears none.   The two Houses will withdraw from joint session. Each House will  deliberate separately on the pending objection and report its decision  back to the joint session.   The Senate will now retire to its Chamber.   The Senate retired to its Chamber.                                time  0020     Madam Speaker, this is a somber day for the defense of the  Constitution. You see, the Constitution is just a piece of paper. It  cannot defend itself. That is why our leaders swear an oath to uphold  and defend the Constitution, and that is what I am doing here this  evening.   The Constitution states: ``The times, places, and manner of holding  elections . . . shall be prescribed . . . by the legislature''--not the  courts, not the Governor, not the secretary of state or other  bureaucrats or elected officials, the legislature.   In Pennsylvania, the supreme court unilaterally extended the deadline  for ballots to 3 days after the election. They actually wanted 10. The  supreme court is not the legislature. The supreme court mandated un- postmarked ballots to be received, destroying the validity of all the  votes that were cast timely.   The supreme court action defied the law, the legislature, and the  will of the people.   The supreme court authorized the use of drop boxes, where ballot  harvesting could occur. The legislature never authorized that form of  voting, and the court had absolutely no right to do so.   Responding to the secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, the supreme  court ruled that mail-in ballots need not authenticate signatures.   Once again, the court not only defied the Constitution and the will  of the people, but by so doing, they created a separate class of  voters, thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause prescribed in the  Constitution.   How can we have two legally separate classes of voters? Yet, the  court made it so, not the legislature.   The Constitution doesn't mention the court when determining the time,  place, and manner of elections because they are not authorized to make  those decisions. Yet, they did it.   And the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the case, denying the  evidence and denying the demands for justice from the people of  Pennsylvania and America.   These aren't my opinions. These aren't partisan viewpoints. These are  irrefutable facts.   Six days before the election, guidance emailed from the secretary of  state required that the counties shall not pre-canvass or canvass any  mail-in or civilian absentee ballots received between 8 o'clock Tuesday  and 5 o'clock Friday and that they must be kept separately. That was 6  days before the election.   Madam Speaker, 2 days before the election, counties received new  guidance from the secretary of state, informing counties that they  shall canvass segregated absentee and mail-in ballots as soon as  possible upon receipt.   The secretary of state is not elected by the people. She is not a  member of the legislature. Yet, she, and she alone, determined the time  and manner of elections. That was unconstitutional.   In defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court order that all ballots received  after election day be segregated, the secretary of state knew, once  they were canvassed, that is opened and commingled with all the other  ballots, they would be counted with all the rest.   And what is the remedy for this defiance, for this lawbreaking? So  far, the court has decided there is no remedy. There is no penalty for  this lawlessness, this dilution of lawfully cast votes, this defiance  of the Constitution--no remedy. When the State legislature requested  the Governor to convene a special session to address the unanswered  questions and try to provide a remedy, he refused.   When votes are accepted under unconstitutional means without fair and  equal protection for all, the only result can be an illegitimate  outcome--illegitimate.   The voters did not create this mess, but the will of the people is  absolutely being subverted by the deliberate and willful actions of  individuals defying their oath, the law, and the Constitution.   In Pennsylvania, we use the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors,  or SURE, system as the basis of determining who can vote.  Unfortunately, a recent attempted audit by the Democrat State auditor  general concluded that he was unable to establish with any degree of  reasonable assurance that the SURE system is secure and that  Pennsylvania voter registration records are complete and accurate.   That is what we are relying on. That right there. This is the very  same system used to certify the election in the contest for President  of the United States. This is the very same system that the State used  to certify the 2020 election, even though its figures do not match more  than half of Pennsylvania's 67 counties.    To this day, right now, while we stand here, how can this election be  certified using a system that after 2 months still displays that over  205,000 more votes were cast in Pennsylvania than people who voted in  the November election? Let me say that again: 205,000 more votes than  voters.    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    When is the appropriate time to ask that the words be  stricken, be taken down?
