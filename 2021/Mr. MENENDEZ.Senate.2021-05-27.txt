The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, which       contains the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a Global       Positioning System (GPS), and a set of Aerosurfaces and an       umbilical Cover, which allows the JDAM to improve the       accuracy of unguided, general purpose bombs. The Guidance       Set, when combined with a warhead and appropriate fuse, forms       a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The JDAM weapon can be       delivered from modest standoff ranges at high or low       altitudes against a variety of land and surface targets       during the day or night. After release, JDAM autonomously       guides to a target, using the resident GPS-aided INS guidance       system. The JDAM is capable of receiving target coordinates       via preplanned mission data from the delivery aircraft, by       onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FUR, Radar, etc.) during       captive carry, or from a third-party source via manual or       automated aircrew cockpit entry.        The KMU-572 is the guidance set for a GBU-38 (500-pound       bomb body) JDAM Tail Kit.        18. The Laser JDAM (GBU-54) is a 500-pound JDAM that       incorporates all the capabilities of the JDAM guidance kit       and adds a precision laser guidance set. The Guidance Set       consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the Inertial       Navigation System (INS) and a Global Positioning System (GPS)       receiver, a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which       allows the JDAM to improve the accuracy of unguided, general       purpose bombs. The Laser JDAM (LJDAM) adds the DSU-38/40       sensor, which gives the system a semi-active laser seeker.       This allows the weapon to strike targets moving at up to 70       mph.        19. GBU-12/58 Paveway II (PW-II) 500-pound (GBU-12) and       250-pound (GBU-58) are maneuverable, free-fall, laser-guided       bombs (LGBs) that guides to reflected laser energy from the       desired target. Employment of the LGB is the same as a normal       general purpose (GP) warhead, except the semi-active guidance       corrects for employment errors inherent in any delivery       system. Laser designation for the weapon can be provided by a       variety of laser target markers or designators from the air       or ground. The Paveway system consists of a laser guidance       kit, a computer control group (CCG), a warhead-specific Air       Foil Group (AFG) that attach to the nose and tail of MK-81       and MK-82 General Purpose (GP) bombs, and a fuse.

Transmittal No. 21-40       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer and Acceptance           Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control           Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. M1A2 System Enhancement Package 3 (SEPv3) Main Battle       Tank. The M1A2 Abrams is a third-generation American main       battle tank, produced by General Dynamics Land Systems. The       M1A2 SEPv3 features include a multi-fuel turbine engine,       composite armor, an advanced computer fire control system,       separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and       120mm main gun. Extensive improvements have been implemented       to the latest M1A2 SEPv3 configuration. These include       improved digital systems, increased electrical power margin       to support demands of future technologies, line replaceable       modules (LRM) to reduce operational support costs, ammunition       data link to support new tank main gun rounds, and an       auxiliary power unit (APU). The M1A2 Thermal Imaging System       (TIS) and M1A2 Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV)       constitute the system's target acquisition system, which,       when operated with other tank systems gives the tank crew a       substantial battlefield advantage. The TIS provides the M1A2       crew with the ability to effectively aim and fire the tank       main armament system under a broad range of adverse       battlefield conditions. The TIS can be operated and viewed by       the tank gunner or tank commander, and is the main sighting       system for the tanks' main gun (cannon.) The CITV provides       the same target acquisition system as the TIS, but provides       the tank commander a separate system that can be controlled       and operated independent of the TIS. Australia has       commissioned the development and production of bespoke Turret       Front armor to be used in their M1A2SEPv3. This armor is       being developed by the USG in consultation and coordination       with the CoA to ensure that it is optimized to their       perceived threat matrix.        2. The Abrams 120mm main gun system is composed of a 120       millimeter smoothbore gun manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal.       Gun production and design technology are generally well       known.        3. The use of a gas turbine propulsion system in the M1A2       is a unique application of armored vehicle power pack       technology. The hardware is composed of the AGT-1500 engine       and transmission, and while the system is not a critical       military technology the manufacturing processes associated       with the turbine blades, recuperator, bearings and shafts,       and hydrostatic pump and motor are proprietary and therefore       commercially competition sensitive.        4. The Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station--Low Profile       (CROWS-LP) is the M1A2 commander's weapon station, and allows       for under-armor operation of the weapons on the system       including the M2HB, M2A1, M240B and M240 machine guns. The       CROWS-LP is an updated version of the M153A2 CROWS, is       approximately 10 inches shorter, and offers increased       visibility to the user. The fire control system of the CROWS-      LP allows for ``first-burst'' on target capability from       stationary and moving platforms. The CROWS-LP ingratiates a       day camera (VIM-C), thermal camera (TIM 1500) and laser range       finder (STORM/STORM-PI).        5. The Driver Vision Enhancer--Abrams (DVE-A) and Rear View       Sensor System (RVSS) are un-cooled thermal imaging systems       developed for use while driving combat vehicles and tactical       wheeled vehicles. The DVE-A provides night vision capability       for the Abrams tank driver. RVSS provides a rear view camera       for the Abrams tank. DVE-A and RVSS allow for tactical       vehicle movement in support of operational missions in all       environmental conditions (day/night and all weather) and       provides enhanced driving capability during limited       visibility conditions.        6. M88A2 Heavy Equipment Recovery Vehicle. M88A2 Heavy       Equipment Recovery Combat Utility Lifting Extraction System       (HERCULES) Combat Recovery Vehicle is to extricate combat       vehicles that have become bogged down or entangled, and to       repair or replace damaged parts in fighting vehicles while       under fire. The 70-ton M88A2 Recovery Combat Vehicle is       standard equipment to de-process, recover, and sustain the       Abrams Ml Tank.        7. The M88A2's AVDS-1790-8CR is a unique modification to       the standard piston engine family in the M60 series and the       base M88Al. Manufacturing processes associated with the       production of turbochargers, fuel injection system, and       cylinders are proprietary and therefore commercially       competition sensitive.        8. The Driver's Vision Enhancer--Combat Vehicle M88 is an       un-cooled thermal imaging system developed for use on combat       and tactical wheeled vehicles. It allows for tactical vehicle       movement in all environmental and limited visibility       conditions. The DVE-CV for M88 vehicle is a platform-mounted       night vision device that requires external power supply and       is integrated into the vehicle. The M88 is also equipped with       CROWS-LP (M153A2E1), described above for the Abrams.        9. The Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV). The ABV is a highly       mobile and heavily armored minefield and complex obstacle       breaching system. It consists of an M1 Abrams tank hull, a       unique turret with two Linear Demolition Charge Systems (       employing two Mine Clearing Line Charges (MCLC) and rockets),       a Lane Marking System (LMS), Integrated Vision System, and a       High Lift Adapter that interchangeably mounts mine plows,       rollers, and dozer blades.        10. The Driver Vision Enhancer. Abrams (DVE-A) and Assault       Breacher Vehicle Integrated Vision System (IVS) are un-cooled       thermal imaging systems developed for use while driving       combat vehicles and tactical wheeled vehicles. The DVE-A       provides night vision capability for the ABV tank driver. IVS       provides a rear view camera for the ABV. The ABV is equipped       with the AGT 1500 Gas Turbine Propulsion System and the       CROWS-LP described in the Abrams and M88A2 sections above.        11. The ABV is equipped with a Magnetic Signature       Duplicator which mounts to the forward engineering       attachments.

The estimated total cost is $1.7 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the military capability of Canada, a NATO ally       that is an important force for ensuring political stability       and economic progress, and a contributor to military,       peacekeeping and humanitarian operations around the world.        This proposed sale will increase Canadian maritime forces'       interoperability with the United States and other allied       forces, as well as their ability to contribute to missions of       mutual interest by delivering the first AEGIS-capable       Canadian Surface Combatant ships. This will significantly       improve network-centric warfare capability for the U.S.       forces operating globally alongside Canada. Canada will have       no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems, Moorestown, NJ. There are a significant       number of other companies under contract with the U.S. Navy       that will provide components, systems, and engineering       services during the execution of this effort. While the       purchaser typically requests offsets, any offset agreement       will be defined in future negotiations between the purchaser       and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple       trips by U.S. Government representatives and the assignment       of contractor representatives to Canada on an intermittent       basis over the life of the case to support delivery and       integration of items and to provide supply support       management, inventory control and equipment familiarization.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
