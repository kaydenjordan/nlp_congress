 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here today to celebrate the 18th  Annual National Charter Schools Week and thank the students, parents,  and teachers from charter schools across the United States for their  ongoing contributions to education. Senator Bennet of Colorado and I  introduced a resolution marking this event, which the Senate approved  yesterday.   Let me tell you my favorite story about charter schools. It was 24  years ago, 1992. I was in my last month as U.S. Secretary of Education,  and as my last official act, I wrote a letter to every school  superintendent in the country asking them to consider replicating the  early success of the State of Minnesota in creating charter schools.  There were about a dozen of them then, and they were created by the  Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota. That was consistent with  what President George H.W. Bush and I had been encouraging, which was  what we called start-from-scratch schools--schools that gave teachers  more freedom and parents more choices. We thought that could improve  education in the country and might lead to what we call new American  schools.   The first charter schools were created in the State of Minnesota  nearly a quarter of a century ago, led by the Democratic-Farmer-Labor  Party, and there were about a dozen of them. Since then, there has been  broad bipartisan, mainstream support for charter schools.   Let's remember that charter schools are public schools. They are  simply public schools which are freer from government rules, Federal  rules, State rules, and union rules and which give teachers more  freedom to teach the children who are presented to them and parents  more freedom to choose those public schools.  [[Page S2675]]    Some of those who supported the creation of charter schools include  Albert Shanker, the late head of the American Federation of Teachers.  In 1997, President Clinton said: We need 3,000 charter schools by the  year 2002. George W. Bush, in the No Child Left Behind legislation,  supported charter schools. President Obama was a strong supporter of  charter schools while he was in office. His first U.S. Secretary of  Education, Arne Duncan, called himself a ``strong supporter'' of  charter schools. President Obama's second U.S. Education Secretary,  John King, founded a charter school and ran a system of charter  schools. Secretary Betsy DeVos, the current Secretary of Education, has  spent most of her life as a strong supporter of charter schools. In  1994, 1998, 2001, and 2015, the U.S. Congress supported charter schools  by large margins and in a bipartisan manner. Over 44 States and the  District of Columbia have created an environment through their laws for  charter schools.   In 30 years, public charter schools have grown from a dozen in  Minnesota to more than 6,900 today. Today, charter schools are serving  over 3.1 million students. Over 6 percent of all public school students  in America today now attend charter schools, and another 1 million  students are on waiting lists for charter schools. This past year saw  an estimated enrollment increase of over 200,000 students, representing  a 7-percent growth in just one school year.   Over half of the students served by these institutions are eligible  for free or reduced-priced lunches, over half are students of color,  and 17 percent are limited English proficient--all higher percentages  than those served in traditional public schools.   As I said earlier, charter schools are about freedom for teachers,  choices for parents, and more and better opportunities for students.  Charter schools enable people. They enable parents to help their  children get a real opportunity by choosing better schools or at least  schools that fit them better and help them succeed. They enable  students to learn and succeed. They enable teachers to succeed by  giving them the freedom to use their firsthand knowledge. They enable  administrators to succeed by ending bureaucratic mandates and giving  them a chance to use their own good judgment.   In amending the No Child Left Behind Act, which we called the Every  Student Succeeds Act, we made a number of changes to strengthen and  expand the Federal Charter Schools Program, which since 1994 has given  grants to States to start new charter schools.   ESSA, as we call it, made improvements to that program to ensure that  those funds are used as effectively as possible to increase the number  of high-quality charter schools. Specifically, ESSA invests more  Federal funds in the replication and expansion of high-quality charter  schools with a proven record of success, while still giving States the  flexibility to invest in innovative new methods. ESSA continues Federal  support for nonprofit organizations which help charter schools find  suitable facilities, while also encouraging States to assist charter  schools in this task.   Now these hard-working and creative educators who are seeking to open  charter schools have greater flexibility in how they use Federal  startup funds--for example, by allowing them to use the funds for  transportation or facilities improvement, if that is what they decide  is the best use of those funds for their children and their community.   Finally, the Every Student Succeeds Act encourages States to provide  charter schools with the support they need to be successful and to hold  them accountable when they fail to demonstrate positive results.   Charter schools are public schools stripped of many Federal, State,  and union rules and constraints that are placed on traditional public  schools. The money the State would ordinarily spend on the district  school follows each child to the charter school instead.   Across Tennessee, more than 30,000 students now have that same  opportunity to attend one of 107 charter schools, and they are thriving  as a result. A recent study by Stanford University found that on  average, Tennessee students attending charter schools gained the  equivalent of 86 additional days of instruction in reading and 72  additional days of instruction in math each year than did students  attending traditional district schools. In other words, they make  almost a year and a half's worth of progress in a single school year.   More than 80 percent of students attending charter schools in  Tennessee are low income, and more than 94 percent are African American  or Hispanic. In other words, charter schools in Tennessee are making a  difference for those students who have traditionally been least well- served by our Nation's public schools. That is a worthy event to  celebrate in this 18th annual National Charter Schools Week, to  celebrate how charter schools have grown from a dozen start-from- scratch schools in the State of Minnesota 25 years ago to more than  6,900 today.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
