 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding.  [[Page H5234]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Medicaid Reentry Act,  and I urge all Members to support its swift passage in the House.   This bill is about saving lives, pure and simple. 64,000 Americans  died of a drug overdose in 2016, more than were lost at the peak of the  HIV/AIDS crisis. Based on data from the States, we can estimate that as  many as 10,000 of those deaths annually are individuals who have had  some interaction with the criminal justice system in the previous year.  This is a national emergency that demands immediate action.   Individuals who are returning to society after a stay in a  corrections facility are particularly vulnerable to overdose deaths.  Research has found that formerly incarcerated individuals reentering  society are 129 times more likely to die of an overdose during their  first 2 weeks back into the community than the general population.   The risk of overdose is elevated during this period due to reduced  physiological tolerance for opioids among the incarcerated population,  a lack of effective addiction treatment options while incarcerated, and  perhaps poor care transitions back into their given community.   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, roughly 60 percent of  our incarcerated population has a substance use disorder, yet only  around one-quarter of those are receiving any type of treatment.   Even for those receiving treatment, out of the roughly 5,000 jails  and prisons in our country, fewer than 40 provide medication-assisted  addiction treatment using methadone or buprenorphine, which, along with  naltrexone, is considered the gold standard in treating opioid use  disorder.                                time  1445    Those that do offer full-scale MAT services are seeing results. I  have seen firsthand the success of a MAT program called SHARP at the  Albany County Correctional Facility in upstate New York where  individuals shared anecdotes with me about how access to treatment has  transformed their lives for the better.   We have seen even more compelling data from the State of Rhode  Island, where a comprehensive addiction treatment program offering  access to all FDA-approved forms of medication-assisted treatment in  State corrections facilities was able to lower deaths in the first year  post-release by a staggering 61 percent.   My legislation would open the door to more of these success stories  and is designed to increase State flexibility in the Medicaid program  to address the vulnerable population during the 30 days prior to an  individual's release.   As amended, the Medicaid Reentry Act would require the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to release guidance to State Medicaid  Directors on demonstration opportunities that would allow States to  waive the current Medicaid inmate payment restriction during this  prerelease period so that individuals could better access mental health  and addiction care and have an improved care transition back into the  community.   By passing this bill, we can allow States to expand innovative  approaches to reentry that are already underway in places such as New  York, Ohio, New Mexico, and Rhode Island.   I thank Energy and Commerce Chair  Greg Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone and their staffs for the constructive collaboration on this  bill. I also thank my Republican colleague Representative Mike Turner  for his efforts to help shine a light on this vulnerable population.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, while I would have liked to have gone even  further with this effort, I believe that this smart-on-crime  legislation will plant the seeds for meaningful change and will help to  give individuals reentering society a fighting chance to live a  healthier, drug-free life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
