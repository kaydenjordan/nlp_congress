 Madam President, before I turn to other business, let  me just say how grateful I am to have had the chance to be here and to  hear the West Virginia Senators discuss this distinguished gentleman  and to join them in welcoming his family to the U.S. Senate. My father,  too, was a World War II marine, and it is a sad thing as the tides of  time sweep that generation through its dying years.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session to be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 384, S.  3470.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 413, S.  Res. 638.    I further ask that the committee-reported substitute  amendment to the resolution be agreed to.    I know of no further debate on the resolution, as  amended.    I ask that the preamble be agreed to and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, July 14, and that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Heinzelman nomination postcloture; that all  postcloture time be considered expired at 11:45 a.m. and the Senate  vote on confirmation of the nomination; further, that following the  vote, the Senate resume consideration of the Childs nomination, and the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination at 1:45  p.m.; further, that if any nominations are confirmed during Thursday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    For the information of the Senate, the first rollcall  vote of the day will begin at 11:45 a.m. on confirmation of the  Heinzelman nomination to be General Counsel of the CIA, with another  vote at 1:45 p.m. on the motion to invoke cloture on the Childs  nomination to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia  Circuit.                            ____________________     Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Portman and  Wyden.
