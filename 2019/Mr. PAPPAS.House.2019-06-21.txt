 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my high school  U.S. history teacher, Kathleen Mirabile, who retired last week after  serving the Manchester School District for 49 years, 42 of those at my  alma mater of Central High School.   Mrs. Mirabile is a Central High institution, and her passion for her  subject matter and dedication to her profession made her an exemplary  teacher. She was a longtime leader of the social studies department and  the National Honor Society.   She gave back to her community in many ways, including leading  efforts locally to preserve and share the history of Manchester.   Mrs. Mirabile knows that history is not simply a collection of dates,  facts and figures; it is about people. We must understand it or be  bound to repeat it.   I think of her lessons on a regular basis, and so do thousands of New  Hampshire students who have walked through her classroom doors.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire's First District, I thank  Mrs. Mirabile for incredible service and wish her the best in her well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
