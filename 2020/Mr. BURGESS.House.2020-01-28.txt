 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Again, just to recapitulate, today's rule provides for consideration  of legislation to do two things: one, to limit funding for any military  action in or against Iran; and, two, repeal the 2002 Authorization for  Use of Military Force. I do believe it is correct to advocate for  Congress to retake Article I powers, and it is correct to negotiate a  new Authorization for Use of Military Force.   I was not here in 2002. I was not able to vote on that legislation.  However, we should not repeal the existing 2002 authorization without a  hearing, without a markup, and without fully assessing how it will  affect our troops in the region. Further, we should evaluate whether or  not a new Authorization for Use of Military Force should take its  place.   In fact, 2 or 3 weeks ago, Democratic leadership of this House  brought H. Con. Res. 83. The House passed this earlier this month. In  the findings, the majority stated: ``The United States has national  interests in preserving its partnership with Iraq.'' Yet, here we are  now just a few weeks later considering a repeal of that very authority.    If it was important 3 weeks ago, how did it become unimportant today?  We don't know because we haven't had a hearing.   Limiting funding for any military action in and against Iran simply  broadcasts our plans or lack thereof to the enemy, potentially inciting  further aggression. Weakness is provocative.   I voted for an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act  prohibiting funding for authorized military action in Iran because it  was offered, considered, and voted on following regular order. But  neither piece of legislation addressing war authorities before us today  has been marked up or has had committee consideration.   We heard last night in the Rules Committee that there have been  hearings focused on Iran and that, in fact, suffices. But,  realistically, regional hearings do not allow for the serious  discussion required for an Authorization for Use of Military Force and  including funding for military action.   In addition, currently, the Democratic majority is using a vehicle  that removes minority Republicans' ability to offer that one  opportunity to amend the bill that is known as the motion to recommit.  That is a long-honored tradition of both sides that there should at  least be one opportunity for the minority to be heard.   So, I believe it is wrong to rush to limit war authorities, and it is  irresponsible.   Do you know what, Madam Speaker? In a dangerous world, it is  downright dangerous. Congress should be authorizing action through a  renegotiated Authorization for Use of Military Force rather than  passing a resolution prohibiting funding for military activity.                                time  1330    I remember on the floor of this House, a former colleague, Rob  Simmons from Connecticut, a Republican, when there was an effort to  limit funding during the most kinetic part of the Iraq war. Mr. Simmons  had served in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam conflict, and he  related, from one of these very podia, how, as a young soldier in  Vietnam, he had heard that Congress had withdrawn the funding for what  he was doing. I will never forget his words. He said: At that moment, I  hated the United States Congress.   That is the effect we can have on the young men and women whom we  have sent to answer the call of duty, that Congress could and should be  working to provide the necessary authorities for our Commander in Chief  as he directs these brave young men and women in uniform rather than  broadcasting our limitations to the enemy.   Again, weakness is provocative.
