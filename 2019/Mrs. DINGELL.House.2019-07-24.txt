 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both Chairman Scott and Chairman Neal  for their leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 397, the Butch Lewis  Act. This is a historic moment for working men and women in this  country, and it has been a long time coming because people have been  working on this for a long time.   Today, we are telling millions of Americans who worked a lifetime for  their pensions that are now in jeopardy, through no fault of their own,  that we are standing with you. We are listening. We are taking action.   For too long, these working men and women have worked in fear, not  knowing what was going to happen. They have given up pay raises. They  played by the rules. They thought they would have a safe and secure  retirement. By passing the Butch Lewis Act, we are sending a loud  message that we hear them and are taking steps to ensure that their  retirement that they worked for, for a lifetime, will be there when  they need it.   This is money hardworking men and women earned and counted on to  retire safely, to afford to stay in their homes, to afford food on  their table, and to afford their medicine. American workers have done  their part. The House will soon do its part.   I hope the Senate will also act quickly because I know the men and  women, they have come to my door at 7 a.m., they have threatened  suicide. They are scared.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in support of this  legislation. One is from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,  and one is from UNITE HERE.                                       International Brotherhood of                                                       Teamsters,                                                      July 18, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The House of Representatives will soon       have the opportunity to ensure that more than a million       retirees and workers who have played by the rules will       receive the pension benefits they have earned through years       of hard work. On behalf of the International Brotherhood of       Teamsters, its retirees and working families, I ask for a yes       vote on H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer       Pensions Act (often referred to as The Butch Lewis Act). As       you know, this legislation is of the highest priority for the       Teamsters Union.        The multiemployer pension system has for many decades been       an essential foundation for providing financial security in       retirement for millions of Americans and their families. Now,       through no fault of their own, the earned pension benefits of       millions of retirees are being threatened due to the       ``critical and declining'' (financial) status and the       impending insolvency of a number of multiemployer pension       plans. No doubt you have heard from retirees and families who       live with this uncertainty and whose lives have been turned       upside down. H.R. 397 will ensure that we meet our       obligations to current retirees and workers for years to come       and to do so without retiree benefit cuts. It will strengthen       these plans and provide a path forward for financial       stability and solvency. It will provide improved retirement       security for both workers and retirees. And, it will lessen       the financial pressure on the Pension Benefit Guarantee       Corporation (PBGC) which also faces insolvency.        The bill creates a Pension Rehabilitation Administration       (PRA) which would sell  [[Page H7325]]       Treasury-issued bonds on the open market and then loan money       from the bond sale to these critical and declining       multiemployer pension plans. Plans borrowing from the PRA       must set aside the money in separate investments that match       pension payments for retirees. Retirees and their families       are guaranteed their promised benefits. It will also free up       remaining assets and future contributions to protect the       benefits for active workers.        PRA loans will not be sufficient to help all financially       troubled multiemployer pension plans. Some will need       additional help. For such plans, the bill proposes that the       PBGC provide such help. In doing so, the cost to the Federal       government and the U.S. economy will be far less than       allowing Plans and the PBGC to fail. Unlike the current       federal pension insurance program, H.R. 397 protects benefits       before plan failure.        The financial distress many of these plans face were and       are beyond the control of these retirees and workers.       Multiemployer pension plans have been buffeted by economic       turbulence over the decades--from deregulation to financial       melt downs to recessions.        Pension statutes and legislation are extraordinarily       complex, none more so than multiemployer and Taft-Hartley       pension plans. They are both unique in their structure, and       the challenges they have faced. If these plans fail, it will       not only impact the retirees receiving the benefit, there       will be a broader impact on their communities and the       economy--adverse effects on economic growth and tax losses to       state, local and federal governments.        H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act       provides a mechanism for ``critical and declining''       multiemployer pension plans to address their serious       underfunding problem. It will strengthen these plans and       provide a path forward for financial stability and solvency.       Importantly, the bill does this while avoiding retiree       benefit cuts.        I hope that I can report to our retirees and members in       your district that you stood with the International       Brotherhood of Teamsters family to enact this critically       important legislation. Vote to protect retirement benefits.       Vote yes on H.R. 397.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,      General President.                                   ____                                                       UNITEHERE!,                                       Las Vegas, NV, July 17, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 300,000 members of       UNITE HERE and their families, we strongly urge your support       for H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for Multi-Employer Pensions       Act.        At a time when hard working American's are already anxious       about an economy where one job should be enough but often       isn't to make ends meet, we should also be very concerned       about the retirement security of millions of Americans.        H.R. 397, also known as the ``Butch-Lewis Act'', includes a       modest, common sense approach to bringing stability and       reassurance to the retirement pensions of over a million       Americans. Only a small number of multi-employer plans are       facing financial difficulty, but that does not ease the pain       and potential devastation for the millions who honorably       worked hard for themselves and their families. We are talking       about auto workers, truck drivers, iron workers and other       impacted workers who live, work and retire in our       communities.        If we do not offer the means to see those impacted plans       through to solvency, we will all feel the pain of their       distress during their retirement years--a time they have       worked hard to attain.        On behalf of our members, I again urge you to support H.R.       397 and stand up for millions of middle-class Americans who       should be able to retire in dignity.                                                         D. Taylor,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott and Chairman Neal  for their leadership and taking a lot of words and putting it into real  action.
