 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 336) calling on the Government of the Russian  Federation to provide evidence or to release United States citizen Paul  Whelan, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 336         Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan is a resident of       Novi, Michigan, and a United States Marine Corps veteran;        Whereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow for the wedding of a       personal friend on December 22, 2018;        Whereas Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Paul       Whelan at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow on December 28, 2018,       and charged him with espionage;        Whereas the Federal Security Service has never provided any       evidence of supposed wrongdoing;        Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison and       was held there for more than 19 months after his arrest in       pretrial detention;        Whereas a Moscow court extended Paul Whelan's pretrial       detention multiple times without publicly presenting       justification or evidence of wrongdoing;        Whereas even Paul Whelan's Federal Security Service-      appointed lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019,       ``[The Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out what they       have, but in this case, we've seen nothing concrete against       Whelan in five months. That means there is nothing.'';        Whereas the then United States Ambassador to the Russian       Federation, Jon Huntsman, responded on April 12, 2019, to a       question about the detention of Paul Whelan, ``If the       Russians have evidence, they should bring it forward. We have       seen nothing. If there was a case, I think the evidence would       have been brought forward by now.'';        Whereas then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with       Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and       urged him to ensure United States citizens are not unjustly       held abroad;        Whereas the Kremlin has refused Paul Whelan full access to       his lawyer and the so-called evidence against him;        Whereas any evidence he has seen is in Russian, a language       Paul does not read or speak;        Whereas Lefortovo pretrial detention facility and the       Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to provide medical       treatment for Paul Whelan's medical condition, despite being       aware of its worsening state, resulting in emergency surgery       on May 29, 2020;        Whereas Paul Whelan was wrongfully convicted on June 15,       2020, and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor camp by a       3-judge panel, in a trial witnessed by then United States       Ambassador John Sullivan, who referred to it as ``a mockery       of justice'' due to the denial of a fair trial and the       exclusion of defense witnesses;        Whereas in August 2020, on an unknown day because he was       moved secretly, Paul Whelan was transferred to camp IK-17, a       penal labor camp in Mordovia, where he is forced to work 6       days a week in a garment factory;        Whereas Ambassador John Sullivan, while visiting Paul       Whelan at the labor camp in Mordovia, stated that ``Russian       authorities . . . have never shown the world evidence of his       guilt,'' and reiterated his call that the Russian authorities       correct this injustice and release Mr. Whelan; and        Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with       Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on February 4, 2021,       and urged him to release Americans detained in Russia,       including Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed, so that they are able       to return home to their families in the United States: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) demands the Government of the Russian Federation       present credible evidence on the allegations against Paul       Whelan or immediately release him from imprisonment;        (2) demands the Government of the Russian Federation comply       with its international treaty obligations and provide       unrestricted consular access to Paul Whelan while he remains       imprisoned in Russia;        (3) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, and all others imprisoned       for political motivations or otherwise unjustly imprisoned       their constitutionally afforded due process rights and       universally recognized human rights; and        (4) expresses sympathy to the family of Paul Whelan for       this travesty to justice and personal hardship, and expresses       hope that their ordeal can soon be brought to a just end.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 336, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 336, calling  on the Government of the Russian Federation to provide evidence or to  release United States citizen Paul Whelan.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stevens for her tireless work on  behalf of her constituent, Paul Whelan, whom Russia has held hostage as  a political prisoner for over 3 years.   For more than 1,300 days the Russian Government has put Paul and his  family through unimaginable torment: taking away Paul's freedom,  threatening his health, and denying him his most basic human rights-- all for the purpose of using an American citizen--a human being--as a  political bargaining chip.   Paul's treatment at the hands of the Russian Government and its so- called justice system is shocking, but unfortunately, hardly  surprising.   As we witness the horrors committed by Putin, his enablers, and  Russian forces in Ukraine, we are reminded of the lengths that the  authoritarian regime in the Kremlin will go to achieve its nefarious  objectives. But neither Paul nor any political prisoner is a tool to be  used for an end. They are human beings with families who just want to  see justice served and see their loved ones home safe and sound.  [[Page H4524]]    In light of the horrific treatment Paul has endured, I thank our  wonderful diplomats in Russia, particularly Ambassador John Sullivan,  as well as Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Roger Carstens, working  under tremendous pressure from the Russian Government to see that Paul  Whelan, Brittney Griner, and other Americans detained in Russia are  treated with dignity and that their human rights are respected.   Good news today, we are thrilled that in large part due to their  work, Trevor Reed is now on his way home. We cannot stop until Paul's  family and other families with Americans detained overseas are given  that same relief. These families work tirelessly to remind us that we  cannot stop pushing--they deserve that same level of dedication from  all of us.   H. Res. 336, calling on the Government of the Russian Federation to  provide evidence or to release United States citizen Paul Whelan, takes  another step toward securing that safe and swift release of American  citizens from unjust detention abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I support this important resolution and thank the  gentlewoman from Michigan for introducing it. I urge all Members to  vote in support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   I also thank my dear friend and colleague from South Carolina for  delivering to me a Ukraine-United States solidarity pin that I now wear  proudly on my lapel.   Freedom is at the core of our American values. It is the backbone of  democracy. We have Americans stuck in Russia and around the world being  held against their will and without explanation to be used as political  bargaining chips.   During this time of horrific atrocities, their safe and secure  release is all the more imperative. H. Res. 336 takes action to secure  the safety of our fellow Americans, including Brittany Griner and Paul  Whelan, who are at the mercy of Vladimir Putin, an evil dictator who  has no regard for human life.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7314) to require the Secretary of State to submit to  Congress a report on the People's Republic of China's support to the  Russian Federation with respect to its unprovoked invasion of and full- scale war against Ukraine, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7314         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Assessing Xi's Interference       and Subversion Act'' or ``AXIS Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) On February 4, 2022, weeks ahead of the Russian       Federation's invasion of Ukraine, Russia and the People's       Republic of China released a joint statement following a       meeting between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, which outlined       a strategic partnership with ``no limits'' and no       ``forbidden'' areas for cooperation.        (2) On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an       unprovoked and unjustified act of war.        (3) China abstained from voting on the February 25, 2022,       United Nations Security Council resolution and the March 2,       2022, United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning       Russia's invasion of Ukraine.        (4) As of April 1, 2022, China has not publicly condemned       Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.        (5) In his call with Xi Jinping on March 18, 2022,       President Joe Biden communicated that there would be       ``implications and consequences if China provides material       support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against       Ukrainian cities and civilians''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the People's Republic of China's disinformation efforts       relating to the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine make       it culpable in whitewashing Russia's war crimes, which       include the indiscriminate killing of countless Ukrainian       men, women, and children; and        (2) if China is found to be materially supporting Russia in       its war against Ukraine, there should be swift and stringent       consequences for China.       SEC. 3. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act and every 90 days thereafter, the       Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of       Commerce and the Director of National Intelligence as       appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a report on whether and how the People's Republic       of China, including the Government of the People's Republic       of China, the Chinese Communist Party, any Chinese state-      owned enterprise, and any other Chinese entity, has provided       support to the Russian Federation with respect to its       unprovoked invasion of and full-scale war against Ukraine.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required by       subsection (a) shall include a discussion of the People's       Republic of China support to the Russian Federation with       respect to--        (1) helping the Government of Russia or Russian entities       evade or circumvent United  [[Page H4526]]       States sanctions or multilateral sanctions and export       controls;        (2) deliberately inhibiting onsite United States Government       export control end-use checks, including interviews and       investigations, in China;        (3) providing Russia with any technology, including       semiconductors classified as EAR99, that supports Russian       intelligence or military capabilities;        (4) establishing economic or financial arrangements that       will have the effect of alleviating the impact of United       States sanctions or multilateral sanctions;        (5) furthering Russia's disinformation and propaganda       efforts;        (6) coordinating to hinder the response of multilateral       organizations, including the United Nations, to provide       assistance to the people or Government of Ukraine, to condemn       Russia's war, to hold Russia accountable for the invasion and       its prosecution of the war, or to hold those complicit       accountable; and        (7) providing any material, technical, or logistical       support, including to Russian military or intelligence       agencies and state-owned or state-linked enterprises.        (c) Form.--The report required by subsection (a) shall be       submitted in unclassified form and published on the       Department of State's publicly available website.        (d) Sunset.--The requirement to submit the report required       by subsection (a) shall terminate on the earlier of--        (1) the date on which the Secretary of State determines the       conflict in Ukraine has ended; or        (2) the date that is 2 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7314, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7314, the AXIS Act,  authored by our committee colleague, Representative   Andy Barr.   The world watched in horror as Russia launched its latest invasion of  Ukraine, marking an egregious violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and a  disdain for the rules-based international order. Russia has mercilessly  killed thousands of innocent civilians. Graphic images of death and  destruction from Bucha and Mariupol lay bare: There is no defense for  Putin's barbarity.   Amid this carnage, the international community has overwhelmingly  come together to condemn Russia's brutal, unprovoked aggression against  Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for the gross atrocities being  committed.   While China has tried to distance itself from Russia's war of choice  against Ukraine, it has, at best, remained neutral in the face of this  violence, demonstrating a woeful abdication of its self-proclaimed role  as a responsible stakeholder. Worse, growing signs indicate China is  aligning itself more closely with Russia.   Just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Putin and  Chairman Xi released a joint statement calling for closer strategic  cooperation. While China has publicly denied any foreknowledge of the  invasion, it discounted and ignored American intelligence showing  Russian buildup around Ukraine. At no point since the invasion began  has China condemned Russia for its invasion nor for its subsequent  human rights atrocities.   The PRC has chosen to employ a disinformation campaign to spread  harmful narratives about Russia's assault on Ukraine. Both within China  and abroad, the PRC is promoting Russian propaganda about the war and  echoing Russian's absurd justifications for the invasion, going so far  as accusing the United States for Russia's one-sided aggression.   President Biden has warned China that there will be consequences if  it decides to materially support Russia's war or helps it skirt U.S.  export controls and sanctions. H.R. 7314 would require the Secretary of  State to report on any efforts made by the PRC to support Russia's  unprovoked, unjust, and illegal invasion of Ukraine.   This bipartisan measure is vital to ensure Congress and the American  people stay informed about how, if at all, China might be supporting  Russia in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I support swift passage of this timely and urgent bill,  I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to China and Russia, I do not trust empty  words; I verify.   H.R. 7314, the AXIS Act, will help Congress and the American people  stay informed about how, if at all, China might be supporting Russia in  its unprovoked, unjust, and illegal invasion of Ukraine.   It is of the utmost importance for this body and the world to  understand whether China is complicit in the gross atrocities and war  crimes being committed against the Ukrainian people. Doing so will  allow us to adjust our strategies and policies as necessary to further  isolate Russia and deepen support for the Ukrainian people.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7372) to amend the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 to  require the President to establish a semiconductor supply chain working  group in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and submit reports  to Congress on potential future disruptions to the supply chain.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7372         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Semiconductor       Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE UKRAINE FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT OF                     2014.         The Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 8921 et       seq.) is amended--        (1) by redesignating section 11 as section 13; and        (2) by inserting after section 10 the following new       sections:       ``SEC. 11. WORKING GROUP ON SEMICONDUCTOR SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this section, the President shall establish       an interagency working group to address semiconductor supply       chain issues caused by the Russia's illegal and unprovoked       attack on Ukraine.        ``(b) Membership.--The interagency working group       established pursuant to subsection (a) shall be comprised of       the head, or designee of the head, of each of the following:        ``(1) The Department of State.        ``(2) The Department of Defense.        ``(3) The Department of Commerce.        ``(4) The Department of the Treasury.        ``(5) The Office of the United States Trade Representative.        ``(6) The Department of Interior.        ``(7) The Department of Energy.        ``(8) The Department of Homeland Security.        ``(9) The Department of Labor.        ``(10) Any other Federal department or agency the President       determines appropriate.        ``(c) Chair.--The Secretary of State shall serve as the       chair of the working group established pursuant to subsection       (a).       ``SEC. 12.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7372.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7372, the Protecting  Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act.   The pandemic has exposed how intricate, how fragile, and how  globalized supply chains are in 2022. Many of the products our families  know and use every day, whether it is our cars, our computers, our  smartphones, or our refrigerators, are the products of complex  components assembled all around the globe. Semiconductors are a prime  example, as they power just about every electronic device in existence.   America is the global leader in semiconductors because our  semiconductor design companies are the global leaders. No country is  capable of making advanced semiconductors without American innovation  and know-how.   But we are also reliant on other nations that are a part of the  semiconductor supply chain. Ukraine and Russia are crucial providers of  important compounds and elements that are necessary for their  production, including palladium, neon gas, helium, and C4F6. Without  these gases, many types of semiconductors cannot be produced. Most  chip-making companies had a little extra supply of these products  before Putin started his immoral, unjustifiable invasion, but these  stores are quickly dwindling.   This bill directs the President to quickly address this problem and  forces the administration to work with our allies and partners to ramp  up production of these key elements and compounds. It also asks the  administration to look ahead to future geopolitical threats and analyze  how we can prepare for potential instability down the road.   I thank Representative Titus for her work on this important bill and  for working in a bipartisan way with Representative Meijer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this valuable  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   H.R. 7372 is important legislation that will take practical steps to  solve supply chain problems that would affect all Americans in a  bipartisan way.   This is exactly the type of work we were elected to do. I applaud the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus) and the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Meijer) for their work on the Protecting Semiconductor Supply  Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 496) to oppose violations of religious freedom in Ukraine by  Russia and armed groups commanded by Russia, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 496         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Religious Freedom       Support Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to never recognize the illegal, attempted annexation of       Crimea by the Government of the Russia or the separation       through the use of military force or recognition of       independence of any portion of Ukrainian territory; and        (2) to consider any alien who, while serving as an official       of the Government of Russia, was responsible for or directly       carried out particularly severe violations of religious       freedom in the sovereign territory of Ukraine that Russia       illegally occupies, controls, or recognizes as independent,       including through non-state armed groups and illegal entities       it commands or otherwise supports or which act on Russia's       behalf, to have committed particularly severe violations of       religious freedom for purposes of applying section       212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1182(a)(2)(G)) with respect to any such alien.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF RUSSIA AS A COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR                     CONCERN FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.         For purposes of making a determination of whether to       designate Russia as a country of particular concern for       religious freedom under section 402 of the International       Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442), the President       shall consider any particularly severe violation of religious       freedom in the territory of Ukraine that Russia illegally       occupies, controls, or recognizes as independent, including       through non-state armed groups and illegal entities it       commands or otherwise supports or which act on Russia's       behalf, during the period of time that is the basis for the       determination and designation, to be a particularly severe       violation of religious freedom that the Government of Russia       has engaged in or tolerated.       [SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 496, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 496, the Ukraine Religious Freedom  Support Act, and thank my committee colleague and friend, the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), for introducing it.   As we speak here in this Chamber, Russian forces are ravaging  Ukrainian cities and towns. They are committing unspeakable atrocities  and war crimes against innocent civilians and continuing to wage an  unprovoked and unjustified war. The world cannot and will not overlook  or forget Russia's heinous acts of aggression, nor the war crimes and  other human rights violations it is committing.   But, sadly, Russia's human rights violations against Ukrainian  civilians and on sovereign Ukrainian territory started well before  February of this year. Ever since Russia illegally attempted to annex  Crimea and backed the separatists in the Donbas region, Russia and  Russian-backed forces, as well as the so-called authorities in those  regions, have demonstrated a complete disregard for human rights,  including the rights of Ukrainians and others to practice their  religions freely.   That is why H.R. 496 is so critically important. We must hold  accountable those Russians and Russian-backed individuals responsible  for committing severe violations of religious freedom on Ukrainian  sovereign territory. Not only must we ensure that it is held  accountable for the daily human rights violations that characterize its  illegal war in Ukraine, but also for those committed long before this  latest invasion.   Given that the U.S. may take actions, including by withdrawing  development assistance, against countries who defy religious freedoms  protected under U.S. Federal law, H.R. 496 directs the President to  include Russia-controlled areas and groups when determining concern for  religious freedoms and funding eligibility for Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I support this important legislation and thank the  gentleman from South Carolina once again for introducing it. I urge all  Members to vote in support, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: This letter is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 496, the ``Ukraine Religious       Freedom Support Act,'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 496, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.  [[Page H4530]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 21, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       496, Ukraine Religious Freedom Support Act, as amended. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 496       to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       also acknowledge that your Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves       forward, and will support the appointment of Committee on the       Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   I thank my friend and colleague from South Carolina. He is a  gentleman and a champion of religious freedoms around the world. This  is an example of what this institution, and we Americans can do  together when we find common ground and set our minds to it in the face  of such aggression and risk around the world.   Putin's flagrant violations of the basic human rights of Ukrainian  civilians on Ukraine's sovereign territory are disturbing, and they are  unacceptable. Freedom of religion is a moral imperative that the United  States must continue to strive to defend as we support the people of  Ukraine through these incredibly trying and horrific times.   This is personal to me. My own family fled Russian persecution during  the pogroms of the late 19th century to come to this extraordinary  country. Little could they have imagined that I would be standing here  with you, my friend from South Carolina, talking about religious  freedoms and doing everything we can as a country to preserve and  protect those all around the world. That is what it means to be an  American, not just here, but all around the world.   We must take action where we can, including by ensuring that the  President considers all regions where Russian influence is determining  future development funding for the Nation. I trust my colleagues will  join me in supporting this terribly important bill to defend these  freedoms all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6930) to authorize the confiscation of assets subject to  United States jurisdiction of certain foreign persons, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6930         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Asset Seizure for Ukraine       Reconstruction Act''.  [[Page H4531]]            SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress as follows:        (1) The President should take all constitutional steps to       seize and confiscate assets under the jurisdiction of the       United States of foreign persons whose wealth is derived in       part through corruption linked to or political support for       the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin and with       respect to which the President has imposed sanctions.        (2) The President, by means of instructions, licenses, or       other regulations as may be promulgated and in a manner       consistent with due process of law, should confiscate any       property or accounts subject to the jurisdiction of the       United States, valued over $2,000,000, and belonging to       Russian energy companies or to foreign persons whose wealth       is derived in part through corruption linked to or political       support for the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin       and with respect to which the President has imposed       sanctions.        (3) All rights, title, and interest in any property so       confiscated should vest, upon the terms directed by the       President, in such agency or person as the President may       designate from time to time, and upon such terms and       conditions as the President may prescribe.        (4) Such interest or property should be held, used,       administered, liquidated, or sold, by such agency or person       and such designated agency or person should perform any and       all acts incident to the accomplishment or furtherance of       these purposes.        (5) The President should use all liquidated funds for the       benefit of the people of Ukraine, including for the       following:        (A) Post-conflict reconstruction in Ukraine.        (B) Humanitarian assistance.        (C) United States government assistance provided to the       security forces of the government of Ukraine.        (D) Provisions to support refugees and refugee resettlement       in neighboring countries and in the United States.        (E) Technology items and services to ensure the free flow       of information to the Ukrainian people in Ukraine, including       items to counter internet censorship by Russian authorities,       to circumvent efforts to shut down internet or communication       services by Russian authorities and bolster the cybersecurity       capabilities of Ukrainian Government or non-governmental       organizations.        (F) Humanitarian and development assistance for the Russian       people, including democracy and human rights programming and       monitoring.       SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.         The President shall establish an interagency working group,       which shall be headed by the Secretary of State, to determine       the constitutional mechanisms through which the President can       take steps to seize and confiscate assets under the       jurisdiction of the United States of foreign persons whose       wealth is derived in part through corruption linked to or       political support for the regime of Russian President       Vladimir Putin and with respect to which the President has       imposed sanctions.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON STEPS AND AUTHORITIES.         Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of State, on behalf of the       interagency working group, shall submit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report about       the steps taken by the interagency working group to       accomplish the steps laid out in section 2, a report that       includes any recommendations to impose additional energy-      related sanctions on the Government of Russia, and a report       on any additional authorities the President needs to take       such steps.       SEC. 5. EXPANSION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF THE                     RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT.         Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the President shall submit to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report, which       may be submitted in classified form if necessary, that       contains a justification for any determination of whether or       not, in addition to the sanctions imposed pursuant to       Executive Order 14024 (86 Fed. Reg. 73; relating to blocking       property with respect to specified 11 harmful foreign       activities of the Government of the Russian Federation),       imposing sanctions on 328 members of the Russian State Duma,       a determination as to whether remaining members of the Duma       and the Russian Federation Council, which includes officials       who may be involved in corrupt and other sanctionable       activities, who voted on February 22, 2022, to recognize the       Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's       Republic (LPR), as well as the Russian Federation Council in       its entirety, should be subject to sanctions under the such       Executive Order.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6930, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6930, the  Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, we have long known the Russian oligarch class is an  important pillar of President Putin's brutal and corrupt regime. These  Russian oligarchs have been able to enrich themselves and use their  wealth to consolidate power within their country and increase their  influence abroad.   As President Putin continues in his unjustified and premeditated  full-scale invasion into Ukraine, the United States must do all that it  can to identify and sanction his cronies bankrolling this brutality.   The Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, as amended, takes  an important step in this direction. The bill expresses the sense of  Congress that the President should confiscate property subject to U.S.  jurisdiction worth over $2 million belonging to Russian energy  companies or Russian oligarchs whose wealth is derived from corruption  or by support of President Putin. It expresses the sense that such  property should be held, used, administered, liquidated, or sold, and  that any funds gained from such sale should be used to benefit the  Ukrainian people.   Furthermore, this legislation would also create an interagency  working group to determine the proper constitutional mechanisms through  which this could be achieved.   The luxury villas and fancy yachts and private airplanes of Putin and  his cronies are tainted with the blood of the Ukrainian people. Their  corrupt assets should be seized and should be used to rebuild Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, as  amended, sends a statement to Vladimir Putin and his cronies that the  U.S. Congress will make sure the United States is not a safe haven for  their corrupt assets.   The legislation makes it clear that the President should take  measures to seize and confiscate their assets subject to U.S.  jurisdiction and use the proceeds from such sales to help the Ukrainian  people, all while protecting and preserving the rights enshrined in our  Constitution.   I thank Representative Malinowski for authoring the bill, and I urge  my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
