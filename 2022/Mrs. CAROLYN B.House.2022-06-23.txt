 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1191, I call up the bill (H.R. 4176) to improve Federal  population surveys by requiring the collection of voluntary, self- disclosed information on sexual orientation and gender identity in  certain surveys, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the bill before  us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data  Inclusion Act. This historic bill takes the long overdue step of  ensuring that Federal agencies collect data on sexual orientation,  gender identity, and variation in sex characteristics so that the  Federal Government can better understand and serve America's LGBTQI+  communities.   We are considering this legislation at a critical time. Across the  United States, the rights of the LGBTQI+ people are under attack and  the health and safety of LGBTQI+ people are under threat. From the  limited data currently available, we understand  [[Page H5857]]  that LGBTQI+ people disproportionately experience poverty, housing  insecurity, adverse physical and mental health outcomes,  discrimination, and more. For example, according to the Williams  Institute, more than one in five LGBTQI+ people live in poverty.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, LGBTQI+ people are  2.5 times more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and substance  abuse than people who are heterosexual.   There is also an epidemic of violence against transgender and gender- nonconforming people across the U.S.--an epidemic that killed more than  50 people last year.   The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act, introduced by my friend and chair of  the Natural Resources Committee, Raul Grijalva, would close many  longstanding gaps in the collection of data pertaining to our Nation's  LGBTQI+ communities. By ensuring that Federal surveys collect data on  sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex  characteristics, this bill will equip Congress and Federal agencies  with the information they need to better understand the specific  challenges faced by the LGBTQI+ communities and help us develop  equitable policy solutions.   This bill currently has 128 cosponsors. The legislation has also  received overwhelming support from more than 200 civil rights, health,  and scientific organizations and the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus.   This bill builds on the Biden administration's efforts to advance  equity for LGBTQI+ populations, including by empowering Federal  agencies to carry out the President's recently announced executive  order to expand collection of Federal data pertaining to LGBTQI+  people.   The Biden administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy  that strongly supports passage of the bill.   Importantly, under this bill answering questions about one's sexual  orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics  would be entirely voluntary, and the bill also includes strong  confidentiality and privacy protections. The design of this bill  strikes a necessary balance between informing policymaking and  protecting the personal information of LGBTQI+ people across the  country.   Before I conclude, let me take a moment to acknowledge the importance  of the House taking this historic step during Pride Month--a  celebration of immeasurable contributions made by LGBTQI+ people in  every aspect of American life and a reminder of our continued mission  to ensure that every community in the United States is treated with  equality and respect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I point out to my good colleague that this year the National  Academies put out a report which found that complete and accurate  demographic information on the LGBTQI+ community should be standardized  and collected. The report showed that only a limited number of Federal  surveys collect data on sexual orientation and gender identity, and  that none collect data on intersex populations.    This bill would greatly improve our data collection efforts. This  would help ensure the Federal Government's programs and services can  reach every person in the U.S. with the greatest effectiveness.   It would help us also to better address longstanding health and  economic inequities for America's LGBTQI+ population. From the limited  research currently available, we understand that LGBTQI+ people  disproportionately experience poverty, housing insecurity, adverse  physical and mental health outcomes, discrimination, and more. So  collecting this data is critically important to ensure that our  policies meet the needs of our LGBTQI+ constituents.   I will give one example of why this is so important. Without the  collection of this data, States were not able to measure the impact of  the pandemic on the LGBTQI+ individuals. They were completely left out  of all medical surveys leaving pandemic response programs at risk of  neglecting these individuals. It moves us to a more inclusive and  equitable society.   Representative Raul Grijalva is the distinguished and outstanding  chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources. He is the author of the  original bill. I was proud to work with him, with the committee members  to bring it to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority  leader.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I respond to his  statements on the citizenship status in saying that it should be  collected with LGBT data.   I want to make it very clear that the citizenship question should not  be part of this bill. Requiring that citizenship questions be included  in this bill is a duplication and totally unnecessary.   The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics already ask  about citizenship status in two different surveys: the American  Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey.   This data is collected in addition to the volumes of citizenship  records collected and maintained by the Department of Homeland  Security.   The Trump administration's efforts to add the citizenship question to  the Census was a fear tactic, intended to discourage specific people  from participating in the Census, and to exclude them from the count.   Requiring citizenship data collection on Federal surveys was, and  always will be, about suppressing data sets and denying U.S. citizens  and residents the representation and resources they need to contribute  to their communities.   Now, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration's stated  reasoning for adding the citizenship question was ``pretextual.''   Unlike the citizenship question, collecting data on sexual  orientation, gender identity, and variations in sex characteristics  will allow individuals to receive the proper care and resources they  need to thrive, while helping to combat the discrimination they face  every day.   Unlike the citizenship question, these questions will be voluntary,  and respondents' privacy will be vigorously protected.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), Chair of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for his extraordinary statement, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the distinguished  chief deputy whip.    MALONEY of New York. I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Texas.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  the balance of my time to close.   I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) for introducing  this important legislation. I am pleased that we were able to bring  this bill before the House during Pride Month to show that we care  about everyone in our country. We think everyone should be counted,  everyone should be surveyed, and everyone's needs should be listened  to.   I particularly thank the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus for their attention  and work on this bill and the Committee on Oversight staff for all the  work required to make this happen.   I am also very grateful to the more than 124 cosponsors, my  colleagues here in this body, and more than 200 civil rights, health,  and scientific organizations that have supported this bill  [[Page H5862]]  and affirm the need for comprehensive Federal data collection on  members of the LGBTQI+ communities.   This bill, H.R. 4176, moves this country one step closer to equality  and gives us the tools to see and support all of our communities, all  of our constituents.   I again urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the  leadership of this body, our Speaker, our majority leader, and our  Caucus chair, all of whom have played a role in supporting this  legislation and moving it to a vote today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of the Jackson Lee amendment.   This amendment would require reporting to Congress on the impact of  data collection on the LGBTQI+ populations, facilitated by this act,  and the provision of services extended to those groups.   As the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, I am committed  to ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of government operations  for all Americans. Reporting on the impacts of H.R. 4176 will provide  transparency into the data collection and help inform our policymaking  efforts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, Representative  Sean Patrick Maloney has an amendment at the desk, and I am his  designee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Today, I rise in support of this amendment that clarifies the Federal  surveys governed by this bill can and should collect data on deceased  LGBTQ individuals when applicable.   As we know, due to mistreatment and being stigmatized, LGBTQ+ youth  are over four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.   In recent years, the number of violent fatal attacks against  transgender people have hit record highs. But importantly, the actual  number of fatal attacks is widely believed to be undercounted. Allowing  a proxy of a deceased person to respond to a Federal survey can right  this wrong.   Federal surveys often do not collect key demographic information on  those they study, such as the gender identity or sexual orientation of  a deceased person. As a result, we as policymakers do not have the full  picture and cannot accurately identify disparities or create policy  solutions that serve each person we represent.   For example, the Justice Department's National Crime Victimization  Survey only asks questions about the victim's sexual orientation but  not about their gender identity.   This potentially severe undercount of targeted violence against the  transgender community has left us making policies with one hand tied  behind our backs.   This amendment ensures that researchers and policymakers can  understand the experiences of deceased LGBTQ individuals and make more  informed decisions as we fight for equality and justice under the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I urge support of  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise as  designee for Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's amendment made in order by  the rule.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, this  straightforward amendment requires the agencies collecting information  through this bill to create standards and protocols for anonymizing and  destroying personally identifiable information at the appropriate time.   This amendment is a strong addition to the underlying bill, as it  ensures that the necessary demographic information collected will be  responsibly destroyed to fully protect an individual's privacy.   Complete and accurate data collection is essential to informing  policies, laws, and programs that address the needs of our communities.   Individuals who identify as LGBTQI+ have been underrepresented in  Federal data collection efforts for generations. This critical  information has been missing from this community in all areas of data  collection and has led to worsened outcomes compared to individuals who  are fully counted in Federal data collection.   I am proud to support this commonsense pro-privacy amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I urge support of  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
