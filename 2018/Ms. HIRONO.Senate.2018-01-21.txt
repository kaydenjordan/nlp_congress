 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when Donald Trump was a private citizen  during the last government shutdown, he said:         Problems start from the top, and they have to get solved       from the top, and the President's the leader, and he's got to       get everybody in a room, and he's got to lead.    That is what Donald Trump said when he was Citizen Trump. He is now  the President. Now that he is the President, he has those shoes to  wear. He refuses to step into them and step up. The only person who  actually said that maybe we need a good shutdown is President Trump.  Although I have to say that, recently, Office of Management and Budget  Director Mick Mulvaney also said it was ``cool'' to shut down the  government--unbelievable. It is definitely not cool. This attitude may  explain why the President keeps shooting down bipartisan efforts to  prevent a shutdown.   Republicans control the House and the Senate. I don't know why we  have to keep reminding Republicans that they control the House and the  Senate. There is no reason for the majority leader and the Speaker to  enable this Trump shutdown to continue. There is no reason to wait on  the President to tell them to do whatever or to tell them what he  believes, because Donald Trump is a changeling. He is incapable of  being consistent. I witnessed this 2 weeks ago when I went to the White  House with a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to find a path  forward to protect the Dreamers. During the meeting, in front of all of  us and on national TV for over 50 minutes, Donald Trump promised to  sign whatever bipartisan compromise that Congress came up with. He said  he would take the heat. We had barely driven back to the Capitol before  he went back on that promise. This pattern repeated on Friday, when the  Democratic leader discussed a broad, bipartisan compromise with the  President to keep the government open, and after appearing to agree on  a framework, the President, shortly thereafter, said no.   Once again, this is Donald Trump's shutdown. It is important to  understand who is responsible for this shutdown. He himself said it is  the President who is supposed to be bringing everybody together. But,  frankly, it is more important to end the shutdown. It is time for  Congress to lead.   Congress is a separate branch of government, and we should start  acting like it. We can come to a broad, bipartisan agreement on nearly  every part of a deal to end this shutdown. We can reauthorize the  Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health insurance to  9 million children all across the country. We can fund community health  centers, which provide healthcare for hundreds of millions of people in  our communities. We can protect the Dreamers. We can fully  [[Page S411]]  fund the Department of Defense and provide funding parity for critical  domestic programs. Congress shouldn't wait around for the President to  make up his mind. Let's do our jobs.   I support passing a very short-term funding bill, somewhere in  between 1 and 3 days, which we have proposed, to sustain the urgency in  getting this done in as short a time as possible. So a multiweek  extension of government funding that allows the President, the majority  leader, and the Speaker to kick the can down the road and pit one group  against another is not the way to go.   The Republicans continue to pit the Children's Health Insurance  Program against Dreamers, and they pit funding for troops against  Dreamers, pitting one group after another on and on. Are the  Republicans saying that we can only take care of one group or the  other? Do we cut off the right arm or the left arm? We have seen this  ``pitting one group against another'' strategy at work all week.   Authorization for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired on  September 30, months ago, but the majority leader waited until now to  put it up for a vote because he hoped to use it as leverage to divide  Democrats and leave Dreamers out in the cold, pitting one group against  another. Just as a reminder, guess who spent months and months trying  to take away healthcare from millions of Americans and more months to  provide the richest 1 percent of people and corporations in our country  with huge tax cuts, all behind closed doors? The Republicans--that is  who. We could have and should have funded the Children's Health  Insurance Program months ago. We could have come to a compromise on  Dreamers months ago.   The majority leader has come to the floor repeatedly to argue that  there is no urgency to protect the Dreamers or the DACA participants,  that we have months to find a solution. Doesn't he know that more than  16,000 people have lost their DACA protections since Donald Trump  cruelly and cynically ended the program in September, and every single  day, 122 DACA recipients lose their status. These young lives are on  hold. They are scared, and they are afraid of being kicked out of the  only country they know and love, and that is the United States of  America.   Over the past few days, we have heard the President and the majority  leader continuously disrespecting these inspiring young people by  referring to them as illegals. That is how you take away an  individual's humanity, by categorizing them as one group or another--as  illegals. I have met many of these DACA recipients. They are not  illegals. They are legally protected under the DACA Program to be in  the United States. They want to make a contribution to the only country  they know, America.   It is Dreamers like Leonardo, from Oregon, who came to my office in  late December, shared his immigrant story and why he is fighting to be  able to stay in the United States. Leonardo came to our country with  his siblings and his mom, who was fleeing an abusive marriage. Growing  up, Leonardo hardly saw his mom, who took public transportation to work  the night shift and slept most of the day. He told me that, as he has  gotten older and as he has had to work so hard to make ends meet, he  truly appreciates the sacrifices his mom made to ensure that he had  food and clothes. Like many young high school students, Leonardo  dreamed of going to college. Because he was ineligible for financial  aid as an undocumented student, he saw athletics as a path to pursue  his dreams. Leonardo got a scholarship offer from a small school, but  at precisely the moment he thought his dreams came true, he learned the  school was unable to fulfill its promise because Leonardo was  undocumented. Put yourself in his shoes. His heart was broken.  Leonardo's life changed when he was able to sign up for DACA. He  enrolled in community college to study chemistry and hopes to become a  pharmacist one day. Leonardo told me that DACA didn't just allow him to  access a better quality of life. He said it changed how he values  himself as an individual and as a person, that he was more than his  status--that he was a human being, not an illegal. When I asked him why  he came all this way to share his story, he said:         What we're doing here really encompasses what it means to       be an American. The idea that we have to fight for justice.       That we have to fight for dignity. That equality surpasses       any status. That our humanity surpasses any status.    Thank you, Leonardo. I agree.   This is a pivotal moment for Congress. Are we going to continue to  bend to the whims of a unpredictable, mercurial, and unreliable  President, or will we come together on a bipartisan basis, behave like  the separate branch of government that we are, and reauthorize the  Children's Health Insurance Program, fund community health centers,  protect Dreamers, and provide parity for defense and domestic programs  in a long-term budget deal?   I respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. What I don't  respect is holding up this process, knowing full well that we can come  up with a bipartisan way in 3 or 2 days, or even 1 day to end this  shutdown.   I yield the floor.
