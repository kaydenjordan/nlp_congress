 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Equality  Act.   In the fight for LGBTQ-plus equality, we have made significant  progress. From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, there is no doubt we  have come a long way, but the unfortunate truth is that in far too many  places discrimination is still permitted under the law. In public  facilities, in education institutions, when applying for jobs, when  trying to rent or buy a home, discrimination is still permitted under  the law.   Many States right now are actively trying to turn back progress or  write discriminatory practices into their own laws, especially against  our transgender citizens. We can and must do better.   In Arizona, in any place in America, everyone deserves equal  treatment under the law, no matter who they are, who they love, or how  they express themselves.   I fervently support the Equality Act because we are a Nation that  believes all are created equal and that this truth is self-evident.  Everyone deserves to be seen, to feel heard, to be welcomed and  protected.
