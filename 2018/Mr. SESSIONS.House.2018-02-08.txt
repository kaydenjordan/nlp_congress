 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 734 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 734         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1892) to amend title 4, United States Code, to provide for       the flying of the flag at half-staff in the event of the       death of a first responder in the line of duty, with the       Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate       amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without       intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that       the House concur in the Senate amendment to the House       amendment to the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and       the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1  hour.    Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the  Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, this 2-year budget agreement begins to repair our  military and frees our armed services from the harmful spending caps  and the devastating practice of funding our troops with stopgap  spending bills. It raises defense discretionary spending levels in  fiscal year 2018 by $80 billion and nondefense levels by $63 billion,  while raising fiscal year 2019 levels by $85 billion and $63 billion  respectively.   I have been told that this will move spending levels from 2009  spending levels to 2011 spending levels, consistent with what we had  done during those periods of time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the distinguished gentlewoman for her help  to make sure that the Rules Committee effectively and carefully got  their work done this evening, and I want to thank the gentlewoman. I do  know it is 3:30 in the morning, and the entire committee, the entire  Rules Committee, was prepared on both sides, and I thank the  gentlewoman and the staffs that were included.   Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress who are elected by their respective  districts come to Washington to represent their districts. But perhaps,  I think, more importantly, some bit of those people also take into  account, not just the representation of their district, but the pride  and authorship they have in particular about America, about being a  part of America and us standing together.   Tonight, we are going to have a chance to say back to one of our  Members who has come to Washington, D.C., representing her home of  Puerto Rico, home territory of Puerto Rico, and to say back to her that  this body offered its condolences for the storms that happened last  year.   She stood up, representing Puerto Rico. She is a former Speaker of  the House of Puerto Rico. She stands with the people of Puerto Rico.  She has come and visited Member after Member after Member to sell to  them, not only the attributes of how to fix Puerto Rico, but came and  did the things legislatively.   With great, great admiration, I will tell you that our next speaker,  who is a member of the Republican majority, has really done an  outstanding job as a brand new Member of this body; and I am pleased  that we can say tonight, included in this package is that disaster  package that the House passed last, I think, October.   She has worked hard. She has had faith and confidence, not only in  her home territory of Puerto Rico, but in her body here, the United  States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it is with extreme pride that I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), the former Speaker  of the House of Puerto Rico.    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman  for allowing me to support this rule that will have, finally, this bill  to be considered on this floor.   I think it is important to acknowledge that still, 5 months after the  storm, after Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma hit Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands, 30 percent of Puerto  [[Page H997]]  Ricans are still without power. That is something that you will never  expect in a U.S. territory or neither a State.   So that is one of the biggest reasons I stood here, at 3:30 in the  morning. Why? Because it is time to show our deeds in terms of  supporting a bill that will have the money to restore the power grid in  Puerto Rico, to help the island to recover from the last hurricanes.   Also, we were facing a medical cliff in April of this year--a medical  cliff that will put an end to the insurance to 680,000 patients in the  island. That is the reason this bill is so important for Puerto Rico.   Actually, we have been waiting for 2 months. This bill has been  stalled in the Senate, and I actually am very happy to see that  agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate voted 71-28  to have this bill here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I need to say that today Congress will make a critical  vote in terms of that we finally have a budget deal, and this is the  time to vote, not for ideologies, but for the people, for American  citizens all over the States. For the States and territories that were  struck by disaster during the last year, this bill will provide  billions of dollars, including improvement to Puerto Rico's electrical  power network.   It also takes the steps to secure the island's Medicaid program and  ensure that our people do not lose their health coverage. For the past  year, I have been fighting to ensure Puerto Rico receives the money  necessary to avoid that medical cliff now in April. This funding will  give Puerto Rico and Congress the time to craft a long-term solution,  not just for Puerto Rico, but for all U.S. territories, and help out  the medical problems that we all face.   I want to thank, especially, the Speaker of the House, Speaker Ryan,  the members of this leadership who have been supporting me all of the  way; the chairmen, Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, Chairman  Sessions, Chairman Frelinghuysen; and all members of this House  leadership who have been working with me, visiting the island, even  Members from the other side of the aisle, supporting Puerto Rico.   You know what? That is the hard work that we need to do for our  people.   On the Senate side, I need to thank our special friend and advocate,  Senator Marco Rubio, who has been supporting this issue since day one.   I also want to thank all Members of both Chambers willing to save  Puerto Rico from near collapse and to help their fellow citizens in the  island.   I urge my Democratic colleagues, if we want to help Puerto Rico, now  is the time to do it. It is not just talking, it is time to act. It is  time to vote for this kind of bill. We can't be hostage of another  bill, and I do support having an immigration bill happen.   This is a disaster bill that has been included. It has been included  in this budget, and we must take action today. That is the reason; this  is the time to show it, not by words, by acts. That is the reason I ask  my colleagues to vote for this, not say just we want to help Puerto  Rico. This is the time to show you really want to help Puerto Rico; you  really want to help the island.   I understand that, as the Senate did a few minutes ago, we can come  together and support what we are willing to do. In Puerto Rico, there  are still a lot of things that need to be done. There are so many needs  to be met. But let's continue to work together, as the Senate did  today; and I hope, and I expect, the House can do the same thing.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), a member of the Republican leadership team.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), a member of the Republican leadership team.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of  Administration Policy, which is referred to as a SAP. It comes from the  Executive Office of the President.   Mr. Speaker, if I could read the last paragraph: ``If the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form,  his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law.''                     Statement of Administration Policy     Senate Amendment to H.R. 1892--Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018--(Sen.                              McConnell, R-KY)         The Administration supports Senate passage of the       substitute amendment to H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act       of 2018. This amendment raises the defense spending caps for       fiscal year (FY) 2018 and FY 2019, a key step toward       fulfilling the President's promise to rebuild America's       military and ensure funding would be provided to support the       enacted National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2018 (NDAA).        After years of dangerous spending reductions and an       unpredictable budgetary environment perpetuated by numerous       continuing resolutions, the Bipartisan Budget Act lays the       groundwork for full funding of America's national defense,       within the framework of the Administration's National       Security and Defense Strategies and the NDAA. Passage of this       legislation would ensure America is prepared to deter and, if       necessary, defeat the full spectrum of threats from rival       powers, rogue states, and terrorist organizations like the       Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.        The Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for higher       investments in several Administration priorities, including       infrastructure and combating the opioid epidemic, and the       Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to       reflect the Administration's detailed funding priorities for       the remainder of FY 2018 and for FY 2019 for both defense and       non-defense needs.        At the same time, it is critical that the Congress work to       decrease non-defense spending in other areas to reduce       America's growing national debt. The Bipartisan Budget Act       provides non-defense discretionary spending levels higher       than the Administration deems necessary. Additionally,       although the Bipartisan Budget Act does include some spending       reductions, the Administration has proposed hundreds of       billions of dollars in additional spending reductions that       the Congress should also enact without delay in order to       improve our fiscal state.        Further, the Administration recognizes the Congress's       desire to provide significant funding for victims of the       recent hurricanes and wildfires, as provided in the       Bipartisan Budget Act and previously in the House-passed       supplemental bill (H.R. 4667). The Administration looks       forward to working with the Congress to ensure that adequate       oversight is exercised over disaster-related funds to ensure       that these funds reach the communities devastated by natural       disasters and are not misapplied.        The Administration supports other components of the       Bipartisan Budget Act, including greater certainty for the       Children's Health Insurance Program, an extension of funding       for Community Health Centers, and repeal of Obamacare's       Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The IPAB authority       allows an unelected, unaccountable board to undertake major       changes to the Medicare program. The repeal of IPAB furthers       the President's goal of repealing and replacing Obamacare.  [[Page H999]]         The Administration also supports suspending the debt limit       until March 2019 to provide the certainty to markets around       the world that the United States will honor its obligations.        Furthermore, the Administration is concerned with future       extensions of special interest tax deductions and benefits in       the wake of tax cuts and reforms that were enacted in       December 2017.        The President's top priority is to keep the Nation safe       from those who wish to harm it, both at home and abroad. To       do so, the United States military needs the resources       provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which have previously       been supported on a bipartisan basis in the NDAA and in       multiple bills passed by the House.        If the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the       President in its current form, his advisors would recommend       that he sign it into law.     There should be no question about that, that the  President of the United States is asking not only Members of Congress  but the American people to understand how important it is to make sure  that this government is up and running, to make sure that our military  is funded, and that the men and women who protect this great Nation,  those volunteers to our military, deserve a right to have us fully fund  our military for the rest of the year.   I know and the Chair knows, Mr. Speaker, that this deal is only until  March 23. But we should not ever allow our military to be put in harm's  way. They are the ones who protect us, and for us putting them in  harm's way without the money to protect them I think is bad timing and  a bad way for us to extend our support to the military.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today, at 10 minutes to 4 o'clock Eastern  time, that we can say we are going to move forward with this bill that  fully funds the military for the rest of the year. I will ask our  Members at the very end, accordingly, to please support this underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this past year, 80 members of our armed  services lost their lives in training and noncombat-related fatalities.  We are going to attempt tonight, not wait, to pass a bill which will  offer funding for our military.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentlewoman I will be  closing as soon as she does.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend and colleague, the  ranking member of the Rules Committee; and the entire Rules Committee,  Republicans and Democrats; and our staffs for their work late tonight  and well into the morning.   Mr. Speaker, there was a question about the President of the United  States and his advice that he has provided to this body. The President  of the United States has indicated through a Statement of  Administration Policy that there would be an expectation the President  would sign this bill.   What does this mean?   This means that, as quickly as we can accomplish this rule, the  underlying legislation, and the vote, perhaps as early as 7 o'clock  this morning or earlier, the President of the United States may sign  that; meaning that the American people could wake up today with  confidence that the United States Senate and the United States House of  Representatives has averted a further problem through the leadership of  making sure that we move forward to fund the government.   Make no mistake about it: there will be people who vote ``yes'' and  people who vote ``no,'' and that is up to them. But, Mr. Speaker,  tonight I would ask every Member of this body for that ``aye'' vote to  do the right thing to fund the government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:      An Amendment to H. Res. 734 Offered by Ms. Slaughter of New York         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote  [[Page H1001]]       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
