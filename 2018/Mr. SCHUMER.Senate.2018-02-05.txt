 Mr. President, first, it is always a pleasure to hear  from my friend, the Senator from Utah, when I agree with him and even  when I don't.

Mr. President, first, it is always a pleasure to hear  from my friend, the Senator from Utah, when I agree with him and even  when I don't.    It is serious stuff.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we must pass another extension of  government funding by this Thursday. There isn't much time to waste,  and yet Speaker Ryan is again considering a CRomnibus--a short-term  extension of funding for urgent domestic priorities but a long-term  extension and a large increase in funding for defense--to placate the  ultraconservatives in his caucus.   Of course, a CRomnibus is merely a ruse designed to slash funding for  education, healthcare, infrastructure, and scientific research--all the  things that many in the Freedom Caucus don't want the government to  support. That is why 44 Senate Democrats warned our Republican  colleagues in a letter last year that we wouldn't support a CRomnibus  and that it could never pass the Senate.   We want to fund defense, absolutely, but we also want to fund  programs that help the middle class, like education, like  infrastructure, like scientific research. We are standing up and saying  we must do both. That is how this body works. Different people have  different views, and we compromise. Maybe there are some on my side who  don't want to spend as much on defense as the Republican side does, but  it is a compromise. I, for one, appreciate that we need robust defense  spending.   Sending a CRomnibus to the Senate--one that just funded defense and  cut programs crucial to the middle class--would be barreling head-first  into a dead end. Speaker Ryan needs to do what is best for the country  and work in a bipartisan way to fund the government, even if not every  faction of his caucus will go along. If he lets the Freedom Caucus be  the tail that wags the dog, there is no way we will reach an agreement  that can pass the Senate, and it would jeopardize the positive  discussions going on right now about the budget, disaster aid,  immigration, and more.                            ____________________     Now, for a word on the Republican tax bill, even as  corporations plow tens of billions of dollars into share-buybacks and  stock-repurchasing programs, instead of raising wages or hiring more  workers, President Trump and congressional Republicans are doing their  best to portray their $1.5 trillion corporate giveaway as a boost to  working Americans.   I am sure that President Trump's address in Ohio today will focus on  the few companies that have given bonuses, but I wonder how many of  those bonuses delivered around Christmas were annual and would have  been given anyway. I wonder how many of those bonuses were linked to  the tax bill in corporate press releases to curry favor with the  President, even though they would have been given anyway.   I bet President Trump will not mention a thing about the slew of  layoffs and stock buybacks in the wake of the bill. I bet he will not  dare mention that 80 percent of the benefits of this bill went to the  top 1 percent and that the middle class should have gotten a lot more  than they are getting. We all know that corporations have spent  billions enriching their shareholders,  [[Page S597]]  while the middle class is waiting for the trickle-down effects that may  never come.   Imagine if all the money that went into tax breaks for corporations  and the superrich went to the middle class instead. If that were the  case, then President Trump would actually have something to boast about  in Ohio today.   This weekend Speaker Ryan showed just how far Republicans will strain  credulity to claim their tax bill helps working Americans. He tweeted:  ``A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said  she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week . . . she  said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.''   Someone must have told him how out of touch that was because Speaker  Ryan soon deleted the tweet. As high school secretaries get $1.50 a  week in savings, the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans are getting an  average of about $3,000 a week--high school secretary, $1.50; top 0.1  percent, $3,000 a week. Because of the tax bill, the Lancaster  secretary may well be able to afford a membership to a big-box store,  but the top 0.1 percent can now afford a new Bentley. Is that fair? Is  that right? Is that what the American people wanted? No way. No way.    All the propaganda and millions of dollars of ads from the Koch  brothers and all these other rich people--the handful of rich people  who have so much say on the Republican side--all the ads they will pay  for will not make up for that fact, and the American people see it.   The fundamental unfairness at the center of the Republican tax bill  is this. Corporations and the superrich are having a bonanza while  American workers are left with paltry savings. Considering the  Republicans spent $1.5 trillion in Federal resources to pass their tax  bill, the middle class should have gotten a whole lot more--a lot more  than $1.50 a week.   When President Trump takes the stump in Ohio, we can expect to hear a  lot of talk about how his tax bill is helping American workers, but  every American should know that the reality is different.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Friday, the Trump administration  declassified and released the contents of the deceptive Nunes memo. It  is the latest distraction concocted by Republicans to protect the  President of their party from the conclusions of a truly independent  investigation. Shamefully, it is the latest abuse in a long line of  partisan broadsides against the FBI, the Nation's premier law  enforcement agency. These attacks erode faith in the rule of law.   At least the American people can now see the Nunes memo for what it  truly is: an impotent document of GOP talking points. Far from being  the smoking gun that many Republicans, rightwing media outlets, and  Russia-linked bots claimed it would be, the Nunes memo just blows  smoke. It is full of misleading conclusions based on innuendo.   What it does confirm does not vindicate the President or prove bias  at the Department of Justice. It confirms that the Steele dossier was  not the catalyst for the Russia investigation, debunking a favorite  rightwing talking point. Let that sink in. The FBI was concerned about  Trump campaign advisers linked to Putin's spy services before--let me  repeat, before--the Steele dossier existed. This idea that the Steele  dossier created all this is just plain wrong, and even their own memo  admits it.   The Nunes memo also confirms that a three-judge panel, on multiple  occasions, thought it was in the best interest of our national security  to monitor a Trump campaign adviser for his troubling links with the  Kremlin.   Seeing as House Republicans saw fit to release the contents of their  partisan memo, they should certainly support the release of the memo  prepared by Ranking Member Schiff. If House Republicans had any  semblance of fairness, they would vote to release the Schiff memo. It  is based on the same underlying documents. If it was all right to  release the Republican memo on these documents, it should be all right  to release a Democratic memo based on the same documents.   Meanwhile, President Trump still refuses to implement the sanctions  that passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress. I have  to say, if President Trump and his allies spent half the time standing  up to Putin as they do attacking our own FBI, we might actually get  somewhere with Putin. But the administration seems to fear doing  anything to upset him. The American people ask: Why? Why is Donald  Trump so afraid to upset Mr. Putin?   What are they so afraid of? It is inexplicable to me that the  President of the United States and his allies are far more concerned  with attacking American law enforcement agencies than standing up to  Russia. President Putin interfered with our sacred democratic process.  The very process we exalt--correctly so--in our schools and teach our  children is so wonderful, Putin is trying to make a sham of. He is  trying to interfere with it. We hardly hear a peep out of President  Trump and so many Republicans on this side of the aisle who used to go  after Putin, to their credit, regularly.   We have an investigation into the matter of Putin's engagement in our  elections by one of the most trusted and nonpartisan civil servants in  Washington, but because that investigation might include some  wrongdoing by the President or his close associates, too many  Republicans in Congress and, of course, the conservative media have  turned on the FBI rather than on Putin.   It is far more than disquieting. It is the worst place that partisan  politics can go. The vital interests of our Nation are being subverted  to the benefit of a foreign hostile power. A Congressman says that we  are witnessing a ``coup'' on the House floor. A Senator floats the  possibility of ``secret societies.'' The Speaker of the House suggests  a ``cleanse'' of the FBI.   For partisan reasons, the President and his allies in Congress are  systematically trying to weaken America's faith in the rule of law, and  to a large extent, sadly, the leaders of the Republican Party have been  silent.   A few notable exceptions, including my dear friend Senator John  McCain, are speaking out about the real threat here--not the FBI, not  our career law enforcement officials, not Special Counsel Mueller but  President Putin and his war on democratic societies and democracy in  general.   We desperately need more of our Republican friends to stand up and  speak out, particularly the Republican leadership, because their  silence is rapidly becoming complicit in the denigration of our  Republic--something that is happening, unfortunately, before our very  eyes.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
