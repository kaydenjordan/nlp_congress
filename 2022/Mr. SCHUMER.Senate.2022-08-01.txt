 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate gavels in for what will be a  [[Page S3795]]  very consequential week for this Chamber and for our country.   Later today, we will vote on the nomination of Elizabeth Hanes to  serve as district judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. If  confirmed, she will be the 75th judge this Senate majority has  confirmed since the start of President Biden's term.   In the coming days, the Senate will also finish its work passing the  PACT Act, the largest expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in  decades and a piece of legislation that should sail through this  Chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Over the past few days, the Capitol steps have been the site of  something we should never see in this country: dozens of veterans  braving heat and heavy rain, protesting through the night, demanding  that the Senate take action on their healthcare benefits. They are  there right now as we speak. No veteran who has sacrificed for our  country should ever have to resort to spending the night on the Capitol  steps to secure their benefits, but sadly, in this case, they have.   It is unfortunate that our Republican colleagues chose to block quick  passage of this bill last week even though this is the exact same piece  of legislation many of them supported in June, with one small technical  fix. In the coming days, we are going to give Senate Republicans  another chance to do the right thing, to work with us so we can send  this bill to the President's desk ASAP.   Since 9/11, nearly 3\1/2\ million veterans have been exposed to toxic  burn pits in the line of duty, leading to complications like cancer,  lung disease, and other illnesses, but instead of getting the care they  need without delay, many veterans have had to hire lawyers and jump  through hoops. They have to sue the Veterans' Administration to get the  help they deserve and need, incurred as they served our country in  dangerous places like Iraq and Vietnam. Is that incredible? They have  wasted years fighting the VA just to get the care they need when they  should have spent that time treating their illnesses. It is equally  parts tragic and infuriating.   Our veterans have already given their all to defend our Nation from  threats abroad. They shouldn't have to fight a second war here at home  just to get the healthcare benefits they rightfully deserve. These  brave Americans sacrificed everything. They risked life and limb. The  very least we can do as a country is ensure they receive top care.   I urge both sides to work together to quickly pass the PACT act so we  can send it to the President's desk ASAP.                       Inflation Reduction Act of 2022    Now on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, this week, the Senate  will take action on a groundbreaking piece of legislation, one that we  haven't seen in decades: the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   Over the coming days, both sides will continue conversations with the  Parliamentarian in order to move forward the bipartisan Byrd bath  process. Our timeline has not changed, and I expect to bring this  legislation to the Senate floor and to begin voting this week.   Already, leading experts have confirmed the Inflation Reduction Act  lives up to its name.   The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--by no means a liberal  group--affirmed that ``almost every one of [this bill's] policies, in  and of itself, will fight inflation. And on net, the entire package  most certainly will.'' That is the Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, whom our Republican friends often quote.   Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers--recently the Republican  leader's favored economist--said, ``This bill is fighting inflation''  and that ``this is disinflationary policy that's also going to make the  economy more efficient.''   Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's--again, hardly a liberal  authority, someone who actually served as an economic adviser to  Senator McCain--writes that our bill will have a ``material economic  impact'' and said that the Inflation Reduction Act will ``push  inflation lower.'' That is Mark Zandi.   In short, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to be just what the  doctor ordered for bringing down costs for American families. We are  excited and eager to pass this bill through the Senate as soon as we  can.   Of course, of huge significance--this is one of the things that make  this bill so historic--by a significant margin, our bill will also be  the largest package on climate change ever--ever--passed by this  Congress.   By our analysis, this bill will cut greenhouse gas emissions by  approximately 40 percent by 2030--that is a lot--and independent  studies corroborate this.   According to a new study by the nonpartisan Energy Innovation group,  the Inflation Reduction Act would not only create at least 1.5 million  new jobs by 2030, it also affirms that our bill will achieve  approximately 40 percent greenhouse gas reduction by the end of the  decade.   Let me repeat that last part. This independent analysis says that our  bill, if enacted, could cut greenhouse gasses by approximately 40  percent. That is the number we believe it does. That is a very, very,  very big deal.   But with this bill, we are going to put the country on track to meet  the climate goals we need to preserve for our planet, for our children,  and for our grandchildren.   Now, cutting emissions is not just about protecting our planet's  health; it is also about protecting our kids' health, too.   If we slash emissions, that means cleaner air for everyone, which in  turn means fewer people suffer health complications that arise from  pollution. It means less strain on our healthcare system. It means that  communities--poorer communities, minority communities--long exposed to  harmful emissions can, quite literally, breathe easy at last.   In fact, the same study from Energy Innovation found that our bill  could avoid as many as 3,900 premature deaths and 100,000 asthma  attacks annually by 2030--3,900 fewer premature deaths, 100,000 fewer  asthma attacks. These are benchmarks every single one of us should  aspire to, regardless of party. Put simply, this legislation will save  lives, create jobs, reduce costs, reduce inflation.   Now, over the past few days, we have heard Republicans go back to  their timeworn attacks that they use virtually against any Democratic  policy. They are sounding alarms that this bill will raise taxes on  American families, but it does not. Here is the plain truth: The bill  will not raise any taxes--any taxes--on families making under $400,000  a year. Instead, it will close loopholes long exploited by the largest  corporations that essentially give them lower tax rates than many  nurses, firefighters, teachers. You won't hear Republicans admit that.  Why? Because they know that their tax policies are utterly toxic in the  minds of American people.   When you increase taxes on the wealthiest and corporations who pay  nothing, they say: You are raising taxes on everybody.  Bull. They  tried it in 2017. They went out there and said they had a massive tax  reduction for the middle class. They called it a ``middle class  miracle,'' even though they were just cutting taxes predominantly on  the rich. I think it was like 70, 80 percent. It was a boondoggle in  favor of the rich.   They promised their tax bill would unleash a tsunami of economic  activity. Instead, it led to record corporate stock buybacks,  benefiting the wealthy and nobody else.   So when Republicans talk about cutting taxes, what they really mean  is cutting taxes for the richest of the rich. That is how their whole  philosophy is. That is the people who seem to control lots of the  Republican party.   Our bill, meanwhile, will close tax loopholes in our Tax Code and not  touch anyone--anyone--making under $400,000 a year. That is common  sense.   At the end of the day, the American people want us to do a few  straightforward things. They want us to lower the cost of daily  expenses like healthcare and drugs. They want us to lower energy costs  and protect our planet for future generations. And they want to make  sure that everyone plays by the same rules and that we close loopholes  long exploited by powerful corporations.   That is what the Inflation Reduction Act will do, and soon, Democrats  will take action to pass this bill and deliver on our promise to make  better the lives of the American people.
