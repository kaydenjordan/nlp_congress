 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Major General John F. King from the Georgia National  Guard.   Major General King has been a member of the Georgia National Guard  for over 30 years. During his time with the guard, he has served abroad  in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan.   While in Afghanistan, he served as the military adviser to the Deputy  Minister of Interior for Security for Afghanistan who oversaw an agency  of over 96,000 police officers.   Major General King has won many awards for military and public  services, including the Bronze Star Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge,  the Meritorious Service Medal, and a NATO award for his service in both  Bosnia and Afghanistan, among many others.   For his entire career, Major General King has put his country and his  State before himself. He is a true example of what it means to be a  public servant.   I hope that he enjoys his retirement from the Georgia National Guard,  and I look forward to seeing the great things he does as Georgia's  insurance commissioner.                    Recognizing Marshes of Glynn Libraries     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marshes  of  [[Page H885]]  Glynn Libraries for being recognized as the Georgia Public Library of  the Year.   The single-county library system serves a population of 85,000 in  Glynn County, Georgia, through two branches: The Brunswick-Glynn County  Library and the St. Simons Island Public Library.   This honor was given for the library's efforts to strengthen  community partnerships, diversify its funding portfolio, and expand  services to meet the informational, educational, cultural, and  recreational needs of Glynn County residents.   Marshes of Glynn Libraries received nomination letters from local  partners, business leaders, and patrons who each highlighted the impact  the library has made in the community.   One of the library's many initiatives includes the Take 5 program,  which is helping reestablish early literacy outreach following the  impacts of COVID-19 on family engagement with schools and public  libraries.   I congratulate and thank everyone at Marshes of Glynn Libraries for  their incredible work to provide such a vital resource for our  community.                            Operation Ghost Busted     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  hard work of law enforcement officials who participated in Operation  Ghost Busted.   Law enforcement officials planned for more than 2 years to bust the  drug trafficking network. This multidepartment operation led to the  indictment of 76 individuals who planned to move a large amount of  illegal drugs into south Georgia.   The criminals planned to distribute methamphetamine, fentanyl,  heroin, and alprazolam. Law enforcement officials also seized 43  firearms and over $53,000 in cash.   As we all know, the fentanyl crisis is devastating communities all  across our country. Now more than ever, it is important for our law  enforcement to get these dangerous narcotics off of our streets.   Luckily, because of the hard work of our law enforcement officials,  south Georgians can sleep well at night. Thank you again to the work of  all law enforcement personnel involved.                            ____________________
