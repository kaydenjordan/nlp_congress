 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we had joint jurisdiction over this legislation, and,  for the most part, this is a good product.   I was actually the ranking member on the Water Resources and  Environment Subcommittee 16 years ago when the initial brownfields  legislation passed and later became law. We expected that the targeted  reforms and Federal grant funds in the initial law would spur  redevelopment of blighted areas and be of great benefit, and we were  right. It has a proven record of success, assisting States and  communities in redevelopment of abandoned or underutilized properties,  leveraging Federal seed money with State, local, and private dollars,  and creating jobs.    Now, here is an example.   In 2013, the city of Eugene, Oregon, got a $680,000 brownfield site  assessment grant to improve the environment and spur economic  development. The city used this funding for the assessment of 15  specific properties and for the development of a local redevelopment  plan.   One of the results of this work is that the Ninkasi Brewery--as co- chair of the House Craft Brewers Caucus, I had to bring beer into the  discussion--now sits on the site of a former Eugene brownfield. In a  decade, they have 100 employees, and it is sold right here in  Washington, D.C., today.   This year, Eugene was selected for an additional $500,000 in  brownfield site assessments. I am hoping that they can replicate the  success they had with their earlier grant from the Federal Government.   I am pleased that we are considering this bill to extend the program  through 2022. It will increase the funding limit from $200 to $500 per  grant, authorize EPA to award multipurpose brownfields grants for  projects consisting of multiple elements, and make nonprofit entities  eligible for mediation assessment grants under the program. It will  also allow local governments to apply for site assessment grants for  properties acquired prior to the creation of the program.                                time  1445    Unfortunately, it falls short in two areas. The final version of this  legislation that passed committee contained a provision ensuring that  State and local governments that acquire brownfields properties  continue to take steps to protect people from coming into contact with  contamination on the property. In fact, I have a letter here from the  Conference of Mayors where they say they would agree if there were two  clauses: that they did not cause or contribute to the contamination and  exercises due care with regard to any known contamination at the site.   Unfortunately, this bill strikes out the words ``due care,'' and with  the liability exemption, there is the possibility that properties would  be acquired that are dangerous for entry that wouldn't be properly  fenced or secured because of removing the ``due care.'' I don't know  why that had to come out, since the Conference of Mayors had supported  it.   Second, nearly every stakeholder that testified before our committee  stated that the current level of funding for the program is well below  need, so we should be increasing the authorized and appropriated  levels. Again, unfortunately, the bill under consideration today only  reauthorizes flat funding levels for the program, which is, I think, a  missed opportunity.   I hope, as we move forward and resolve any differences with the  Senate, that we can make improvements in these areas.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time.
