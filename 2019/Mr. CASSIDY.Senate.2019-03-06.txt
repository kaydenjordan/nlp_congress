 Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the  200th anniversary of the founding of Washington Parish in my home State  of Louisiana. It is a parish filled with determined and patriotic  citizens who work day in and day out to better our State and our  Nation.   Washington Parish, named in honor of our first President, is located  in the section of Louisiana known as the Florida Parishes. The parish  government was founded on March 6, 1819, and a few years later, the  town of Franklinton would become the permanent parish seat. The parish  covers 676 square miles with the Mississippi State line serving as the  eastern and northern borders.   The area is rich with American history. In 1814, Andrew Jackson  marched with his soldiers across the Pearl River and recruited many of  the local citizens to join them in the Battle of New Orleans. The  ``Military Road'' constructed by General Andrew Jackson crossed the  Pearl River into present-day Bogalusa. Records from the War Department  show the future President and his troops made camp in the area on  November 28, 1814.   As one of the most rural parts of the State, the parish is known for  its pine forests, rolling hills, and many farms. The people who call  Washington Parish home are incredibly proud of their local heritage,  good food, and for hosting the Washington Parish Free Fair, the  Nation's largest free fair.   I would like to wish the citizens of Washington Parish a very happy  bicentennial and thank them for their many contributions over the last  200 years to our beautiful State and to our Nation.                            ____________________
