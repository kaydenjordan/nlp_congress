 Mr. Chairman, I would like to, first of all,  thank the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester) for  introducing this very important legislation, and thank Chairman Scott  for yielding me time and for his leadership and support in continuing  to provide access to quality healthcare for working families.   As vice chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, I am  happy to stand with my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee  to urge my colleagues to support the Strengthening Healthcare and  Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act.   While H.R. 987 is not a panacea to the many challenges that we face  in our Nation's healthcare delivery system, it is sound legislation  that will reduce drug pricing and increase market competition to bring  generic drugs to the market sooner.   It improves the lives of Americans by lowering the cost of premiums  and out-of-pocket expenses and that presents real financial hardships  to Americans who have to struggle with limited resources and ask  themselves, Do I pay for medication, or do I purchase food, or school  fees, or transportation to and from work?   While my home State of New York has banned the sale of short-term  health insurance plans, they are legal in other states and often do not  provide a comprehensive level of healthcare insurance and coverage in  the event of an emergency.   Mr. Chairman, let's do the right thing and enact legislation that  will lower the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs and give  protections to the consumers of health insurance coverage, lifting the  burden of access and affordability from the American people.
