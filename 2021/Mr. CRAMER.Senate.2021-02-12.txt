 My apologies to the Senator from Massachusetts for  butting in.   I send a question to the desk for the former President's attorneys.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question from Senator Cramer is for  the counsel for the former President.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Given the allegations of the House manager that President       Trump has tolerated anti-Semitic rhetoric, has there been a       more pro-Israel President than President Trump?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. No. But it is apparent that nobody listened  to what I said earlier today, because the vitriolic speech needs to  stop. You need to stop.   There was nothing funny here, Mr. Raskin. We aren't having fun here.  This is about the most miserable experience I have had down here in  Washington, DC. There is nothing fun about it.   And in Philadelphia, where I come from, when you get caught doctoring  the evidence, your case is over, and that is what happened. They got  caught doctoring the evidence, and this case should be over.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.
