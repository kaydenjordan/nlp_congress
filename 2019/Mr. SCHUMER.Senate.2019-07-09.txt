 Madam President, yesterday, I sent a letter to U.S.  soccer that officially invited the U.S. women's soccer team to come to  the Senate to celebrate their outstanding World Cup victory. Happily, I  heard last night that Megan Rapinoe, one of the team's cocaptains and  stars of the tournament, has accepted our invitation. I greatly look  forward to scheduling a time when these inspiring women can come to the  Nation's Capital.   What they have accomplished on and off the pitch is a credit to our  Nation. Millions of young girls and young boys look up to these  players. Millions of women, sports fans or not, admire the light they  have shown on the disparities between the men's and women's game--part  of a broader fight for equal treatment and fair pay in the workplace  for all women.   I believe it would be a fitting tribute to this great women's soccer  team to bring legislation to the Senate floor that would make it easier  for women to get equal pay in the workplace. The House has already  passed a bill to do just that. I call on Leader McConnell, again, to  bring that bill to the floor of the Senate, particularly in light of  the great victory of the women's team and the knowledge that they get  paid much less than the men, even though they work just as hard and  bring, at least in recent years, even greater glory to the United  States.   Wouldn't it be great if we could pass that bill while the women's  national team is visiting the Chamber? Wouldn't that send a powerful  message of our commitment to rooting out discrimination everywhere?   I urge Leader McConnell to consider it. Right now that bill lies in  Leader McConnell's all-too-full legislative graveyard. Perhaps this  great victory might spring it free so that we could do something for  women's equality.
