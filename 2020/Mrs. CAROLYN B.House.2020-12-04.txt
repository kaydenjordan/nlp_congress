 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for her leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the MORE Act. I applaud my  colleagues,  [[Page H6837]]  Chairman Nadler and Vice President-elect Harris, for their leadership.  It is past time that Congress answers the call for reform for low-level  marijuana conviction justice.   This sweeping legislation would officially remove cannabis from the  list of federally controlled harmful substances, protect medical  cannabis businesses, and expunge low-level marijuana convictions that  have disproportionately harmed people and communities of color.   The MORE Act would also help those whose convictions are overturned  through an opportunity trust fund that would provide job training,  reentry assistance, and legal aid. If we are serious about criminal  justice reform, we need to get rid of the antiquated cannabis laws that  disproportionately harm people of color. The MORE Act would do just  that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
