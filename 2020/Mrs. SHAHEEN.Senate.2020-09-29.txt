 Mr. President, I join my colleague in coming to the  floor to talk about what is at stake as the Senate considers who will  fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the passing of Justice Ginsburg.   Justice Ginsburg was not only an extraordinary legal mind, but she  was an unwavering advocate for equality under the law. I believe she  epitomized what we should seek in any Supreme Court Justice: a respect  for the rule of law coupled with an understanding that our Constitution  was designed to protect the rights of the many, not just the few.   Unfortunately, President Trump and my colleagues across the aisle are  doing a disservice to Justice Ginsburg's legacy by attempting to rush  through a nominee when the election is already underway. And that is  not being dramatic. The fact is, we have 31 States, including my home  State of New Hampshire, that have already begun distributing their  absentee ballots. In fact, I was at a UPS distribution center in the  city of Dover yesterday--actually it was on Monday--and I talked to  several people there who showed me their absentee ballots because they  had filled them out, and they were getting ready to mail them.   So voting is already underway, and this is no ordinary election. It  comes  [[Page S5915]]  during a global pandemic, when cities and towns are struggling to stay  afloat and Americans are trying to figure out how they are going to  continue to pay the rent and put food on the table. With more than  200,000 Americans, including 439 Granite Staters who have died from  COVID-19, we are still experiencing as many as 40,000 new cases each  day in this country.   Our economy is struggling to get back on its feet. There are still  11.5 million fewer workers employed since the pandemic began, and many  are unable to go back to work because the majority of our childcare  centers remain closed out of safety concerns. We still have so many  schools, at least in New Hampshire, where the students are working from  home. If they are lucky, they are going to school part time and working  from home part time, but most of them are not back in school full time.   Treatment and recovery centers are reporting that the overdose crisis  has worsened because of the pandemic. In New Hampshire, where we saw in  2019 for the first time in a number of years the overdose death rate  began to fall, we are now seeing an increase again. We are also facing  a looming eviction crisis and housing shortage that has been  exacerbated by COVID-19.   Yet, given this reality, what we are seeing in the Senate is not an  effort to pass a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package that is actually  going to help the millions who have been impacted by this pandemic.  Instead, what we are seeing from the Republican leadership here is a  focus on quickly ramming through a nominee to serve on the Supreme  Court in just a few short weeks.   While that is going on, we have seen Republican leadership in the  Senate blocking bipartisan negotiations on a COVID-19 relief bill. That  has been going on since May, when we received the House bill called the  Heroes Act. During those last 4 months, businesses have been shuttered  in New Hampshire and across this country; families have been evicted;  hospitals have laid off staff. All of this is going on while the  pandemic continues--more than 40,000 new cases a day.   Yesterday, I was in Nashua, the second largest city in New Hampshire,  and I met with leadership from St. Joseph Hospital there. It is one of  two hospitals in Nashua, and it is one of the four hospitals that has  treated the most COVID cases of any of the hospitals in New Hampshire.  Nashua is one of the communities in New Hampshire that has been hardest  hit by the coronavirus.   What I heard at the hospital was that COVID-19 has had a huge impact  on their facility. Despite the very much needed injection of funds from  the CARES Act and assistance from the Medicare advance payments loan  program, they are still forecasting significant losses. They have had  to furlough employees, many of whom rely on their jobs at St. Joseph  not just for their healthcare but also for their childcare benefits.   They shared that they have concerns with the lack of availability of  testing capability. They have had orders that never arrived at their  facility, despite commitments from the companies who are selling the  tests.   But the leadership and the staff at St. Joseph remain committed to  serving their community, as do all of the hospitals across New  Hampshire, so many of whom are facing similar financial difficulties  and need additional help from the Federal Government.   I am hearing from people across my State who urgently need Federal  help. I have had letters from people all across New Hampshire,  representing different industries in the State and different segments  of our communities. I want to read an excerpt from a letter that I  received from Pamela Keilig, who works with the New Hampshire Coalition  Against Domestic Violence. She says:         The pandemic has had grave consequences on the health and       safety of survivors as they encounter ongoing barriers to       accessing the support they need. . . . Overall, the statewide       hotlines have seen a 7 percent increase in call volume       compared to this time last year.    Pamela's letter goes on to highlight what is at stake if Congress  refuses to act. She says:         [P]rolonged inaction in providing additional funding places       survivors and their families in increased jeopardy. . . .       [T]he time to intervene is now.    They need help now.   I also want to read a letter from Chris Coates, who is the county  administrator for Cheshire County in New Hampshire over in the western  part of our State that borders Vermont. Chris's letter describes the  important role local governments are playing in mitigating the spread  of COVID-19. He says:         We are providing essential support and guidance to small       businesses, record numbers of unemployed individuals, and       those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse       disorders.    State and local leaders like Chris are facing severe budgetary  shortfalls. They desperately need help from Congress. The State of New  Hampshire alone expects to experience a budget shortfall of nearly $540  million if Congress doesn't provide additional support.   In his letter Chris Coates goes on to say:         Cheshire County is not looking for a special handout. My       request reflects the simple reality that county governments,       along with our state and local partners, are dealing with       immense challenges at the community level.    Then I also heard from the Seacoast Chamber Alliance, which  represents chambers of commerce in the communities of Hampton, Exeter,  Portsmouth, Dover, Somersworth, and Rochester. The Chamber Alliance  says:         The Seacoast Chamber Alliance respectfully requests you and       your colleagues in the Senate work together in a bipartisan       effort to approve a comprehensive funding relief package to       support our businesses.    They go on to say:         Although we--and our members--are grateful for the support       already allocated through previous CARES Act funding relief       packages, we know this economic crisis caused by COVID-19 is       far from over. And for many, the worst is yet to come.    They finally conclude by saying:         It is clear that without another round of assistance, many       businesses will not survive into 2021.    I ask unanimous consent that these letters, including the ones I just  quoted from, be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     New Hampshire Coalition Against                                      Domestic & Sexual Violence,                                                 September 18, 2020.      Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Shaheen: On behalf of the New Hampshire       Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence and our 13       member programs, we are writing with the urgent request for       additional COVID-19 relief funding to meet the continued and       escalated needs of survivors of domestic and sexual violence       in our state. Such funding is imperative to further the life-      saving work of our crisis centers, keep the lights on in our       shelters, and help prevent violence in our communities.        Over the last 6 months we have witnessed the full impact       and extent of the pandemic unfold before us, and it is has       become increasingly evident that we have transitioned into a       sustained crisis in New Hampshire, where every intersection       of our work has been interrupted. Annually, our member       programs serve more than 15,000 survivors through prevention       education, court and hospital accompaniment, crisis       counseling, and housing support. Crisis centers have worked       tirelessly to adapt service delivery and transform their       advocacy efforts under incredible circumstances. Despite the       resilience and innovation of crisis centers, long-term       support is needed to maintain the work and respond       effectively to the needs of survivors and their families.        The pandemic has had grave consequences on the health and       safety of survivors as they encounter ongoing barriers to       accessing the support they need, while simultaneously       experiencing more severe and lethal cases of violence and       abuse. Crisis centers remain inundated with service demands       as abusers continue to utilize new ways to leverage power and       control, noting an increase in calls from Child Advocacy       Centers, male survivors of domestic violence, and individuals       experiencing mental health crises. Overall, the statewide       hotlines have seen a 7 percent increase in call volume       compared to last year. Moreover, victims of domestic violence       and sexual assault have a higher vulnerability to       homelessness, substance abuse, and poverty compared to the       general population, requiring a greater number of       interventions.        New Hampshire's housing crisis has made it increasingly       difficult to place survivors in transitional or permanent       housing, and this has been exacerbated since March. In 2019,       well before a global pandemic was on our radar, crisis       centers provided shelter for over 400 survivors, accounting       for more than 40,000 bed nights, and even then, had to turn       away more than 3,000 adult and child survivors due to the       lack of available services.        Advocates have reported an increased need for housing       support, as survivors experience  [[Page S5916]]       job loss and threat of homelessness due to violence at home.       Most shelters across the state have remained at capacity       since the start of the pandemic, utilizing hotels to house       additional victims, often for extended stays lasting several       weeks at a time. Crisis centers remain deeply concerned about       the consequences of not having enough housing support,       especially as we move into winter.        Despite added efforts to help domestic violence and       stalking victims access the legal system, there has been a       severe decrease in the number of protective orders filed       compared to last year. In a state where over 50 percent of       Lethality Assessment screenings represent high risk of       fatality, and where domestic violence is a factor in nearly       half of all homicides, there is an essential need to ensure       that survivors are able to access every resource available to       them, and receive the support needed to navigate the legal       system during a public health crisis.        The continued challenges that survivors face in accessing       vital services cannot be overstated; prolonged inaction in       providing additional funding places survivors and their       families in increased jeopardy. At the onset of the pandemic,       crisis centers quickly identified the immediate loss of       funding due to COVID-19 as annual fundraisers had to be       cancelled. It is projected that the total loss of revenue for       all 13 member programs will be over one million dollars. This       has required member programs to tap into unrestricted funding       in order to meet the increased service demands and needs of       survivors, leaving crisis centers with limited funding to       cover basic operating costs. Crisis center staff have been       running an endless marathon over the last six months and are       in great need for Congress to rally behind them.        As we continue to acknowledge the full impact of COVID-19       on our field, we would be exceedingly grateful for further       federal funding to help us weather this storm. Centering the       needs and experiences of survivors in future relief packages       would be instrumental to the individuals that crisis centers       serve throughout the country. Survivors will feel the impact       of this pandemic on their lives for months to come; the time       to intervene is now.        Thank you for your continued dedication to supporting       survivors in New Hampshire, and throughout the United States.            Sincerely,                                                     Pamela Keilig,      Public Policy Specialist.                                   ____                                                 September 22, 2020.      Senator Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Shaheen: The Seacoast Chamber Alliance       respectfully requests that you and your colleagues in the       Senate work together in a bipartisan effort to approve a       comprehensive funding relief package to support our       businesses.        Although we--and our members--are grateful for the support       already allocated through previous CARES Act funding relief       packages, we know this economic crisis caused by COVID-19 is       far from over. And for many, the worst is yet to come.        As we head into the winter months, many are seeing       continued declines in business over concerns about a surge in       coronavirus cases during what is typically the season for flu       and other illnesses.        Our restaurants and hospitality industry in particular are       seeing a lack of consumer confidence in dining indoors.       Restaurants are often `destination businesses' that attract       patrons not just to their own business but serve as an       attraction for other businesses located nearby. Downtown       business districts rely heavily on restaurants to bring       customers to the area and help to support numerous other       businesses such as retailers and service-oriented businesses.       The loss of restaurants will create a ripple effect that will       be catastrophic to downtown business districts resulting in       the closing of many other small businesses, loss of jobs and       empty buildings.        Although hospitality businesses are facing an urgent need       due to the change of season, many other businesses are still       in need of assistance as well. Supply chain delays, slower       mail and shipping services and lower customer spending are       resulting in businesses seeing lower revenues and higher       costs for materials across all sectors. A great many of our       businesses are not able to operate at full capacity and are       furloughing employees as a result.        Feedback from some of our members is below. It is clear       that without another round of assistance, many businesses       will not survive into 2021. Please urge the Senate to vote on       a bipartisan bill and send the relief needed to ensure our       business community's survival.        Thank you for your consideration.      John Nyhan,        President, Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce.      Jennifer Wheeler,        President, Exeter Area Chamber of Commerce.      Valerie Rochon,        Chief Collaborator, Chamber Collaborative of Greater       Portsmouth.      Margaret Joyce,        President, Greater Dover Chamber of Commerce.      Allison St. Laurent,        Executive Director, The Falls Chamber of Commerce.      Laura Ring,        President, Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce.                           Feedback From Members         From a small independent restaurant: Most people are       getting to a point that even if congress needs to piecemeal a       deal, we need to get some funding. Those parts of the package       that everyone agrees upon should be funded, leaving aside       that which is contentious. MUST be funded now. To hold up the       funding to small business, while the other funding is being       debated, isn't helping anyone at all. Could help many small       businesses by getting the funding out as quickly as possible.       At the end of the day, stop holding out for everything, agree       on common ground, get it done, and get the funds out to those       who desperately need it.        From a downtown Retail & Commercial Real Estate: I'm       concerned that the level of additional funding that Sen.       Shaheen is supporting may be more than necessary for most       circumstances and, more importantly, will certainly add even       more to the huge debt that we are already leaving on the       shoulders of the younger generations. I suggest that they       stop holding out to get everything, but get SOMETHING--those       things they agree upon now--so our businesses can stay in       business. They can argue about the contentious items later,       which may or may not happen.        From a Historic Museum: By our interactions, based here at       the historic museum, on common interests in our past and our       cultural heritage, we have played a significant part in       creating and maintaining a vibrant economy. With our physical       distance, though, our places in the economy have evaporated.       In the absence of the PPP loan program, it seems doubtful       that our organization would have been able to cover our       payroll costs this summer, and our prospects are looking       increasingly dim if the federal government does not provide       additional funding to ensure the sustainability of essential       community organizations like ours. Cultural and historic       nonprofits are key to the local tourism economy, and to the       economy of the region. We urge New Hampshire's legislators to       support additional federal support for our community, and our       economy.        From a Catering Company: Our challenges lie in people not       being able to gather. Limits on indoor get-togethers and       events are our main difficulty. Our corporate catering       accounts have all but dried up due to people working remotely       and not going into their offices. Our wedding business is       about half of what it was last year and that will all end in       early November. Previous events that we had scheduled, like       being an in house caterer for a private club in Portsmouth,       will not be gathering and thus a loss of over $45,000 for the       winter season. We have come up with some creative ways to       bring in revenue but we will likely fall far short of the       $20,000 we need monthly for occupancy and to pay our full-      time staff. When we discuss our outlook for the next 6       months, it's looking for ways to survive that next 6 months.       It will be very challenging and will likely cause us to go       further into debt to maintain everything. catering service       and function hall.        From a History Museum/Attraction: The museum's fiscal year       ends on March 31st--we project a $180,000 operating deficit.       Up to this point we have been able to keep year-round staff       [27] fully employed and a reasonable amount of programming,       mostly focused on serving the schools. To reduce costs we       hired far fewer seasonal employees [last year we had about 65       part-time seasonal staff, this year a dozen.] Looking to       2021--I anticipate that we will continue to run a significant       deficit. This may result in some furloughing of some staff       and reduction in programs, especially special events that       draw such large crowds to the city. No matter if the pandemic       is under control with a vaccine or better treatments, tourism       will be down and philanthropy will be depleted for the most       part because of donor fatigue and significantly reduced       funds. I think 2021 will be much harder for tourist--based       businesses and cultural organizations. Unless there is a       significant change, older and middle age people [a major part       of our audience] will not travel in great numbers because of       reduced funds or their reluctance to spend because of the       fluctuating economy.        From a 501(c)(6) Membership Art Association: As a non-      profit organization, we really need all the help we can get       to stay in existence. As an art oriented organization, we are       finding it extremely challenging to get grants and do other       fund raising because much of the money available in grants,       (other than the governor's main street funds), and from       individuals, seems to be prioritized to more social oriented       non-profits--such as food banks, homeless shelters, etc. We       certainly realize these are very important at this time, but       we also have to have the ability for other nonprofits to get       funding assistance. We have had to reinvent the way we do       business by moving more of it online, which has meant       increased staff costs, and software expenditures so things       remain a challenge for us.        From an Amusement Attraction: Thank you for spearheadng       this. I have to tell you, this may be the most important       battle we have had to wage collectively. This is the first       time I've stopped and put what we are  [[Page S5917]]       dealing with and what it could very well mean for my family       and our business into words. The result? I cried for an hour.       Please fight for us.        From a Cultural/Tourist destination: We were closed for our       2020 season (this weekend would have been our closing       weekend!). This resulted in the loss of over $3 million in       income, and while we were able to reduce our expenses by $1.7       million, we still face a massive challenge this year, and       uncertainty about the status of our 2021 season. We did       receive both a PPP loan (which we anticipate will be fully       forgiven) and a NERF grant, which made a big difference for       us--but even this amazing support (totaling over $800K!)       didn't cover our losses for this fiscal year. However, nobody       knows what is going to happen next year. We are in the       process of considering benefit reductions, furloughs, and       possibly even layoffs for early 2021, depending on what       happens. If an effective vaccine is widely available and       administered by May or June (which is seeming less and less       likely, we will be able to open safely. Having said that, we       can't wait till June to make tough decisions--so even if we       can open, we need additional support in the winter months.       And if we can't open, we need even more support. I can't       imagine where we would be without the PPP loan and NERF grant       this year. If a vaccine isn't forthcoming, we could be in the       exact same position next year, and would be looking for a       similar amount of funding. Star is open to the public and       welcomes nearly 20,000 people a year. We consider ourselves       stewards of this NH treasure, we are grateful with the       funding we received in 2020, and we know that without       continued support, our ability to continue to welcome guests       and protect this important NH resource would be in jeopardy.       Senator Shaheen has been an effective advocate for our       nonprofit organization (and many others), and I am happy she       is continuing this fight.                                              County of Cheshire,                                                 September 25, 2020.      Hon. Jeanne Shaheen,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Shaheen: I write to you today in my position       as County Administrator for Cheshire County to first and       foremost thank you for your leadership, guidance and advocacy       on this seemingly never-ending COVID-19 journey.        In the early days of COVID-19 your voice of calm       reassurance allowed us to know that we had a friend in       Washington and you and your staff provided us valuable       guidance in the early days of this virus. That guidance       helped us deal with this tsunami of a pandemic that came down       upon our communities and up-ended our lives.        Your leadership in Washington has helped Cheshire County       receive funding for PPE, stipends for our nursing home,       sheriff's deputies and Department of Corrections. We have       received funding to cover for lost revenues at our nursing       home and unemployment benefits for those in-need living in       Cheshire County. This is just a short list of the work you       have done on behalf of the citizens of Cheshire County and I       thank-you.        When Cheshire County needed you, you were there, and       continue to be today. As the impact of the pandemic endures,       the residents of Cheshire County continue to feel the       devastating impact on our health and economic structures. The       Delivering Immediate Relief to America's Families, Schools       and Small Businesses Act which was voted down yesterday, fell       short in many areas but especially for counties due to the       lack of providing direct flexible relief to counties, cities       and towns of all sizes.        At a time when so many Cheshire County citizens are serving       on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we move       closer to 2021 with so many unknown fiscal realities, I was       extremely disappointed that the new supplemental aid package       being considered in the U.S. Senate left out new fiscal       relief or flexibility for county governments.        As you look to the next stimulus or CARES Act funding, I       urge you to work with the White House and leaders of both       parties in the House and Senate to resume negotiations on a       bipartisan relief package that provides this missing direct,       flexible aid to counties, cities and towns. With national       numbers showing that last week that 1.7 million Americans       filed new jobless and unemployment claims, we now stand with       30 million Americans out of work.        If a new stimulus agreement is not reached prior to the       seating of the new congress the fiscal ramification could be       devastating. Counties could be looking at tax payments from       towns and cities that may be substantial short of normal       revenues and services that are dictated by state statute may       need to be immediately reduced. A stimulus package that       allows municipalities to utilize federal funding to offset       lost revenue could advert what may be a pending catastrophe       for not just Cheshire County but the country.        Cheshire County is not looking for a special handout. My       request reflects the simple reality that county governments,       along with our state and local partners, are dealing with       immense challenges at the community level.        Local governmental bodies are playing a significant role in       mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 virus. We are providing       essential support and guidance to small businesses, record       numbers of unemployed individuals, and those suffering from       mental illnesses and substance use disorders. We remain       steadfast in our focus to protect our most vulnerable       residents such as at-risk children and seniors.        We understand the need for appropriate public       accountability standards, and the oversight guardrails that       are in place for the existing and proposed legislation, and       we will meet those expectations.        Our goal is to always ensure that all federal resources are       utilized wisely and responsibly at the local level to address       the immediate and far-reaching impacts of the current       pandemic, and to make our nation more resilient and safer at       the individual community level.        I therefore request, with the utmost respect and gratitude       for your tireless and steadfast work during this pandemic,       that you continue to fight and advocate to your colleagues on       both sides of the aisle.        The urgency to agree upon a stimulus bill prior to the new       year that will address the needs of the counties, cities and       towns in the State of New Hampshire cannot be stressed       strongly enough. The ability to access flexible funding that       allows municipal bodies to address revenue shortfalls will       strengthen all of our communities, but especially Cheshire       County.        Again, thank you for your voice in Washington, you make a       difference.                                             Christopher C. Coates,                                              County Administrator.     So in the middle of this pandemic, the likes of which  we haven't seen in more than 100 years, what we see here in the Senate  is that Majority Leader McConnell has prioritized moving a nominee who  would enable the Court to strip away critical health protections that  keep Americans safe.   Instead of providing more resources for the businesses, the  hospitals, the healthcare providers, and the people who have lost their  jobs--instead of providing more resources for them, the majority is  hoping to confirm a nominee who would strike down healthcare coverage  for people, including those with preexisting conditions.   My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, was very eloquent in  talking about what the impact of striking down the Affordable Care Act  will be. But the fundamental concern is that, instead of working  together here to help Americans who are struggling with this pandemic,  what the majority has chosen to do, what the Republicans in this  Chamber have chosen to do, is to ram through a nominee who threatens to  erode these fundamental rights while in the Court.   Right now, Granite Staters and all Americans need the Senate to work  for them, not for a partisan agenda to radicalize the Supreme Court.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to set aside this  effort and to work together for the American people to get people the  help they so desperately need.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there is a lot going on in America  right now. We are in the middle of a pandemic where we have lost over  200,000 people. We have millions who are unemployed. We are only 34  days away from a Presidential election. It is easy to see that a lot of  Americans could have missed the fact that we are also in the middle of  a decennial census.   Under article I, section 2 of the Constitution, since 1790, the  United States has conducted a census every 10 years. The U.S. Census  Bureau is currently executing the 2020 decennial census. As we speak,  census workers are conducting interviews and filling out survey forms  in every community in our country despite the tremendous obstacles that  have been posed by COVID-19. Their work is of utmost importance. I want  to take this opportunity to thank them for their very challenging  efforts.   The 2020 census will dictate apportionment of the House of  Representatives for the next decade. In addition, Federal programs rely  on census data to distribute more than $1.5 trillion in funding every  year to States, localities, individuals, and businesses. So the stakes  are high for the census, and we have only one chance to get it right-- one chance every 10 years.   As the vice chair of the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with  Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Census Bureau has  the resources it needs to ensure a complete and accurate 2020 census.  This includes securing, for the past several fiscal years, the entire  amount that was requested by the administration, including reserve  funding, which has been critical to meet the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic.   However, in addition to funding, the Census needs sufficient time to  get the job done right. To protect public health, on April 13, 2020,  Census Director Steven Dillingham and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  announced that the Census Bureau would delay field operations by 3  months and they asked Congress to delay reporting apportionment and  redistricting counts by 4 months in order to ``ensure the completeness  and accuracy of the 2020 Census.'' That was Census Director Dillingham  and Commerce Secretary Ross. Under this revised plan, the largest and  most important field data collection operation to follow up with  households that have been nonresponsive would run until October 31. On  a bipartisan basis, this request from the administration was welcomed.  We want to give the Census both the time and the resources that it  needs to do the job right.   Over the course of the summer, the Trump administration installed new  political appointees at the Census, and a number of reports indicated  that the Trump administration was looking to rush the 2020 decennial  census operations so that Secretary Ross--despite what he said to us  last spring--could transmit the apportionment counts to the President  by December 31, 2020.   Then, on August 3--just last month, August 3--Census Director  Dillingham announced that 2020 field data collection and self-response  operations would be shortened by a month, ending today, September 30.  This decision to curtail operations was not based on the advice of  career Census Bureau experts. Census data collection operations are  incredibly complicated even under the best of conditions, but their  complexity is greatly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact,  this spring, experts made clear that a 4-month delay of statutory  deadlines was necessary.   In May, Tim Olson, Director for Field Operations for the 2020  decennial census, stated:         We have passed the point where we could even meet the       current legislative requirement of December 31. We can't do       that anymore.    That was back in May.   After the truncated data collection operations were announced, a  career official stated:         It's going to be impossible to complete the count in time.       I'm very fearful we're going to have a massive undercount.   [[Page S5920]]     I share this fear. I am deeply concerned that cutting short data  collection and processing operations during a global pandemic will  necessitate changes that will be detrimental to the accuracy and  completeness of the 2020 decennial census. In particular, I am  concerned that the Census Bureau will reduce the number of attempts to  count households and significantly increase the use of less accurate  data collection methods. This could lead to a substantial undercount in  historically hard-to-count areas. Those areas include Native American,  rural, and immigrant communities. An undercount would mean that these  communities would be left disenfranchised, without proper political  representation and without millions of dollars of Federal funding.   We should be clear about the gravity of this outcome. This would be a  constitutional crisis that further undermines faith in our governing  institutions.   I called for the Department of Commerce inspector general to  investigate why the Trump administration suddenly curtailed data  collection operations. I have also requested that the Government  Accountability Office conduct an investigation into how this rushed  timeline could affect data quality and the overall completeness of the  census count.   Last week, the Commerce inspector general released a preliminary  report, finding what we already knew: that the decision to accelerate  the 2020 census schedule was not made by the experts at the Census  Bureau and that rushed schedule increases the risk to the accuracy of  the 2020 census.   In particular, the report raises that the curtailed timeline does not  provide schedule flexibility in the case of natural disasters.  Unfortunately, over the last month, we have seen record wildfires out  West and several hurricanes in the gulf. This has delayed operations in  those regions.   The GAO came to a similar conclusion, publishing a report last month  that found that cutting the timeframe for the 2020 census could  increase the risk of an inaccurate count. One line from the inspector  general's report really stuck with me. It said:         A statutory extension would permit the Bureau to adhere, as       closely as practicable, to the 2020 Census plan it developed       over a decade instead of the replan it developed over a       weekend.    I hope my colleagues will review these reports. I know everybody is  anxious to go home. I am anxious to go home. But I hope people will  review these reports and join me in providing the Census Bureau the  time the agency needs.   This last-minute attempt to shorten data collection and data  processing isn't surprising, sadly. The Trump administration has made  other attempts to manipulate the count for political gain. It has been  well documented that political operatives have pushed the  administration and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to include a  citizenship question as part of the 2020 census and in an attempt to  reduce participation in immigrant communities. Ultimately, Secretary  Ross's attempt to include a citizenship question was rejected by the  Supreme Court.   We can't let these latest attempts to undermine the accuracy of the  constitutionally mandated count succeed.   Last week, a Federal court issued an injunction preventing the Census  Bureau from ramping down operations prematurely because there would be  irreparable harm to communities from rushing the count. However, this  could just be temporary. In defying the court, earlier this week, the  Census Bureau announced a mere 5-day delay so that operations will now  end on October 5. This is not long enough. The Census Bureau has also  announced plans to appeal the court's injunction.   This is not solely a rural or an urban issue, a red State or a blue  State problem. I hope my colleagues will listen to this because the  States with the lowest percentage of households counted are Alabama,  Louisiana, Montana, South Carolina, Mississippi--Senator Wicker--and  Georgia. Some of these States are on the bubble of gaining or losing  Representatives, so an undercount, which is a real risk if operations  are rushed and shut down prematurely, would have serious repercussions.   That is why I call on my colleagues to pass a 4-month extension of  the Census's statutory deadlines so that the Trump administration is  compelled to stick to the timeline it had originally announced.  Congress already missed an opportunity to address this issue as part of  the continuing resolution.   Again, there is bipartisan support for this extension, with a  bipartisan bill filed. In addition, last month, a bipartisan group of  48 Senators sent a letter to Senate and House leadership that called  for the inclusion of legislation to extend the statutory deadlines as  part of the next coronavirus relief package, as the House has done in  the updated Heroes Act that was released recently. We should also  ensure that the data collection operations, including nonresponse  followup and self-response, continue through October 31.   It is imperative for the census to count every person in the United  States and where one lives. This includes communities that have had  historically low participation in decennial censuses. The census is too  important to allow meddling for political gain. We must take action  immediately to ensure that the Census Bureau takes the time to get it  right.
