 Mr. Chair, the problem of increasing energy costs is a  critically important issue for my constituents. Many of the members of  my community are paying natural gas prices over twice as high as they  were a year ago, and they count themselves lucky, because some of the  people in my district have natural gas bills three times higher to heat  their homes than they were a year ago. Also, gasoline prices in my  district are almost twice as high as they were just a few years ago.   Mr. Chair, I represent over 100,000 people who commute over an hour,  each way, back and forth to Los Angeles every day. They are not doing  this because they want to. They are doing this because that is what is  required to put food on the table for their families. They can't afford  to buy a new car, much less an electric car. Every time the price of  energy goes up, these people feel the effects the most acutely.   This is not unique to my district. In fact, a survey released several  weeks ago showed that over 30 percent of Americans had to make the  incredibly difficult decision between paying a higher energy bill or  buying basic necessities for their family in the last 12 months.   This bill is a meaningful step toward improving that situation. It  would streamline the production of energy here in America.                                time  1415    Mr. Chair, the problem we have here is a classic one of supply and  demand. Unfortunately, at both the Federal and State levels, we have  actively sought to constrain the supply of domestic energy here in  America over the last several years.   Economists will tell you that when you do that, when you have a fixed  demand and you constrain the supply, prices have to go up. That is  exactly what has been happening, and it is disproportionately impacting  the segment of our population who can least afford to pay it.   Mr. Chair, we produce energy more cleanly in America than anywhere  else on the planet. When we force our constituents to import a barrel  of oil from Venezuela, it has a 50 percent higher life cycle greenhouse  gas emission than a barrel of oil produced here. This bill will  meaningfully improve that situation.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of H.R. 1.
