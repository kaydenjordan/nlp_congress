 Mr. Speaker, ``Corrupting an election to keep oneself in  office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's  oath of office that I can imagine.''   Yesterday, Senator Mitt Romney outlined what so many of us know to be  the truth; that the evidence of this President's guilt is beyond any  doubt; that despite silencing witnesses and shielding even more  evidence, that this President abused his office to retain his slipping  grasp on power.                                time  1030    Yet Senators voted to acquit, nonetheless. This will be a stain on  the Senate and on Congress for all history.   But lost beneath the headlines and the attempts to justify the  unjustifiable lies, the true motivation that guided almost every single  Republican Senator and every last Republican Member of this House-- fear, not just of losing a seat but of losing power; fear of what might  happen if we allow this representative democracy to truly represent the  interests and desires and agenda of all its people; fear of a country:   Where we actually address climate change because it is devastating  our planet and threatening our lives;   Where women could have an unalterable right to bodily autonomy;   Where everyone would get the healthcare they need when they need it;   Where guns wouldn't shatter our schools and our churches and theaters  and every place in between;   Where working families wouldn't go to bed fearful of what tomorrow  may bring;   Where babies won't be ripped from their parents' arms and kids  trapped in cages;   Where freedom means the freedom to be you, whoever you may be;   Where you count, no matter the God of your prayers, the color of your  skin, the hand that you hold, the language that you speak.   The good news is, however, that their power, our power, as elected  officials is temporary. The people's power is not.   It is our people who have always forced our Nation forward on civil  rights, on healthcare, on justice, on war and peace, on liberty, on  freedom. And it is our people who will hold every single person in  Washington accountable for their actions yesterday, and that gives me  faith. It gives me hope. It makes me sure that the best days of our  democracy are still to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Medicaid saves lives. It helps save  patients from poverty and provides families with access to critical  care. It is the largest payer of mental healthcare in the country and  the longest payer of long-term care in the country.   It covers half of all births and strengthens special education  opportunities in our schools. It covers working families. It covers  babies. It covers the elderly, the sick, the addicted, and those in  need.   In short, it covers those that this administration has relentlessly  targeted from its very first day, from a healthcare repeal effort that  would have denied care to millions of Americans; to a lawsuit that  could still steal healthcare from millions more; then a relentless  effort to impose onerous bureaucratic red tape known as work  requirements on people struggling to make ends meet; and now this, an  illegal and immoral block grant that will end in countless lives lost  to preventable deaths.   We can afford trillions of dollars in tax cuts to make the rich  richer. We can afford $60 billion for a wall that falls in the wind and  fails in the rain. But taking care of our neighbors, that is a cost we  can't bear, a challenge too great for this country to shoulder.   For an administration that seeks to make America great, our President  far too frequently doubts the capabilities and grit of our fellow  neighbors. But as this administration stands proudly behind this  illegal policy, I have no doubt that it will be rejected by this  Chamber, in our courts, and by the American people yet again.
