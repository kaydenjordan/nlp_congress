 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 787, I call up  the bill (H.R. 5247) to authorize the use of eligible investigational  drugs by eligible patients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a  disease or condition in which there is reasonable likelihood that death  will occur within a matter of months, or with another eligible illness,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5247.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Members of Congress heard the  President during his State of the Union Address make a specific promise  to the American people that the passage of right-to-try legislation  would occur. This afternoon, I am proud to stand with the President and  the thousands of Americans with terminal illnesses, their families, and  their friends, in passing this important bill in the House.   Since 2014, nearly three out of four States, including my home State  of Texas, have passed a version of right-to-try laws. I am pleased that  the House is again considering H.R. 5247, the Trickett Wendler, Frank  Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018,  so that terminally ill patients have a chance, or maybe a second  chance, at life. These patients are our constituents. They could be  someone we know. Let us take this opportunity to improve access to  experimental treatments for them.   Over the course of the past decade, our Nation has achieved an  unprecedented number of innovations and scientific breakthroughs.  Through the contributions of researchers in academia and the private  sector, Americans have more innovative treatments at their fingertips.   Despite these achievements, I still hear from patients with serious,  life-threatening conditions, including my own constituents in north  Texas, who are frustrated with what they see as regulatory barriers  from trying new therapies when everything else has failed.   Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I understand that access to  investigational drugs and therapies is a deeply personal priority for  those seeking treatment for their loved ones with serious, life- threatening conditions.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle, I have a simple  question: Why do you not want to allow these patients to exercise their  right to fight for their future?   It is worth mentioning that the bill before us today is a revised,  more narrowly crafted version of the one that passed the Senate last  August. Since that time, the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health  held a hearing in early October to consider the Senate bill, where  Members heard from  [[Page H1740]]  the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott  Gottlieb, about the agency's concerns. We also heard testimony from  patients and groups that support and oppose right to try.   From then to just recently, our committee engaged in multistakeholder  efforts to improve the original right-to-try bill, as passed by the  Senate. It entailed numerous conversations with patients, advocates,  the Administration, authors of the bill, and stakeholders on all sides  of this complex topic.   The Food and Drug Administration was never left out of the  discussion. In fact, the agency provided valuable input throughout the  process and up until the introduction of H.R. 5247. The aim was to open  the door to innovative, experimental drugs for terminally ill patients  without necessarily compromising the vital work and the mission of the  Food and Drug Administration.   The current compassionate use program at the Food and Drug  Administration does make a good faith effort to help patients who do  not qualify for clinical trials. But right to try would actually offer  patients an alternative pathway to access eligible investigational  drugs, so long as they are certified by a physician who is in good  standing and abides by the rules laid out in the bill.   Again, we have worked closely with the Food and Drug Administration  to ensure that this new, alternative pathway does not hinder or  conflict with the critically important oversight that the agency  conducts.   Additionally, this bill protects patients from manufacturers  mislabeling or misbranding drugs, requires sponsors and manufacturers  to report adverse events to the Food and Drug Administration, and  provides certain liability protections for parties participating in the  new pathway.   Mr. Speaker, this alternative pathway would also be limited to  individuals who are suffering from a disease or a condition where there  is a reasonable likelihood of death within a matter of months or  significant, reversible morbidity, and who have exhausted all FDA- approved treatment options.   Lastly, it is essential that we do not create additional hurdles in  this process so that manufacturers in the drug approval process have  the certainty that they need.   The revised right-to-try bill clearly states that the Secretary of  the Department of Health and Human Services ``may not use a clinical  outcome associated with the use of an eligible investigational drug . .  . to delay or adversely affect the review or approval of such drug. . .  . `'   After months of work and thoughtful discussions, this legislation is  a positive step forward in our shared goal of improving care for  America's patients. It strikes the proper balance between ensuring  patient safety and granting access to new treatments.   The President outlined in his State of the Union Address that this  was an important priority for the administration. In the words of our  Vice President and former colleague, Mike Pence: ``It's about restoring  hope and giving patients with life-threatening diseases a fighting  chance.''   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues in the House to  vote in support of H.R. 5247, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), one of the authors of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield such  time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the  chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), a valuable member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee, the vice chairman of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), another valuable member of the Committee On  Energy and Commerce and the Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), one of the primary drivers on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I will be closing.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, during the rule debate on this bill, I  outlined a case where the previous Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, provided the  right to try for a patient, a Democratic donor, back in my home State  of Texas. So, really, all we are asking today is that we give regular  Americans, the forgotten men and women of this country, the same rights  that the Speaker of the House provided to a Democratic donor back in  October of 2008.    Yesterday I quoted from an article from the Dallas Morning News. I  have a different but similar article today talking about the same case,  talking about the individual who had a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.   There was a drug that perhaps would provide some hope. The individual  was clearly terminal. This monoclonal antibody that was primarily used  to treat multiple sclerosis might show some efficacy in treating the  advanced form of multiple myeloma that this patient had. The drug had  been through phase 1 clinical trials. The patient did not have time for  the drug to go through phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials.   The article says:         Enter Nancy Pelosi. Through means to which we have never       been privy, Ms. Pelosi got the FDA to give the manufacturer       the all-clear to give the drug to the patient. The patient       got the drug, the patient took the drug, but, unfortunately,       the patient died anyway, but his family remains grateful to       the Speaker for interceding on his behalf.    I don't doubt that they are.   Yesterday, I quoted the Dallas Morning News article where the  patient's spouse said, somehow, Nancy Pelosi got it done.   Well, do you know what, Mr. Speaker? You shouldn't have to depend on  the Speaker of the House to intercede on your behalf to get the FDA to  get the manufacturer to make a drug available. If you are really up  against a bad situation, wouldn't it be better if we provided everyone  that same pathway?   That is what this bill does today. That is why the right-to-try  legislation was advocated by the President of the United States. In  fact, I think it was the only legislative priority that the President  laid out during his State of the Union Address where he wanted to see  Congress act.   So today, we are going to do that. Today, we are going to act. It is  an important bill. I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, while well-intentioned, this motion to  recommit falls short of providing vulnerable patients full access to  experimental treatments.   Providing clarity on how negative side effects will be accounted for  during drug approvals is helpful. Giving manufacturers, sponsors,  physicians, hospitals, and clinical investigators certainty on  liability protections is meaningful. Taken together, these improvements  to the existing expanded access program could lead to enhanced  manufacturer and sponsor participation and increased patient access.   But this would not provide an alternative pathway for patients who  cannot get into a clinical trial and have been rejected from  participation in the existing compassionate use program.    This bill before us today does provide an alternative pathway, one  that strengthens patient protections with clearer informed consent and  real-time adverse event reporting. This bill--the underlying bill--also  makes certain that the FDA is notified when a patient receives an  unapproved drug through the new alternative pathway to ensure proper  oversight. These are significant patient protections.   With this motion to recommit, we have a choice. The underlying bill  is the only choice that gives those patients in the greatest need of  help access to investigational drugs, with their consent, even after  they were rejected from participating in a clinical trial or expanded  access.   Mr. Speaker, the choice is clear. We need to vote to expand patient  access. We need to vote down the motion to recommit. We need to vote  for the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
