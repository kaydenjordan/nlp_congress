 First, let me thank my good friend--who did a great and  outstanding job this morning on the Judiciary Committee--for his  graciousness and thoughtfulness as always. I also thank my friend from  New Mexico.   Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings today on  Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Democrats on  the committee have pointed out that over 40,000 of Judge Kavanaugh's  documents were handed over to the committee last night. It is the  latest insult in what has been an insulting process for reviewing the  nominee's record on the issues. It has not just been insulting to  Democrats in the Senate but insulting to the Senate as a whole and  insulting to the American people: We can jam this through, and it  doesn't matter what you think and what you need to know.   More than 90 percent of the nominee's record has been shielded from  public scrutiny. The chairman keeps claiming that there are several  hundred thousand pages that have been made available. That is not the  point. If only 7 percent of the documents are made available, the  question is, What looms in the other 93 percent? It is the percentage  that matters because we want to know what is hidden.   Furthermore, we have no knowledge of why we were given these  documents and not given the vast bulk of the documents. What is the  rule? Is there some objective rule finding? They should make it public.  Why? They haven't, and the reason is simple. The obvious conclusion-- and we can't prove it because we don't have the documents--is that in  the 93 percent, there are things they don't want to be made public.  Otherwise, there would be a set system, and they would say: Here is why  you are getting this, and here is why you are not getting that.   Again, it is not the number; it is the percentage. Almost everything  the Republicans requested with Elena Kagan and Sotomayor when they were  in the minority--in our position now--was granted. Very little of what  we have requested has been granted. So the question looms: What are  they hiding?   I commend my colleagues, sincerely and strongly, for standing up and  raising these issues this morning. The Judiciary Committee members were  lending their voices to a large and growing chorus of people out in  America who are deeply concerned about how this process has been run.  Every member of the Judiciary Committee was eloquent and forceful in  their clarifying of just how far the Republicans have gone to keep  Judge Kavanaugh's record a secret. Here, for the highest Court in the  land--which has huge power over every one of our lives in many  different ways--we are hiding what he really thinks. Maybe it is  because they don't want the American people to know what he really  thinks.   Nonetheless, the Judiciary Committee proceedings are going forward  even though the Republican majority has taken great pains to shield a  great bulk of Kavanaugh's record from the American public. Since they  are in the majority, they can do this against the will of all of the  Democrats and of, probably, much of the American people, but it is so  wrong. Let's review what we already know about this nominee.   For the bulk of his career, Brett Kavanaugh has been a loyal  Republican foot soldier who has consistently found himself near the  center of the most heated, partisan legal fights of the past  [[Page S6015]]  two decades. From the Starr report to Bush v. Gore and through the  myriad controversies of the Bush White House, Brett Kavanaugh was front  and center in representing the political interests of the Republicans.  His service as a partisan warrior was rewarded with a judgeship,  wherein he immediately began to establish a jurisprudence far outside  the judicial mainstream.   As a judge, he ruled against commonsense gun safety measures. He  ruled against commonsense environmental protections. He consistently  ruled against the rulemaking powers of independent agencies. He went so  far as to label the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  unconstitutional, and he has praised the dissents in both Roe and  Casey, which are two landmark cases that established a woman's right to  privacy with respect to her medical decisions.   Remember--we can't forget--Brett Kavanaugh was selected from a  preapproved list of candidates that had been vetted by the Federalist  Society and the Heritage Foundation--two hard-right groups that are  dedicated to the destruction of our healthcare law and the repeal of  Roe v. Wade. He was selected by a President who explicitly promised to  pick judges who would do those two things exactly.   Unlike with former nominees, Brett Kavanaugh has the special burden  of explaining his views on these crucial issues. The President didn't  just say: I am going to choose the best legal mind available. He said:  I am going to choose someone who will repeal Roe. He said: I am going  to choose someone who will overturn many of the healthcare protections  that we have, as in the ACA. So he has a special obligation.   When I interviewed him in my office, he ducked. I asked him if he  believed Planned Parenthood v. Casey was correctly decided, not whether  it were precedent. That doesn't matter. Precedents change. Supreme  Court Justices do it. I asked him whether it was correctly decided. He  refused to say. He refused to say whether any restriction on a woman's  reproductive freedom constituted an undue burden. There was nothing  that I heard from Judge Kavanaugh in our interview to dispel the  presumption that has been created by President Trump's litmus test that  a Justice Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe and protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions.   Judge Kavanaugh will, no doubt, refuse to answer these important  questions in the committee hearings as well. We are not going to get  clear answers. That is what judicial nominees have been taught to do.  Yet, given how he was chosen--in his coming from a preappointed list-- that makes, No. 1, his obfuscation even more troubling. No. 2, it makes  the need for documents all the more compelling.   Another area of examination this week should be of Judge Kavanaugh's  views on Executive power and accountability. During his time in the  White House, it seems that Judge Kavanaugh developed an adulation for  powers of the Presidency. He said that Presidents should not be subject  to investigations of criminal or civil wrongdoing while in office. He  said that a President can refuse to enforce any law that he deems  unconstitutional even if a court has ruled otherwise. In our meeting,  he refused to say that a President must comply with a duly issued  subpoena. Judge Kavanaugh also wrote that Presidents should be able to  hire and fire, at will, the heads of independent agencies. In Brett  Kavanaugh's jurisprudence, the Executive of the United States is nearer  a King than a coequal branch of government.   At a time when the President of the United States routinely tests the  bounds of powers of his office, at a time when the President disdains  and routinely disparages the rule of law, at a time when the President  has been named as a coconspirator in a Federal criminal case, Brett  Kavanaugh's views on Executive power are more than dangerous; they are  disqualifying.   This week, the Judiciary Committee has the task of scrutinizing  Kavanaugh. I would remind my colleagues there is no legal standard,  rule, or logic that prohibits nominees from answering questions that  don't involve immediate and specific cases that are or could become  before the Court. I would remind my colleagues that indications of  stare decisis and solemn promises to respect precedent have been called  before the committee before and generally have little bearing,  unfortunately, as to whether the nominee will abide by those principles  on the bench.   Only a few months ago, Judge Gorsuch reminded us of that with his  ruling in the Janus case, as Justice Roberts reminded us with his  ruling in Citizens United. Justices will overturn decades of well-worn  precedent if given the opportunity. The debate this week about the  future of the Supreme Court may get wonky and technical, but what is at  stake is not abstract. It is real; it is concrete for Americans whose  lives, health, happiness, and freedoms are on the line at the Supreme  Court. Closely divided decisions recently have meant that the  difference between the ability to marry the person you love or not, to  have your right to vote protected or not, to make personal choices  about your healthcare or not are all at stake. Stakes in this  nomination today could not be higher.   The need for openness and lack of secrecy is as high as it has ever  been. The responsibility of the Judiciary Committee this week is to  drill down and examine Judge Kavanaugh's views to the extent that he  will share them and to point out those areas in which he fails to be  forthcoming. The American people have a right to know who may become  the deciding vote on issues ranging from women's reproductive rights,  to civil rights, to labor rights, to voting rights, to LGBTQ rights,  and more. I believe the Judiciary Committee's proceedings this week  will reveal to the American people a nominee unfit for the job of  Associate Justice.   Mr. President, there is one more issue--that of President Trump's  unconscionable statement of politicizing the Justice Department.  Yesterday, the President made the following statement:         Two long-running, Obama era investigations of two very       popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well-      publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff       Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt       because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff. . . .    That is the President speaking. Yes, I think he spoke. He didn't  tweet.   For so long, President Trump's actions have suggested that he views  the Justice Department not as an independent law enforcement agency but  as a tool to prosecute his enemies and protect himself and his friends.  President Trump's statement yesterday comes right out and says it.  Trump is chastising the Attorney General of the United States for  enforcing the law--for announcing two indictments, backed up by ample  evidence, because it may hurt members of his political party from  winning elections. How outrageous is that?   So I say to President Trump: America is not some fiefdom in which the  lord of the manor gets to decide who the law applies to and who it  doesn't apply to. The beauty and the greatness of American democracy is  that we are all equal in the eyes of the law--Republicans, Democrats,  and, yes, even Presidents.   President Trump, you do not seem to understand or choose not to  understand the basic principles of the rule of law that have governed  our great Nation since its founding.   President Trump seems to think he is above the law, so it is no  wonder he selected Judge Kavanaugh--who believes sitting Presidents  should not be investigated--to sit on a potential jury on the Mueller  probe.   Again, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy. I might note that I  am very proud of the job the Senator from Rhode Island and all of his  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee did this morning.   I yield the floor
