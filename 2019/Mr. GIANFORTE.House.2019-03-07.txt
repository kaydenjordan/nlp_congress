 Madam Chair, we all agree that Americans should vote  and participate in our Republic. We all agree that every American's  vote deserves to be counted and protected. But the bill, the underlying  bill we consider today, is riddled with problems.   My friends across the aisle call this bill the For the People Act,  but it should really be called the ``Protect Professional Politicians  Act.''   One of the most egregious parts of this bill is the creation of  Federal funding for elections. Taxpayers will pay for politicians'  campaigns whether they agree with them or not. Under this bill, if  someone gives a politician $200, the Federal Government will send  $1,200 of money to that politician.   Those mailers that fill your mailbox, well, under the ``Protect the  Professional Politicians Act,'' you will pay for them.   Those attack ads that flood your TV, well, you will pay for them.   Those high-priced political consultants in Washington, D.C., well,  you will pay for them, too.   Since when is it a good idea to have taxpayers' hard-earned money  shoveled into a trough for a politician's campaign?   Montanans don't want that. At a recent townhall, 97 percent of  Montanans told me they oppose taxpayer funding for political campaigns.   Imagine Republicans and Democrats working together on a bipartisan  bill that addresses voting and election reforms. We could have done  that. We did that with election security in the last Congress.   But that is not what happened with H.R. 1, the ``Protect Professional  Politicians Act.'' Maybe that is one of the reasons why diverse groups  like the  [[Page H2531]]  Montana Chamber of Commerce and the ACLU have opposed this bill.   I join those groups, and I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1, the  Protect Professional Politicians Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
