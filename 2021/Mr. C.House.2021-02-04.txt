 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Lakeland Fire Chief Doug Riley for being named the 2020  Florida Fire Chief of the Year by the Florida Fire Chiefs' Association.   Riley was appointed as fire chief in December 2017. He has served  more than 30 years with the Lakeland Fire Department, holding just  about every position there during his tenure.   I was privileged to serve alongside Chief Riley as a Lakeland city  commissioner and as a fellow rotarian. I have seen firsthand his effort  to build better relationships with employees, staff, and the community.  Doug Riley continues to go above and beyond to strengthen the fire  department and its employees.   On behalf of the 15th District of Florida, congratulations to Chief  Doug Riley for earning this distinguished honor. The Lakeland community  thanks the chief for his efforts to protect and serve us every day.   Well done, Chief.                            ____________________
