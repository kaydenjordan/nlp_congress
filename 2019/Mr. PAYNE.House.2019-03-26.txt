 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional dentist,  Army Brigadier General Shan K. Bagby.   General Bagby is the first African American Army dentist to be  promoted to the rank of general. He is the first-ever African American  to serve as chief of the Army Dental Corps.   General Bagby was born in Newark, New Jersey. When he was 8 years  old, General Bagby went to the neighborhood health clinic and met an  African American dentist. That visit, more than 40 years ago, inspired  him to become a dentist himself.   When General Bagby graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood,  New Jersey, also in my district, he went to Rutgers University to study  physics.   Today, General Bagby is a rising star in the U.S. Army. He is an  inspiration to young people across the country who dream of becoming a  dentist.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Brigadier General Shan K.  Bagby for his service to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Garamendi for his  leadership and for bringing us together today on two very, very  important topics. I have come to know him as a leader on issues that  are impacting the American people, from California to New Jersey. The  gentleman has demonstrated a concern for all people of this country and  his constituents. For that, I am grateful.   Today, the second topic on the Democratic agenda for the people,  protecting preexisting conditions, is both timely and important.  Yesterday, the Trump administration unleashed another assault on the  Affordable Care Act. In Federal court, the Trump administration said  that it agrees with the lower court's decision to overturn the  Affordable Care Act.   After campaigning on the premise that he would work to improve  healthcare, President Trump wants to  [[Page H2821]]  eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions.   President Trump wants to end the provision that allows young people  to stay on their parents' health insurance plans.   President Trump wants to bring back junk insurance plans that take  people's money but refuse to cover their medical expenses. That is what  will happen if President Trump wins in Federal court.   It was not that long ago when Federal law allowed insurance companies  to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. Insurance  companies could charge people with preexisting conditions extremely  high rates and refuse to cover them at all. The Affordable Care Act  eliminated legalized discrimination against people with preexisting  conditions.                                time  1515    But now the Trump administration is fighting to bring healthcare  discrimination back.   Well, there is no going back.   More than 200,000 people in New Jersey, alone, who purchase their  insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace have preexisting  conditions. Nearly 5 million New Jerseyans who get insurance through  their employment could be harmed by Trump's attack on the Affordable  Care Act's protections for people with preexisting conditions.   New Jerseyans and all Americans deserve protection, not  discrimination.   In my district, 16,000 people, alone, with preexisting conditions  would be at risk of coverage loss or premium increases if the Trump  administration successfully rolls back the Affordable Care Act.   Now, let me touch on the effects of this on women for a second.   The Affordable Care Act's protection for people with preexisting  conditions prevents insurance companies from charging women a higher  premium on the basis of their being a woman. It keeps insurance  companies from charging women a higher premium on the basis of them  being a woman. Now, that is not something that they had very much of a  choice in at birth, so it is immoral to hold that against them.   What the Trump administration is trying to do would result in women  facing significantly higher health insurance premiums simply because  they are not men. That wasn't right before the Affordable Care Act, and  it sure isn't right now.   Let me be clear: The Trump administration wants to put lives at risk  by undermining people's access to healthcare in this Nation.   And let me be clear about this: I will keep fighting, along with the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), to ensure that all  Americans' healthcare is protected. That is the least we can do in the  position that our constituents have given us in this task to be their  voice in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to once again commend Mr. Garamendi for  always being timely in bringing these issues to light for the American  people and for all the country to see, that we here in the House of  Representatives do speak for them.
