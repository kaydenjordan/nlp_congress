 Mr. Speaker, the House will be leaving town today, heading  back to our States, heading back to our districts. Obviously, this will  be a week of thanksgiving and, obviously, I wish all of my colleagues  well and safe travel. We have much, of course, for which to be thankful  in this great country.   But there are great concerns that we face. Today, obviously, we had  the speech and the news about the future of Speaker Pelosi. The  outgoing Speaker has had a long career in this body, and I wish her  well. I wish her the best in the next chapter of her life.   Some are saying it is an end of an era; and I would say that it is  only an end of an era if we choose to make it so.   Speaker Pelosi ran this Chamber not terribly unlike her Republican  predecessors, and I don't necessarily mean that to be the right way to  do things; bills that are cooked up in small rooms among leadership  staff and Members of leadership; thousands of pages of legislation  dropped on Members at the 11th hour; key pieces of legislation that are  shuttled through committee without significant debate and then dropped  on the floor.   Sometimes we have what is called suspension votes, where we suspend  the rules and we have votes on the floor with no Members here to debate  it or discuss it; just take the word of the committees on which I don't  serve; amendments on the floor of this body restrained since May of  2016, under both parties' leadership.   Some people refer to this as a cartel. Some refer to it as the swamp.  What it is, regardless of branding, we know that it takes power away  from the legislators and, thereby, takes power away from the people who  sent their legislators here to represent them.   The only way we are going to make this the end of an era is if we  change the way we do things, and we should. I am saying this now that  there is a Republican majority about to take the gavel. I believe we  have to change the way this town works. I believe we have to change the  way this body works.   The reason that I introduced the Article I Act in the first Congress  that I served in this body, while President Trump was in office, to  reclaim power from the executive branch, to say that we must have a  voice in these ongoing emergency declarations, some of which date back  to the 1970s. The reason that I did that was because I believed it,  even though it would have taken power away from a Republican President.   I am wondering now if some of my Democratic colleagues will think,  well, maybe that is not a terrible idea if we look ahead. I don't know.   Here, in this Chamber, I am, as a Republican, calling on a  fundamental change in the way we do things here; how bills get to the  floor.   Most people might not understand that the default rules that would go  back to the Jefferson Manual and the basic rules of parliamentary  procedure would be that I have the right to be able to offer a bill;  and that then you would have the right to amend the bill here on the  floor of this body; this being the floor of the House of  Representatives.   But what the American people don't know is that every Congress we  come in and we vote on new rules, and we vote on rules that, then,  restrict the power of every Member of this body to be able to represent  their constituents.   We restrict the power of a Member to offer a bill, to bring that bill  to a vote, to have debate on that bill, to amend that bill here on the  floor of the House of Representatives. That is the way it works.   Then we even go further. Every week, we fly in and then we have votes  on rules, rules that are cooked up among 13 Members of the House of  Representatives who sit up in a committee up here, behind these walls,  and they vote a new rule, and send it down here; and then the body  votes on the rule that then structures debate for the week.   Then can I offer an amendment here on the floor? No. You know why?  Because people are afraid to vote.   Members of this body, sent to vote on legislation and to represent  their constituents, are afraid to vote. Can you imagine, in the  founding of this country, the establishment of this body, the people's  House, to go get reelected every two years, to go seek re-election,  that we are afraid to vote?   Do you know how many times if I bring up opening the process and  opening up the floor of the House, colleagues on my side of the aisle,  the other side of the aisle go, well, you know, don't you know that  means somebody could bring up a really tough vote.   Well, if you vote ``no'' on a whole lot of tough votes, like I tend  to do, you get kind of used to it, and you get used to what you have to  do, which is go explain to your constituents why there ain't no free  lunch.   This isn't the United States House of free stuff. You can't just keep  passing bills to spend money we don't have to buy off votes. You can't  keep voting for bills that have a nice title so that you don't have to  go back and explain why you voted, as I did, against burn pit  legislation for veterans who need support and help for burn pits. But  you vote against it because you don't need another $675 billion  mandatory spending item.   Yet, bipartisan support for a bill because nobody wants to go say no.  Nobody wants to go look in a veteran's eye and explain the hard reality  of what we need to do in this body.   Nobody wants to say no to a bill that says ALS research. Nobody wants  to say no to a bill that says something about helping animals or  helping old people or helping kids. You put a nice title on there, then  everybody has got to vote for. It doesn't matter which side of the  aisle you are on; you have got to vote for it because there is no  spending limit. There is no restraint. There is no responsibility.   There is no leadership. There is no check on unrestrained power of  the executive branch by this body because this body keeps funding the  very tyranny of the executive branch that many campaign against. That  is the truth.  [[Page H8580]]    My colleagues on this side of the aisle just went out and sought  election, where we took the House back. My colleagues on this side of  the aisle went out and campaigned against unrestrained Federal power in  the Federal Bureau of Investigation; a Department of Homeland Security  that refuses to secure the border of the United States; labeling of  parents as domestic terrorists.   They went out and campaigned against an energy policy of an  administration that is destroying American energy; driving the price of  gas up; driving the price of electricity up; destroying the grid of the  United States; making us more dependent on China, on Venezuela, on  Russia, on Saudi Arabia, on Iran.   It is absurd. We ran against all that stuff, but you know what? A  whole lot of my colleagues vote to fund all that stuff; have no problem  writing a big old check, both sides of the aisle.   You know why? Because they always have something they want that they  are willing to just sign off on a monster piece of legislation,  irrespective of the debt that is piling up around the ears of their  kids and their grandkids, the destruction of the American Dream that is  happening because of that, or the funding of the very bureaucrats that  are undermining the freedoms of the United States people every day.   Come to the floor. It has got a National Defense Authorization Act.  You come to the floor, and you have got something you must pass. We  have to pay for the pay raise for our troops. We must pay for some more  planes and bombers and helicopters and missiles.   Don't you know, Chip, that we have got to go stand up against China.  We have got to fund Ukraine. We have got to stand up against Putin.   Great. Let's have a debate on this floor about those things. If you  are talking about war, maybe we should declare it. If you think that  there is a proxy war with funding, maybe we should debate it on the  floor of this body.   Maybe you shouldn't just keep writing blank checks and never have a  debate about guns and butter. But that is what we do.   This is where I have got to have a little tough talk to my colleagues  on this side of the aisle. What, pray tell, have you heard out of  anybody on this side of the aisle that will change any of that?   Yesterday, we had all sorts of conference meetings, debates about our  internal workings. I tend to like to keep those meetings confidential  and private, but half my dadgum colleagues are tweeting that stuff out  in real time.   The fact of the matter is nothing changed. The status quo remains  because people want their power. They want their committee  chairmanships. They want their gavel. They want the ability to control  the power and the purse strings, but they don't want to look in the  mirror to fundamentally change a broken town, a broken House, a broken  body, a broken Federal Government that is stepping all over the dreams  and the hopes and the future and the prosperity of the American people.   There is not a remote indication that my colleagues on my side of the  aisle understand what time it is in America; understand what we are  facing. It is not just a campaign statement. It is not just something  to go rile up the American people to get elected; to get elected, to  get power, to get on a certain committee.   You know what every conversation that has been had in this body, at  least on my side of the aisle, since last Tuesday? Hey, what's going on  in the Steering Committee?   Hey, who is going to get Ways and Means?   Hey, who is going to get on what committee?   Hey, did the freshmen have their votes? Who is going to be the head  of the freshman class?   Hey, who is going to be the Speaker? Who is going to be the whip?   I don't know. Let's figure out what we are going to do; who is going  to have power. Who is going to have power; who is going to have power?   The answer is, anybody but the American people. The answer is,  anybody but the rank-and-file Members of this body.   The answer is the status quo. That is why people ran--that is why  President Trump, by the way, did well in 2016 running against the  swamp.   Say what you want about President Trump. He represented a large block  of this country that were sick and tired of this town, of this place,  of this body, of the people in this room, and it is high time we do  something about it.   Stop kissing each other's rear ends, asking and begging for some slot  on a committee. We didn't come here to be on committees. We didn't come  here to get a title.   The titles around this place, who is in leadership? Leadership. Isn't  leadership something you recognize and follow? It is not something you  elect.   I didn't come here for second place. I didn't come here--I don't  leave my family, I don't say goodbye to my son and my daughter and my  wife every Monday and fly up here and spend, 3, 4, 5 days up here and  fly back every week, just because I want to earn Southwest points.   I didn't fly up here because I want to sit in rooms and go have a  steak dinner and go talk to lobbyists about what needs to be put in a  bill.   I didn't come up here to say, well, we have got to make sure we get-- don't call them earmarks. No, don't call them earmarks. That is already  bad out there. So we are going to call them community-directed  spending. Okay, we will call them community-directed spending, the  currency of this town.   How are you going to take care--how are you going to get a bridge  back home? That is important. We have floods in Houston. We have floods  in Louisiana. They need flood money, right?   We have tornadoes in the Midwest. Well, we need some tornado money.   Well, how do you think you get people to vote for all these  appropriations bills that have left your country $32 trillion in debt?                                time  1530    By the way, 5 percent interest rates, do you know what is going to  happen? I am sorry, interest rates going up where they are at 5  percent, do you know what is going to happen to the interest payments?  It is going to be another $600 billion, $700 billion, $800 billion. You  pretty much just bought a whole second Department of Defense, ladies  and gentlemen, with money that you are printing.   How does that sound? Enjoy that, do you? And nobody here has any plan  on what to do about it except more of the same.   We will have a lot of speeches about, ``Chip, don't you understand?  Entitlements, mandatory spending, that is the problem. That is 70  percent of the whole thing.''   Well, as a technical matter, that is not incorrect, but we got here  because we refused to deal with it. And that is not an excuse to write  a blank check for discretionary spending.   Hey, we don't need to be responsible on discretionary spending  because the actual problem is the rest of the spending, even though  discretionary spending is still $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion, $1.8  trillion, $2 trillion, or is it $7 trillion? Does anybody know? Does  anybody care?   Hey, we shut down the whole country under COVID-19, but hell, we will  just write a $5 trillion check. Why not? That is what we do. We just  keep writing checks that we can't cash.   So, what are we going to do? What are Republicans going to do to  demonstrate that they get what time it is in America, that they get  that there is $32 trillion in debt, that they get that our borders are  wide open? That is not a political campaign speech; it is a reality.   Even Democrats who refuse to acknowledge that our border is wide open  are panicked over the title 42 ruling by a district judge because even  Democrats who want to ignore the 230,000 or 240,000 apprehensions in  October, the 70,000-something got-aways, the 27 dead migrants, they  ignore all that, but that 7,000 or 8,000 a day, they can just sort of  barely process that.   You get rid of title 42--which, by the way, there is no pandemic  reason for title 42 right now. It is literally a Band-Aid that  Democrats are using as an, oh, my God. If we actually opened up the  borders entirely, we can't deal with 17,000 a day. But that is the  truth. That is the reality.   What are my colleagues on this side of the aisle going to do about  it? ``Oh,  [[Page H8581]]  Chip. We will pass a bill in January. I don't know if it will be H.R.  1, H.R. 2, H.R. 5, but don't worry. We will pass a border security  bill.''   Well, one, I will believe that when I see it. We don't have a great  track record.   Two, so what? Are you going to pass that bill and walk over and  convince that great stalwart of defense of our border Mitt Romney that  he should vote for it? Are you going to convince any of the 12 who just  decided to redefine marriage and stomp all over religious liberty over  in the United States Senate? Are you going to convince any one of them  to vote for a strong border security bill? And even if you do, do you  think that Joe Biden is going to sign it?   The question for Republicans is: Are you willing to use the power of  the purse, articulated by our Founders in Federalist No. 58 and broadly  at our founding, to stop what is happening and the destruction of our  sovereignty with wide-open borders that are endangering migrants,  killing Texas, having fentanyl poured into our schools, or are you just  going to continue the fraud that is the United States House of  Representatives?   That is what it is. We don't represent anything at all when it comes  to the core values of the American people. We represent power. We  represent the quest for power.   Are we going to use the power of the purse to secure the border? Are  we going to deal with the National Defense Authorization Act that is  currently being negotiated and likely passed out of the United States  Senate and sent over to the House of Representatives?   Now, it is hard to hear the Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy, say that  he thinks maybe the NDAA ought to be pushed to the next Congress. I  agree with that. But then what? Then what?   Is the Senate going to pass the same thing right back over, an NDAA  that is chock-full of all sorts of non-truly defense-related matters?   Are we going to have an NDAA that is sent over to us that drafts our  daughters without so much as a single debate here on the floor about  what it means to actually add our daughters to Selective Service?   Are we going to have an NDAA and are we going to support an NDAA that  continues to advance vaccine mandates? How many of our men and women in  uniform need to be fired? Oh, don't worry, Chip. We took care of it. It  is not a dishonorable discharge. Oh, really. Well, thank you for that  grand leadership, GOP, because I am sure it really makes our men and  women in uniform feel all that much better when they are forced to  leave their service in the United States military with discharge--not  honorable, discharge.   I am sure that makes them feel great. I am sure they are sitting  around the table this coming Thursday after they got fired because they  refused to take a jab in the arm of a vaccine that Moderna and Pfizer  made over $100 billion on with all sorts of questions by legitimate,  mainline doctors about the efficacy of the vaccine.   In a hearing that we held just last week off the Hill, because my  Democratic colleagues won't hold a hearing on COVID on the Hill, where  all three doctors sat on the panel, we asked them: Is there any basis,  any reason, for our men and women in uniform to be required to take a  vaccine for COVID? The answer was no, no, no. Unequivocal no.   This doesn't do anything significant for transmission. This doesn't  do anything to truly help and protect young, healthy men and women who  are in the military. They are precisely the population who are the  least impacted by COVID.   Yet, here we are today, sitting here in real time while we adjourn  for Thanksgiving, and an NDAA is getting debated in the Senate to be  sent over here. What will Republicans do about that? I don't know. I  don't know.   Are we going to have hearings in this body on COVID itself, the  reaction and response to it, the power of government being used against  the American people? Are we going to have hearings about its origins,  hearings about NIH funding, hearings about mask policy, hearings about  what Fauci and Birx knew and when they knew it, hearings about the  efficacy of the vaccine, hearings about the side effects of the  vaccine, hearings about why only now some of our leadership of this  country is going out and saying: Oh, sorry. My bad.   I think it really was just kind of something bad for old people and  maybe we really didn't see that maybe we didn't need to freak out and  lock down our economy and kill our economy and send our kids to the  corners and mask them and shut down our schools and set them back a  generation in education. Our bad.   These are real people's lives. This is the greatest economy in the  history of the world, and you just shut it down. What in the world? Is  anybody on our side of the aisle going to do anything about that?   I haven't heard anything yet. I haven't seen anything yet. All I saw  today was a hearing, a press conference talking about Hunter Biden.   Well, that is great. But what are we going to do about Scott Smith,  who was targeted by the Department of Justice, the National School  Board Association?   What are we going to do about Anthony Fauci? What are we going to do  to make sure the American people know and fully understand the  collective power of the Federal Government being pointed at and used  against the American people?   Because it is happening--COVID tyranny, nurses and doctors forced out  of the workforce, the effort under OSHA to try to force employers to  mandate vaccines, the CDC regularly pushing Twitter, Google, and  Facebook to flag any dissenters who dared question the orthodoxy and  all that the powers that be said that they thought we must know.   How about the CDC purchasing $420,000 worth of Americans' location  data to monitor compliance with lockdowns? Is anybody bothered by that?  Is anybody bothered by the government looking at our information,  looking at phone records?   How about guns? The FBI secretly coerced Americans to sign forms to  voluntarily relinquish their rights to own, buy, or use firearms and  permanently register them in the NICS system.   In Delaware, the ATF showed up unannounced to a man's home without a  warrant for a surprise inspection. Under Biden, the ATF has revoked 500  percent more Federal firearms licenses.   How about DHS? Documents reveal DHS plans to target inaccurate  information on ``the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy  of the COVID-19 vaccines.'' Facebook created a special portal for DHS  and government partners to report disinformation directly.   How about the environment? A 77-year-old veteran was sentenced to 18  months in Federal prison and $130,000 in fines for digging ponds on his  Montana property in violation of the Clean Water Act.   The power of government is being used against the American people and  our citizens every day. I have heard lots of talk by my Republican  colleagues about oversight. Oversight doesn't do any good if you have a  handful of hearings and nobody in America knows what is going on.   That is why we should have a coordinated Church Committee-style  direct effort to bring together the entirety of the Federal  Government's assault on the well-being of the American people and bring  that to light to the American people and then specific changes to deal  with it.   But I am not sure how much confidence a lot of the American people  have that we are going to change anything because you have to actually  change something.   We have, immediately following the election, the recoronation of  Mitch McConnell in the Senate and the adoption of essentially the exact  same leadership team on this side of the aisle.   What is the first thing that happens in the votes? What do  Republicans do? In the Senate, 12 Senate Republicans voted for cloture  just yesterday to codify other than marriage between a man and a woman  and trample on the religious liberty rights of Americans to disagree.  That happened yesterday.   Mitt Romney, Utah, Trump won 58 percent of that vote in Utah; Cynthia  Lummis, Wyoming, a 70 percent Republican State; Shelley Moore Capito, a  69 percent Republican State; Todd  [[Page H8582]]  Young, a 57 percent Republican State; Roy Blunt, a 57 percent  Republican State; Joni Ernst, a 53 percent Republican State; Rob  Portman; Dan Sullivan; Lisa Murkowski; Richard Burr; Thom Tillis; Susan  Collins--Republicans walking away from religious liberty, walking away  from the definition of marriage. What better way to signal to the  American people and your Republican supporters and voters that you got  your personal thing pulled together and you are going to represent them  and change what we are doing in this town? Hard to believe the American  people are cynical. Hard to believe that.                                time  1545    Yesterday, we had a bunch of votes on rules and procedures in the  Republican Conference. It was a private meeting, despite the fact that  my colleagues love to leak it out. I don't like to get into what  specifically was done behind halfway closed doors, but I will just say  this: There wasn't an overall warm and fuzzy feeling about change.   Very little changed. In fact, one of the things that did change was  to just pull away from a 200-year-old precedent, dating back to  Jefferson's Manual, about vacating the chair. It is my belief that  sitting in the Speaker's chair, you would want to make very clear that  you are confident that vacating the chair would never be a problem.   Yet, Republicans circled the wagons yesterday. You know why? It is  about power. It is about the fear of losing power. It is about the fear  of change. It is about the fear of empowering the body to do its thing.  It is about the fear of open debate. It is about the fear of regular  order. It is about the fear of votes. It is about the fear of taking  tough votes.   I don't fear tough votes. But I will say something to my Republican  colleagues. Don't talk to me about change or what you think is changing  until you tell me about the process you are going to use to bring bills  to this floor. Because if I don't have the right to amend it, if I  don't have the right to represent my constituents, if I don't have the  right to have a voice and you are going to come down and whip me and  whip my colleagues to support a bill crammed down my throat by a Rules  Committee that I didn't vote for or select, if you are going to tell me  I have got to eat that vote, then that is not representative government  and that is not the way we should do things.   When you bring a bill to the floor of the House of Representatives  through the Rules Committee and it is told to us to be must passed-- National Defense Authorization Act, which by the way is not must pass,  but is always considered such. Appropriations bills--how many of my  colleagues went to the microphone yesterday saying continuing  resolutions are destroying our military; we need actual appropriations?  You know what? I do not disagree. But when you offer a rule change to  say, I tell you what, if our Senate colleagues will work with us to get  the defense bill passed, then maybe we can consider the other things.  They are saying: No, no, no, we don't want to bind our hands to the  Senate. But that sounds nice, doesn't it?   The truth is, what they don't want to do is give up the ability to do  what they always do, which is trying to jam through an omnibus spending  bill, with backroom deals cut in order to try to drive up defense  spending. I support our defense, I want them to be properly funded, but  I don't want them to get more blank checks.   When are we going to have a debate about guns and butter? When are we  going to stop spending money we don't have? When are we going to have  an honest conversation in this body?   Is it when we turn off those dadgum cameras? Is it when we decide to  actually offer amendments on the floor again?   You are not going to change anything if you keep doing the same  stuff. That is the truth.   Two days ago, I stood up and nominated my friend   Andy Biggs for  Speaker of the House as the nominee for the Republican Party. Andy did  not win that vote. He is my friend. My friend Kevin McCarthy won that  vote and earned over a majority of the Republican Conference. That news  has been reported.   Virtually everything that we did in that meeting or said in that  meeting was literally verbatim tweeted out in real time or leaked to  the press in real time. That is the truth.   I have a rule when reporters talk to me about what happened in a  meeting, that I tell them it is a private meeting, and I don't think I  should talk about it. But when things leak out in real time about what  is being said and what is being done, you at some point have to go  explain to the people you represent, to your supporters, and people  broadly, what you were doing. Because if you can't have a private  debate and a private conversation among family and it is going to be  made public, then you have got to go explain it.   So allow me to read the speech that I gave in the Republican  Conference meeting nominating my friend,   Andy Biggs. It went like  this:   I rise in support of my friend and colleague from Arizona to serve as  Speaker of the House.   Andy Biggs is a proven leader who has  demonstrated leadership here in D.C., as well as serving as president  of the Arizona State Senate in a slim two-seat majority. He is a  committed conservative and a good man.   Andy's candidacy is not an attack on Kevin, with whom a number of us  have been engaging and will continue to engage in good faith.   Andy's candidacy is about his courage to stand here today willing to  take arrows, the courage to offer a debate rather than a coronation;  the courage to say perhaps, just perhaps, we should consider changing  the way we do things in this broken Congress, in this broken town. A  town to which our constituents sent us specifically to change it.   While there are many factors impacting last Tuesday's elections, the  outcome is not so much murky as convicting.   Our voters, Republican voters, expected a reckoning, and in so doing,  they gave us nearly 5 million more Republican votes in congressional  elections than my Democratic colleagues.   Yes, redistricting can explain why we gained perhaps a smaller margin  than anticipated, but it is not enough. What did we run on?   In the 1990s, we ran specifically on crime and a bold agenda to  transform Congress. In 2010 and 2012, we ran specifically on cutting  spending.   Meanwhile, this year, bold conservative leadership outside of this  city was affirmed enthusiastically by voters. No one better represents  that than Governor Ron DeSantis' overwhelming dominance in Florida. But  we also saw Governor Lee in Tennessee, Governor Kemp in Georgia,  Governor Reynolds in Iowa, and Governor Abbott in Texas, and we saw our  old colleague Lee Zeldin's powerful run for Governor in New York where  he fell short but helped flip four seats, because Lee ran on something,  crime and the rule of law in New York.    DeSantis ran on something: Fighting COVID tyranny directly and  fighting woke-ism directly. Governor Abbott ran on something: Securing  the border ravaging Texas.   Meanwhile, in a midterm election against the most radical, leftist,  and dangerous White House in American history, we left the Senate in  Democrat hands, and we are looking at a three- to five-seat majority in  the House of Representatives.   So what do we do? I hear a lot about unity. Amen. But it has to be  real unity. If we just say we are unified, it will not do a thing if  the Rules Committee jams a disastrous immigration and border security  bill, like happened in July of 2018.   Or consider that, to the best of my knowledge, the House Freedom  Caucus, which represents about 20 percent of the body, has one member  of the Steering Committee, which has 30 people, one member of the 20  standing committee chairs, or respectfully, how about all the PAC money  that was spent around this town in favor of leadership-tapped  candidates, for example, Rodney Davis over Mary Miller, two incumbents.  That is why I give you that example.   But it is not about any one person or group. It is about empowerment  of the whole Republican Conference, not just a select few.   We say we are for limited government, we Republicans, but how do you  expect to decentralize the power of  [[Page H8583]]  Washington if we can't even decentralize our own leadership structure?   Our Republic is on the edge. Americans and their families are being  crushed by a weaponized government, radical wokeness, vaccine mandates,  open borders, crime, inflation. Yet voters don't understand how  Democrats, who have championed such destruction, still hold so much  power and largely avoided the reckoning that we talked about.   We talk a lot about accountability. I ask everyone in this room, how  can we hold them accountable if we cannot hold ourselves accountable  when we come up short?   Today's voting date--this being two days ago--is an arbitrary date,  rushed in an environment where many of our voters believe the system is  rigged against them.   A vote for Andy is a vote to shout ``stop'' and to stand to thwart  the status quo. It is a vote to pause and debate. It is a vote to  empower every one of us to have a say and to have the ability to use  our election certificate to its fullest. It is not a vote against  Kevin, but a vote to force us all to the table to figure out how--not  if--how we will come together as a party to reshape the Conference  rules; rethink the makeup of steering and the very structure and  operation of the Rules Committee; and most of all, to lay out a  specific agreed-to agenda and battle plan to which we can unite and to  inspire and win the minds and hearts of the American people.   Now, that is an internal debate among Republicans. I think it is  healthy. I think it is good. The question will be: Will Republicans  stand for change, or will Republicans stand up for the continuation of  the status quo?   The status quo ain't working. It is not. That is an indictment of  both parties. That is an indictment of this institution. It is an  indictment of this town.   We come here called to represent the American people. We come here  called to engage in debate and discourse.   As I have said before on this floor, how often have you seen a  legitimate and robust debate on this floor?   I would ask all the staff who sit in the room to answer, but that is  not appropriate. They are the ones sitting here all the time, along  with a handful of C-SPAN viewers.   Everybody knows, most of the time, we are preaching to an empty  Chamber. Most of the time, if there are a lot of people on the floor,  it is only for votes and a lot of back slapping and a lot of ``Hey,  when is our dinner tonight?'' and a lot of ``Hey, what are we going to  do tomorrow? When are you leaving town? How fast can we leave town? How  quickly can we get to the airport? Chip, don't demand another vote,  dang it. I have got to get to my tee time back home.''   Yeah, but when was the last time you saw a rigorous debate? Yeah,  okay, I know we sometimes have the majority leader and the whip go back  and forth on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday for an hour. But it is  all talking points, it is all posturing, it is all back and forth to  say, let's go out on the steps and give our speeches.   When was the last time you had--let's sit here for 3 hours and let's  debate Ukraine. All of us, let's carve out time, how about 5 days?  Let's debate Ukraine. We have given them $70 billion, and now the  administration is asking for $37 billion more.   Any of y'all got $107 billion sitting around? Well, guess what,  neither do we. We are just going to print more money. We are just going  to print more money, send it to Ukraine, allegedly for a helpful goal  of trying to help Zelenskyy stand up against Putin.   Where is all that money going? Is any of that money going into the  hands of certain companies who are then turning around and sending it  to certain politicians here? Certain stories seem to indicate so.   Any of that money going to oligarchs in Ukraine? Any of that money  getting into the hands of China? A lot of stories about all of that.   I am not even talking about accountability yet. I am just saying that  if we are going to vote on another $37 billion for Ukraine, shouldn't  we debate it? Are we at war, or aren't we? Do we have advisers there or  not? Is it in our national security or not? Is it helping stability  around the globe or not? Is it actually good for the people of Ukraine,  bad for Putin's power?                                time  1600    And there is a lot of good debates around all that. The answer might  be ``yes'' to some of those, ``no'' to some of those. I will just throw  it out there. Has anybody seen a debate like that on the floor of the  United States House of Representatives? I have not. And I am here. A  few people have come down and given speeches. That is not the same  thing. That is not the same thing as an actual debate.   The American people expect us to do our job. I expect and believe  that Republicans will end the absurdity of a closed-down Capitol; the  absurdity of magnetometers to go onto the floor of the House; the  absurdity of proxy voting, proxy voting extended by the current Speaker  until December 25th, when Santa Claus is going to bring home the magic  day when COVID disappears. Obviously absurd.   Our goal and our intent is to open up this body and to restore the  people's House. That has to be our goal. That has to be our mission.  Our mission as Republicans cannot be power for the sake of it. I would  ask or suggest to my Democratic colleagues that their mission should  not be opposition just for the sake of it.   I am proud that I have one of the higher voting records against my  own party than most of the people in my party. I believe that is  attached to some amount of consistency and not attached to the whip or  attached to the party power structure. It doesn't mean I am right. I  mean, I think I am. But what it means is that I have got some guiding  principles that I think ought to guide how I vote. And it shouldn't be  just because we are in shirts and skins or, you know, red shirts-green  shirts, blue shirts-red shirts. It shouldn't be that way.   We should be able to be united on taking power back from the  executive branch and restoring it to Congress.   We should be united on sovereignty of our Nation and defense of our  borders to ensure that cartels don't exploit them for human tragedy,  sex trafficking, fentanyl pouring in and killing American people.   We should be united on a strong national defense used sparingly but  forcefully, not entangled in never-ending battles, and not blank checks  to countries representing proxy wars.   We should be united in trying to figure out how to solve our fiscal  crisis that is killing our country.   Every one of us should wake up, we should literally not be going home  right now. We shouldn't even go home for Thanksgiving. It is so bad and  such a crisis; we should not leave here until we have a plan to stop  spending money we don't have.   I will go ahead and say it right here, everything should be on the  table. But we won't do that because if somebody brings up mandatory  spending, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will run ads  like they did against Paul Ryan saying, you are pushing granny off the  cliff if you dare say something about Social Security or Medicare. You  mean to say there is not a single dollar that we can save out of that  without it being pushing granny off the cliff?   On my side of the aisle, they will not touch defense spending. If you  do, it is sacrilegious. You cannot touch defense spending. Chip, we  need more. It doesn't matter what we are going to do with that. We need  more. You mean, there is not a single dollar we can't save at the  Department of Defense? There is not a single dollar we can't repurpose?  There is no way to make that run more efficiently, more effectively to  have a strong military force that will kill bad guys and blow things up  when necessary? I think we can do that. We should be united in that.   You can't keep spending money you don't have. You can't have open  borders and a lack of sovereignty. You can't. If we can't unite on  that, what in the world are we going to unite on?   This body is supposed to, even in our disagreement, stand athwart the  executive branch extending beyond the powers given it in the  Constitution. It is supposed to. Yet we routinely give the executive  branch open-ended, long runways of power. And we both do it. And we  know we do it. Why shouldn't we unite to restrain the executive branch  if you actually believe in separation of powers?   I will say right here and stipulate, I don't care who is in the White  House. I  [[Page H8584]]  don't want the President and the executive branch to have unlimited  power. I introduced a bill under Trump. I will introduce that bill, and  I have reintroduced it under Biden. I will introduce it again in  January of 2025 if I am here, no matter who the President is.   We have got the American people right now trying to figure out what  they are going to pass down to their kids and grandkids. I have got  staff, 25, 27, 28, 30 years old saying, am I going to be able to buy a  house? Literally. Look around the country. Pulling it up on maps,  saying, how am I going to afford this? How do I afford a half million  dollar house with 7, 8 percent interest rates? All the families across  the country are trying to figure that out.   They are trying to figure out why they are increasingly concerned  about their safety and well-being.   They are trying to figure out why kids in their schools are dying  from fentanyl.   They are trying to figure out why we can't just agree that there are  men and there are women, and we can acknowledge that we can build our  society around that without that being hate.   These are fundamental truths, fundamental elements of our society and  how we organize ourselves. We have got to find a way as a body, on both  sides of the aisle, to bring back common sense, normalcy, and in this  Chamber regular order. Or nothing will ever change.   I am strongly of the belief that we must change. I have tried to work  with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I have introduced  legislation on a bipartisan basis. I have passed legislation on a  bipartisan basis despite being, I think by any objective measure, on  the more conservative end of the spectrum of this body.   I don't care whether there's a D or an R after your name, I am going  to tell you what I think, and that is directed at my colleagues on my  side of the aisle, running around back-slapping about getting the  majority. The majority and having the majority is absolutely useless if  we are unwilling to change. We have to change the way we do things  around here.    We have to empower Members of this body to have a say in what is  brought to the floor, to have a say to amend the legislation, a say in  open and real and true debate that is driven by a desire to lead this  country forward on the most basic of terms.   Open up the Constitution. Look at the powers granted in Article I,  Section 8. Ask yourself whether what we are doing is connected to those  powers, and then ask yourself if we are not a stronger, freer, better  society if we can agree to disagree and push decisionmaking as close to  the people and families and communities and local and State leaders so  that we can actually have a Republic united around ideals and not at  each other's throats because that is what we are, because we are trying  to make decisions in this town for everybody. And that is both sides of  the aisle.   Federalism is not just some quaint word you talk about. It is  actually central to the health of this Republic. We cannot function if  we can't agree to disagree, and you can only agree to disagree if you  are not trying to solve every problem for every person and every family  in every walk of life in this Chamber doing everything and actually  accomplishing nothing.   The beauty and the structure of this Republic and its founding is in  the diffusion of power away from any one person, any one entity, the  diffusion of power across three branches of government, the diffusion  of power among Federal, State, and local government. That is the  greatness of this country.   It is the essence of the great American experiment, that we trust the  people, that we allow the people to prosper according to their own  work, that we help each other, that civil society matters.   But we fundamentally broke not just this institution, we are breaking  our country because we believe that an unlimited checkbook gives us the  right to buy votes with it. And by doing it, you are breaking the  spirit of the country. You are taking away the value of work. You are  taking away the value of responsibility.   It is not just a campaign effort to buy student votes by paying off  student loans so you can be nice. You just destroyed the entire ethic  of responsibility of a woman like my wife, the daughter of a single mom  who went to college, made decisions about what college she would go to  based on the cost of that tuition, who took on loans, who then took  every step to pay them back, who drove a crappy little car in order to  pay her loans off. What do you say to her and every other American like  her who did it the right way? You just say, Here you go, we are going  to pay off your student loans.   That is just one example of thousands, and my side of the aisle is  just as guilty. Another blank check to solve something, a disease or an  illness, another blank check because Ukraine, another blank check  because you don't dare look a farmer in the eye when the farm bill  comes up and say, look, man, I am sorry, but farm plus SNAP equals a  whole lot of debt, and we can't keep writing a blank check.   How about another blank check for subsidies for unreliable energy?  Here you go. Here is another check to buy off another company to  destroy our grid, destroy our way of life, destroy American energy  through a blank check.   We are literally destroying the soul of the country every day we walk  into this Chamber, and that is not a good legacy. Everybody just walks  around acting like, well, one day the think tanks and the world will  come together, we will solve all the mandatory spending problems. That  is the real deal. Stop writing blank checks. Actually have the  responsibility to do your job.   I am optimistic about the American people and always have been, and  there is a large bloc of the American people who are not going to just  walk away from the Republic that they inherited from their parents and  grandparents and those that fought, bled, and died for this country.  They are not going to walk away from the American Dream for their kids  and grandkids. But this body, every day that we meet, we make it harder  for them.   Why don't we stop that? Why don't we agree together to sit down and  do the hard work that is required of us to do it the right way? To  spend within our means? To follow the constitutional order? To limit  our affairs to the consequential things that unite our Republic rather  than meddling in the affairs of every American and every State and  every local government? Why can we not sit down and agree to disagree  and push decisions of disagreement down to the people, where they  belong, and do our basic duty step by step. That is our calling. That  is our opportunity. When you have a change of power and a change of  leadership, it is our duty to follow the constitutional order. It is  our duty to do it the right way. It is our duty to use the powers  granted in the people's House to stand up in defense of the people who  send us here to represent them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
