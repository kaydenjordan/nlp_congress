 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today to support  Representative Boebert's request for this to be referred to the  Committee on Homeland Security with regard to the dereliction of duty  under this administration and this President's policies.   As a United States Army combat veteran, I have fought abroad for the  majority of my adult life. I have spent over 7 years of my life in  Iraq, over 3 years of my life in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Pakistan, and  northern Somalia. I have been blown up twice, and I am a Bronze Star  recipient.   I went overseas for the purpose of protecting this Nation and  ensuring that terrorists do not have the ability to come to threaten  our lives and threaten our children, but under the failed policies of  this President just this last year, in the last 7 months, we have had  over 96 people who are on the known terrorist watch list who have  crossed our borders.   I would love to know from this President and from everyone else here:  Why did my brothers go and die in the thousands? Why did we waste 20- plus years of our lives fighting terrorism? Why did we go ahead and  botch the Afghan withdrawal and leave our allies behind if we were just  going to open our borders anyway to them?   Tell me why it was that we were going to vote to fight in these wars  to protect this Nation when this President and his failed policies were  going to do nothing but open up our borders to the terrorists who are  coming across daily.   We will see another 9/11-type attack if we continue this type of  unsafe policy and do not get ahold of this right now.
