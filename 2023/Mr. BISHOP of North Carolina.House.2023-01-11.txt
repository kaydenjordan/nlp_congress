 Madam Speaker, attacks on churches and  pro-life pregnancy centers are unconscionable and un-American.   Thugs elevate their extreme political ideology over the most basic  gift from God: Life. This phenomenon is fed from here.   We all recall Senator Schumer's threat to Supreme Court Justices that  they ``will pay the price.'' Now we see the price: firebombing pro-life  pregnancy centers and assassination attempts.  [[Page H175]]    In my own State there is rhetoric amid the broken windows, red paint,  and anarchist symbols. ``If abortions aren't safe, neither are you.''  That sentence is repeated over and over across this country. That is a  threat. This is the death cult's echo of the KKK's burning cross on the  lawn; brazen, violent intimidation. The Federal Government responded to  the KKK.   Where is the Biden Justice Department amid this violent campaign of  national scope?   Mr. President, it is time for action. Do your duty.
