 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment. I would like to thank  my good friend, Congressman Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, for helping  me to introduce this amendment.   Right now what is being taught in classes doesn't necessarily align  with what is needed to get a job. Yesterday, the House passed a  bipartisan bill unanimously that would make sure that there is stronger  alignment and collaboration between career and technical education  programs and the employers that will be hiring.   Our amendment would require that States report the percentage of  subsidized individuals whose jobs match their previous experience.  Incentivizing States that opt into this pilot program expands on  yesterday's bill to ensure that resources are being used as efficiently  as possible by guiding students towards the jobs they were trained for.   Mr. Chairman, I hope everybody will support passage of our amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support.   I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
