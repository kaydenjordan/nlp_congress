 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Naval  Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head, MD. They were recognized as a  winner in the 2022 Federal Laboratory Consortium National Awards  Program, also known as the FLC. The FLC Awards Program annually  recognizes Federal laboratories and their industry partners for  outstanding technology transfer achievements.   The Excellence in Technology Transfer Award recognizes employees of  FLC member laboratories and non-laboratory staff who have accomplished  outstanding work in the process of transferring federally developed  technology.   Indian Head received the award for its efforts in developing Silent  Spring, a technology that desensitizes homemade explosives or HMEs.  HMEs are extremely sensitive and unpredictable; a stray spark, a change  in temperature, exposure to sunlight, or even an accidental bump can  set them off.   Silent Spring shields volatile explosive materials from these  potential triggers. This allows explosive ordnance disposal and law  enforcement personnel to more safely move the explosive materials,  while preserving forensic evidence and minimizing damage to existing  infrastructure.   Silent Spring is now available commercially and is approved within  the Department of Defense to address the highest priority EOD threats.  The partnership has already provided hundreds of product units to  Department of Defense explosive ordinance disposal users for  demonstration and training and will soon do the same for the civilian  public safety and law enforcement communities.   ``This collaboration is one of many we have across the command that  deliver innovative technologies to the warfighter,'' said NSWC IHD  commanding officer Capt. Eric Correll. ``The faster we can get new  innovative products to our warfighters and our first responder  partners, the better.''   This emphasizes the need to invest in energetics experts. The need  for this experience is more apparent than ever. As foreign threats  emerge, the bright minds at Indian Head have been able to meet and  exceed these threats.   Indian Head does not just explore the detection of explosive devices.  They also look at ways to enhance the United States' capabilities to  deter foreign aggressors.   Indian Head is a premier facility that has developed ejection seats  for our pilots and have developed materials that ensure that our  military has the best and sharpest tools to deter our adversaries and  keep the people of this country safe.   Indian Head is an unsung hero that has tirelessly worked to ensure  our national security and has humbly provided to this country for over  a hundred years. We must recognize the importance of energetics  research in this country. Other countries are recognizing this, and we  cannot ignore this.   We need to continue to invest in this research and development, these  are vital capabilities that keep our aggressors at bay.   I want to recognize and thank Indian Head for all of their  contributions to the security of our country and for this great  achievement.                            ____________________
