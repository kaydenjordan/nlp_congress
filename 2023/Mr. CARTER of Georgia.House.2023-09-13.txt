 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  James ``Jimmy'' Shaw who passed away on May 6, 2023, at the age of 66.   Jimmy was a resident of Brunswick where he spent his entire life. He  was a hardworking man who, at the age of 22, started the process of  acquiring his father's business, Central Hardware, that celebrated its  75th anniversary in July. Jimmy was an advocate for the Norwich Street  Corridor and a respected business leader in downtown Brunswick.   Mr. Shaw's legacy will live on through his family, who Jimmy passed  Central Hardware down to, just as his father did to him.   I know his children will do him proud by keeping Central Hardware a  successful business serving the Brunswick community.   Jimmy was a great person. He will be remembered by his family but  also the community that he had such a positive impact on.                      REMEMBERING JOHNNY GREGORY PICKREN     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Johnny Gregory Pickren who passed away on July 8, 2023, at the age of  71.   Johnny, also known as ``Greg,'' was a resident of Georgia his whole  life. He was born in Douglas but moved around to other parts of Georgia  such as Darien and Atlanta.   Greg's strong passion for music led him to pursue higher education in  broadcast journalism, which he worked in for many years before changing  paths to become an emergency medical technician in south Georgia.   Later, Greg joined the Glynn County Fire Department as a firefighter  and EMT where he served the citizens of Glynn County for 28 years  before retiring as deputy chief.   Greg served his community well. He dedicated his life to saving the  lives of others, and his life of service should serve as an example for  all of us to follow.                        RECOGNIZING COACH CARL CARTER     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Coach  Carl Carter for 40 years of teaching and giving back to his alma mater,  Savannah Christian Preparatory School.   Carl graduated from Savannah Christian in 1974 and then went on to  play football and baseball at Newberry College in South Carolina.   In 1983, he began coaching the Raiders baseball team and took over  the helm in the 1989 season. Over his 35-year plus career coaching the  Raiders, Carl won over 600 games, including the 2017 Georgia State  championship.   In 2017, he was also inducted into the Greater Savannah Athletic Hall  of Fame and the Georgia Dugout Club Hall of Fame.   He retired from coaching but did not stop impacting the students of  Savannah Christian as a teacher. After his retirement from coaching,  Savannah Christian renamed their baseball field the Carl Carter Field.   Carl's favorite Bible verse is John 3:16, and he tries his best to  inspire his students to live a good and Godly life.   I am proud to recognize Coach Carter for his 40 years of service to  the families in Savannah and continue to wish him the best for the next  40 years.                        REMEMBERING JERRY WILLIS KEITH     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Jerry Willis Keith. Jerry was born on March 28, 1937, in Waycross to  Warren Lott Keith and Mary Emma Corbett Keith.   He was a lifelong member of the First Baptist Church of Jesup and a  member of the Golden Rulers Sunday school class.   He spent his adult life managing and operating retail grocery stores  for several national food chains. There, he was always praised by many  loyal employees as the best boss they ever had.   He was a very active member of many community organizations including  the Elks Club, the Pine Forest Men's Golf Association, a Jaycee Member,  and an elite member of the Pond House crew.   He was a loving husband, a caring father of 7, a doting grandfather  of 15, and a great-grandfather of 6.   Mr. Keith's legacy will live on in the positive impact that he had on  his community, and I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.                            ____________________
