 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the weekend, the small town of  Cleveland, TX--more or less in East Texas; east at least of Conroe and  the Houston area--they experienced a shocking crime. We are still  learning more details about the perpetrator and exactly what happened  that led to such horrific bloodshed, but here is what we know right  now.   Late on Friday night, 38-year-old Francisco Oropesa was firing his  gun in his front yard in this rural part of the State. His neighbor  came over and asked him to stop, respectfully, because it was just  about midnight and the neighbor explained he had an infant at home who  was trying to get some sleep. He asked that Oropesa shoot farther away  from the home, hoping to minimize the disturbance to his 1-month-old  son. Oropesa refused. He said he could do anything he wanted on his  property and continued shooting.   The neighbors did what anyone else would do under the circumstances:  They called law enforcement. They called the police. The gunshots  continued, so the neighbors called the police again, eventually calling  five times.   Before police could arrive, Oropesa stormed his neighbor's home with  a gun and began firing, and he killed five people before fleeing. He  remains at large. All of the victims found inside the home were killed  in what law enforcement has described as execution-style shooting.   The first victim was 25-year-old Sonia Argentina Guzman, a mother of  three. Sonia's husband Wilson had been the one to go to the door and  ask that the shooting stop so their 1-month-old son could get some  sleep. While Sonia's husband, infant son, and 2-year-old daughter  survived the shooting, her eldest son did not. At just 9 years old, her  son, Daniel Enrique Lazo Guzman, was also murdered by Oropesa. The  other victims were family friends who had been at their home that  evening. This includes 21-year-old Diana Velasquez Alvarado, 31-year- old Julisa Molina Rivera, and 18-year-old Jose Jonathan Casarez.   I can't imagine the shock and grief these families are experiencing  today. What they thought was just a normal Friday night surrounded by  family and friends turned into a life-shattering day because of the  actions of this criminal. My prayers are with these families as they  search for peace, healing, and justice.   In the wake of this tragedy, Governor Abbott's office announced that  the suspect had been in the United States illegally and had been  previously deported four times. He never should have been in the United  States in the first place.   As devastating and unimaginable as this story is, it is not entirely  unique. I remember the murder of Kate Steinle in 2015. She and her  father were walking alongside a pier in San Francisco when she was shot  and killed. The man who killed her was an illegal immigrant who had  been deported not once, not twice, but five times. He had seven felony  convictions.   I want to be abundantly clear about one point: The actions of these  criminals do not and should not reflect on the tens of millions of law- abiding immigrants in this country. Any attempt to frame immigrants in  general as a threat to our country is completely devoid of facts and  detached from reality.   But my point in sharing these stories is to prove that there are  devastating  [[Page S1433]]  consequences when the Biden administration simply refuses to enforce  the law both at and inside of our borders.   Since President Biden took office, now about 2\1/2\ years ago,  Customs and Border Protection has logged more than 5 million border  crossings--an unprecedented number. Most of these individuals probably  came to the United States for economic reasons, which, as we know, does  not in and of itself qualify them for asylum. Some are probably  escaping persecution, which will likely qualify them for asylum under  the U.S. law. Some--although certainly another small percentage--are  dangerous criminals who have been convicted of serious crimes.    Since October, Border Patrol has arrested more than 5,000 convicted  criminals at the border who have been convicted of everything from  burglary and assault to drug trafficking and murder. The big caveat to  remember is, these are just the ones we know about. When thousands of  migrants illegally cross the southern border every day, it completely  overwhelms our border patrol and law enforcement authorities.   Law enforcement is pulled from the frontlines to help feed and care  for these migrants, including unaccompanied children, creating a  veritable gateway for dangerous criminals and drugs to make their way  into the United States undetected.   Earlier this year, Border Patrol told news outlets that 1.2 million  migrants had evaded law enforcement since President Biden took office.  In other words, we know how many law enforcement encountered, but the  so-called ``got-aways''--1.2 million of them--we have no inkling what  they are up to, whether they are economic migrants simply looking for a  better life. My guess is, probably not. My guess is that they were  probably either convicted criminals who knew they would not be allowed  into the United States or they were people who were transiting the  United States, carrying drugs into the interior.   These ``got-aways''--that number is not just one pulled out of thin  air. These individuals are detected by cameras, sensors, or other forms  of surveillance but never arrested or processed by Border Patrol  because they are simply overwhelmed. These are the ones who are running  away from the Border Patrol instead of turning themselves in to claim  asylum, like the majority of immigrants.   I have no idea where these 1.2 million people are or what they are  doing, but neither does President Biden; neither does Customs and  Border Protection; neither do any of our law enforcement Agencies know  where these 1.2 million migrants are or what they are doing. Maybe,  just maybe--I would say in all likelihood--inside of that number, some  subset are probably murderers, rapists, child abusers with lengthy rap  sheets. Maybe they are cartel members smuggling fentanyl and other  dangerous drugs into our communities. Maybe they are members of  criminal gangs like MS-13 or other transnational gangs.   The truth is, President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas, as Secretary of  Homeland Security, have no idea who or what is coming across our border  every day.   When title 42, which, as we all know, is the public health title that  has been used to expel some migrants during the pendency of the  pandemic--when it expires next Thursday, the number of migrants coming  across the border every day will soar, making it even easier for  criminals and gang members to sneak into the United States, along with  the drugs that have taken too many lives in recent years.   One hundred and eight thousand Americans died of drug overdoses last  year, 71,000 from fentanyl. All that comes across the border. We know  where it is coming from, but President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas  have done too little to stop it. In fact, their policies have  encouraged more and more people to come.   Law enforcement depends in part on deterrence, people knowing that  ``If I try, I am unlikely to be successful, so I am not going to try in  the first place.'' That is how law enforcement manages their business.  But when people see no likelihood of negative consequences, they are  going to keep coming, and we understand exactly why. Unfortunately,  this allows dangerous individuals into the United States, and the odds  of them being arrested and removed by the Biden administration are  extremely low.   So this is a problem not only at the border, this is a problem once  these individuals make their way inside the United States.   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, is  charged with removing individuals who are illegally present in the  United States.   In fiscal year 2020, the Agency deported just over 100,000  individuals. That is fiscal year 2020. For context, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection logged 458,000 border crossings during that period.   Once President Biden took office and the welcome mat came out and  people knew that our borders essentially were open, things have changed  dramatically. In fiscal year 2022, the number of deportations fell to  just over 38,000--from 100,000 in 2020 to 38,000 in 2022--while the  number of border encounters has skyrocketed. Customs and Border  Protection logged nearly 2.4 million border crossings that year.   So day after day, the Biden administration is allowing more and more  migrants to enter the United States illegally, despite the fact that  the vast majority of these individuals have no legal basis to stay, but  they are depending on their system being overwhelmed and so are the  people who are getting rich, getting paid by the head to smuggle those  individuals into the United States.   But at the same time, the administration is doing less and less to  actually enforce the law and remove those who have been found to have  no credible claim to remain in the United States. The Biden  administration simply refuses to enforce America's immigration laws,  and its policies have real and deadly consequences.   It is dangerous for the migrants to make the long trip from their  home in the hands of cartels who care nothing for them. They don't care  about people. They just care about the money and the drugs. As a  consequence, many migrants are hurt and abused and extorted by the  cartels and coyotes en route. Many girls and women are sexually  assaulted in astonishingly large numbers.   It is hurtful to law enforcement who are overworked, unappreciated,  and burnt out. These policies hurt the border communities like the ones  I represent that are expected to shoulder the massive weight of this  humanitarian crisis because the Federal Government and the Biden  administration refuses to do its job. It hurts small towns, medium- sized towns, and large towns all across America that have been  infiltrated by fentanyl and other deadly drugs. And as we saw again  this weekend, the administration's policies victimize people who are  attacked by dangerous individuals who never should have been in the  United States in the first place.   How much pain and suffering will our country have to endure before  the Biden administration takes this seriously? It is past time to  secure the border, enforce our immigration laws, and prioritize the  safety and security of the American people. Until then, I am sad to  say, innocent people will continue to suffer due to the  administration's failed policies.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
