 Mr. President, anyone who follows the situation in  Honduras, as I and many Vermonters do, cannot help but be disappointed  and concerned by what is happening there. I won't take the time to  discuss in detail the lengthy litany of circumstances that have  resulted in the deep social and political divisions, the rampant  corruption, violence and insecurity, the prevalence of threats and  assassinations by gangs, the dysfunctional justice system, and the  sense of desperation and hopelessness that so many Hondurans are  feeling, but I do want to mention several that should concern every  Senator.   To put the situation there in perspective, it is important to keep in  mind what is happening in our own country.   For purely political reasons, President Trump has directed his wrath  and contempt on the thousands of Central American migrants seeking  entry to the United States, many of whom are women and children and  many of whom are from Honduras. Regrettably, his xenophobic attacks  have encouraged other extreme voices demonizing migrants and asylum  seekers. They have apparently forgotten that America is fundamentally a  nation of immigrants.   There is no question that our government is woefully unprepared to  humanely and expeditiously handle this influx and that there is a  humanitarian crisis at our southern border. We are each aware of the  appalling treatment to which many of these desperate migrants have been  subjected, both during the harrowing journey from their home countries  to the U.S. border and in our government's custody--human beings  trafficked, robbed, and sexually abused by unscrupulous smugglers;  defenseless, impoverished people crammed into grossly overcrowded  detention facilities; frightened children forcibly separated from their  families and sleeping on cement floors in wire cages; a backlog of  hundreds of thousands of asylum applications; and if that were not  enough, racist and disparaging Facebook posts by U.S. Border Patrol  officers about the people in their custody.   This, not the Statue of Liberty, is what awaits the Hondurans who  have abandoned their impoverished, violence-ridden communities in  search of safety and a better life for themselves and their children.  Yet they continue to come because remaining in Central America is a  worse option.   While the White House justifies its mistreatment of Central American  migrants by falsely labeling them all as criminals who have engaged in  asylum fraud, it has rightly asked Congress for millions of dollars to  help care for refugees from Venezuela who are fleeing economic  collapse, violence, and political chaos in that country. The  similarities of the factors that are motivating the exodus of Hondurans  and Venezuelans are far greater than their differences, which  illustrates the blatant hypocrisy and unfairness of the  administration's incoherent policies.   Honduras has been in a state of convulsion since the coup that ousted  President Manuel Zelaya in 2009 and  [[Page S5304]]  the 2013 election that was plagued with vote buying, violence, and  fraud and that ended with President Hernandez declared the winner. The  situation was exacerbated by the 2017 election that was widely regarded  as flawed before it even took place. After President Hernandez secured  the support of the National Assembly, the electoral commission, and the  Supreme Court, each of which was beholden to him, to change the  Constitution so he could run for a second term, the election was marred  by reports of egregious vote counting irregularities.   Given these circumstances, after being sworn into office a second  time, President Hernandez would have been wise to appoint a  politically, ethnically, and geographically diverse cabinet and to  promote policies designed to rebuild confidence and trust with the  opposition and civil society. Instead, he and his government have often  embraced policies and practices that have further deepened divisions in  an already polarized society.   Popular protests over election fraud, corruption, land disputes, and  seemingly intractable poverty have been met with the indiscriminate use  of live ammunition by the police and armed forces resulting in multiple  deaths, arbitrary arrests, beatings, and prolonged detention without  trial. Despite repeated appeals by the international community,  including the United Nations and the U.S. Embassy, to the Honduran  Government to respect the rule of law and use restraint against  protesters, the situation has not improved, and those responsible have  not been held accountable. The country is afflicted by near daily  confrontations, and the number of people seeking refuge outside the  country continues unabated.   Many of us also remember the emblematic case of Berta Caceres, a  courageous indigenous environmental activist who was repeatedly  harassed and threatened and ultimately assassinated for opposing the  illegal construction of a hydroelectric plant. After the police tried  to cover up the crime, it was only thanks to international outrage that  seven individuals, including an employee of the DESA hydroelectric  company, a former security chief for the company who was an ex-U.S.- trained army lieutenant, another U.S.-trained special forces major, and  a former special forces sergeant, were arrested and convicted. Yet more  than 3 years after that horrific crime, none of them has been  sentenced. The prosecution of an eighth individual, David Castillo, the  former DESA president who was also a U.S.-trained former military  intelligence officer, has been stalled for months. It is also widely  believed that there are other coconspirators who have not been charged.  Scores of similar assassinations of social activists and independent  journalists in the past 10 years have never even been investigated,  much less resulted in prosecution or punishment. By its inaction, the  Honduran Government is sending the unmistakable message that impunity  for these crimes is acceptable.   For many years, Vermont and Honduras were ``sister states.'' I have  traveled there, as have many Vermonters, including some who have served  as volunteers providing primary health care, education, and other  humanitarian services to isolated rural communities. So I have a  longstanding interest in Honduras and its people, and over the years I  have supported hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. assistance for  Honduras.   Yet today Honduras faces every imaginable problem. It is a  transshipment point for Colombian cocaine and a haven for ruthless drug  gangs. Millions of Hondurans live in dangerous, squalid conditions with  no hope for the future. The police have a history of corruption and are  mistrusted. Violent crimes are common and almost never result in  conviction. And the government is plagued by corruption, its officials  often seeming to be more concerned with staying in power and enriching  themselves than addressing the needs of their people.   Why is this? There are obviously many factors, but one is undoubtedly  a failure of leadership in Honduras and in the United States. For too  long, successive U.S. administrations made excuses for and continued to  support Honduran Governments that were corrupt, ineffective,  unaccountable, and whose commitment to fundamental rights and  democratic principles was lacking. It was a waste of U.S. taxpayer  dollars and a disservice to the Honduran people.   In a reversal, the White House has suspended assistance for Honduras  and the other Northern Triangle countries because President Trump says  they have not done enough to stop the exodus of migrants. The President  seems to believe that the Honduran Government should somehow prevent  its citizens from leaving, even though they have a legal right to. At  the same time, there is no doubt that the Honduran Government can and  must do far more to address the violence, poverty, corruption, and  injustice that cause people to seek refuge elsewhere. That includes  firing corrupt officials, enacting and implementing the plea bargaining  legislation that has been pending for years, strengthening the Mission  to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity instead of  weakening it, as the Honduran Government is trying, and defending civil  society activists who are frequently harassed, threatened, arbitrarily  arrested, and even assassinated.   The United States has not had an Ambassador in Tegucigalpa for more  than 2 years. The message this sends to the Honduran people is that it  doesn't matter, that Honduras is not important. That is wrong. We need  an ambassador who is a strong voice for good governance, for human  rights, for accountability, and for defending the independence of the  judiciary and other democratic institutions against fraud,  exploitation, or improper influence.   Those who were involved in conceiving, carrying out, and attempting  to cover up the assassination of Berta Caceres should be brought to  justice without further delay. The Honduran people also need to see  justice done in the cases of excessive, deadly force against protesters  by Honduran military police following the 2017 election. There needs to  be fair trials of the protesters who were arrested and who have  languished in jail without due process for a year and a half. Justice  delayed is justice denied YET, unfortunately, that is the norm in  Honduras.   Finally, it is the Honduran Government's urgent responsibility to  take whatever steps are necessary to reform Honduras election laws and  procedures. The Honduran people need to have confidence that the next  election--only 2\1/2\ years away--will be unlike the 2017 election,  free and fair and will not result in more social upheaval, more  excessive force by the police, more impunity, and a further exodus of  people seeking safety and a better life.                            ____________________
