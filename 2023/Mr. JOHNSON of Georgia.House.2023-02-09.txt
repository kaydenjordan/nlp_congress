 Mr. Speaker, in the beginning, Tommy Dortch,  like every other person born on this Earth, was endowed with certain  unique talents.   The mission we all have in living is to go forth and be fruitful with  those talents. I am here today with my colleagues, and also with the  family and church members and pastor of Tommy Dortch. They are in the  gallery today.   We are here to recognize the exceptionally talented Tommy Dortch and  the fruits that we have enjoyed in his living.   My colleagues have told you of Tommy's many accomplishments, and  there is so much more that can be said about him. But with the little  time I have, I want to leave you with this: Tommy Dortch is a man whose  cup runneth over. At the end of each day, Tommy made sure that that cup  was empty, not consuming its contents for himself, but in service to  others.   His example and legacy have and will continue to resonate profoundly,  which is why he is so deserving of receiving the Congressional Gold  Medal.
