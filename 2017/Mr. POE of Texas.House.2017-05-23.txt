 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing up  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this past February, in my hometown of Houston, Texas, we  hosted the 51st Super Bowl. For most Americans, the Super Bowl is a  fun-filled day spent with friends, family, and cheering on our favorite  team. But for human traffickers, the Super Bowl has become an annual  opportunity to expand their evil, criminal empire.   Studies show that big events like the Super Bowl create large upticks  in the trafficking and purchasing of sex trafficking victims. In order  to counteract this, the Department of Homeland Security, as a part of  its Blue Campaign initiative, began preparing months in advance before  the Super Bowl in Houston.   Through the Blue Campaign, the Department of Homeland Security raises  public awareness, it forges antitrafficking partnerships, and brings  suspected human traffickers to justice. Most importantly, it rescues  victims of the sex trafficking trade.   In advance of the last Super Bowl, the Blue Campaign worked with  local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies on the ground, as  well as participating in several congressional briefings. One such  briefing I hosted here in Washington.   Everybody working together, all different law enforcement agencies,  State, local, and Federal, had a great result in what occurred in  Houston. Over 750 people were arrested, and 86 victims were rescued.  Many more were likely spared being forced into the trafficking  industry.   Having worked closely with the Blue Campaign on this, and many other  operations, I have seen firsthand the important role the Department of  Homeland Security has in fighting the scourge of human trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, trafficking is second only to the drug  trade in the amount of money, criminal money, it brings in. And the  Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act will  ensure that the critically important program continues to provide  safety to victims and gets some justice to the traffickers and those  would-be buyers of little children.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the chairman for this legislation.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for the  time and also his work on this issue of human sex trafficking in the  United States. I support this legislation.   I also compliment Congresswoman Wagner, Congresswoman Bass,  Congresswoman Maloney, and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and other  women. I mention that because when we presented the Justice for Victims  of Trafficking Act 2 years ago and worked on that massive legislation  that is excellent legislation, I am convinced that it was the women in  the United States House of Representatives who got it done. They made  sure that this legislation passed, and then they trotted down the  hallway to the Senate and--I will use the word--``encouraged'' our  Senators to take the bill up, and it passed there, and President Obama  did sign the legislation. I am convinced there is nothing more powerful  than a woman who has made up her mind, and the women in this House made  up their mind about human sex trafficking. I just wanted to point that  out.   This legislation is important. There are many stories. I am going to  talk about a 9-year-old girl who lived not far from where we are today  here in the United States Capitol. When Ashley's mother died, she was  left alone. Like any lost and lonely child, she sought the comfort that  she needed of love and safety. A woman came in to Ashley's life,  offering her the care that Ashley was looking for as a 9-year-old:  comfort and love. Ashley felt like she was safe for the first time  since she had lost her mother. She was an orphan in Washington, D.C.  Little did she know that the woman who was being nice to her was faking  it all because she was grooming Ashley to be a sex slave here in  Washington.   You see, traffickers exploit the vulnerabilities of victims,  destroying their self-worth and their hope for a better life. In some  cases, traffickers steal the soul of young children. They have no hope  and they have no self-worth.   That happened to Ashley, this 9-year-old girl. She was trafficked on  the streets of Washington, D.C., and online for 5 years. At 16, a peace  officer here in Washington, D.C., arrested her for prostitution. She  was brought before a judge, and the judge recognized that she was not a  criminal, she was not guilty of prostitution. Children cannot commit  the crime of prostitution. He recognized her plight and he ordered her  into a treatment program to help her recover from being a trafficking  victim. It is my opinion that that judge saved Ashley's life.   As was mentioned here on the House floor by Congresswoman Bass, the  average age of a trafficking victim here in the United States of  America is between 12 and 13. That means some girls are younger, like  Ashley. She was 9. What a statistic. And, yes, it is mostly young minor  females. Boys are trafficked. Adult females are trafficked as well, but  the scourge is the biggest when it is our children.   Like the laws of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, they  have increased judge and prosecutor training, giving them tools to deal  with the scourge of human trafficking. It is nothing more than modern  sex slavery. That is what human trafficking is.   Congresswoman Wagner's Put Trafficking Victims First Act continues to  improve the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act and improve the  process by encouraging more training and a focus on victim-centered  approaches in the courtroom. I was a judge for 22 years in Houston. We  had none of this legislation to help rescue and restore victims of  trafficking, and now we do.   We should remember that in our country we treat trafficking victims,  like Ashley, like victims and make survivors out of them. Gone are the  days that we are going to treat them like criminals. They are not  criminals. They are victims of crime. We must stop the sale of children  on the marketplace of sex slavery. This legislation helps do that.  Victims like Ashley deserve treatment and care, and I support the work  that has been done in the Put Trafficking Victims First Act, and I  support the fact that it will help victims.   As co-chair of the Victims' Rights Caucus, along with the gentleman  from California (Mr. Costa), we understand the importance of victims  and we understand the importance of this legislation. No more, Mr.  Speaker. Not in our city, not in our States, and not in our country.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, this Monday, America honors its war  dead. We call it Memorial Day.   Many Americans do not realize that there are 25 United States  cemeteries overseas for America's war dead. The one in Luxembourg is  one that I have visited and I find quite unique.   During World War II, in 1944, the Germans crushed through the  American lines in a surprise attack. It was called the Battle of the  Bulge. My 92-year-old father fought in that battle when he was 18.   The German advance was eventually halted. One reason was because  General George Patton and his army helped halt the attack by quickly  advancing through and saving Luxembourg.   After the war, the nation of Luxembourg agreed to a memorial there.  The memorial is unique because the cemetery is a burial place for  mostly Americans who were killed in the Battle of the Bulge. There are  5,076 Americans buried there--22 sets of brothers. And the average age  of the soldier buried in Luxembourg is 19.   This Memorial Day, let us remember all who have served and have given  their lives and are buried all over the world, because, Mr. Speaker,  the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
