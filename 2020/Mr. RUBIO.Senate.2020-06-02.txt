 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a small  business that is known for excellence in its industry, outstanding  craftsmanship, and creating dignified work in their community. This  week, it is my pleasure to recognize Ideal Aluminum Products, LLC of  St. Augustine, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2010, Michael Siegel and Doug Brady purchased Ideal Aluminum  Products. Based in DeLand, FL, this fence, gate, and railing  manufacturing company had recently gone out of business. Doug, an  alumnus of the University of South Florida, had also worked with  Michael at Ideal Gas, LLC. Together, the two planned to turn this new  company around.   Over the next decade, Michael and Doug grew Ideal Aluminum into an  industry leader. A favorable business environment and proximity to I-95  spurred Ideal Aluminum's relocation to St. Augustine in 2015. Their  success as a local manufacturer and commitment to job creation was  honored by then-Governor Rick Scott, who issued a monthly job report at  their facility in 2016.   Ideal Aluminum has been an ardent supporter of community development.  In 2011, Ideal Aluminum manufactured, donated, and installed railings  for ABC's ``Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.'' They were recognized in  2015 by  [[Page S2648]]  GrowFL, which spotlights businesses that create quality jobs, enrich  their communities, and broaden new industries throughout Florida. Ideal  Aluminum was nominated for the Florida Sterling Manufacturing Business  Award in 2017 for business excellence in Florida's manufacturing  community. Michael and Doug were finalists for the Ernst & Young  Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2017 and 2018. Ideal Aluminum has  also been featured in the St. Augustine Record and industry  publications.   Like many other small businesses, Ideal Aluminum stepped up to help  their community during the coronavirus pandemic. When Michael and Doug  heard about the shortage of blood donations, they organized a blood  drive at Ideal Aluminum and collected donations for Feeding Northeast  Florida. The company matched every dollar collected, resulting in a  $3,000 donation to feed the hungry in the St. Augustine area.   When the U.S. Small Business Administration--SBA--launched the  Paycheck Protection Program--PPP--Michael and Doug applied immediately.  The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. In  late April, Ideal Aluminum received a PPP loan and an Economic Injury  Disaster Loan from the SBA. As a result, they were able to keep all of  their employees paid.   Ideal Aluminum Products exemplifies how crucial small businesses are  in creating jobs and building the local community. I commend their  efforts to create jobs in the critical manufacturing sector.   Congratulations to Michael, Doug, and the entire team at Ideal  Aluminum. I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
