 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bill. I feel like I am repeating myself, but this is yet another bill  that would overturn a radical rule from the Biden administration's EPA.   The agency's recent actions to provide California a waiver request to  strictly regulate vehicle emissions and its proposed emissions  standards combine to a de facto EV mandate.   Allowing California to ban the sale of internal combustion engines by  2035 will significantly distort the market and manufacturing of  vehicles throughout our country. This is entirely inappropriate.   The Federal Government is not in the business of dictating consumer  choice, especially when it can be detrimental to the lives of Americans  from all walks of life.   If people want an EV, they can make that choice. Many people have  already  [[Page H4322]]  made that choice, and I suspect more will as these vehicles improve and  become more accessible.   However, they are not the right choice for all Americans. For most,  they are simply out of reach. They are too expensive, even with  existing incentives, and do not have the range nor the reliability  consumers desire yet.   Portions of my district are incredibly rural and simply not practical  for EVs. My constituents deserve access to affordable vehicles that can  be depended on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Jerry Willis Keith.   Jerry was born on March 28, 1937, in Waycross, Georgia, to Warren  Lott Keith and Mary Emma Corbett Keith. He was a lifelong member of  First Baptist Church of Jesup and a member of the Golden Rulers Sunday  School Class.   He spent his adult life managing and operating retail grocery stores  for several national food chains. There, he was always praised by many  local employees as the best boss they ever had.   He was a very active member of many community organizations,  including the Elks Club, Pine Forest Men's Golf Association, a Jaycee  member, and an elite member of the Pond House crew.   He was a loving husband; a caring father of 7; a doting grandfather  of 15; and great-grandfather of 6.   Mr. Keith's legacy will live on in the positive impact that he had on  his community. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.                            ____________________
