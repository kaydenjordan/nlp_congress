 Mr. Speaker, I intend to address the good news that we  had a significant drop in murders in this country in 2017 over the  recent peak in 2016.   However, before I address the House on that matter, I would like to  yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I would now like to address the body on  the topic of the recent decline of murders in the United States of  America.   For people who watch this House, we know that there are all sorts of  bad things we can dwell on. We can dwell on the immigration crisis, we  can dwell on high healthcare costs, we can dwell on the debt, but  recently some relatively good news--we have more work to do--was  brought forth, and that is the murder rates for 2018 were published.   Largely in this country, murder rates skyrocketed from the early  1960s, when we had the beginning of the welfare culture, the war on the  family under Lyndon Johnson, and murder rates rose from around 5 per  100,000 to over 10 per 100,000 in 1980. Murder rates stayed relatively  high throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s.   Since that time, I think in part because of increased incarceration,  those murder rates were falling until 2015.   And then, I think in part because of a government that spoke  negatively of police, talked about or implied that police shootings  were racially motivated, something happened opposite of what had been  going on the 25 years before that.   All of a sudden for 2 years in a row, the number of people murdered  in this country jumped up, jumped up from a low of 4.4 to 5.4 per  100,000 in the years 2015 and 2016.   After that, we can talk about whether it was because of this or not,  but Donald Trump took over, somebody who ran encouraging support of the  police, respect of the police, and the murder rate began to drop a  little bit in 2017, and last year, it one more time fell to less than 5  per 100,000.   President Trump ran, of course, on respect for police. That is one of  the reasons I think people wanted him in there.   The prior President, a dignified man, had Al Sharpton in the White  House over 80 times. And I think if you look, Barack Obama is praising  Black Lives Matter, is encouraging people to view police with distrust,  was perhaps one of the reasons why, completely out of the ordinary at a  time when the economy was not bad, we had police shootings rise  significantly.   Now we have a President who, as the yard signs in my district say,  ``Respect the Badge'', we have somebody as a President who is more a  respect-the-badge sort of guy, and in 1 year we have a decrease in  murders in this country--despite the fact the population continues to  grow--of 1,000 people; 1,000 lives saved.   We have to ask ourselves, why was there a spike in murders before  President Trump took office and why was there a reduction in murders  after he took office?   As I mentioned, I think the embracing of people like Al Sharpton, who  encourages disrespect for police, or at least blames them, blames sad  shootings on racial motivation, I think that is one of the reasons why  you had an increase.   You had police who were afraid to do what they could do for fear of  being sanctioned. You had people maybe afraid to go to the police to  report criminals, perhaps because they were told the police were their  enemy.   But in any event, in this era, I haven't checked, but I am sure Al  Sharpton hasn't been invited to the White House a dozen times in  President Trump's first 3 years. I would be surprised if he was there  at all, actually.   Instead, we have someone who knows that as long as the police are  appropriately doing their job, he has their back. And we have seen that  significant drop in the last 2 years, which is rare good news that you  get.   I anxiously await when the statistics come out for the year 2019. We  know there was another drop of about 7 percent in the massive city  south of me in Chicago, I believe, in the first 7 months of the year.  We saw another 10 percent drop in Milwaukee. There was another drop in  New York.   Is this a coincidence or is it because our police know that they are  respected at the highest level of government?   So I know when I get back home, I hear some people talk about crime  and worry about crime, and there is more work that has to be done.  Obviously, having as many people as we have murdered every year is  still a figure way too high, but a drop of 1,000 was a significant  drop.    I hope everybody pays attention to what I believe is another drop  that is going to happen in 2019, and I hope everybody realizes that  this may not have been just an aberration. One thousand lives are a lot  of lives. It could be the result of a policy based on respect for the  police, punishing police when they are wrong, no doubt about that, and  there are bad police, but not a love affair with Black Lives Matter;  respecting the fact that when studies have been done by groups such as  the National Academy of Sciences, they find that when police do kill  people, it is collectively not a racially motivated or a racial thing.   It is, sadly, something that happens because sometimes people do  wrong things and it is usually people that are in the process of or are  trying not to be apprehended from very dangerous crimes. And a couple  times, a few times, it does happen because police make mistakes. But  when it is, it shouldn't be used to tarnish police as a whole and it  shouldn't be used to come out with the idea that these things are  racially motivated.   So there is my report on the good news to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
