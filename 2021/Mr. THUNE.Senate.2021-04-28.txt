 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this evening President Biden will deliver  his first address to Congress. I have been asked, I think as most  Members have, by the media: What do you expect to hear? What do you  want to hear?   Honestly, I am interested to hear the direction the President will  set in his speech. The President's inaugural address leaned heavily  into the theme of unity and bipartisanship, but unity and  bipartisanship have not been a distinguishing feature of the Biden  Presidency.   The President's first major bill, a COVID relief bill, broke the  streak of bipartisanship on COVID legislation--a streak that goes back  to March of last year. Since that time, when we were the majority, we  passed five bills, all of them with big bipartisan majorities. Under  President Biden, Democrats shoved through a totally partisan bill  filled with non-COVID-related liberal priorities.   Republicans were more than ready to work with Democrats on additional  coronavirus legislation. In fact, 10 Republicans developed a COVID  proposal and then met with President Biden to discuss it. But Democrats  and the President were having none of it. It was ``their way or the  highway'' on COVID legislation. No bipartisanship. No compromise. It  was, support the Democrats' bill and its wasteful spending on non- COVID-related priorities or be left out of the discussion. As I pointed  out, only about 10 percent--10 percent--of that ``COVID bill'' was  actually COVID related.   It was a deeply disappointing start to the Biden Presidency and a  betrayal of the unity that President Biden had pledged himself to in  his inauguration address.   Unfortunately, the Biden Presidency has mostly continued along in the  same partisan fashion. The President promised to be a President for the  whole people yet seems more focused on making sure that he is the  President for the far left. You don't have to take my word for it. One  of the leading voices of the far left in this Congress recently stated  that President Biden had exceeded--not met; exceeded--progressives'  expectations.   Between Democrats and the White House, the first 3 months of the  Biden Presidency have been a long stream of policies and proposals that  seem to have come right from the progressives' playbook--proposals for  tax hikes and more tax hikes and still more tax hikes to pay for new  government programs like the President's Green New Deal-esque Civilian  Climate Corps; a sharp retreat from border security, with a huge crisis  going on at the border as a result; a bill that would place  unprecedented restrictions on the free exercise of religion in the name  of equality; legislation to dramatically revise our electoral system to  ensure Democrats' hold on power. The list goes on.   Once an ardent defender of America's core institutions, the President  recently established a commission to explore the idea of court- packing--perhaps the most outrageously partisan and political proposal  we have seen in this century.   From the way Democrats are behaving, you would think that the  American people had elected overwhelming Democratic majorities and a  President with a reputation as a strong leftist. Of course, that isn't  close to being the case. We all know that. Democrats have a razor-thin  majority in the Senate and an almost equally thin majority in the House  of Representatives, where they lost a substantial number of seats. As  for the Presidency, while certainly a Democrat won the election, it is  worth noting that the only candidate who could win the Democratic  primary was a man historically regarded as a moderate. That is right.  Even among primary Democratic voters, the Democrats' far-left liberal  candidates did not fare so well.   If there was any mandate in the election, it was a mandate for  moderation, for compromise. Yet the President and Democrats are  behaving as if they had been delivered a mandate for a partisan  revolution.   There has been one encouraging thing lately, and that is the fact  that President Biden seems to actually be considering pursuing  bipartisanship on an infrastructure package. He has had multiple  meetings on infrastructure with Republican Members of Congress, and  while I am still waiting to see just how committed the Democrats are to  achieving a bipartisan result, I am encouraged that the President is at  least talking to the Republican Members.   A bipartisan infrastructure proposal should be a slam dunk. Congress  has a history of bipartisan collaboration on infrastructure  legislation. In fact, our last major infrastructure bill, the FAST Act,  received strong support from both Democrats and Republicans and was a  remarkably successful bill.   As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I helped to spearhead a  bipartisan reauthorization of the FAA, including of critical programs  to improve airport infrastructure, and last Congress, the Environment  and Public Works Committee developed major bipartisan infrastructure  legislation.   There is no good reason that we shouldn't reach bipartisan agreement  on another substantial infrastructure bill, but it will require a  commitment from the Democrats and the President to real bipartisan work  and a recognition that bipartisanship involves compromise and that no  one side is going to get everything its Members want.   Bipartisanship is not the Democrats inviting the Republicans to  support the Democrats' ideal bill. Bipartisanship is sitting down at  the table, identifying what we agree on, and then working out a  solution to our differences that involves both sides accepting  compromises.   I hope that, tonight, the President will go beyond empty talk about  bipartisanship and make an actual, concrete commitment to achieve  bipartisan results, starting with infrastructure legislation. I hope,  although I do not really expect, that he will move away from the  policies and partisan priorities of the far left and toward a more  moderate vision, more in keeping with the bringing together of  Americans that he spoke of in his inaugural address.   Ultimately, what matters the most is not what the President will say  tonight  [[Page S2262]]  but what he will do in the days and weeks to come. Will he finally  deliver on that promise of unity that he spoke of in his inaugural  address or will he continue to pursue the partisan path that  progressives have laid out for him? For the sake of our country, I hope  he chooses bipartisanship.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul),  the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds), and the Senator from  Alabama (Mr. Shelby).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul),  the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds), the Senator from Alabama  (Mr. Shelby), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul),  the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds), the Senator from Alabama  (Mr. Shelby), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Toomey) would have voted ``nay.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1424         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
