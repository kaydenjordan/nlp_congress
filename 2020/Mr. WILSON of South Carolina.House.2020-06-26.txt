 Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the 70th  anniversary of the Korean war. On June 25, 1950, at 4 a.m., the North  Korean army mercilessly crossed the 38th parallel with 135,000 troops  to begin the invasion of the South.   This anniversary is an opportunity to especially remember the 326,863  Americans who served and the 36,574 who died to successfully stop  communist imperialism.   I am grateful that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania  Trump provided a wreath at the extraordinary Korean War Veterans  Memorial on The Mall yesterday in Washington.   There is no greater contrast between the blessings of democratic  capitalism, with South Korea being one of the world's wealthiest  nations as North Korea's totalitarian socialist regime has mass  poverty.   Korea is well represented in Washington by Ambassador Lee Soo-hyuck,  and Korean Americans are valued citizens.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
