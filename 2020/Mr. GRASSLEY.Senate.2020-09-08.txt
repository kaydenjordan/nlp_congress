 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    In August, I held 49 county meetings as part of my  annual 99-county set of meetings in Iowa. At every meeting, the format  is the same: Iowans set the agenda.   Challenges from the pandemic and storm recovery were among their top  concerns. To explain the storm recovery--about once every 10 years  there is a big wind storm called a derecho going across someplace in  the country. That path was about 150 miles long in Iowa and 34 miles  wide, and it destroyed the crops for this year in that area. Other  issues came up as well. Biofuels, unemployment insurance, the farm  economy, access to childcare and school reopenings were frequent points  of discussion. I had the chance of visiting in 15 different locations  with about that many school superintendents, and they were very  optimistic about the coming school year.   This is my 40th year holding my 99 county meetings. I started this  tradition when I first was elected to the Senate, so Iowans in every  corner of the State would know I care about their opinions.   It is an honor to serve Iowans in the U.S. Senate and uphold my end  of representative government. I look forward to more Q&As across the  State this year and starting my 41st year of 99 county meetings in  2021.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
