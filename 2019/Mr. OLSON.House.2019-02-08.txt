 Madam Speaker, back home in Texas 22, a new source of  economic growth is exploding in Sienna Plantation and Missouri City.  This force of prosperity is the Sauce Boss. The Sauce Boss is a  walking, talking, sauce-making American Dream. Her name is Tyla-Simone  Crayton.   Tyla is 15 years young, a sophomore Panther at Ridge Point High  School. Tyla started Sienna Wings because Tyla just loves eating. One  sauce has now become three: Tangy, Spicy, and Lemon Pepper.   Tyla has just one employee, her mom, Monique. She also has 22  distributors and a box packer who is packing more boxes now than they  have packed before.   Tyla, Monique, Panther Nation, and all of Texas 22 have a common  dream: We can't wait until Sienna Wings are on the shelves of HEB.   And that's just the way it is.                            ____________________
