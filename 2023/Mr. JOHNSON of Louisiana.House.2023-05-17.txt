 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my special order.    Madam Speaker, House Republicans are here,  yet again, to urge President Biden to avoid the impending default  crisis and strike a deal with House Republicans. We have to do this.   For over 100 days now, Joe Biden and Democrats have wasted valuable  time refusing to offer a reasonable solution to raise the debt ceiling  and prevent our Nation from default.   House Republicans did our job. We did it here. We passed the Limit,  Save, Grow Act almost 3 weeks ago. Our bill is a really important  measure because it will do a number of things. It will save taxpayers  nearly $5 trillion. It will set commonsense caps on future spending  levels. It will grow the economy, it will increase American energy  production, it will lower prices on working families, it will defund  this administration's aggressive expansion of the IRS, and it lifts the  debt ceiling.   This is responsible legislation. We got together, and we did our job.  The bill has not changed, and neither has our position. We will not,  under any circumstances, accept a clean debt ceiling increase. We can't  do that. We have stewardship responsibility.   Our fiscal house is not in order here, and this negotiation may be  the only real opportunity that Congress has to address Washington's  spending obsession and begin to get our debt under control until the  next election cycle.   We are $31.7 trillion in Federal debt. Inflation is sky high,  interest rates are only continuing to rise, and, yet, what does this  President do?   Joe Biden can barely be bothered to address the threat of collapse of  our financial system.                                time  1915    The entire debate is symptomatic of the unmitigated rot that has  afflicted Washington. Our constituents know the parties have to  negotiate; the markets know we need to negotiate; and until a decade  ago, Joe Biden did himself.   We have all these quotes on record. I mean, as recently as 2011, when  he was in charge on the Senate side, he was over here negotiating with  the House. He said over and over how important this was, how important  it is to the process, and how anyone who says it is only my way or the  highway was being irresponsible.   Do you know what? He was right. We are just asking him to live by his  own mantra. Look, I am confident that the White House will come to its  senses soon. It has to. If not, Americans know there is only one person  to blame. It is President Biden.                       Celebrating National Police Week     Madam Speaker, while we are dealing with  that, we also recognize and are delighted to celebrate National Police  Week.   It is my honor to lead this group of speeches tonight honoring the  men and women who risk their lives daily to keep our communities safe.   I am the son of a first responder who was critically injured and  permanently disabled in the line of duty.   My dad was the assistant fire chief in Shreveport, Louisiana, in  1984. September 17 of that year, he was burned over 80 percent of his  body, third-degree burns.   He had about a 5 percent chance to live. He miraculously survived,  and he struggled with those injuries for decades longer.   I lost him just 3 days before I got elected to Congress. I know  personally the risk that first responder families face every single  day.   Madam Speaker, we aren't just on the floor speaking tonight. We have  work product to back up what we are saying. House Republicans have made  support for law enforcement a central part of our agenda in this  Congress.   This week, we passed multiple pieces of legislation to support these  brave men and women. Today, we passed the POLICE Act, which makes  assaulting a law enforcement officer a deportable offense for those in  the country illegally.   This bill's passage could not come soon enough because, as we know,  both illegal immigration and assaults on police officers continue to  rise. Increased penalties like these will help deter future attacks  against officers.   We also passed the Federal Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon  Purchase Act, which gives officers the option to purchase their service  weapon at fair market value once they retire. It is just commonsense  legislation.   Tomorrow, we are going to pass H. Con. Res. 40. This resolution  condemns efforts to defund or dismantle local law enforcement agencies,  and it also condemns attacks against police officers.   Just today, we watched sadly as Chicago laid to rest Officer Areanah  Preston, who was tragically shot and killed outside of her home this  month in a targeted attack.   Officer Preston was just 24 years old, fresh-faced and idealistic,  eager to serve the people of Chicago, but her life was cut short due,  in part, to dangerous antipolice rhetoric, rhetoric often used in these  Halls, and it is a shame.   Madam Speaker, one would think that a resolution condemning attacks  on police officers would pass through this House, of course,  unanimously. Do you know what? That wasn't the case last night. Two  Democrats in this body, one of which has paid astonishing sums of money  for armed personal security, voted against this measure.   This problem goes far beyond just those two Members in question. As I  have recounted multiple times in our House Judiciary Committee, dozens  of members of the House Democratic Caucus have publicly called to  either defund or dismantle police departments when America lost its  collective mind during the summer of 2020.   This is exactly why it is so important that House Republicans lead  the charge in support of law enforcement, and we will.   After 4 years of inaction and demonization of these heroic officers,  the people's House now decisively backs the blue.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be joined by a number of my  colleagues, some of the stars of the House, and I yield to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  compelling testimony. We took the House Judiciary Committee to lower  Manhattan just a few weeks back, right in Alvin Bragg's backyard, the  Soros-funded D.A. We let victims of crime tell their tragic stories. It  was really something to hear. There is a lot to be said about this  issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to another great gentleman from New York (Mr.  Williams).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his good work and for his service, as well, and we will take care of  the veterans. That is what Republicans do.   That bill passed out of the Appropriations Committee sends a strong  message that that was, let's say, misinformation by the other side  about the veterans' funding.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from the  State of Utah (Mr. Owens), my dear friend and a Super Bowl champion.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. That was  so well said. I thank him for highlighting those specific examples of  brave men and women in the State of Utah who put on the badge every day  to do that really important job.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Strong), a great Member.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  thank him for his service. I didn't know that about his bio. That is  impressive. I am really, really grateful, as we all are, for those who  gave their lives in the line of duty, and we do pray blessings over  their families and all those left behind.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird),  somebody who knows a little bit about sacrifice, one of my favorite  people in the world.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  service in keeping us safe.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).    Madam Speaker, I yield next to another  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for  his comments and the really sad state of things in California with so  much that is going on there. You are right, it is a blue State that  really needs to get its act together. I am glad that we can come here  and have this opportunity to honor men and women in law enforcement as  you have, so I thank you for that.   Madam Speaker, as my friend was speaking here about officers lost in  the line of duty, I was just looking over some statistics. On the web  page that is titled: ``Officer Down Memorial Page'' they honor officers  who are killed in the line of duty. They have a listing of the total  line of duty deaths. So far this year we are sadly at number 42.   I did not realize this until I was just sitting here doing the  research, but my State of Louisiana is in the lead by total deaths by  State as they are all listed.   I would just close this Special Order hour by saying that there  really aren't words. We can come to the floor of the people's House  here, and we can share our thoughts and share our hearts. We can pray  for the families of those who are lost in the line of duty and all  those who serve so bravely each day, but words really do not do justice  to the level of risk that is taken by those who put on the badge every  day and go out and do that hard job. We need more of them. They  represent the best of America, and we know that.   All of my House Republican colleagues honor those who have served. We  honor their families for their sacrifices and certainly those who have  been lost in the line of duty.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
