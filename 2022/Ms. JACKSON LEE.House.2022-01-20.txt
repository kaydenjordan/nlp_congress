 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R.  1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act (EVEST), which  provides automatic enrollment in the VA for all transitioning service  members, and veterans who don't want to obtain its services have the  easy choice of opting out.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 20, 2022, on page H263, in the third column, the  following appeared: Mrs JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I stand here in  strong support of H.R. 1836, the Ensuring Veterans' Smooth  Transition Act      The online version has been corrected to read:   Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of H.R. 1836, the  Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition Act    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Specifically, this bill would:   Automatically enroll new veterans into VA Health Care;   Provide VA with information about transitioning service members;   Require the VA to reach out to veterans about the scope of, and  access to, benefits.   Assuring future cohorts of veterans--including those struggling with  the Taliban triumph in Afghanistan--don't go without health care during  their transition from military to civilian life is the worthy goal of  this bill.   After attempting suicide while serving on active duty in Iraq,  Kristofer Goldsmith was given a general discharge by the Army and  little else.   The overwhelmed 21-year-old returned to his hometown on Long Island,  N.Y., totally unaware that he was eligible for care from the Veterans  Health Administration (VA).   ``I had just lost my income, my support network, my identity, and  almost my life. I was in a total mental health crisis,'' Goldsmith  said.   During the critical months following his transition to civilian life,  he went without desperately needed services.   If his mother hadn't forced him to go to the VA, Goldsmith, who  credits the VA with helping him rebuild his life, doesn't know what  would have happened to him.   Of this, however, he is certain, ``If I had heard from my local VA  informing me of what benefits I had and that I'd been enrolled in the  system, it would have changed my life drastically.''   This bill would help thousands of veterans who need services for the  multitude of conditions acquired or exacerbated by military service but  are confused about how to access them.  [[Page H264]]    These ailments include everything from respiratory problems caused by  burn-pit toxic exposure to signature combat conditions such as  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).   For all these problems, prompt attention means everything.   For example, according to research conducted by the VA, veterans who  received care soon after the end of their service ``had lower levels of  PTSD upon follow-up a year after they initiated care.   According to the study, for each year that a veteran waited to  initiate treatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of  their PTSD either not improving or worsening.   In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine  found that post-9/11 veterans who had not sought VA mental health care  didn't know how to apply for benefits--or were unsure whether they were  even eligible.   Some didn't know what services the VA offered or felt that they  didn't deserve care even if they could get it.   Some women veterans are similarly unsure whether VA services are even  available to their gender.   This legislation will not only be key to eliminating these barriers  but also to reducing the veteran suicide crisis.   A disproportionate number of veterans die by suicide during the  initial months and years following separation from military service.   Veterans ages 18 to 34 have the highest rate of suicide.   Automatic pre-enrollment could be lifesaving during a crisis when  speed is of the essence.   Smoother access to VA health care has never been more important than  it is today.   The tumultuous end of the war in Afghanistan is intensifying mental  health symptoms within the veteran population.   I am proud to support this legislation in order to better serve  veterans and reduce veteran suicide.   This bill, in which we further the benefits and recognition that our  servicemen and women deserve, also reminds us that we have an  overriding duty to protect the health and dignity of those serving  today.   For this reason, I would like to discuss the crisis that our National  Guardsmen and Guardswomen have been thrust into at the Texas Governor's  direction on our Southern Border.   In March 2021, the Texas Governor launched the ill-fated and  ineffective Operation Lone Star which he claimed was necessary to stem  a so-called invasion of migrants at Texas' southern border.   As of November 2021, more than 10,000 Texas National Guardsmen have  been deployed to the southern border in pursuit of this folly.   According to published media accounts, National Guard members who  have been activated for Operation Lone Star are experiencing habitual  pay delays and poor working conditions during the border mission,  including being exposed to COVID-19, and many are missing the equipment  necessary for safety and mission success.   In addition, the National Guard has faced austere conditions and  limited resources, leading to unsanitary conditions such as the lack of  portable restrooms.   Rather than addressing these conditions, just last week the Texas  Governor filed a frivolous lawsuit in federal court challenging the  authority of President Biden, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed  Forces to require that members of the National Guard be vaccinated  against COVID-19.   There is no merit to this nuisance law suit as demonstrated by the  summary rejection of similar arguments raised by neighboring Oklahoma  Governor Stitt.   The Texas Governor's failure to comply with the policies intended to  reduce the spread of COVID-19 among the Armed Forces will mean that  there will be less military personnel available national disasters that  have struck Texas in recent years, such as the winter freeze of last  year.   This will also mean that there are fewer personnel to respond to any  attacks on the homeland.   Encouraged by the Texas Governor's obstinacy, about 40% of the  members of the Texas Army National Guard are refusing to get  vaccinated, which puts at risk their colleagues and the persons they  are sworn to defend and protect.   National Guardsmen and Guardswomen deployed in this disastrous  mission at the Texas Governor's insistence face the deadly spread of  COVID-19, unsanitary conditions, lack of pay, and a lack of a certain  future.   These uniformed men and women deserve better, and some of them,  seeing no alternative to their present reality, have decided to end it  all.   Five National guard soldiers have shot and killed themselves in the  past three months, and one more survived a suicide attempt.   One of these men, private first class Joshua R. Cortez, was preparing  to accept a ``lifetime job'' with one of the nation's biggest health  insurance companies in late October last year, but the Texas National  Guard had other ideas.   Operation Lone Star required involuntary activations to meet the  Texas Governor's troop quotas, and Cortez was one of the soldiers  tapped to go on state active duty orders--with no idea how long the  mission would last.   In November, the 21-year-old mechanic requested a hardship release  from the mission: ``I've been waiting for this job and I'm on my way to  getting hired . . . I missed my first opportunity in September when I  had to go on the flood mission in Louisiana. . . . I can not miss this  opportunity because it is my last opportunity for this lifetime job.''   Cortez's company commander recommended approval. But his battalion  commander and brigade commander disapproved.   Within 36 hours of his request being denied, Cortez drove to a  parking lot in northwest San Antonio and shot himself in the head.   Three other soldiers tied to Operation lone Star have died by  suicide, including:   Sgt. Jose L. De Hoyos was found dead in Laredo, Texas, on Oct. 26. He  was a member of the 949th Brigade Support Battalion's headquarters  company.   1st Sgt. John ``Kenny'' Crutcher died Nov. 12, as time ran out on his  temporary hardship waiver. He was the top NCO for B Company, 3rd  Battalion, 144th Infantry.   1st Lt. Charles Williams, a platoon leader in Crutcher's company,  died at home overnight Dec. 17 while on pass.   The string of suicides raises urgent questions about the mission's  conditions and purpose, as well as the way it's organized and manned  through indefinite involuntary call-ups.   This is an excellent and common-sense bill that will enhance the  benefits of our servicemen and women.   We must also act to ensure that our servicemen and women are  protected from COVID-19, both for their own safety and the safety of  our nation.   Although we cannot bring back the lives lost due to the Texas  Governor's misguided actions, we can remember the names of those we  have lost and work to ensure that we treat all members of our military  equally and with dignity and respect.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the name of Dr. Martin  Luther King and John Robert Lewis, our late colleague.   I rise today to say that we are not finished. The work of this Nation  is not finished, even in the aftermath of a sinister vote on the floor  of the United States Senate that could not see clearly to determine  that the Constitution and the right to vote rose above the silly and  insignificant rule of the Senate called the filibuster.   In the midst of that debate, we heard eloquent and beautiful  statements about the many times the filibuster had been eliminated or  relieved. We heard a brilliant analysis of the Constitution and the  Founding Fathers' desire for the filibuster not to be in the  Constitution, yet due process and the 15th Amendment are.   Mr. Speaker, we saw justice crushed and democracy gored. In Texas, of  course, more criminal laws are now related to voting. Poll watchers can  attack voters in terms of what they are doing. We are now in a  constitutional hearing in Judiciary. It is my commitment to go forward  on the John Robert Lewis and all the bills attached to it because the  Nation is crying out for justice. The country is crying out for  democracy. We will not let it down. The Senate must continue its  debate, and we must get these billed passed.                            ____________________
