 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would just ask the gentleman a couple  questions to underline a couple of the really important points you made  about the context in which this bill is considered, because while I  think every Democrat agrees with our colleague from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse) about the importance of civility and the importance of us  each taking responsibility for the tone here and certainly condemning  violence, condemning anyone who would suggest that if you come to the  rally and you protest that you ought to be beaten up by the people that  are there, the kind of thing that happened, unfortunately, last year,  that we should condemn all of that. Does the gentleman agree that the  House exercising vigorous oversight of the Administration when it  breaks its promises, when it mixes personal business with public  business, that this remains an important aspect of our job and no way  suggests a breach of civility?    If the gentleman would further yield, I heard a rather  bizarre comment last week in the aftermath of these shootings  suggesting that, in the aftermath of them, Democrats would be reaching  out to Republicans on healthcare, and I couldn't quite understand how  that could occur. Indeed, your comments about this particular set of  bills and the healthcare bill, isn't it a part of civility that we have  respect for one another and don't try to force through a bill with an  all-night, unnecessary session, not force through here a bill that  Republican Members say they didn't have time to read but then leave it  up there on the Speaker's desk for a month before even sending it to  the Senate? And if you have a legislative process where the majority  leader in the Senate says he won't even guarantee 10 hours to see a  huge bill that affects this much of the economy and the lives and the  livelihoods of millions of Americans, that that in itself is a breach  of the respect and the civility that we need to have in this Congress?    No. I served on the Ways and Means Committee. We could  not see the Republican House bill until hours before it came up.    It was under police guard downstairs so that even  Republicans, like Senator Rand Paul, couldn't get in and see the bill.   Then we have an all-night session without a single member of the  Trump Administration coming to respond to questions about it, while  every healthcare professional group that I have heard of opposed the  bill, not letting any of those people come to a hearing. I just suggest  that this is a breach of civility. That is a breach of respect. It is a  breach of the democratic process which we are all about. That needs to  be on the table and is as important as whether someone uses strong  language here in the House.    No. I think he has only wanted to listen to one side,  and I don't begin to think that even the Republican Members of this  House can contain President Trump. They seem to have sealed their lips  about it, and I wish they would speak out more.   But I think they can effect the processes in this House, and when  they pass a bill that President Trump says is ``mean, mean, mean,''  they need to go back and look at that process. And I see the same thing  happening, from what you have told us, about the two bills that are up  here.   Why is it that we have a process that is designed to exclude almost  half of the people in this House, to exclude their amendments, to give  them no opportunity to be heard at a markup, to bring in no witnesses  to defend the bill or to allow discussion of that bill? That is not  only not civil, not the democratic process, but it leads to worse  public policy.   Even if they have a majority to pass it, their ideas need to be  tested, and it allows them to perfect their legislation. That is the  way the democratic process is supposed to work. But with all the  secrecy, all the forced action, the tight timetables that are applying  here, they thwart our democratic process in a way that hurts all sides  and certainly impairs civility.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed, asking  that it be read in full concerning President Trump's tax returns.    Mr. Speaker, I do wish to address the parliamentary  question and would appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time  about it.    Mr. Speaker, you can certainly observe, as all the  Members can, the many troubling events that are reflected in the  resolution we just had read and why they do arise to the privileges of  the House.   Under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House  are: ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its  safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''   This resolution seeks to protect the integrity of the proceedings of  the House, and I believe that it is therefore privileged. There is just  not an issue that is more fundamental to the integrity of this House,  the people's House, than the faith the American people have in our  democracy.   That sacred faith is being undermined. It is under assault right now  by President Trump. This House must act to protect the integrity of its  proceedings.  [[Page H5014]]    Now, I know that there are many Members here who are eager to avoid a  direct up-and-down vote on the specific question of covering up the  Trump tax returns, and that there have been nine previous times when  Members have come to the floor and presented resolutions that were  focused on trying to get those returns and to end the coverup.   Recognizing the Speaker's prior rulings nine times against  considering this measure, I have, today, offered a different  resolution, taking a new approach that I bring to the Speaker's  attention. Unlike the last nine resolutions, my resolution does not  direct the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider action on  these secreted tax returns.   I believe it should not be ruled out of order on the grounds that  were used the previous nine times that this type of resolution was  blocked. This coverup of the Trump returns must end, and that is why I  have taken a different approach.   Pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United States  Constitution, what we know as the Origination Clause, the House of  Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that  raises revenue for the national government.   As the Speaker knows, that means the House Ways and Means Committee,  on which I serve, on which Mr. Pascrell, who I know wants to comment on  this point of order, is concerned, for this House to exercise with  integrity its authority to originate tax legislation. This is authority  that it solely possesses. The American people should know how the  President and his family might personally benefit from the tax  legislation, either in their direct personal income or through the many  business intermediaries with which they work. I believe some 500-plus  entities reported on their financial disclosure statement.   President Trump, we know, has bragged publicly about his ability to  bend the Tax Code to his whim in the past. He has said only he can  ``fix it.''   And the question is: Will he fix it for himself, or fix it for  working families? Will he enrich the middle class with jobs, or simply  enrich himself and other billionaires like him?   While recently Mr. Trump has provided us a single page of clues  concerning the contents of his tax plan that they now say will be  provided fully in September, he has not given us much detail. But he  does give us a few clues off that one page. One is his proposal to  repeal the alternative minimum tax. We know if that had been the law,  if that Trump proposal had been in effect for the one year, 2005, that  we have his return, he would have paid about the amount that an  employee does on their Social Security. It would have saved him $30  million.   I understand that there are many here that simply don't want to look  under the rock to see what is contained in those returns. And there are  many who believe that Mr. Trump is the golden ticket to more prized tax  breaks, to more ending of consumer protection, and they have been  rather quiet about the tax return issue, about the conflicts of  interest, and about the potential foreign collusion.   But after all the resolutions presented here on the floor, nine, plus  the amendments that I have offered in the Ways and Means Committee that  have been rejected, I can say that, while there has not been progress  yet on the House floor, there has been progress.   Mr. Trump has responded. He provided a one-page letter from a lawyer  that reviewed his tax returns, and that lawyer gave a Good Housekeeping  ``seal of approval'' to assure us--``to assure America he had no  business dealings with the Russians as a result of reviewing the  returns.''   What he did not say was that the same law firm had boasted of what  they call the prestigious honor of being named the ``Russia Law Firm of  the Year.'' I would just say today, in response specifically to the  point of order, that it is not sufficient to preserve the integrity of  this House to rely on the ``Russia Law Firm of the Year'' to be the  only entity that reviews these returns.                                time  1345    I believe that we can do better; that we must protect the dignity of  the House.   According to Mr. Trump himself, he is already being investigated for  obstruction of justice. It is important for us to have the tax returns  on tax reform. It is important to have it on the Russia investigation.   And, you know, there is hardly an hour that goes by, certainly a day  that goes by, that there is not some additional information. When I  opened The Washington Post this morning, right there on the front  page----    Certainly.   And one of those aspects of the question of privilege is how  conflicts of interest interface with what we are doing here in the  House. I mentioned the tax returns and the Russia investigation, but  there is a new one out today, and that is in the budget. I assume  eventually we are going to have a budget resolution presented here,  though it is very late this year. But when we take up that budget  resolution and we take up the appropriation bills, The Washington Post  reports that, while there have been significant cuts in the Housing and  Urban Development budget, as many people cannot afford housing--    I would do nothing else, Mr. Speaker.   And this particular example shows how the proceedings of the House  would be impaired if the only aspect of the budget that increases HUD  is one from which Mr. Trump personally benefits, which is what the Post  is reporting, and so we need the returns in order to see that.   Like so many other broken promises, we will not get these returns  voluntarily. I believe that the House needs to act. Unlike Sally Yates,  unlike the U.S. attorney in New York, and unlike James Comey, he can't  fire us, and we don't have to be accessories to a coverup.   I call on this House to protect the integrity of its proceedings,  including the integrity of our unique constitutional authority over tax  legislation, by declaring that this resolution is in order. This  resolution simply calls on the House to secure the tax return and  return information on Mr. Trump and his businesses. It further declares  that, in order to preserve the integrity of the House, we will not be  taking up tax reform legislation, which we certainly need to take up,  and we have ideas to offer and to cooperate in trying to see reform of  our taxes, but not do it until we have had an opportunity to review  thoroughly Mr. Trump's tax returns and return information to ascertain  how he may personally benefit.   I would hope that the Speaker, considering my comments, as well as  those that I know Mr. Pascrell wants to offer, would be ruling that we  can have that straight up-and-down vote, no hiding behind a rock, let  us look under the rock.   I appreciate the Speaker giving me this opportunity to emphasize the  very significant importance of this question to the integrity of the  House and to the future of the American people and our democracy.    Mr. Speaker, I most reluctantly, after the Speaker's  careful consideration of this, must appeal the ruling of the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
