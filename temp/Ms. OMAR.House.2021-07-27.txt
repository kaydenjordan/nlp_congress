 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced four of the  amendments in this en bloc.   My first amendment would allow the Federal Government to start  researching new economic metrics that would take into account the well- being of American families in a way that our current GDP measure does  not.   The second amendment addresses challenges posed by COVID to  remittances and how the Federal Government could better facilitate  these lifelines for fragile countries.   My T-HUD amendment makes sure the Federal Government is helping  manufactured housing communities cope with the pandemic.   And, lastly, my Interior amendment ensures that the NEA prioritizes  grants for projects that preserve civil rights art, such as the  projects within the George Floyd Memorial site in Minneapolis.    Thank you to the Appropriations Committee for including these  amendments that will help my district and many more.
