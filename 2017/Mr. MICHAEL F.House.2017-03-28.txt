 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 34.   Today, colleagues, we are waist deep in the swamp. The American  people did not ask for this resolution.   In fact, no company will even put its name behind this effort.  Instead, this resolution is the result of an explicit written request  from Washington lobbyists. These lobbyists make the bogus claim that  having actual protections will confuse consumers and the only way to  help clear up this information is to have no rules at all.   No consumer has come forward to support this position. No consumer  has said this argument even makes sense.   I challenge every Member of this body at your next townhall meeting  to have a show of hands of how many people think it is a good idea to  allow your internet service provider to sell their personal information  without their permission.                                time  1600    Then after you get that show of hands, ask them how many of them  would vote for you if you support allowing corporations to do that.   This resolution is of the swamp and for the swamp and no one else.  The rules of this resolution would overturn rules that are simple and  make common sense. They don't require much, only three things:   One, internet service providers should ask permission before selling  your private internet browsing history, app usage, or other sensitive  information;   Two, once they have your information, internet service providers  should take reasonable measures to protect it; and   Finally, if the information gets stolen, the company should quickly  let you know.   That is it. That is all that is being asked of them.   These modest rules don't stop internet service providers from using  data for advertising and profiling or whatever else so long as they ask  first.   ISPs have an obligation under these rules not to dive into the  personal lives of Americans unless that is what those Americans want.  They just need to ask first.   This is particularly true because broadband providers see literally  everything you do online, every website you visit, every app, every  device, every time. By analyzing your internet usage and browsing  history, these companies will know more about you than members of your  own family, more than you tell your doctor, more than you know about  yourself. Without these rules, these companies don't have to ask before  selling all of that information, and they don't have to take reasonable  measures to protect that information when they collect it.   Make no mistake about this, colleagues: Anyone who votes for this  bill is telling your constituents that they no longer have the freedom  to decide how to control their own information. You have given that  freedom away to big corporations. More importantly, there aren't rules  to fall back on if Congress scraps these.   Critics of the rules argue that the Federal Trade Commission should  oversee the privacy protection for broadband providers, but, under  current law, they have no authority to do so, and the CRA won't do a  thing to fix that. Under a Federal court of appeals case, the FTC has  no authority over mobile broadband providers at all.   And to those that say the FCC can evaluate complaints on a case-by- case basis using its statutory authority, the current Chairman--your  current Chairman--stated that section 222 cannot be used to protect  personal information and that rules are necessary to enforce this  statute.   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a statement by the FCC  Commissioner.               Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Ajit Pai       Re TerraCom, Inc. and YourTel America, Inc., Apparent           Liability for Forfeiture, File No. EB-TCD-13-00009175.         A core principle of the American legal system is due       process. The government cannot sanction you for violating the       law unless it has told you what the law is.        In the regulatory context, due process is protected, in       part, through the fair warning rule. Specifically, the D.C.       Circuit has stated that ``[i]n the absence of notice--for       example, where the regulation is not sufficiently clear to       warn a party about what is expected of it--an agency may not       deprive a party of property.'' Thus, an agency cannot at once       invent and enforce a legal obligation.        Yet this is precisely what has happened here. In this case,       there is no pre-existing legal obligation to protect       personally identifiable information (also known as PII) or       notify customers of a PII data breach to enforce. The       Commission has never interpreted the Communications Act to       impose an enforceable duty on carriers to ``employ reasonable       data security practices to protect'' PII. The Commission has       never expounded a duty that carriers notify all consumers of       a data breach of PII. The Commission has never adopted rules       regarding the misappropriation, breach, or unlawful       disclosure of PII. The Commission never identifies in the       entire Notice of Apparent Liability a single rule that has       been violated.        Nevertheless, the Commission asserts that these companies       violated novel legal interpretations and never-adopted rules.       And it seeks to impose a substantial financial penalty. In so       doing, the Commission runs afoul of the fair warning rule. I       cannot support such ``sentence first, verdict afterward''       decision-making.        To the extent that the circumstances giving rise to today's       item merited the Commission's attention, there was a better       (and lawful) path forward. We could have opened a notice-and-      comment rulemaking. This process would have given the public       an opportunity to speak. And in turn, the agency would have       had a chance to formulate clear, well-considered rules--rules       we then could have enforced against anyone who violated them.       Instead, the Commission proposes a forfeiture today that, if       actually imposed, has little chance of surviving judicial       review.        One more thing. The Commission asserts that the base       forfeiture for these violations is nine billion dollars--      that's $9,000,000,000--which is by far the biggest in our       history. It strains credulity to think that Congress intended       such massive potential liability for ``telecommunications       carriers'' but not retailers or banks or insurance companies       or tech companies or cable operators or any of the myriad       other businesses that possess consumers' PII. Nor can I       understand how such liability can be squared with the       Enforcement Bureau's recent consent decrees with these       companies. Under those consent decrees, the companies paid       the Treasury $440,000 and $160,000 for flouting our actual       rules and draining the Universal Service Fund by seeking       Lifeline support multiple times for the same customer.        Consumer protection is a critical component of the agency's       charge to promote the public interest. But any enforcement       action we take in that regard must comport with the law. For       the reasons stated above, I dissent.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Without these protections,  there will be no clear rules of the road. At a time when foreign actors  like the Russians, the Chinese, and everyone else under the sun are  constantly trying to steal our data and compromise our security, it  would be irresponsible to roll back the only Federal safeguards we  have. I want my colleagues to think long and hard before you give  corporations the ability to sell your information without their  permission.   Mr. Speaker, I include several articles in the Record by Free Press  and the Open Technology Institute opposing the CRA, an op-ed from a  current  [[Page H2491]]  FTC Commissioner opposing this CRA, and a memorandum from engineers at  EFF opposing this CRA.                      [From Free Press, May 10, 2016]     Pay-for-Privacy Schemes Put the Most Vulnerable Americans at Risk                             (By Sandra Fulton)         The FCC has opened a proceeding on the rules and policies       surrounding privacy rights for broadband service. One       industry practice called into question in that proceeding       could have a devastating impact on our most vulnerable       populations.        Internet service providers charge broadband customers a ton       for Internet access. ISPs are increasingly finding new       revenue streams too, by taking part in the multibillion-      dollar market that's evolved out of selling users' personal       information to online marketers. As the debate around privacy       has heated up, ISPs have tried to placate the public's       growing interest in privacy protections while maintaining       revenues they can get when they auction off their customers'       valuable personal information.        One proposed solution that AT&T has largely ``pioneered''?       Have customers pay to preserve their privacy.        The potential harms and discriminatory implications of this       practice are obvious. It could mean that only people with the       necessary financial means could protect their privacy and       prevent their ISPs from sharing their personal information       with predatory online marketers. The FCC rulemaking       proceeding seeks comments on whether to allow such       ``financial inducements'' for the surrender of private       information. If the agency decides not to ban such practices       outright, it wants to know how it should regulate them.        As our lives have moved online, ISPs have gained access to       our most sensitive personal information. Advanced       technologies allow companies to track us invisibly,       collecting and selling data on nearly every detail of what we       do online.        But ISPs don't just stop at knowing what we're doing. The       location tracking that's needed to provide mobile service to       our phones lets the ISPs know when and where we do it too.       And they can figure out the people and organizations we       associate with by looking at who we talk to and which       websites we visit.        As ISPs track their customers, they create comprehensive       dossiers containing sensitive information on each person's       finances, health, age, race, religion and ethnicity. Their       reach is so pervasive that information like a visit to a       website discussing mental health, a search on how to collect       unemployment benefits, or a visit to a church or Planned       Parenthood office could be swept up into their databases.        How do you feel about your ISP selling such a personal       glimpse into your life to online advertisers? Under a pay-      for-privacy scheme, you wouldn't need to worry about it so       long as you could afford to shell out the hush money. But       those who aren't so fortunate would have to relinquish any       control over how their personal data is spread across the       Web.        The FCC raised concerns about this dynamic when it launched       its rulemaking proceeding, noting that such pay-for-privacy       practices might disadvantage low-income people and members of       other vulnerable communities. But it didn't make any specific       recommendations or issue any proposals on how to regulate in       this space.        Long before the FCC launched this inquiry at the end of       March 2016, and even before the agency had clarified its       authority to protect broadband users in the February 2015       Open Internet Order, AT&T's GigaPower broadband service had       become one of the first pay-for-privacy plans on the market.       The AT&T deal allows customers to opt out of some information       sharing if they pay an extra $29 a month or more.        For a struggling family, that could mean choosing between       paying for privacy and paying for groceries or the public       transportation needed to get to work. And while AT&T might be       the first to launch this kind of service, an article in       Fortune notes that other companies are eager to roll out       similar plans.        Under pay-for-privacy models, consumers who are unable to       pay the higher broadband cost will likely see their ISPs       share their data with shadowy online data brokers who use       this information to tailor marketing messages. While       unregulated and unaccountable data brokers are a threat to       everyone's privacy, they're notorious for targeting low-      income communities, people of color and other vulnerable       demographics.        One particularly damning report from the Senate Commerce       Committee offered this glimpse into how these brokers       categorize and label these target audiences:        The Senate committee's report notes, for example, that the       ``Hard Times'' category includes people who are ``Older,       down-scale and ethnically diverse singles typically       concentrated in inner-city apartments.''        It continues: ``This is the bottom of the socioeconomic       ladder, the poorest lifestyle segment in the nation. Hard       Times are older singles in poor city neighborhoods. Nearly       three-quarters of the adults are between the ages of 50 and       75; this is an underclass of the working poor and destitute       seniors without family support . . .''        These classifications can influence not just what kinds of       ads people see, but the interest rates they're offered or the       insurance premiums they pay. These targeted communities are       precisely the ones who can't pay extra to shield their       personal information from these dangerous companies.        There may be some argument that if big companies are going       to profit from our data anyway, it's actually good if their       customers get a share of that. The FCC's rulemaking proposal       notes that brickand-mortar stores and websites alike offer       all sorts of ``free'' services, discounts and perks in       exchange for the data they mine from their customers and       users.        But the nature of the broadband market--where users have no       real options when it comes to choosing their providers, and       no way to opt out short of staying offline--makes the       tradeoffs here especially worthy of attention. If users could       get fair value for their data, and if they got a real       discount on broadband and not just a privacy penalty, and if       they were providing truly informed consent with full       knowledge of all the pernicious uses data brokers have for       their information, then maybe we could have a conversation       about the fairness of such schemes. But those are some very       big ifs.        We need better transparency rules for marketers and easy-      to-use disclosures and opt-in mechanisms before we get there.       We also need strong baseline privacy protections guaranteed       for all, including rules that prohibit ISPs from using       discriminatory schemes that jeopardize the rights of their       most vulnerable customers.        We applaud the FCC for taking this crucial first step to       protect privacy from broadband ISPs' overreach and abuse. As       gatekeepers to the Internet, ISPs hold a wealth of       information about their customers, and the Communications Act       commands the FCC to establish strong safeguards for that       private info. But the FCC also must also remember that our       rights are not for sale--and that privacy is not a luxury for       the wealthy.                                   ____                                ISPs Know All            you deserve more privacy from your broadband provider                               (By Eric Null)         As you read this post, your internet service provider is       collecting information about you: what you're reading right       now on Slate, what URL you go to next, what time of day it       is, and whether you're on your home computer or your mobile       device, among many other data points. Your ISP has similar       data about apps you've used, how much data you consume at any       given time of day, and your other daily internet habits and       rhythms. Of course, your ISP has other up-to-date personal       information as well--things like your name, address,       telephone number, credit card number, and likely your Social       Security number. In this way, ISPs have access to a uniquely       detailed, comprehensive, and accurate view of you and every       other subscriber. All of this at a time when consumer concern       over privacy is increasing and has actually caused people to       refrain from engaging in e-commerce and other activities       online.        To make matters worse, you are essentially powerless to       limit the data your ISP collects about you. While you may, in       some instances, defend yourself against tracking by websites       and apps by disallowing cookies or turning on ``Do Not       Track'' in your browser settings, in many cases there is no       way to protect against ISP tracking except by avoiding the       internet altogether.        While there are some tools that can help consumers protect       themselves, they are not prevalent. For example, ISPs cannot       see full website addresses when that site uses encryption--      denoted by a small lock icon in your browser bar. However,       the website--not you--decides whether it will use encryption.       And while Netflix traffic is encrypted (so your ISP only       knows you're watching videos, not specifically which ones       you're watching), WebMD traffic is not (so your ISP likely       knows every page you've visited on WebMD), even though       medical symptoms are clearly much more personal than your       favorite TV program.        Another example of ways consumers can purportedly protect       themselves is through virtual private networks, or VPNs,       which route web traffic through another network and therefore       effectively ``hide'' the traffic from the person's ISP. But       VPNs are difficult to use and configure. They often cost       extra money, slow down your browsing, and simply send your       data through some other access provider that may be       collecting data about you, too. These options are not       practical defenses for most consumers.        Currently, there are no rules to prevent your ISP from       using these data for almost any purpose, including       categorizing you and serving you advertisements based on       those categories. Targeted ads may even be based on whether       you have (or the ISP has inferred you have) a certain disease       or what your income level is. Recently, Cable One was found       to be using predictive analytics to determine which of its       customers were ``hollow'' (that is, had low credit scores)       and then offering them low-quality customer service. Cable       One technicians, the company's CEO stated, aren't going to       ``spend 15 minutes setting up an iPhone app'' for someone       with a low credit score. Of course, making decisions based on       credit scores is going to disproportionately affect       communities of color and other vulnerable populations.       Additionally, the data ISPs collect, often compiled into a       ``profile,'' might be sold to third parties (like advertisers       or data brokers) and used and reused for purposes for which       they were not initially collected--in ways that often annoy       people, such as when personal information is used to send a       ``barrage of unwanted  [[Page H2492]]       emails.'' And as the number of entities who hold your data       increases, so too does the chance those data will be       compromised by a leak or hack.        So you may find yourself between a rock and a hard place:       Use the internet and give up your privacy, or forego internet       access entirely--something that's not exactly reasonable. But       there is good news. The Federal Communications Commission is       trying to make sure that you and all other ISP customers       don't have to confront this choice. In 2015, as part of       decision to uphold net neutrality, the FCC ruled that ISPs       are ``common carriers.'' (The U.S. Court of Appeals for the       District of Columbia Circuit recently upheld that ruling.)       Since then, the FCC has had a statutory obligation to protect       the data ISPs collect about their customers. To accomplish       that, the FCC recently proposed a new rule that would require       ISPs, in most cases, to seek opt-in consent from customers       before using data collected for purposes other than to       provide service, such as to deliver certain kinds of ads or       to sell to data brokers. That means that if the rule passes,       your ISP would have to notify you of any new intended use of       the data and give you the opportunity to say ``yes, that is       OK with me'' or ``no, that is not OK with me.'' Of key       importance in this rule is that if you said ``no,'' your ISP       couldn't just refuse to serve you--it would have to respect       your wishes and still provide you with service.        The FCC's proposal should be enacted, because you should       not have to trade your privacy to access the internet. (New       America's Open Technology Institute, where I work, has been       actively engaged on this issue and has submitted comments in       the record. New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona       State University in Future Tense.) It should go without       saying, but it's important enough that I will say it anyway:       Internet access is imperative for personal and professional       success in today's digital world. Yet to gain access to the       most important tool of the 21st century, you have to allow       your ISP access to incredibly rich and private information       about what you do online. You should get to control what it       does with that data. Consumers deserve real choice when it       comes to protecting their data, and the opt-in regime       proposed by the FCC is a huge step in the right direction.        Yet--perhaps unsurprisingly--ISPs and several House       committees have responded to the FCC's proposal as if the sky       is falling. They have mounted an all-out assault on the idea       that you should have the right to choose how ISPs use your       data. Their arguments range from the highly dubious (the       proposal exceeds the FCC's authority) to the downright silly       (consumers will be confused by having different privacy rules       for ISPs as compared with other companies, like search       engines and social networks). Chances are your ISP is telling       the FCC that you don't need protections against exploitation       of your data. (If you're interested, you can see exactly what       your ISP is saying--here are the responses from AT&T,       Comcast, CenturyLink, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint; unnamed       ISPs may be represented by various trade associations like       the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and       CTIA for wireless.) However, as with the net neutrality       debate that led to this proposal, consumers may feel       differently.        The FCC has proposed a very strong rule that will help       protect ISP customers from exploitative uses of their data.       This battle for consumer choice will be ongoing for many       months, but soon, you may finally be able to choose both       having internet access and protecting your privacy.                                   ____                                   Electronic Frontier Foundation,                                                  San Francisco, CA.  Five Ways Americans' Cybersecurity Will Suffer If Congress Repeals the                             FCC Privacy Rules         If the House votes to repeal the FCC's recent privacy       rules, Americans' cybersecurity will be put at risk. That's       because privacy and security are two sides of the same coin:       privacy is about controlling who has access to information       about you, and security is how you maintain that control. You       usually can't break one without breaking the other, and       that's especially true in this context. To show how, here are       five ways repealing the FCC's privacy rules will weaken       Americans' cybersecurity.        1. Internet providers will record our browsing history, and       the systems they use to record that information (not to       mention the information itself) will become very tempting       targets for hackers. (Just imagine what would happen if a       foreign hacker thought she could blackmail a politician or a       celebrity based on their browsing history.)        2. In order to record encrypted browsing history (i.e.       https websites), Internet providers will start deploying       systems that remove the encryption so they can inspect the       data. Although US-CERT (part of DHS) just put out an alert       saying that this is extremely dangerous for Americans'       cybersecurity, FCC Chairman Pai just decided not to enforce       rules that keep Internet providers from doing this.        3. Internet providers will insert ads into our browsing,       but that could break the existing code on webpages. That       means security features might be broken, which could expose       Americans to a greater risk of attack.        4. Internet providers will insert tracking tags into our       browsing--and that means every website will be able to track       you, not just your Internet provider, and there's nothing you       can do to stop them.        5. Internet providers will pre-install software to record       information directly from our mobile phones (after all, it's       just one more source of information they can monetize). But       if the software that does that recording has bugs or       vulnerabilities, hackers could break into that software, and       then access everything the Internet provider could see. Do       you trust your Internet provider, which can't even keep an       appointment to fix your cable, to write completely bug-free       software?        The net result is simple: repealing the FCC's privacy rules       won't just be a disaster for Americans' privacy. It will be a       disaster for America's cybersecurity, too.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my  friends that, under current law, the FTC has no authority to regulate  ISPs and that it was your Commissioner, your current FCC Commissioner,  that said that they can't do it under section 222 also, which I have  submitted for the record.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Eshoo).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would just  remind my colleague, once again, that the FTC has no authority to  regulate ISPs once this bill is implemented; and consumers will not be  protected, and their current FCC Commissioner has stated that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Ms. DeGette).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as  to how much time remains on both sides?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my  colleagues that, whether it is nonsensitive information or sensitive  information, the ISP should ask for your permission to use it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind my  friend, since he acknowledges the court decision does not allow FTC  jurisdiction and that he wants to introduce a bill, perhaps the  Republicans should have done that first, before scrapping the rules  that leave ISPs with no rules.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have heard about  this last-minute dropping and late at night. Just for the other side's  information, after a 7-month rulemaking process, this rule was adopted  midday on October 26. So let's get the record straight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McNerney).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time is remaining on both sides?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind the  gentleman that these heavy-handed regulations that he speaks of are  simply: ask permission, protect people's data, and tell them if it gets  stolen.   That doesn't sound too heavy-handed to me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Tonko).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind my  friends once again that this does not put us on equal footing. The FTC  has no power to regulate ISPs under current law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Capuano).                                time  1645     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an  additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time remains on both sides?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I just remind my  friend, you can say it as many times as you want, but the fact of the  matter is that, under current law, the FTC has no authority to regulate  the FCC, and the FCC Commissioner has said that you cannot do this  without a rule in section 222.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our  House Democratic leader, the magic minute.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time I have remaining?    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record letters from a coalition of small ISPs, a coalition of civil  rights organizations, the Consumers Union, and an article by Terrell  McSweeny all opposing this CRA.

Dear U.S. Representatives: We, the undersigned founders,       executives, and employees of ISPs and networking companies,       spend our working lives ensuring that Americans have high-      quality, fast, reliable, and locally provided choices       available when they need to connect to the Internet. One of       the cornerstones of our businesses is respecting the privacy       of our customers, and it is for that primary reason that we       are writing to you today.        We urge Congress to preserve the FCC's Broadband Privacy       Rules and vote down plans to abolish them. If the rules are       repealed, large ISPs across America would resume spying on       their customers, selling their data, and denying them a       practical and informed choice in the matter.        Perhaps if there were a healthy, free, transparent, and       competitive market for Internet services in this country,       consumers could choose not to use those companies' products.       But small ISPs like ours face many structural obstacles, and       many Americans have very limited choices: a monopoly or       duopoly on the wireline side, and a highly consolidated       cellular market dominated by the same wireline firms.        Under those circumstances, the FCC's Broadband Privacy       Rules are the only way that most Americans will retain the       free market choice to browse the Web without being surveilled       by the company they pay for an Internet connection.

Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, Representative       Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: The undersigned media justice,       consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups       strongly urge you to oppose the use of the Congressional       Review Act (CRA) to adopt a Resolution of Disapproval       overturning the FCC's broadband privacy order. That order       implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996       Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan       majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications       users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising       lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry       attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a       say in how their private information may be used.        Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the       agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish       internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the       agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996       Act. This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful       as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry       up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt       intemet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy       rules at the FCC. As you know, a successful CRA on the       privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any       ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in       direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222       that telecommunications carriers protect their customers'       privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any       of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data       breach notification and from revisiting these issues as       technology continues to evolve in the future. The true       consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when       considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules.       Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer       information at will. The result could be extensive harm       caused by breaches or misuse of data.        Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers       to everything on the intemet, have a largely unencumbered       view into their customers' online communications. That       includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and       the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted,       ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their       users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the       most sensitive information remains unencrypted.        The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their       personal information and lets them choose the terms on which       ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are       increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases       have begun to censor their online activity for fear their       personal information may be compromised. Consumers have       repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy       protections and their belief that the government helps ensure       those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband       customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be       honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to       market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted       offers.        The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules       has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule       are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and       trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a       full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there       complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with       other large advertising companies and platforms like Google       and Facebook. To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will       continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their       customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such       uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that       informed consent.        The ISPs and their trade associations already have several       petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the       FCC. Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a       ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband       privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its       statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission       itself All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only       is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily       mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom       customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th       Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&T, common       carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning       that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband       customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the       FCC's rules here.        This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups,       who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and       reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA       request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and       to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or       enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under       Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how       their private information can be used and no protection       against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose       consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm       caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging       to consumers.        Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that       telecommunications carriers protect the information they       collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask       Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act,       enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the       FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a       blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance,       where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding       ISPs' disagreement with them.        We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of       disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy       rule.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and       mobilization arm of Consumer  [[Page H2500]]       Reports, writes regarding House consideration of S.J. Res.       34, approved by a 50-48 party line vote in the Senate last       week.        This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law       by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to       nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly-      enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better       control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer       confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy       rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion       and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy       protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly       oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers       of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them       with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.J.       Res. 34.        The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer-      friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over       how their information is collected by internet service       providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit       consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove       of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history       or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe       the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward.        ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to       everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into       consumers' online activities. Data including websites       consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very       valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard       to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of       the Congressional Review Act. But we should make no mistake:       abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits       big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers.        Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as       those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband       providers' privacy and data security practices should be       returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect       to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently       possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs       thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made       stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's       AT&T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and       time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid       of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is       such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all.        For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy       practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II       reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time-      consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the       legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Order. Congress, in       turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common       carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over       those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress       would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy       the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a       result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to       happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of       privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to       privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy       protections favored by most corporations.        There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current       broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online       petition drive last month in support of the Commission's       strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed       the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than       24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to       oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the       vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong       privacy protections afforded to the them by the FCC. Any       removal or watering down of those rules would represent the       destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers.        Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the       Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from       adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect       consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a ride is       erased, an agency cannot move forward with any       ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new       legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts,       this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but       then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative       process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt       instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti-      consumer.        We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow       Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords       consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The       FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the       broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them       via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward.       Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.J. Res. 34.            Respectfully,      Laura MacCleery,        Vice President, Consumer Policy & Mobilization, Consumer       Reports.

Jonathan Schwantes,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.                                   ____                       [From wired.com, Mar. 22, 2017]             Congress Is About To Give Away Your Online Privacy                 (By Terrell McSweeney and Chris Hoofnagle)         The resolution that could come to a Congressional vote this       week aims to tackle differences in how the FCC rule treats       ISPs compared with other internet companies. Your broadband       provider has to offer you a choice about what information it       shares about you, but ecommerce sites and search engines do       not.        Advocates for repealing the current protections--the       resolution is sponsored by Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)--argue       that Congress should void the FCC's rule using the       Congressional Review Act. They contend that in order to       properly govern privacy and avoid confusing consumers, the       FCC should maintain consistent rules across the internet       ecosystem. But inconsistent standards pervade privacy and       consumer law. Furthermore, consistent standards militate in       favor of increasing protections for privacy, rather than       unraveling them as the current proposal would do.        An alphabet soup of state and federal laws set the privacy       requirements for everything from our financial information to       data about our children. That's largely because privacy is       both essential to and sometimes in conflict with our most       deeply held value, liberty. So, legislators have never been       able to craft omnibus privacy protections. Instead, they've       developed frameworks informed by prevailing norms,       incentives, political economy, and ways the information might       be used.        As we connect more devices in our home and on our bodies,       the array of technologies that raise data privacy and       security concerns is expanding. The privacy landscape will       likely continue to be shaped as technologies evolve.        Different consumer technologies may justify different       approaches. For example, the safety issues inherent in cars       and medical devices may warrant particularly strong privacy       and security protections. In the future, privacy rules could       come from the FCC as well as the Department of Commerce,       National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Food and Drug       Administration, and other agencies.        Consider that your bank can--and probably does--sell your       contact and financial information unless you opt out. Yet if       you rent a movie, online or off, the rental service can't       sell information about your media consumption without your       consent, and it must delete your rental history after it's no       longer needed. Congress enacted those protections to shield       intellectual freedom, so that one can enjoy controversial       movies without fear of one's curiosity resulting in extortion       or embarrassment.        This brings us to our second point: If consistency and       reducing consumer confusion is the goal, consumers should       demand stronger internet privacy norms. Given the animating       purpose of protecting movie rental information, why not       require consumers to consent to the sharing any information       about their online behavior? After all, our web activity is       the ultimate manifestation of our intellectual curiosity,       representing second-by-second decisions about consuming news       and entertainment.        In addition to existing federal laws, legislators could, as       professor Helen Nissenbaum has suggested, look to offline       contexts, such as the strong privacy norms governing       searching for a book in a library, to guide the privacy rules       we ought to enjoy when using a search engine. The government       also could take a page from the confidentiality standards       patients enjoy when conversing with physicians and apply       those same norms to medical information websites.       Policymakers could look to the last two centuries of privacy       in the postal mail to guide rules for commercial scanning of       email. Yet in all these contexts, web business models drive       design decisions that have turned social and personal       behaviors into marketplace transactions.        Left standing, the FCC rule offers an opportunity for a       meaningful debate about how to better translate our analog       privacy norms into the digital world. Broadband ISPs are       essentially utilities, like postal mail and the telephone.       Subscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which       provider to use. ISPs know our identities, and their position       gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways       that others cannot. It makes sense to ensure consumers can       choose whether to share data related to their Internet usage.        The majority of consumers--91 percent in a recent survey--      feel they've lost control of their personal information. Yet,       paradoxically, the late, great privacy researcher and       historian Alan Westin consistently found that Americans       expect companies to handle personal data in a       ``confidential'' way. In reality, the modern internet is like       a one-way mirror, where users are often unaware that they are       being silently watched by third parties. The FCC rule exposes       this one-way mirror and allows people to decide whether to       draw a curtain on it.        Maintaining the current rules would make ISP practices more       consistent with consumers' expectations of confidentiality.       Congress should spend time examining the  [[Page H2501]]       strengths and weaknesses of our current approach, instead of       using consistency arguments to eviscerate the FCC's rule.
