 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Keith Bicsak of Cascade County for his longstanding  commitment to providing medical response and transport for countless  sick and injured Montanans through his role as a critical care flight  paramedic.   For 52 years, Keith has diligently provided emergency medical  services--EMS--to folks throughout the Treasure State. His time-honored  career is a testament to his passion and expertise in providing  emergent lifesaving care. Keith's calling to selfless service began  with his family's own ambulance service, Bicsak Emergency Air  Transport--BEAT--which later became Mercy Flight, its esteemed crew  proudly serving Montanans today.   EMS providers like Keith and the lifesaving care they deliver remain  a vital component to the overall health and wellness of the State of  Montana and the United States of America. These men and women choose to  put their lives on the line as they stand ready to respond to any  disaster or crisis they may encounter. Professionalism, expertise, and  grace under fire enable these heroes to deliver swift and efficient  lifesaving care to families in need.   Keith's passion for helping Montanans is evident through his  distinguished career, as he now steps into a new season of life and  enjoys a well-deserved retirement. As Keith reflects back on his time  as an EMS provider, he is quick to point out the great experience it  has been and the ``work families'' he has made along the way. He  continues to encourage younger generations to pursue careers in  emergency services to help build up Montana's EMS workforce in order to  ensure needs are being met in every corner of the State.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Keith Bicsak for his revered 52  years of frontline service in helping Montanans reach health and  safety. I am confident that Keith's work as an EMS provider will long  be remembered and appreciated by families throughout the Treasure  State. Thank you for your selfless service, Keith. You make Montana  proud.                            ____________________
