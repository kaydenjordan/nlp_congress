 Mr. Speaker, I stand before you proud-- proud of Pennsylvania; proud of my Democratic colleagues in the  Pennsylvania House; proud of the thousands of volunteers who helped  deliver a statehouse majority last November in Pennsylvania, a house  majority that on this last day of Black History Month is celebrating  history--or should I say her-story--Pennsylvania made today.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate and celebrate Representative Joanna  McClinton, my colleague, my friend, and, as of today, speaker of the  Pennsylvania House, the first woman, the first African-American woman,  to be called Madam Speaker.   Speaker McClinton follows in the footsteps of men like Leroy Irvis,  the first African-American speaker of the Pennsylvania House, and  African-American trailblazers like Barbara Jordan and Karen Bass.   What a crucial time in our State's history, our Nation's history, to  have Speaker McClinton lead us, a time when we can fairly fund our  education, rebuild roads, and combat gun violence and the opioid  epidemic while protecting the planet for our children and children to  come.   Joanna, a mother, a minister, a former public defender, now our  speaker, what a way to end Black History Month. Congratulations to the  Pennsylvania House. Congratulations, and Godspeed, Speaker McClinton.  [[Page H954]]                                ____________________
