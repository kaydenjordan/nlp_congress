 Mr. President, we are beginning to receive the first  bits of information about the Senate Republican healthcare bill, which  has until now been shrouded in absolute secrecy.   I can see why. Even as we continue to get more details, the broad  outlines are clear. This is a bill designed to strip away healthcare  benefits and protections from Americans who need it most in order to  give a tax break to the folks who need it least.   This is a bill that would end Medicaid as we know it, rolling back  Medicaid expansion, cutting Federal support for the program even more  than the House bill, which cut Medicaid by $800 billion.   Let me remind everyone in this Chamber, Medicaid is not just a health  insurance program for Americans struggling in poverty, though that is  an important and necessary part of it. Medicaid is increasingly a  middle-class program. Medicaid is how many Americans are able to access  opioid abuse treatment, Medicaid foots the bill for two-thirds of all  Americans living in nursing homes, and Medicaid provides the cushion,  particularly in rural areas, so hospitals can survive and give topnotch  healthcare to all of us.   From what is reported, in just 3 short years under the Senate bill,  Republicans will take millions off their Medicaid coverage, and then,  starting in 2025, the plan will institute even more Medicaid cuts, and  each year those cuts get deeper than the year before. Within 10 years  of this new funding system, the cuts to Medicaid could total hundreds  of billions of dollars above the more than $800 billion the House bill  already cuts from the program.   Every senior in America should read the fine print of this bill. It  looks as if American seniors could be paying way more. Why do this?  Looking at the bill, the answer is, because the Republicans want to  give a tax break to the wealthiest Americans--those making over  $200,000 a year--and set themselves up to give these folks another,  even larger tax cut in their tax bill.   Even though much of the early reporting says that the bill will keep  certain protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, the  truth is, it may well not guarantee them the coverage they need by  allowing States to waive essential health benefits. What the bill is  saying to those Americans is that insurance still has to cover you, but  it doesn't have to cover what you may actually need. It doesn't have to  cover all or even most of your costs.   If you need treatment for opioid addiction, your plan may no longer  cover it. If you are pregnant and need maternity care, your plan may  have decided that is too expensive. The coverage that Americans with  preexisting conditions actually need may well become either  unaffordable or even nonexistent under this bill.   Simply put, this bill will result----    Not right now--at the end of my remarks.   Simply put, this bill will result in higher costs, less care, and  millions of Americans will lose their health insurance, particularly  through Medicaid. It is every bit as bad as the House bill. In some  ways, it is even worse.   The President said the Senate bill needed heart. The way this bill  cuts healthcare is heartless. The President said the House bill was  mean. The Senate bill may be meaner.   The Senate Republican healthcare bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing,  but this wolf has even sharper teeth than the House bill.   It is clear that Republicans know that cutting Medicaid will hurt so  many people in the middle class, so many in my home State of New York.  Republicans know that people want essential health benefits, so they  have created a disguise by saying that these changes will not occur for  a year. But, in reality, the Senate Republican bill is a wolf in  sheep's clothing, only this wolf has even sharper teeth than the House  bill.    We are potentially voting on it in a week--with no committee  hearings, no amendments in committee, no debate on the floor, save for  10 measly hours, on one of the most important bills we are dealing with  in decades. That brings shame on this body. We won't even know the full  cost or consequence of the bill until CBO scores it, and that could  take a few days more.   How can my friend the majority leader expect this body to fairly  consider this legislation, prepare amendments, and debate it in 1 week  with only 10 hours of debate? How can he expect his own Members to do  the same? Many of them on the Republican side are learning the details  of the bill the same way we Democrats are: They are reading it today.   Now, listen to what the majority leader had to say in 2009 when we  were debating healthcare--his words:         This is a very important issue. . . . We shouldn't try to       do it in the dark. And whatever final bill is produced should       be available to the American public and to Members of the       Senate, certainly, for enough time to  [[Page S3699]]       come to grips with it. . . . And we are going to insist--and       the American people are going to insist--that it be done in a       transparent, fair, and open way.    Is 5 or 6 days enough time for the American people and the Members of  the Senate to come to grips with a bill that affects one-sixth of the  economy and the lives of every American in this country? I don't think  so, neither do the American people and neither do a whole bunch of  Republican Senators.   Senator Cassidy: Would I have preferred a more open process? The  answer is yes.   Senator Collins: I don't think it gives enough time to thoroughly  analyze the bill, but we will see when it comes out.   Member after Member--Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Jerry Moran, Marco  Rubio, Bob Corker--has repeatedly said that this process--in their  words and now in mine--is unfair, it is truncated, and it is rushed.   For my dear friend the majority leader to say we are going to have an  open amendment process is turning truth upside down. I would ask our  leader, rhetorically, because I know the answer: Can we allow at least  1 hour on each amendment, not 2 minutes? Will we have more time than 10  hours to debate the bill? I hope so. But, if not, please don't call  this an open and fair process. If you want to rush it through, admit  the consequences.   The debate over healthcare has been fierce. We know that Republicans  and Democrats had differences when we debated the Affordable Care Act.  At least we had a debate. At least we had committee hearings and a  process. More broadly than that, at least we Democrats were trying to  pass a healthcare bill that helped more Americans afford insurance and  tried to bring costs down and end some of the most egregious practices  of the healthcare industry.   What is this bill--TrumpCare--trying to achieve? It seems designed to  slash support for healthcare programs in order to give tax breaks to  the very wealthy.   When the CBO score comes out, I believe it will verify that millions  of Americans in this great country will be unable to afford insurance  or the insurance they can afford won't cover the services they need.   Somewhere in America there is a family who takes a trip each Friday  to visit grandma or grandpa at a nursing home, who sacrificed all of  their savings to pay for their healthcare until they had no more  savings and now rely on Medicaid to help pay the cost of long-term care  in a nursing home.   Somewhere in America there is a father who is eaten up inside  watching his son struggle with opioid addiction, who knows in his heart  that his son will be able to go on and live a healthy and fulfilling  life if he could only afford treatment to get him out from under this  devastating addiction.   Somewhere in America there is a parent whose child has cancer, a  mother and father who stay up late at night worried that their  insurance will either not be available or run out when the family needs  it most.   In the America that my Republican friends envision with this  healthcare bill, those Americans, and many more besides, might not get  the coverage and care they need.   We live in the wealthiest country on Earth. Surely, surely, we can do  better than what the Republican healthcare bill promises.                    Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1628    Now I have a unanimous consent request. I am going to have to delay  my friend from asking questions until we finish our unanimous consent  requests.   I ask unanimous consent that any substitute or perfecting amendment  offered to Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, not be in order if the text of  the amendment has not been filed at the desk and made available on a  public website for at least 72 hours, along with an analysis by the  Congressional Budget Office of the bill's budgetary, coverage, and cost  implications.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my  colleague Senator Cornyn was going to ask a question, which I will  answer, which was that the minority leader is referring to a bill that  he hasn't seen a copy of because it hasn't yet been released. So the  speech we just heard was about a bill that he hasn't seen.   With regard to his unanimous consent request, I object.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.    Mr. President, leader time.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has the floor.    Mr. President, 142 pages thus far of this supposed bill  have been printed online, and that is what I have used.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority whip.    Would the majority leader yield?   I am the minority leader, at this point.   Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield for a question.    The question is, Does the majority leader know that a  half hour before we came to the floor were 142 pages of the bill listed  online? That is what we used in our report.   I would ask the majority leader a further question: If there is  anything I said--anything I said--that is not going to be in the bill,  could he clarify?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, would my dear colleague from Texas yield  for a question?   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas does not  have the floor. You have the floor.    I would like to just then tell my friend from Texas:  This is the bill. It was posted online a half hour before we came in. I  would ask a page to come over and bring it to my dear friend and ask  him if this is the bill which we have read.    I would ask my friend from Texas to yield for another  question.    I would ask my friend from Texas to yield for another  question.    I would ask my friend from Texas to yield for another  question.    I would ask my friend from Texas to yield for another  question.    Will we get more than 2 minutes to debate each amendment  we ask for or will we be under the reconciliation process, where we  have 10 hours of debate and then every amendment only gets 2 minutes?  Does he consider that--2 minutes, if that is the case--a full and fair  debate on each amendment?    Mr. President, I would ask my colleague a question.   What would be wrong with 1 hour of debate on every amendment to this  bill? What is the objection to that, since the majority is proposing no  debate on amendments, and then saying it is an open process? What is  wrong with 1 hour of debate on every amendment offered to this bill?   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.    Mr. President, I would ask my friend, the majority whip  from Texas, a series of questions.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    What was the date that reconciliation was added to the  budget resolution which said we don't need any Democratic votes? Was it  May, was it April, was it March, or was it the very beginning of this  session?   I would ask him another question. Where were the meetings held to  discuss this bill, and were any Democrats invited?   I would ask him another question. Why did the majority leader not  accept our offer to go into the Old Senate Chamber--100 Senators, no  press, no anything else--and debate the bill?   How can my good friend--and he is a good friend; we are on the bikes  in the morning together--my good friend from Texas say there was a  bipartisan process when, at the outset--at the outset--our Republican  colleagues said the only thing we will debate is repeal and then  replace? There was no discussion of whether repeal was the right thing  to do or the wrong thing to do. Now, overwhelmingly the American people  prefer fixing ObamaCare--which we offered to do--than repeal and  replace.   It is no wonder, I would say to my colleague as he answers these  questions, that this bill is being brought in the dark of night. It is  because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are ashamed of the  bill--because, believe you me, if they liked this bill, they would have  brass bands down every Main Street in America talking about it, but  they are trying to sneak it through because mainly their goal is a tax  cut for the rich.   I would ask my colleague to answer those three questions, and then he  can respond to my rhetoric.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.    Mr. President, here is the correct analogy: Yes, there  has been an accident. Yes, someone needs help. Someone who is not a  doctor, not a physician, doesn't know how to help the patient--our  Republicans friends go by the side of the road, but they don't know  what to do.   So the Democrats come by. We are doctors. We say: We know how to fix  this system. We know how to fix this patient, and the Republicans say:  No, don't help with us. We will drive right by. Now the patient is  ailing.   I would ask my colleagues, let's forget the past for the moment  because we have a much better argument than you. We had hundreds of  amendments offered by Republicans that became part of our bill. I doubt  there will be a  [[Page S3702]]  single Democratic amendment that will be--we had hours of hearings,  hours of debate. You didn't. So you may not have thought the process  was perfect, but it was a lot more open than yours.   I have a proposal to my friend. Let us forget this draft bill. Let us  right now, Democrats and Republicans, sit down and try to come up with  a bipartisan bill. We are willing to do it today, now, this minute.  Will you accept that offer?   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
