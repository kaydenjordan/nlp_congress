I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that  I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome  of the vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to  reconsider is considered made and laid upon the table and the President  will be immediately notified of the Senate's action.                            ____________________
