 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    While Washington Democrats spent 2021 distracted by  their reckless taxing-and-spending spree, violent criminals were  preying on the American people. Millions of Americans' neighborhoods  descended into chaos and violence around them.   After the nationwide murder rate saw its biggest jump in more than  100 years in 2020, at least 12 major cities set their own alltime  homicide records in 2021. Rates of carjackings have doubled, tripled,  and even quadrupled in major metro areas.   My hometown of Louisville set a new alltime murder record last year  of 188 homicides. Twenty-four of the victims were children. At one  point last year, a staggering 65 percent of our homicides were going  unsolved. Louisville is now averaging one carjacking every 42 hours.  Yesterday, I hosted the FBI special agent in charge of the Louisville  field office for a meeting here in the Capitol. We discussed these  issues at length.   One survey last year found that Americans believe violent crime is  the No. 1 major crisis facing our country. More citizens called violent  crime a major crisis than COVID. When Americans were asked about  President Biden's handling of law enforcement and criminal justice, the  President polls almost 20 points underwater.   The American people know this crime wave is not some spontaneous  event. It has been fed and fueled in multiple ways by the Democratic  Party's far-left turn. For example, liberal activists and many elected  Democrats have spent almost 2 years trying to smear--smear--the entire  profession of policing with the actions of a few bad actors.   We know that anti-police culture wars invite more crime. It is a  fact. A prominent scholar--who, incidentally, was the youngest African- American professor to ever get tenure at Harvard--has proven that anti- police outcry directly results in more crime, including homicides.   Many jurisdictions have entertained financial attacks on police  departments to match the rhetorical attacks. Literally just yesterday,  a prominent House Democrat insisted to the press that the far left will  not be dropping or diluting their message of ``defund the police.''   Meanwhile, our brave men and women in law enforcement are literally-- literally--under attack. While too many politicians take aim at our  brave police officers in a political sense, violent criminals are  taking aim at them in a literal sense. The number of cop killings shot  up nearly 60 percent last year to a two-decade high.    In Louisville, Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy Brandon Shirley was  shot and killed last summer. It is believed he was ambushed while  wearing his uniform.   The streets of New York City were packed full with heroes a few days  ago as fellow officers mourned two of their colleagues who had been  shot and killed.   It is not just regular citizens going about their normal days who  need this violent crime epidemic to stop; our brave men and women in  blue also need very badly for it to stop. But, within the justice  system, leftwing activists have insinuated themselves into  prosecutorial roles throughout America and are making ``soft on crime''  actually their official policy.   The State's attorney in Baltimore announced last year she intended to  stop prosecuting minor drug and prostitution cases.   New York City's new district attorney said last month he would not  pursue charges for marijuana misdemeanors, trespassing, and resisting  arrest, among others. After a huge backlash, he tried to walk some of  this back.   Chain stores like Walgreens have had to close locations in San  Francisco because constant, unpunished theft and shoplifting have  become a fact of life in that city.   Another example is almost too sad and ironic for words. In Wisconsin  last November, a repeat offender who was out on bond drove his car into  a Christmas parade and murdered six people. His victims included an 8- year-old child and a group of grandmothers.   Well, one jurisdiction over in Milwaukee County has one of the most  prominent soft-on-crime liberal prosecutors in the entire country. He  has spent years waging a national campaign urging prosecutors to  actually go easy on repeat criminals like this killer. A few years  back, he even admitted soft-on-crime policies would cost innocent lives  but said he was willing to make the trade.   Here is what he had to say:         Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into       [a] treatment program, who's going to go out and kill       somebody? You bet. Guaranteed. It's guaranteed to happen. It       does not invalidate the overall approach.    These backward, pro-crime attitudes aren't just infecting local DAs'  offices; they also seem to be largely defining the Biden Department of  Justice. Rachael Rollins is the former Massachusetts DA who spent her  last job trying to wipe entire categories of crimes off the enforcement  rolls. This earned her a promotion to U.S. attorney from President  Biden, which every Senate Democrat supported. There is Vanita Gupta,  now an Associate Attorney General, who had previously advocated for  sweeping drug decriminalization and expressed her support for efforts  to ``decrease police budgets.'' There is Kristen Clarke, also confirmed  by Senate Democrats to work at DOJ, who echoed calls to ``invest less  in police.'' These are President Biden's picks to top jobs at Main  Justice.    I just had to place a hold on the nominee to be U.S. attorney for  Minnesota because the person recently acting in that job recommended an  unusually soft sentence below the minimum guideline to a convicted  fatal arsonist because the arsonist was taking part in a far-left  political riot at the time. I will need written assurance the nominee  to succeed this person will not continue this jaw-dropping practice and  lessen criminals' sentences so long as the political violence they  commit happens to be leftwing.   The modern Democratic Party has convinced itself that order--order-- is actually oppression and anarchy is actually compassion. This is  totally wrong. Tolerating lawlessness and anarchy is not compassionate.  It doesn't help vulnerable communities for politicians to passively  watch them devolve into literal war zones. The actual residents of  these communities know this best of all.   Last summer, even after months of anti-police rhetoric from the left,  when a poll asked the residents of Detroit about their concerns, almost  five times more people said public safety than police reform. It was  even more lopsided among African-American residents. They named public  safety eight times more than police reform.   Last summer, NPR interviewed a man who had committed terrible crimes  as a young adult, served time, turned his life around, and now works  with young men in prison. The reporter asked how he had gotten caught  up in criminal violence. Where did his childhood veer off course?   Here was the man's explanation--a direct quote. Here is what he said:         It was my environment. . . . When I go outside every day,       as soon as I walk out my front door, I'm entering a war zone       . . . from sun-up to sundown, robberies and murders and       carjacking and extortion . . . [I] became a product of my       environment.    So this man's problem was not an evil justice system that was out to  get him; it wasn't that his neighborhood had an excess of law and  order; the problem was a lack of--a lack of--law and order.   It is not compassionate to let vulnerable kids grow up in war zones  because Democrats feel bad putting violent criminals in prison, where  they belong.   Let me say that again. It is not compassionate to let vulnerable kids  grow up in war zones because Democrats feel guilty putting violent  criminals behind bars, where they belong.   Neither is it compassionate to make innocent, law-abiding citizens  across America live in fear because liberal public servants won't do  their jobs.   The answer to this crimewave isn't slashing law enforcement budgets,  it isn't replacing cops with social workers, and it isn't far-left gun  grabbers coming after the constitutional rights of law-abiding  citizens. Here is the answer: Elected officials need to drop the  [[Page S584]]  soft-on-crime nonsense and give innocent American families the  protection they deserve.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
