 Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy that I rise today to  recognize and celebrate the life of my 13th grandchild on his first- month birthday.   On November 7, 2018, my family and I welcomed Richard Wayne ``R.W.''  Allen II, my namesake, into our family. Of our 13 grandchildren, R.W.  is our fourth grandson. I am truly humbled that my fourth grandson was  named in my honor.   Robin and I are the proud parents of four wonderful children, and our  only son, Andy, and his wife, Betsy, are now the parents of R.W. and  his older sister, Elsie, who is named after my mother.   Andy is a foreign service officer with the State Department, and  right now he and his family are living here in Washington and training  for his next assignment. I cannot put in words how happy we are that  Andy, Betty, Elsie, and R.W. are here with us in D.C. as we celebrate  this addition to our growing family.   My prayer for R.W. is he will grow strong in his faith and personally  experience the mercy, grace, peace, and love of our Savior, Jesus  Christ.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference  report to H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018.   Facing a nearly 50 percent decline in net farm income over the past 5  years, our Nation's farmers and ranchers have had their backs against  the wall for far too long.   Today, we have an opportunity to right that ship, to secure a  brighter future for our producers, rural communities, and American  consumers.   As a member of the farm bill conference committee, I am confident  that the agreement we have reached will strengthen the farm safety net  and provide a sense of certainty and flexibility for those who feed and  clothe our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, we have been working on this legislation since I came to  Congress, and I would like to thank Chairman Conaway and the entire  House Agriculture Committee for their work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 2, to reinvigorate rural America.
