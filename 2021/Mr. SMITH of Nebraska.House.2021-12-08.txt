 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4996,  the Ocean Shipping Reform Act.   I thank Mr. Johnson, Mr. Garamendi, and others for joining me in  raising the alarm back in March in a letter to the Federal Maritime  Commission about the empty container ships leaving American ports.   This bill follows on that effort, offering necessary reforms to  Federal regulations overseeing the ocean shipping industry in order to  address problems like this that have been discussed.   Agricultural exports are critical to not only feeding the world but  to the livelihood of the producers I represent in Nebraska.   We cannot do that if container ships leave American ports completely  empty.   This bill prohibits foreign ocean carriers from refusing U.S. exports  unreasonably and gives the FMC more tools to ensure these carriers are  held accountable and held to a high standard.   Trade only works if exports reach their final destination in a  reliable and affordable way.   This bill is great step toward facilitating exactly that.   It is a reasonable bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.
