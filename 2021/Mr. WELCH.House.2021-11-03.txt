 Madam Speaker, Vermonters have done their full measure of  service throughout our history, and that is true in Iraq and  Afghanistan. Two of our great soldiers, Sergeant Major Michael Cram and  Brigadier General Michael Heston, both died of cancers that we believe  were related to their exposures to burn pits.   Their wonderful widows, Pat Cram and June Heston, have been so  vigilant and energetic in putting a focus on the devastation of these  burn pits and played a major role in encouraging the VA to, A, get a  registry; B, the Defense Department to stop exposing people to burn  pits; and then, C, to have us presume that those who have been exposed  to burn pits and developed a disease as a result of that are entitled  to VA benefits. We must get this done.                            ____________________
