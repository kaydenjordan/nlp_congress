 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, fiscal conservatism means cutting spending where  possible and, in turn, spending responsibly. Yes, it is a balance. In  our homes, we have to do it; in our businesses, we have to do it. When  the economy goes down, you don't spend as much in your business or your  home, so you have to be balanced and responsible.   Today's vote is timely. The CBO's recent report confirmed what many  of us already know: Washington has a spending problem.   The budget deficit will near $1 trillion next year, and trillions  more are projected indefinitely.   Only a decade ago, the Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent  of GDP, maybe even too much at that time, but today it is 75 percent,  and it is expected to surpass 96 percent over the next decade. Does  anybody think that that is sustainable? At what point does the debt  become so severe, that we stall our economic growth?   Maybe we cannot answer that question today, but we all know that  point looms on the horizon when we must answer that question.   If we don't act, we or our children, or perhaps, in my case, even our  grandchildren, are going to find out the hard way. The burden of our  borrowing is going to fall on our future generations, hurting their  ability to flourish.   I wonder how many of us want to look our children or our  grandchildren or maybe, in some cases, our great-grandchildren in the  eye and say: We weren't responsible enough to do that; we are going to  leave that burden to you.   I could not, in good faith, support the recent budget cap agreement,  nor could I support the most recent omnibus bill. In fact, I voted for  the Cut, Cap and Balance Act during my first year in Congress, which  would have capped the future spending based on the GDP, and I am very  proud of that vote.                                time  1545    That same year, I supported the Budget Control Act, which reined in  the years of high level discretionary spending.   Some of my colleagues across the aisle are trying to use this  resolution to attack the tax cuts, but tax cuts are not the problem.  Our economy needed a jolt, and that is what we did.   In fact, let's just look back a couple of years at what our economic  growth was; didn't even make it out of 2 percent. Many quarters we were  down at 1.5 percent. We are up at 3 percent now. Is that not something  that is worth jolting the economy for?   Where jobs are being created; that just didn't happen out of the  horizon. That is because of tax cuts that we see the jobs being  created. And by the way, people are having more money in their pocket  as a result of that.   We will continue to see economic growth from our tax cuts for years  to come. As a matter of fact, I was just with a group of people not  long ago that were talking about how a small business owner, a lady  that had a pizza shop that started out in that organization as washing  dishes, serving pizza. She then bought it. And you know what she has  been able to do because of this tax cut? She has now bought a second  business; someone who started out as a dishwasher. That is what our tax  cuts are doing.   Spending is the problem. Our mandatory spending has been projected to  nearly quadruple by 2040.   Our population is aging. Our workforce participation rate is  stagnant. For every 1.65 employed persons in the private sector, we  have one person who receives welfare assistance. When people need  assistance, we want to give them assistance. But work is dignity.    Work is dignity. That is what our goal should be; not  having people depend upon the government. When you ask somebody what  they do and they can tell you what they do, they are prideful. Because  after you ask someone their name, what do you ask them? What do you do?   We want everybody to be at work, not where 1.65 people employed in  the private sector, one is receiving welfare assistance. That is not  dignity.   This must be addressed. My budget last year began this processing of  addressing mandatory spending, and we need to build on that progress.   I agree that offering a constitutional amendment should be done  rarely and reluctantly. Our debt burden threatens the kind of country  that we leave behind for our children and grandchildren, and we must  end this borrow-and-spend cycle that has gone on for far, far too long.   Ensuring future generations have the same opportunities that we have  today means making hard choices. No more delays. No more denials.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.
