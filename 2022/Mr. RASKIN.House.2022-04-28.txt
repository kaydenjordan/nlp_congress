 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 1065 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1065         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 3522) to       provide enhanced authority for the President to enter into       agreements with the Government of Ukraine to lend or lease       defense articles to that Government to protect civilian       populations in Ukraine from Russian military invasion, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to commit.        Sec. 2.  House Resolution 1035 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 1017, agreed to       March 31, 2022), is amended by striking ``April 29, 2022''       each place it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``May       13, 2022''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met yesterday and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1065 providing for consideration of  S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act under a closed  rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs. The rule provides for one motion to commit.   The rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority, and same  day authority through May 13, 2022. Finally, the rule deems H. Res.  1035 as passed.   Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin's criminal war of aggression and atrocity  against the sovereign nation of Ukraine has dismembered the second  largest country in Europe. Putin's soldiers have killed more than 2,700  Ukrainian civilians and more than 100 children in Ukraine. They have  raped and murdered untold numbers of women, leaving their bodies in the  street. They have wounded thousands of civilians. They have displaced  10 million Ukrainians, creating the largest exodus of displaced persons  since the Nazis rampaged through Europe. They have traumatized a  nation.   It is a sobering thing to canvas the damage today, which is Holocaust  Remembrance Day. Putin's invasion is intended to deal a fatal blow to  democracy in Ukraine and around the world. Putin's lurch into fascist  aggression has actually unified and galvanized the democratic world,  the democratic nations, and peoples and movements of the world.   I concede that Putin still has his cheerleaders for his homophobia,  his corruption, and his white nationalist racism around the world. I  concede that some people, even in this body, continue to chant the  filthy words ``Russia hoax'' to describe what we know from our own  intelligence community of Putin's unceasing efforts to subvert  democracy all over the world. I concede that Vladimir Putin has been  called a genius by a former twice-impeached President for his assault  on a sovereign democratic nation.   The vast majority of Americans and vast majority of democratic  societies around the world reject Putin's atrocities against democracy.  President Zelenskyy and President Biden have rallied the world against  Putin and in defense of the heroic people of Ukraine standing strong  against this aggression--people who have more courage in their pinky  than Vladimir Putin and his thugs will ever be able to understand.   Mr. Speaker, NATO members have sent or promised at least $8 billion  in weapons to Ukraine. The billions we have sent from the United States  of  [[Page H4587]]  America has made a key difference in allowing the people of Ukraine to  defend themselves. The people of America paid for anti-tank and anti- air systems, for helicopters, for drones, for grenade launchers, for 50  million rounds of ammunition, and more.   Today, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 comes  before Congress as an important part of the effort to defend Ukraine.  This act is rooted in the lend-lease program of World War II, which  President Roosevelt proposed in January of 1941, which allowed our  government to lend or to lease war supplies and equipment to any nation  whose security was defined as vital to the defense and the security of  the United States.   Passage of that act enabled Great Britain and Winston Churchill to  keep fighting and to survive the fascist Nazi bombardment until the  United States could enter the war.   President Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine needs weapons to sustain  themselves, and President Biden has answered that call with billions in  military assistance since Russia's full-blown invasion began on  February 24, a day that will live in infamy in the freedom-loving  world.   On April 21, last Thursday, President Biden announced that we will be  sending an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, the  eighth such installment, which will include 72 howitzers, 144,000  artillery rounds, 72 tactical vehicles, and more than 121 Phoenix Ghost  tactical drones. Today, I understand President Biden has asked for an  additional aid package for the next several months.   But S. 3522 will streamline current legal authorities under the Arms  Export Control Act that allows our government to lend defense articles  needed to defend civilian populations. We will eliminate red tape to  make it easier for our government to lend or lease necessary military  equipment in this struggle to defend Ukraine.   The legislation requires the Biden administration to establish  expedited procedures for delivering military equipment to Ukraine and  other affected Eastern European countries to defend populations made  vulnerable by Vladimir Putin's aggression. It also facilities the  provisioning of loaned and/or leased defense articles to Ukraine,  easing a myriad of administrative regulations and processes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear from my friend from Pennsylvania  that he supports S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act.  This is a moment of grave emergency in Ukraine as Putin's army  continues to bomb hospitals and schools, rape and assault women, and  murder the civilian population.   I am, of course, disappointed that even when we agree, the minority  caucus insists upon disagreeing and bringing up matters that are  utterly extraneous to this resolution. But my friend mentioned  authoritarian lockdowns, oppressive procedures, and dangerous and  radical policies. I didn't know if he was referring to Vladimir Putin  or to the prior President whose dangerous, radical appeasement of  Vladimir Putin empowered and emboldened him as Vladimir Putin has tried  to undermine NATO; and the last President did everything in his power  to undermine NATO and to weaken NATO. But at this point we have the  opportunity to rally the democratic world, the democratic nations of  the world, the democratic societies, peoples, and movements against  Putin's bloody, imperial invasion of Ukraine.   That is what is on the table right now. That is what is on the table  in the world today. That is where democracy is on the line.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think that all of these efforts to distract us from  the issue at hand are meant to cover up the very clear pro-Russian and  pro-Putin faction at the heart of their side of the aisle.   Last month in March of this year, the very distinguished gentlewoman  from Georgia went on a radio show called the ``Voice of Rural  America,'' and she followed Donald Trump's sickening appeasement of  Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine for the situation.   She said:         You see, Ukraine just kept poking the bear and poking the       bear which is Russia, and Russia invaded. There is no win for       Ukraine here. Russia is successful in this invasion.    When Members of Congress are cheerleaders for Vladimir Putin and are  voices of nothing but defeatism, fatalism, and pessimism for democracy  in Europe, then they try to distract us with a lot of phony rhetoric  about other issues.   She also said:         NATO has been supplying the neo-Nazis with powerful weapons       and extensive training on how to use them. What the hell is       going on with these NATO Nazis.    Mr. Speaker, we have to decide which side we are on.   When Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and Americans looked at what was  happening in Europe during World War II and they saw Nazis marching  down the street, they did not see very fine people on both sides of the  street. They did not start cheerleading for Mussolini, Hitler, and  Franco. Yet we have people here who go out and speak on the side of  Vladimir Putin and on the side of Russia.                                time  1300    Let's pass this Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act to show  where America is. We are not cheerleaders for Vladimir Putin. We are  not going to follow the Trump-Putin axis down the road toward autocracy  and kleptocracy and sedition and insurrection and corruption and coups  in the United States. That is not where we are going.   This is the land of the free, the home of the brave. We stand for  democracy here, not Vladimir Putin.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I find this astounding. We are here to talk about aid to  Ukraine, how to streamline and expedite aid to defend the people of  Ukraine, and they will talk about anything but.   I was willing to believe that the distinguished gentlewoman from  Georgia and several other Members were isolated in their Conference.  Now, I am starting to think that maybe they are speaking for the whole  Conference.   I wonder if my good friend from Pennsylvania would explicitly  repudiate some of these statements made by the gentlewoman from  Georgia.   Does the minority Conference agree that NATO has been supplying the  ``neo-Nazis in Ukraine'' with powerful weapons?   Does the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania support or  dissociate himself from the argument that the aid that we send to  Ukraine falls ``into the hands of Nazis,'' a statement made by the  gentlewoman from Georgia, echoing Putin's filthy claim that his war on  the sovereign democracy of Ukraine is, in fact, an attempt to denazify  the country?   Of course, we hear distinct echoes in everything that we get from the  erudite gentlewoman from Georgia.   Does the minority agree that Putin invaded because Ukraine repeatedly  poked the bear?   I mean, I can't understand why they won't talk about defending  Ukraine. That is what this legislation is about. That is what this rule  is about. They want to talk about anything other than that.   We can debate all of those other important issues in other contexts  at the right time. This is how the House of Representatives works. But  why are they covering up for the pro-Putin faction within their  Conference? I would like them to dissociate themselves from the people  who are blaming Ukraine for Russia's bloody imperial invasion and war  of human rights violations and atrocities against the people. Please do  that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America just witnessed the most  astonishing spectacle. We are here to debate aid to the people of  Ukraine defending themselves against a massive invasion by Vladimir  Putin and his army. Then, the minority puts up the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia, who does not mention Ukraine once.   She does not mention the thousands of Ukrainian civilians who have  been slaughtered by Putin's army. She does not mention more than 100  Ukrainian children who have been shot and killed by the Russian army.  Instead, she talks about a massive invasion at the border, a massive  invasion, which their own speakers have said, today, hundreds of  thousands of people have been apprehended in.   That is very different from a military invasion, the one in Ukraine.  Of course, the gentlewoman is not going to talk about that. She had a  lot to say the other day when she heckled me continuously. When I came  to the floor, it was like ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' in here  with her chanting about the Russia hoax and Russia this and Russia  that.   Now, she had the opportunity to tell the world what her views about  Russia are. I put them out there, exactly what she has said. She said  that the aid that the taxpayers of America are sending to the people of  Ukraine to defend themselves against Vladimir Putin and the Russian  army falls into the hands of Nazis.                                time  1315    I want to see her proof.   Where is her evidence?   She talks about NATO Nazis. Does the minority believe that our allies  in NATO, who are trying to defend the people of Ukraine, are Nazis? Has  it come to this?   The gentlewoman talked about massive invasion. We had a massive  invasion of our own Chamber. * * *    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  offending remark.    Mr. Speaker, the House rules do forbid engaging in  personalities. I accept the advice of the Parliamentarian that I used  unparliamentary language to make my point, and I certainly respect the  necessity for parliamentary decorum.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close when my friend from  Pennsylvania is prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Pennsylvania suggests that this is  something that we didn't actually need to bring to the floor, that it  could have been done on a suspension vote. And yet, I am certain that  my dear friend is aware that a number of suspension votes on things as  simple as post office renamings have been voted down by the minority.   There was a distinguished judge who a post office was going to be  named after and that was sabotaged on a suspension vote. There have  been multiple votes like that.   In fact, we have a resolution that we put forward to affirm support  for NATO and its democratic principles. And that was rejected by 63  Members of the minority caucus; 63 Members voted against a resolution  expressing unequivocal support for a strong NATO and for the democratic  principles underlying it.   Mr. Speaker, I would love if it were as simple as he was suggesting,  that we could all agree to this, but they are not agreeing with the  things that we are putting forward about the need to unite for  democracy around the world. That is why we are precisely in this  situation we are in.   Even when we are trying to talk about the importance of this new  lend-lease expediting program to allow the U.S. Government to lend  military equipment, to lease military equipment to Ukraine and to get  it done quickly, it seems like our friends keep on wanting to change  the subject to talk about anything other than that.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what to say other than I wish we were  unified in supporting this rule for the legislation that we are  bringing forward to make it a lot easier to get support to the people  of Ukraine, the support they need to fight off the bloody military  invasion being conducted by Putin's army.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for his service, of  course, and also for his clarification about his particular vote.   The House Resolution we are talking about is 831, calling on the  United States Government to uphold the founding democratic principles  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establishing a center for  democratic resilience within the headquarters of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization.   Of course, everyone in the majority voted for it. I think the vast  majority of the people on the gentleman's side of the aisle voted for  it, but there were 63 Members who did find this or that clause  objectionable and, therefore, voted against it. But that is precisely  my point.   My good friend from Pennsylvania takes me to task for saying, Why  didn't we just do this on a suspension vote basis, just bring it up  here and let it glide through. Because nothing is simple when we are  talking about these issues.   There are some people who are out there on the radio calling NATO  Nazis and saying that the money that Americans are putting into Ukraine  is going  [[Page H4592]]  to support Nazis. I haven't heard anybody renounce or repudiate that  point of view.   Then there are others who find far more substantive and defensible  problems with what we are doing.   In any event, they have been voting against it, so we were not able  to do a suspension resolution. So we bring it up to have a discussion  about Ukraine to see if we can get unity and then they take us off in  50 other directions.   It is a sad thing to see that when President Zelenskyy and the people  of Ukraine have demonstrated democratic courage, bravery, and valor to  the entire world, and democratic societies are trying to get together  to mobilize behind democracy to oppose what Vladimir Putin and his gang  of thugs in Moscow and their allies in different places, like Orban in  Hungary and--well, I don't want to get into the whole rogues' gallery  of tyrants and bullies that they have gathered to support them.   We have got to be building the democratic forces. We should be  together on this. We should be able to think about this in a far  broader way than just talking points for the next election.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend for our lively discussion today. And I am glad to  hear, again, that he supports the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease  Act of 2022, S. 3522. I wish we could have focused on the meaning of  this legislation, rather than for them to fight about the rule and to  raise subjects that are not part of this legislation.   More than 10 million Ukrainians have been forced out of their homes;  have been forced to flee in the worst mass exodus of refugees since  World War II. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed. More  than 100 Ukrainian children have been murdered by Putin's Army.   And I have heard the word authoritarian uttered on the other side of  the aisle today, and it applies to whom? Not Vladimir Putin. They used  it to apply to Nancy Pelosi, to the Speaker of the House of  Representatives, because they disagree with some interpretations of the  rules of the House.   Well, this is a serious moment for people who are serious about  democracy in the new century. If allowed to continue, Vladimir Putin  will spread his rampage beyond Ukraine into neighboring countries in  Eastern Europe, and then other authoritarian and autocratic leaders  around the world will decide they will be able to do to their neighbors  what Vladimir Putin was allowed to do to his neighbor.   This legislation is named after what President Roosevelt made happen  during World War II, the Lend-Lease program that, without declaring  war, America would come to the aid of its allies by lending and leasing  military equipment to our allies in order to secure the democratic  world. And that is where we are again.   So we need to streamline all of the red tape. We need to expedite the  delivery of equipment to our allies in Ukraine. And I hope we will hear  the end of the constant statements of defeatism and pessimism and  surrender that we get from so many people who are out there and  continue to take the position of the former President Trump  [[Page H4593]]  that Vladimir Putin is some kind of genius for invading his neighbor.  He is not a genius. He is a mass murderer. He is not a genius. He is a  human rights violator, and he is a perpetrator of war crimes.   The world needs to know where America stands. And we should stand, if  we could, unified, for the people of Ukraine, for democracy in Europe,  and for democracy all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1065         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 5. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
