 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            China Trade Agreement     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the NAFTA 2.0  trade agreement negotiated by President Trump.   This agreement is opposed by labor unions like the International  Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, as well as by the  United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. It is opposed  by numerous environmental organizations, including the Sunrise  Movement, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, the League of  Conservation Voters, and virtually every major environmental  organization in the country. Further, it is opposed by the National  Family Farm Coalition, which believes it will lock in rules that have  devastated family-based agriculture and expand corporate control over  agriculture in North America.   I am proud to stand with these labor unions, with the environmental  groups, and family farmers against President Trump's NAFTA 2.0.   I not only voted against NAFTA in 1993, but I marched against it. In  2000 I voted against permanent normal trade relations with China. I  opposed the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements.   The bottom line is that we need trade agreements in this country that  work for workers, that work for farmers, and not just the CEOs of large  multinational corporations.   There is no doubt in my mind that we need to fundamentally rewrite  our disastrous trade agreements and create and protect good-paying  American jobs, and that we need trade agreements that will improve the  environment and combat climate change, and we need trade agreements  that end the destructive race to the bottom, where workers are forced  to work for lower, lower wages.   Unfortunately, this revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada  does none of these things. It must be rewritten.   While NAFTA has led to the loss of nearly 1 million American jobs,  this agreement does virtually nothing to stop the outsourcing of jobs  to Mexico. Under this agreement, large multinational corporations will  still be able to shut down factories in America, where workers are paid  some $28 an hour, and move to Mexico, where workers there are paid less  than $2 an hour.   When Donald Trump was a candidate for President, he promised that he  would stop the outsourcing of American jobs to Mexico, China, and other  low-wage countries. That has not happened.   The truth is, since Trump took office, over 170,000 American jobs  have been shipped overseas. In 2018, we had a recordbreaking $891  billion trade deficit in goods, a $419 billion trade deficit with  China, and an $81 billion trade deficit with Mexico.   In 2018, for the first time in our history, manufacturing workers  began getting paid less than workers overall. It used to be that  manufacturing workers made really good wages compared to the rest of  the workforce. It is not the case anymore.   Today, manufacturing workers get $28.15 an hour, while the average  worker makes 15 cents an hour more. Last month we lost 12,000 factory  jobs, and despite Trump's rhetoric, we are in a manufacturing  recession.   There is a reason why virtually every major environmental group is  opposed to Trump's NAFTA 2.0. This agreement does nothing to stop  fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron from dumping their  waste and pollution into Mexico and destroying the environment. In  fact, it makes it easier for fossil fuel companies to bring tar sands  oil into the United States through dangerous pipelines like the  Keystone XL.   This proposal does not even mention the word ``climate change.''  Imagine in the year 2020 that we have a major trade agreement that does  not even mention the words ``climate change,'' the existential threat  facing not only our country but the entire planet.   This deal preserves the disastrous investor-state dispute settlement  system for oil and gas companies, allowing them to continue to put  corporate profits ahead of our air, water, climate, and health.   At this pivotal moment in American history, it is not good enough to  tinker around the edges. The scientific community has been very clear.  If we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our energy system  away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable  energy, the future of this planet is in doubt, and there is no question  but that the Nation and planet we leave to our children and to our  grandchildren will be increasingly unhealthy and uninhabitable.   We have a major climate crisis and no trade deal should be passed  that does not address that issue.   In my view, we need to rewrite this trade agreement to stop the  outsourcing of American jobs, to combat climate change, to protect the  environment, and to stop the destructive race to the bottom.   We have to stop large, profitable corporations that are outsourcing  American jobs overseas from receiving lucrative Federal contracts. It  makes no sense to me that you have large corporations shut down in  America, go to cheap labor countries abroad, and then they get online  and receive very large Federal contacts. We have to stop that.   Further, we have to repeal Trump's tax giveaways to the wealthy,  which have provided huge tax breaks to companies that shut down  manufacturing plants in the United States and move abroad.   Trade is a good thing done well, but this trade agreement does not  accomplish that end.                            ____________________
