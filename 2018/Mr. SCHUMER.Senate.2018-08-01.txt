 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given  the floor and that my time be allocated to leader time.    Mr. President, for several weeks, our Republican  colleagues have been stonewalling our efforts to gain access to Judge  Kavanaugh's full record on behalf of the Senate and, more importantly,  on behalf of the American people. In doing so, they have discarded a  tradition of bipartisan cooperation when it comes to requesting a  nominee's record.   Whether or not you have been for a nominee, we used to all agree that  the Senate should be able to review their  [[Page S5532]]  full record for the sake of transparency and openness, for a vote, to  advise and consent on one of the most important jobs in the country and  in the world, a lifetime job of tremendous power, not abstract power.  The decisions the Supreme Court makes affect the daily lives of  Americans. So this is just incredible.   For Justice Kagan, Democrats joined with the Republican minority to  request all of her records. For Justice Sotomayor, Democrats did the  same. We could have come up with some fake reasons why you couldn't get  the records. We didn't. We believe in transparency and openness. But  Republicans are doing a 180-degree reverse now that they are in charge,  which leaves a very bad taste in our mouths and in the mouths of the  American people. They are saying that what is good for the goose is not  good for the gander; that transparency is fine when Democrats are in  charge and nominating nominees but no transparency when Republicans are  in charge.   Republicans are breaking from the bipartisan precedent, and they are  requesting only a subset of Judge Kavanaugh's records from his time in  the White House. Chairman Grassley has asked for documents pertaining  to Judge Kavanaugh's time in the White House Counsel's Office but none  from his 3 years as Staff Secretary--arguably a more important and more  revealing job.   Now, adding insult to injury--and this is utterly amazing--we have  just learned that even when it comes to the documents concerning  Kavanaugh's time in the White House Counsel's Office, the Senate is not  likely to get the full picture even on that limited group of documents.   Chairman Grassley has written to the National Archives and the Bush  Library to request documents from when Kavanaugh was White House  Counsel, and both are working to produce them. But, unlike at the  National Archives, the Bush Library--and we know President Bush. I have  a great deal of respect for him. I think he is a good man even though I  disagreed with him on a whole lot. But he is a close friend of  Kavanaugh's, who worked for him, and he is a loyal guy.   So what have they done? The Bush Library has hired a legal team--led  by a Republican lawyer with close ties to President Bush and President  Trump--to prescreen the documents from Kavanaugh's time in the White  House Counsel's Office. They are doing the screening--this lawyer who  worked for Bannon and who worked for Priebus and so many other  Republicans. Pejoratively, you might say he is sort of a hack lawyer.  He may be a fine lawyer. But he always works for Republicans. He is a  very partisan man, and he is screening the documents that the public  can see.   The legal team can cite Executive privilege--that is President Bush's  prerogative--to deny the Senate some or all of the documents, and we  believe they may be claiming the discretion to determine whether a  document is properly considered a Presidential record at all. That is  something only the National Archives can do. They are nonpartisan. They  don't have any political pull.   The bottom line is this: The Republican lawyers overseeing the  production of documents from the Bush Library may seek to deny the  Senate access to documents the National Archives would otherwise bring.  Is that incredible? So there is another layer. It is not even all the  counsel's documents, because there is a lawyer--a tried-and-true  doctrinaire Republican lawyer, tight with so many of the people in this  administration--who is determining which documents we get to see and  which documents we don't.   Knowing that, I recently wrote a letter to President Bush asking him  a simple question: Will he, President Bush, make public Judge  Kavanaugh's full record or not? I wanted to be sure there would be  little or no daylight between what the Senate received from the Bush  Library and what we received from the National Archives. Unfortunately,  I did not get a simple answer; I got a reply from the lawyer hired by  the Bush Library, draped in legalese and obfuscations, confirming that  a team of private-sector lawyers are screening the documents--the  limited number of documents--from when Kavanaugh was White House  Counsel. He also made clear that ``copies of records that the team of  lawyers has reviewed and . . . approved for disclosure'' would be made  ``available directly to the Committee.'' That is in this letter right  here sent by the lawyers.   Ironically, this offer was presented as a courtesy. Of course, it is  plain as day--it means that Chairman Grassley could access the  prescreened documents from the Bush legal team and decline to wait for  documents being processed by the National Archives, meaning the Senate  and the public will only see what the partisan lawyers want us to see.  Some courtesy.   This is not a fishing expedition. This is not an attempt to run out  the clock. We are talking about a lifetime appointment to the highest  Court in the land. The person who fills this vacancy on the Court will  have the power to affect the lives of every single American, now and  for decades. Democrats simply want his records to be made available to  the Senate and to the public to judge for themselves whether President  Trump's nominee is the right choice for our country. The American  people deserve that right. But not only are Republicans blocking access  to Kavanaugh's record when he was a senior member of the Bush  administration, the documents they are requesting are being prescreened  by lawyers on their side. It leads you to wonder over and over again,  what are the Republicans trying to hide in Kavanaugh's record? To go to  such lengths to tie themselves in knots and pretzels to deny simple  documents that people can read makes people ask: What are they hiding?  What are they afraid of? Why can't we have open documents, as we had  for Kagan and Sotomayor, President Obama's nominees? To go to such  lengths to deny the Senate impartial access to this material is  telling.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, on healthcare, today the Trump administration has  finalized a plan for a type of health insurance that will essentially  repeal protections on preexisting conditions and allow insurance  companies to cover fewer benefits, not more. These so-called short-term  plans are the very definition of a bait-and-switch. Under the guise of  lower premiums, these plans lure Americans in, but they hardly cover  anything.   The insurance company will tell you that this plan will cover you for  this and that, and then when you read the fine print, it doesn't, even  though you are paying a nice-size premium. So there will be no  protections in these plans if you develop a preexisting condition. God  forbid you find out your son or daughter has cancer. You need help. You  are desperate for help. You want a healthy child above anything else.  The insurance company can just kick you off. That is not what America  should be.   These plans the administration is supporting--allowing, pushing-- don't have any protections for preexisting conditions. Many don't cover  basic services like maternity care and prescription drugs. How do you  like that? You sign up for a plan--no prescription drugs. When you get  sick, you discover you are on the hook for much more than you expected,  maybe much more than you can afford.   There are stories of people having medical bills close to $1 million  after an insurer used a loophole in their junk plan to deny them  coverage. We already know that many of the leading issuers of these  junk plans spend less than half of the premiums they receive on  healthcare. They pocket the money for profit and for salary, and the  poor person who is covered hardly gets anything. There ought to be  protections for that.   We don't live in the 1890s; we live in a modern-day America where we  believe in the private capitalist system. But we have protections. We  have learned through the centuries that people need them. But this  administration, aided by some of our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle--not all--just wants to roll back that clock for the benefit  of the big, powerful industries, hurting average, middle-class  Americans.   The Trump administration plans to increase premiums for middle-class  families and for older Americans. So many who have preexisting  conditions will have no choice but to remain in  [[Page S5533]]  comprehensive insurance, and their premiums will go way up. If you are  over 50 before you get Medicare, you had better be wary of these too.  Even if you don't want to buy the plan, it is going to cost you a lot  more--your existing one. Insurers across the country have already cited  the prospect of this rule as a major reason for the premium increases  that are coming up in 2019, and who knows how much higher the premiums  will go now that the rule is final.   Let me be clear. These new short-term plans are nothing short of junk  insurance. They are junk insurance, and the President is pushing them,  and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--many of them, not  all--are giving these junk plans a Good Housekeeping seal of approval  at the obeisance of big, powerful industry interests. These plans will  cost Americans more, both those who sign up for these plans and the  many who do not. We Democrats will do everything in our power to stop  these junk plans.   Instead of pushing new rules that weaken vital protections for people  with preexisting conditions and raising the cost of healthcare for  families, President Trump and Republicans in Congress should work  together in a bipartisan fashion--as some have tried to do, including  the Senator from Maine, who is standing behind me--to lower costs and  help the most vulnerable Americans.   I yield the floor and relinquish my leader time.    Madam President, I would like to join my friend the  majority leader in congratulating Dick Shelby on his 10,000th vote. I  knew him before he cast his first vote in the  [[Page S5537]]  Senate, when we were fellow Democrats in the House of Representatives.  That was a long time ago.   But one thing has been consonant throughout his career: his decency,  his honor, and, most of all, his desire to get things done for his home  State of Alabama and for our country. That has led him to be an  outstanding leader of the Appropriations Committee.   As the majority leader mentioned, we are working in a remarkably  smooth, bipartisan way. We hope that is a precedent of things to come.  We hope we will continue to work together and not let any outside  forces mess that up--not to mention any names.   He is just a wonderful guy. He really is. We see each other in the  gym in the morning. Let me tell you, Shelby is as fit as ever, huffing  and puffing away on the bike. That gives all of us solace because it  means he has even more strength to guide us through the appropriations  process for many years to come.   I wish to acknowledge his partner in this--they couldn't have done it  without working together--Senator Leahy. It is a great team, and we  look forward to continued bipartisanship, compromise, and success.   The Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S5586]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fluke Fairness Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Summer flounder is an important economic fish stock for       commercial and recreational fishermen across the Northeast       and Mid-Atlantic United States.        (2) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) was reauthorized in       2006 and instituted annual catch limits and accountability       measures for important fish stocks.        (3) That reauthorization prompted fishery managers to look       at alternate management schemes to rebuild depleted stocks       like summer flounder.        (4) Summer flounder occur in both State and Federal waters       and are managed through a joint fishery management plan       between the Council and the Commission.        (5) The Council and the Commission decided that each       State's recreational and commercial harvest limits for summer       flounder would be based upon landings in previous years.        (6) These historical landings were based on flawed data       sets that no longer provide fairness or flexibility for       fisheries managers to allocate resources based on the best       science.        (7) This allocation mechanism resulted in an uneven split       among the States along the East Coast which is problematic.        (8) The fishery management plan for summer flounder does       not account for regional changes in the location of the fluke       stock even though the stock has moved further to the north       and changes in effort by anglers along the East Coast.        (9) The States have been locked in a management system       based on data that occurred over a decade ago and the summer       flounder stock is not being managed using the best available       science and modern fishery management techniques.        (10) It is in the interest of the Federal Government to       establish a new fishery management plan for summer flounder       that is based on current geographic, scientific, and economic       realities.
