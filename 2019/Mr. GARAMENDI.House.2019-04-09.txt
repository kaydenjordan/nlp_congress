 Madam Speaker, I thank the freshman class for giving  me the opportunity to take a few seconds here.   Madam Speaker, I wish to recognize Brigadier General Thomas Kunkel  upon his departure as Chief, Air Force Legislative Liaison to the U.S.  House of Representatives.   In this role, General Kunkel managed the Air Force interaction with  Members of Congress and their staffs in support of the Air Force  programs and congressional oversight and travel.   He served as the Air Force's senior escort for staff and  congressional delegations, traveling to more than 20 countries,  supporting leadership, Members, and committee offices.                                time  1830    Prior to his current position, he served as the 23rd Wing Commander,  [[Page H3194]]  which operates A-10Cs, HC-130Js, HH-60Gs, and Guardian Angel  pararescuemen at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia; Davis-Monthan Air Force  Base, Arizona; and Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; and oversight of Avon  Park aerial gunnery range, Florida.   General Kunkel received his commission in 1994 from the University of  Texas, Arlington. He has served in the Air Force Special Operations and  the Combat Air Forces as an HH-60G special operations and rescue pilot,  flight examiner, and weapons officer. He has deployed in support of  operations Allied Force, Enduring Freedom-Philippines, Enduring  Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. During his time serving in operation Allied  Force, then Captain Kunkel was the pilot in command who rescued the now  Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General David Goldfein, whose aircraft  had been downed by an enemy surface-to-air missile in Serbia. General  Kunkel has also served on the Air Staff as Program Element Monitor for  helicopter sustainment and acquisitions.   He is married to Jennifer and has three children--Avery, Noah, and  Griff--who have supported him and his career.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. Congress and a grateful Nation,  I extend our deepest appreciation to Brigadier General Thomas E. Kunkel  for his dedicated service to the U.S. House of Representatives and to  our Nation. We wish him well as he moves on to his next role at the  National Military Command Center at the Pentagon.   There is no question that the Air Force, the Department of Defense,  the United States, and all of us have benefited greatly from his  service.
