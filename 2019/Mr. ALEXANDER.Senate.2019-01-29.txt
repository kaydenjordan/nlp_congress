 Mr. President, late in December, I announced that I  would not be a candidate for reelection to the U.S. Senate in 2020, and  that prompted this cartoon in the Knoxville News Sentinel by Charlie  Daniel:         He says his name is Alexander. He says he is going to walk       across the State. Wonder how far he will go.    Here is some character wandering across the State in a red and black  shirt, which is what I did 40 years ago when I walked across the State  running for Governor.   I would like to return the favor to Charlie Daniel because he  announced last week that he is retiring from drawing cartoons in the  Knoxville News Sentinel, which is a much more significant event than  anything I might do because Charlie Daniel has been a fixture in  Tennessee for a long time with his gentle skewering of politicians in  the Knoxville newspapers.   Charlie's cartoons have been the first things I have looked for in  the Knoxville newspapers since the year I graduated from Maryville High  School in 1958. That is when Charlie first began drawing for the  Knoxville Journal.    Charlie is a self-taught artist who says he has been drawing ever  since he ``picked up a pencil.'' After a stint in the Marine Corps,  Charlie studied political science at the University of North Carolina,  and he started drawing for the school newspaper. He moved to Knoxville,  where he started drawing at what was known as the Knoxville Journal in  1958. That is when I first saw Charlie Daniel's cartoons. He worked at  the Journal until it closed in 1992 and then moved to the Knoxville  News Sentinel, where he has been ever since. Some of his main subjects  for his cartoons have been sports, social causes, and, of course,  politics.   Over the years, Charlie has had plenty of opportunity to skewer me,  and he has done it with vigor. Actually, it has been honest, usually  gentle, and always effective. For example, as I was working on  legislation, which became law this past year, to ban the use of cell  phones on airplane flights, Charlie drew a cartoon characterizing cell  phone yappers on long flights as the ``perfect hell,'' with the Devil  asking why he didn't think of that.   Charlie's drawings are well known not just in Tennessee but all  across our country. In 2016, the National Cartoonists Society honored  Charlie with a proclamation recognizing his career. He was inducted to  the sixth class of the Tennessee Journalism Hall of Fame last year, and  the University of Tennessee library has a special collections  department with more than 20,000 of these drawings. There are about a  dozen that the University of Tennessee doesn't have because I have them  in my office or in my home.   Charlie's contributions have been recognized by Tennesseans for  decades. Our former Governor, Bill Haslam, said: ``For as long as I can  remember, Charlie has been making us laugh and think.'' Former Senate  Majority Leader Howard Baker, Jr., also from Knoxville, as is Governor  Haslam, said Charlie was ``the personification of civilized relevant  political humor.'' Former Knoxville mayor and Ambassador to Poland,  Victor Ashe, said: ``Charlie Daniel has been an icon and institution  across the country.''   East Tennesseans have been fortunate that Charlie and his family have  called our region home. For over six decades, Charlie's drawings have  been the first thing that I and many others have looked for in the  newspaper, and it is going to be harder to start each day without the  humor and the touch of Charlie Daniel.   Thank you, Charlie. Congratulations to you on your retirement. I wish  you and Patsy and your family the best on behalf of grateful  Tennesseans.   I yield the floor.
