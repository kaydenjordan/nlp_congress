 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my  colleagues--Senator Klobuchar, from Minnesota, and Senator Heitkamp,  from North Dakota--to talk about the most prominent issue facing us  right now; that is, what happens to healthcare for millions of  Americans.   At a town hall in Kentucky last week, Majority Leader McConnell said  that if he can't secure the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he  will have no choice but to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats on  legislation to repair and strengthen the law. Well, I was encouraged to  hear the majority leader say that because I don't think bipartisanship  should be a last resort. I think it should be the starting point. It  should be the beginning of the work we do in this Chamber because that  is what the American people want and that is the best way to make  lasting public policy.   This is especially true with healthcare legislation, which impacts  families all across America. As we have been hearing--and I have had a  chance to hear it directly from my constituents in New Hampshire--the  American people have wanted all along for to take a bipartisan  approach. It is unfortunate that our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle have spent months trying to pass a partisan, deeply unpopular  bill.   Now, I think we would all agree that there are changes we need to  make in the Affordable Care Act, something for which I have advocated  since we passed the law. I have had the opportunity to work with our  colleague Tim Scott from South Carolina. In 2015, we worked together to  make modest changes to the law to protect small businesses from  excessive premium increases. I think that bipartisan approach is  something with which, if we started today, we could make changes in the  Affordable Care Act to improve it and to make sure that Americans could  get better access to healthcare.   We all understand that there are problems currently in the market in  terms of premium increases, and we know why these premium increases are  happening. In their 2018 rate request filings, insurers justified the  increases because of the uncertainty surrounding the repeal of the ACA  and because this administration refuses to commit to making what are  called cost-sharing reduction payments.   These payments were included as part of the Affordable Care Act to  address premiums, deductibles, and copayments and to make them more  affordable for working families, basically, to be able to help people  afford insurance. The payments have been built into the rates that  insurers are charging for 2017. But as we look ahead to 2018, there is  a big problem because, if there is uncertainty around those payments,  it means premiums will skyrockets, insurers will leave marketplaces,  and people will lose their health coverage. Now, we could fix this  today if we were willing to work together, because we know what we need  to do.   I think New Hampshire offers a vivid example of what we are seeing  across the country. Last year, insurance markets were stable, health  insurance premiums increased an average of just 2 percent in New  Hampshire--the lowest annual increase in the country and in our State's  history. Unfortunately, today, because of the uncertainty in the  market, it is a very different story.   Insurers in New Hampshire are raising premiums for 2018. The same  thing is happening across the country. In some cases, insurers are  filing two different sets of rates--one premised on the  administration's continuing to make those cost-sharing payments that I  talked about earlier, and the second set with higher premiums to  account for continuing uncertainty and the possibility that the Trump  administration, which is legally charged with implementing the  Affordable Care Act, is going to renege on making the payments that  have been promised to insurers and, ultimately, to families so that  they can get healthcare.   This uncertainty is completely unnecessary. The instability in the  ACA marketplaces is a manufactured crisis, and we could put a stop to  it today. That is why I have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act,  a bill to permanently appropriate funds that would expand the cost- sharing reduction payments and ensure that we can count on those  payments being made.   I am pleased to be joined by 25 other Senators who have already  cosponsored this bill, and we can pass this right now if we had  agreement with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   The Marketplace Certainty Act is also supported by a broad spectrum  of provider and patient advocate groups--including the American Cancer  Society, the American Heart Association, the American Diabetes  Association, and the National Association of Community Health Centers,  just to name a few.   We can end the artificial crisis. We could immediately restore  certainty and stability to the health insurance markets. In turn, this  would give us the space we need to come together on a bipartisan basis  to improve the Affordable Care Act, to strengthen what is working, and  to fix what is not working. That is what we were sent to Washington to  do.   Bipartisanship should be our first choice, not a last resort. The  American people want us to stop bickering over healthcare, to work  together, and to make the commonsense improvements to the law that we  should be making.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota--North Dakota.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who are here this  afternoon for their eloquence, their remarks, their passion for making  sure the people in this country can get healthcare when they need it,  and for their hard work and legislation to try and make that happen.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1462    Mr. President, in the interest of trying to immediately help to  stabilize the insurance markets, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 1462; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    What is true about the Marketplace Certainty Act is  that it would guarantee the payments that were promised under the  Affordable Care Act--not to insurance companies but to families who  need help affording health insurance. That is one of the goals as we  think about what our challenge is to address the healthcare needs of  the people of this country, and that, in fact, is what the Marketplace  Certainty Act would do.    I want to be clear that what we need to do is to  provide certainty in the marketplace right now. What is happening  because of the effort by our Republican colleagues to repeal the  Affordable Care Act--which is providing coverage for literally tens of  millions of people--what is happening because of this administration's  refusal to guarantee those payments that would help people with the  cost of their health insurance is that we are seeing instability in the  marketplace. But the answer is not the proposal that was released this  morning, the second or maybe it is the third draft of healthcare  legislation that was done behind closed doors by our colleagues.   Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with two children from  New Hampshire: Parker, who is 8, and Sadie, who is 10. These kids were  here advocating for the children's hospitals that have meant that they  can continue to live. They are kids who were born with serious health  challenges. They continue to have those serious health challenges, but  thanks to Children's Hospital at Dartmouth and Boston Children's  Hospital, Parker and Sadie are alive today. They are smart, they are  beautiful, and they are the delight of their families. They have been  able to get the healthcare they need through CHaD and through Boston  Children's because they are able to get covered for their healthcare  under Medicaid. What our colleagues' healthcare legislation would do is  dramatically cut the Medicaid funding that Parker and Sadie and so many  children and old people and disabled in this country depend on in order  to stay alive.   That is a mean-spirited bill. That is not the answer to the serious  healthcare challenges we have in this country, and that is not what we  should be doing to fix what needs to be fixed in the Affordable Care  Act. What we need to do is work together.   I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  continue to work behind closed doors instead of having an open process.  If this legislation that was introduced this morning is such a great  piece of legislation, then let's go through regular order. Let's have a  hearing. Let's let the people of this country weigh in and then see  whether this is a healthcare bill we should pass.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.    Mr. President, I am very pleased that Afghanistan's  robotics team will be coming to Washington to compete with students  from nearly 150 countries in the FIRST Global Challenge, which begins  on Sunday, July 16. I extend a warm welcome to these brilliant young  minds, Lida Azizi, Somayeh Faruqi, Faramarz Najafi, Rodaba Noori,  Fatemah Qaderyan, Kawsar Roshan, and Alireza Mahraban. Of course, we  extend a warm welcome to the team's creation, a robot that can sort  balls, recognize blue and orange, and move objects to their proper  places. People across Afghanistan are extremely proud of the robotics  team's achievements. In recent days, Americans have become acquainted  with the many challenges they have overcome in order to excel in their  studies and come to the U.S., and we too, are very proud of them.   I have been impressed to learn about their passion for education and  determination to pursue STEM studies. This team's indomitable spirit is  a testament to what can be achieved through hard work, creativity, and  perseverance. Each member of the Afghan robotics team has become a  powerful symbol for young women across the globe, especially for those  in developing regions who face barriers to education and opportunity.   The FIRST Robotics Competition should also be recognized for its  ability to bring young people together in the name of science,  mathematics, and technology. It is the creation of Granite Stater Dean  Kamen, and had its beginnings in a New Hampshire high school gym a  quarter century ago. Today, FIRST programs reach more than 400,000  young people across the world every year. Beginning this weekend in  Washington, the FIRST Global Challenge will bring some of the best and  brightest young people from around the world to compete, to demonstrate  teamwork, and to forge new friendships.   It gives me great joy to know that Lida, Somayeh, Faramarz, Rodaba,  Fatemah, Kawsar, and Alireze will be among them. The FIRST Global  Challenge is a competition, and only one team will leave Washington  with top honors, but the seven young women representing Afghanistan are  already winners. They have had the courage to overcome barriers and the  audacity to compete with some of the most talented young people from  across the globe. I wish these young women great success. I thank them  for inspiring us with their fierce determination to achieve.                            ____________________
