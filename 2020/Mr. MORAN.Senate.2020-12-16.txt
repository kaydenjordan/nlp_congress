 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tonight I am pleased to speak as the  chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on the work we  have accomplished with our colleagues in the House to deliver today  meaningful benefits and reforms for our Nation's veterans and to  recognize the decades of service of two of our departing colleagues who  are dedicated to the well-being of our veterans.   Today the House passed the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D.  Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020. This  legislation is the culmination of more than 2 years  [[Page S7533]]  of bipartisan work, with input from all of our veteran service  organizations, dozens of Senators and Members of the House of  Representatives, our partners at the Department of Veterans Affairs,  and the leadership of the former Senate and House VA Committee  chairmen, Senator Isakson and Congressman Roe.   Among its many provisions, this legislation invests in the education  and employment of veterans to make certain they have the tools  necessary to achieve success after service through expanded  opportunities to use their earned benefits for longer periods of time  and more opportunities for job training.   This bill will also give the VA the tools necessary to serve veterans  at risk of homelessness in a more meaningful way during the pandemic  and require the VA to provide greater oversight and support to our  State veterans' homes.   It also includes provisions from the Deborah Sampson Act, a landmark  bill that makes clear women who serve their country in the Armed Forces  must have a VA that is as effective for them as it is for the men who  also have served.   As I mentioned, this bill is named after two public servants. Johnny  Isakson was my predecessor as chairman, and I have worked hard to  follow his example of bipartisanship in working with our VA Committee  ranking member, Senator Jon Tester. Legislation like this bill is the  result of many months of work by members of our staff, stemming from a  desire from both sides of the aisle to better serve our Nation's  veterans. The important relationships that exist between Senators, our  House colleagues, and our staff members result in a bipartisan solution  like the one that passed the House today and that passed the Senate  just a few days before.   I would also like to thank Dr. Phil Roe. I served with him in the  House of Representatives. He is the current House Veterans' Affairs  Committee ranking member and its former chairman. I thank him for his  partnership and his friendship as we worked together to serve veterans,  since we both served on that committee in the House together.   The VA is making positive, measurable changes to better serve our  veterans, and Congressman Roe and Senator Isakson deserve credit not  only for being a big part of that change but also for being an example  for the rest of us as to how we can work across the aisle and across  the Capitol to improve the lives of our country's veterans and all of  our fellow citizens.   I would also like to recognize Congressman Roe's counterpart, House  VA Committee Chairman Takano, for seeing this bill to completion in the  House of Representatives today.   I would like to thank my counterpart in the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, Ranking Member Jon Tester, the Senator from Montana, for his  hard work this past year in helping to lead our committee's efforts to  do the right thing for our Nation's veterans. This bill is a testament  to his dedication to serving our veterans and to his staff's tireless  work on veterans' behalf.   One more thank-you certainly rests with our SVAC members for  providing so many legislative solutions to issues that we have heard  from the VA, from our VSOs and from veterans in each of our home  States. I know that making certain our veterans continue to receive  care and benefits was foremost in their minds during this pandemic, and  I would like to thank Senators Boozman, Cassidy, Rounds, Tillis,  Sullivan, Blackburn, Cramer, Loeffler, and each of our Democratic  colleagues on the committee for their contribution to this landmark  legislation.   Our veteran service organizations often speak for veterans who cannot  speak for themselves, and they help Members of this body understand the  issues and concerns that veterans may be facing across the country in  addition to our own home States. I thank all of the VSOs that have  worked on this bill, for many years in many cases, meeting with me and  with our committee staff, explaining issues and working closely with us  to make certain we find the right solutions for our Nation's veterans.  I hope each VSO--veteran service organization--and its members will  benefit from this legislation following the President's signature. I  hope they will benefit for decades to come.   Finally, I want to thank our team at the Senate VA Committee for  everything they have put into this legislation.   Thank you to Senator Tester's staff for all of your thoughtful work  drafting the language to help address real issues that impact real  veterans.   Thank you to my VA staff, who have put in the work conducting  oversight and responding to casework so we can understand the needs of  veterans in Kansas and across the country and make meaningful, lasting  changes so they may experience the American dream that they once fought  so hard to secure for each of us.   Thank you to Chelsey Ladd, Victoria Lee, Scott Nulty, Kevin Ryan,  Thomas Wilson, Michele Payne, Barry Walker, Pauline Schmitt, Thomas  Coleman, Asher Allman, Jake Vance, Mark Crowley, Brian Newbold, Lindsay  Dearing, Emily Blair, Kelsey Baron, Tiffanii Woolfolk, and David  Shearman.   Finally, I want to recognize my staff director, Caroline Canfield,  who is ending her service with my office and with the Senate at the end  of this month. She has served as a tremendous asset. She is a  tremendous asset and a force multiplier as my military legislative  assistant, as my lead appropriations staffer, and now as my VA  Committee staff director.    Our Nation's veterans and our military members are better off because  of the work she has done throughout her career and because of her  tenacious ``never take no for an answer'' approach to doing all things  right.   Caroline, you will be missed, but you are always part of the team.  You deserve our gratitude for what you have accomplished on behalf of  our Nation's military men and women and on behalf of our veterans.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 867 and 868.
