 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4712,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, as have many of my  colleagues.   I find it interesting to hear from the party that brought us the  Affordable Care Act about the government interfering with healthcare  decisions. But that isn't what I want to talk about today.   I want to talk about the horrendous practice of sitting and watching  a child that was born alive die and not providing them care. The Born- Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 says every infant who is born  alive, at any stage of development, is a human being. However, there is  no law right now that criminalizes the act of abortionists who deny  care to babies who survive abortions.   These fragile young lives need care immediately once they are born,  which is why I strongly support this legislation. It not only requires  appropriate care for children who survive abortions, but it also  establishes strong criminal penalties for those who violate the law,  including punishing those who intentionally kill a child born alive.  Again, I think that is a violation of the Federal murder laws. You are  intentionally letting a child die, and you could help. You are a  doctor. You are trained.   As a strong supporter of life, it is important that we hold those who  kill innocent children accountable for what they do. I believe this law  will do that.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to please join me in  supporting this important legislation to protect the lives of our  newborn babies.
