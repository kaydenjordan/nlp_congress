 Madam Speaker, we just voted on H.R. 8. It is  the first gun control measure we have taken up in years. It is  progress, but we still have so far to go. There are so many lives that  have been taken from too many communities.   On February 15 in Aurora, Illinois, on the edge of my district, that  was the community where a man with a gun took five innocent lives:  Trevor Wehner, Clayton Parks, Vicente Juarez, Russell Beyer, and Josh  Pinkard.   They were fathers, brothers, sons, uncles, friends, and they joined a  long line of Americans who have been going about their daily lives and  got killed.   Here is what is really sickening: Most of the Members of this body  don't even know their names. A week from now, you are going to forget  their names, and you are going to replace them with another set of  names, not because they don't deserve to be remembered, but because  every day in America, 100 people get shot.  [[Page H2265]]    Can we remember all their names? I can't. And shame on us for  allowing that to happen.   Occasionally, one of those shootings captures our attention, and we  offer some thoughts and prayers. Leave that to families. Leave that to  people of faith. We are lawmakers. Our job is to write the laws, fix  the laws.   If we took 100 million guns off the street tomorrow, we would still  have more guns than any other country. We need to do more.                            ____________________
