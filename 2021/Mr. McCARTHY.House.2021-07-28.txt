 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendments and  to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Speaker of the House said that people  who are fully vaccinated but don't support wearing a mask are morons.  She went on to say that the House should follow the science.   Madam Speaker, you don't know the facts nor the science, so let's  talk about it.   The Speaker is referring to the CDC current recommendation. I just  left speaking with Dr. Monahan from the House. He said he used the CDC  recommendation on a report that hasn't been printed yet. He did not  know that the report is based upon India, about a vaccine that is not  approved in America. And now he did not know that it didn't even pass  peer review.   That is why vaccinated people in this House now have to wear a mask.  There is no science. But I guess the Speaker must have not known that.   Why wouldn't the Speaker know the facts? Do you know what frustrates  Americans the most? Hypocrisy. They hate the idea that you tell people  if you get vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. First, they tell  us don't wear a mask, wear a mask, wear two masks, then take the mask  off.   They said if Americans got vaccinated, we would get our lives back.  And we did, thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the past administration.   But what they also hate about hypocrisy is when you break your own  rules. It is kind of like telling America you can't go get your hair  cut, but you get caught on camera because you do it. Or you tell people  you can't go out to dinner, but in my same State, the State that the  individual got the haircut, that Governor went out to dinner with a lot  of people.   Today the Speaker, who didn't know her own science and said names to  people, broke her own rules. Twice today I saw the Speaker in a crowded  room without a mask, less than 24 hours after imposing the mask  mandate, which, again, is not based upon a study. It is based upon a  study in India, based upon a vaccine that isn't approved in America,  and it didn't pass peer review.   Could this be a plan to try to keep our schools closed?   Worst of all, this administration and now this House has broken the  country's trust. One size fits all.   You know, if you read the CDC recommendation, it said you only should  wear the mask for the hot spots. I am sure the gentleman on the other  side knows which States and which cities are hot spots, because those  are the facts. You can see the facts. You can read the facts. You can  understand the facts.   So what is Washington? The vaccination rate for the Members of  Congress is over 85 percent, and as of today the transmission rate on  the Capitol campus is less than 1 percent. Well, the facts will tell us  this isn't a hot spot, so the CDC recommendation doesn't apply to us.    Meanwhile, the hospitalization rate for the people who are vaccinated  is 0.003. As Washington Post columnist Henry Olsen points out, you are  more likely to get struck by lightning than be hospitalized with the  vaccine. It must be a stormy day in the House.   You know what is interesting? We serve in this Chamber, we represent  our districts, and we have Senators who represent our States just down  the hall. The science based upon the Speaker of this House changes  somewhere around the rotunda.   You see, you have to wear your mask here, otherwise you are fined;  because that is what government should do, they should punish people.  You get vaccinated. But if you walk across the hall, you get somewhere  around the rotunda, you don't have to wear it anymore. Somehow the  science is different.   One thing we do know about COVID, it affects older people different  than younger. Facts tell us people who serve in the Senate on average  are older than the people in the House. But the science and the health  over there is different than in here.   It is interesting, too, because I remember a short time ago when we  had the mask mandate during one of the impeachments the Democrats  brought up, the managers wore their masks here, but as they walked to  the Senate, they were able to take them off.   I am not quite sure how much COVID lives on this side of the  building. That must be science. That must be what the Speaker was  talking about.                                time  1645    The past administration worked hard for Operation Warp Speed. I am  proud of the fact of what we voted for. When we brought up bills on  this floor that talked about working toward a vaccine, that is where  the money went, not the trillions of dollars that were wasted that now  gave us inflation.   Americans want to get back to work, back to school, and back to  health. But we now have a majority that doesn't want to base anything  on science. They want to base something on a report that is not  printed, that can't pass peer review, based upon the country of India,  based upon a vaccine that is not even approved in America, because the  facts and the science are that the vaccines in America work. They are  effective. They are free.   I got a vaccine in December. I recommend all Americans get a vaccine.   It is a concern we all have. We go every day trying to get more  people vaccinated. What do you think the message is today? Those who  run this side of this building believe now if you are vaccinated, you  have to wear a mask even though the science doesn't say you should. I  am not sure how many more people are going to rush to get vaccinated.   But it is just like their philosophy. They want to mandate. They want  to impose. They want to tell you when you can go to school, when you  can eat.   Do you know what they are going to do if you walk into this building  without a mask? They are going to charge you $500. Why? Because they  have the power to do it.   You walk across the hall, not quite sure where they morph it into a  different science, you don't have to.   Mark my words, this is just the beginning. In a few weeks, schools  are supposed to open again. We know what the science says about COVID  with children. I think you are going to start seeing new reports. They  won't be printed, but they will try to keep the schools closed.   Maybe if I whisper, the President will listen. He tries it.   Then, they will try to shut our businesses down one more time.  Operation Warp Speed provided vaccines that were tested, that worked,  that are effective. The study, the science, proves it so. The  hospitalization rates prove it so.   I don't know of one person in this Chamber that is going to get  struck by lightning today. But I do know, even though the odds are  better you get struck by lightning than being hospitalized if you are  vaccinated, we are all going to have to wear a mask, or we have to pay  $500.   I don't know, the gentleman over there is going to run for the  Senate. Maybe he wants to do that so he doesn't have to wear a mask.  The science over there is better.
