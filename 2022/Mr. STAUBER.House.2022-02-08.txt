 Mr. Speaker, I thank the congressman for this Special  Order. It is needed and I appreciate the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the devastating fentanyl crisis  that is wreaking havoc on our communities and our families. The hardest  thing I ever had to do during my 23 years as a law enforcement officer  was tell an unsuspecting mother that her child had died due to a drug  overdose.   The opioid crisis has ravaged our communities for years, and when  people were forced inside during this pandemic, things only got worse.  For the first time ever, in 2021, drug overdoses in the United States  topped 100,000. Overdose deaths are now claiming a new victim every 5  minutes.   As stated earlier, fentanyl overdoses were the leading cause of death  for Americans aged 18 to 45 just last year. That is more than the  COVID-19 deaths, car crashes, or suicides put together for that age  group.   The American people are suffering. We have a moral obligation to do  everything we can to prevent another addiction, to prevent another  death, to prevent another heartbroken family. The DEA revealed in  December that criminal drug networks in Mexico, using resources from  China, are trafficking fentanyl over Biden's open southern border at a  rate that could provide a lethal dose to every American over seven  times.   Cartels and their drug runners are exploiting open border policies of  Joe Biden and this administration, and the American people are  literally paying the price with their lives. Without serious action,  this fentanyl will continue to flow across our border and affect our  families and communities.   Joe Biden must secure our border by finishing the wall, fully  reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy and send the clear message: Don't  come to the United States illegally.
