 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last month, we lost Kay Hagan after a  long illness.   Kay was always a fighter, starting with her days in the North  Carolina State Legislature and continuing to when she answered the call  of serving the Senate during the perilous days of the great recession.  Kay was the right person to fight for North Carolina when she was  needed the most.   She came from a family who knows service and sacrifice. Her uncle was  Lawton Chiles, a Korean war veteran and former Representative, Senator,  and Governor of Florida. Her father and brother served in the Navy. Her  father-in-law was a major general in the Marine Corps. Her husband is a  Vietnam veteran who used his GI bill to pay for law school. When Kay  talked about veterans' issues, she spoke from the heart.   Kay was born into politics. As a young girl, she was putting bumper  stickers on cars for her uncle. Her father won an election to become  mayor of Lakeland, FL. While interning for her uncle, Kay learned about  the ups and downs of Congress, literally. She operated the Senators- only elevator in this building.   North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt first encouraged Kay to run for  office when she served as his Guilford County campaign chairman. In  1998, she unseated a Republican incumbent and won a seat in the North  Carolina State Senate. For 10 years, Kay Hagan earned a reputation as a  commonsense hard worker, interested in results, not partisan fighting.  As cochair of the State budget committee, she increased the State's  rainy day fund and balanced five straight budgets. She helped make  record investments in education, raised the pay for teachers, and  increased the minimum wage.   She was one of the most versatile women in her State. She juggled  Girl Scout events, winning reelection four times, raising her growing  family, and serving as a Sunday school teacher and a Presbyterian  Church elder.   In 2008, Kay ran for and won a U.S. Senate seat, becoming the  Senate's first female Democratic Senator. With her family's military  background, it surprised no one that Kay fought hard in the Senate for  military families and veterans. When she heard about 9-year-old Janey  Ensminger--daughter of a retired marine--passing away from leukemia  because of contaminated water on the base of Camp Lejeune, she worked  to pass the Janey Ensminger Act to help those affected receive  healthcare.   Kay also introduced a bill that was close to my heart. It would ban  for-profit colleges from using the phrase ``GI bill'' in their  aggressive marketing efforts aimed at separating veterans and  servicemembers from their hard-earned education benefits.   Kay was fearless with her voting. She made the toughest votes count,  knowing the consequences to her own career. As long as it helped people  of North Carolina and the United States, she was always a crucial  partner. The Affordable Care Act and the 2009 economic stimulus package  were politically difficult for many, but Kay stepped up and supported  them. She was brave to the highest degree. Historians will remember  that bravery. She stepped up when America needed her. Today, because of  it, America is stronger and better.   We will all remember Kay Hagan for her friendship and that we had the  privilege to call her a friend and colleague.   She is survived by her husband Chip, her three children--Jeanette  Hagan, Tilden Hagan, Carrie Hagan Stewart--her father Joe P. Ruthven,  two brothers, and five grandchildren.   It was my honor to serve with Kay Hagan and to memorialize her  service to North Carolina and the United States in this statement  today.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Jones), the Senator from  Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2865         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
