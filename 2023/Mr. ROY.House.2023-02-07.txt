 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am glad  to have him on the Rules Committee and glad to serve with him.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been asking  what have we been doing over the last few weeks?   Well, I will tell you what we have been doing. We have been  protecting babies born alive. We have been protecting families from the  invasive audits of the Internal Revenue Service, or at least trying to  if Chuck Schumer doesn't block it; trying to protect the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve from 200 million barrels being dumped by the  President heading right into an election, lo and behold.    Now, how about protecting, last week, nurses and doctors from being  fired for daring to want to protect their own health and well-being by  not taking a shot, a shot which the CDC Director says does nothing for  transmission of COVID. Those are the facts.   We are standing with the American people. American people are sick  and tired of an overbearing Federal Government sticking its nose where  it doesn't belong into the well-being, into the health, into the jobs,  into the lives of the American people. That is the truth.   Now, what are we trying do? Today, we want to protect individuals  from being punished if they want to try to come to the United States  but haven't had a vaccine; again, a vaccine which the CDC Director says  does nothing for transmission. Those are the truths.   Here is the fact: Right now, a vaccinated noncitizen with COVID can  enter the United States, via air travel, but an unvaccinated noncitizen  who doesn't have COVID would be denied entry. That is the logic of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle; that is, there is no logic.  That is the problem.   Everything about COVID has been free of logic and, rather, full of  emotion. That is the truth.   We have been destroying the American economy. We have been destroying  the future of our children; forcing them into the corners with masks;  forcing them to be denied education. We have been destroying the  futures of families whose family members have lost jobs; who haven't  been able to serve; who haven't been able to carry out their  livelihoods as doctors, as nurses, as public servants who have been  unable to carry out their jobs, including men and women in uniform,  until Republicans demanded, in December, that we protect our men and  women in uniform from getting fired for daring to say I don't want to  have a needle stuck in my arm when there is plenty of evidence  indicating myocarditis and other concerns that arise from it.   I wonder why we haven't had any committee hearings by my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle diving into the origins of COVID, diving  into the side effects of the vaccine?   Well, we are going to do it now, and history is going to judge us,  and we are going to be on the side of protecting the American people.   I will tell you one last thing: This is the capital city of the  United States of America, and Congress has the authority to protect the  people who want to visit here and to make sure that American citizens  are the ones who vote. It is not a State. It is our Nation's Capital  seat.                                time  1315
