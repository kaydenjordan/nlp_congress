 Mr. President, on February 13 the Rules Committee approved  S. Res. 70, which authorizes funding for the Senate's committees from  March 1, 2019, through February 28, 2021. For this 24-month period, the  18 committees covered by this resolution are authorized to spend up to  $214,055,860. This is a small increase over the funding authorized by  the current committee funding resolution, S. Res. 62. For the  information of my colleagues, committee funding authorized by S. Res.  70 remains 13 percent below levels from a decade ago.   Committees are the lifeblood of the legislative process. It is in our  committees that policy is created and programs and agencies are  overseen. Our committees are where the Senate first exercises its  advice and consent function over the executive branch's nominees. Well- functioning committees are crucial to the Senate's role as a separate  but equal branch of the government.   The resolution before the Senate is the result of a bipartisan  process Senator Klobuchar, the Rules Committee's ranking member, and I  undertook this year to solicit more input from committee chairmen and  ranking members. The resolution reflects the needs identified by our  colleagues and will help ensure our committees are able to carry out  their responsibilities and duties.   I would like to thank Fitz Elder and Rachelle Schroeder from my  committee staff; Lizzy Peluso and Lindsey Kerr from Senator Klobuchar's  committee staff; and Cindy Qualley, the Rules Committee's chief clerk.  Additionally, I would like to thank Ileana Garcia and Ted Ruckner from  the Disbursing Office and John Henderson from the Office of Legislative  Counsel. I greatly appreciate their hard work in developing this  resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar No. 25, S. Res. 70.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Continuing as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.  Con. Res. 21.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be  agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you, Mr. President.   One of those items was an enrolling correction and the other was  funding for committees. Our committees are beginning to do their work,  and this makes it, obviously, appropriate and possible for them to do  that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I just listened to the other debate on the  floor, and it reminded me of the fact that our friends on the other  side of the aisle introduced a resolution calling on the Federal  Government to adopt what they call the Green New Deal.   From my point of view, the legislation is pretty far outside the  mainstream in what it is proposing and how it is proposing the problems  we should be debating. I don't have any problem with that. Those  problems should be solved, and even though it seems pretty far outside  the mainstream of thought, at least 12 of our colleagues in the Senate  have cosponsored it. The majority leader thought it would be fair if we  had that idea out there--it is  [[Page S1520]]  getting a lot of public attention--to have a chance to debate this  legislation and vote on it in the Senate.   The Democrats have called it a sham. They said: Why should we have  debate on this piece of legislation? Why would we want to vote on this  piece of legislation?   Now, it is not cosponsored by a majority of the Members of the  Senate, but it is cosponsored by over 25 percent of the Democrats in  the Senate, and one would think that if 25 percent of their conference  is sponsoring a bill, they would be glad to come to the floor and talk  about that bill and talk about what it does.   So let's talk for just a couple of minutes about what that bill  actually says. One of the things that it does is that it calls for the  United States to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. That is just  a little more than 10 years from now. It says, basically, that we want  to have a zero-carbon-dioxide emissions by then.   I know there was some discussion in the rolling out of this bill that  that would mean that ground transportation and air transportation would  either be eliminated or minimized--at least the way we travel right now  would be. At some point in the future that may happen, but it is highly  unlikely it is going to happen in the next 10 years, which is what the  bill calls for. Maybe that is why they don't want to debate it. Even  President Obama's former science adviser says that this is not  feasible. Harvard University professor John Holdren was quoted in the  New York Times saying: ``As a technologist studying this problem for 50  years, I don't think we can do it.''   So that is a pretty good source who indicates that what we are  talking about here can't happen. So that big headline goal appears to  be impossible, but we probably could debate it anyway. Let's hear from  the other side, particularly the 12 cosponsors, to say why it is  possible, why we should be able to do that, and why that is in the  legislation that they filed.   The rest of the legislation goes really beyond things that don't  relate to the environment. There is a laundry list of policies that  appear to be popular right now in the so-called progressive discussion.  One is a single-payer health system and the other is a Federal job  guarantee. The talking points suggested that that would be a Federal  job guarantee for people who can't work or aren't willing to work. Of  course, that was so controversial that immediately people began to say:  Well, maybe that is something that the Republicans snuck into our  talking points. But it turned out that wasn't true.   There is a provision calling for ``repairing the historic oppression  of . . . youth.'' That is sort of what this whole Green New Deal seems  to focus on--accepting responsibility in a debate for things that  really don't make the kind of sense one would want them to make as you  move toward legislation. They don't really say what the ``historic  oppression of youth'' was. Probably that is not related to the economy  or the environment or the greenness of the Green New Deal.   But even if we agree that these ideas are good ideas, the other  question is this: How much is it going to cost?   The American Action Forum looked at the biggest parts of the  legislation, and they estimated that the total would run anywhere from  $51 trillion to $94 trillion over 10 years. To put this in perspective,  the Congress right now appropriates about $1.5 trillion a year. We  spend more than that through programs that are in place like Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we appropriate $1.5 trillion a  year. If the estimates of the Green New Deal are right, that would  suddenly become $5 trillion to $9 trillion a year. That is a pretty  good multiplier of $1.5 trillion a year--six times, in fact, of what we  are spending now--at the $9 trillion level. That works out to be about  $65,000 per family per year. That would probably be more government  than we could afford, but that is how it works out.   There is nothing that talks about how families are supposed to come  up with their share of the bill.   While some of the ideas in the Green New Deal--Medicare for all or a  job for everybody, guaranteed by the government--sound like good ideas,  I don't think they are going to stand the test of the debate. I think  that is one of the reasons that maybe the other side doesn't want to  have the debate.   Some talk about: Well, maybe we will all vote present or we will not  vote at all.   I think it is pretty hard to defend what you are out there talking  about when you are not willing to come to the floor and talk about it.  That is a debate we are going to have. I suspect we are going to have  it sometime this month, and I look forward to engaging in that debate.   This week, we are having another debate on nominees. Right now, the  debate is on the nominee for the Administrator of the EPA. There has  been some discussion of the environment in the debate on the  Administrator of the EPA. Next, we are going to go to someone to serve  on the TVA commission. This is somebody who has been voted out of  committee two times in bipartisan voice votes and never allowed to have  a vote in the Senate.   I will remind my colleagues again that under President Reagan, the  average time in days from when a person was voted out of committee--and  remember, as all of us on the floor would know, the committee is where  questions are asked, and the background check has been completed. That  may take a substantial amount of time, depending on the nominee and how  complicated their information is--sometimes less time, sometimes more.  That has all happened in the committee.   Under President Reagan, the average number of days from the time a  person was voted out of committee until they were voted on, on the  floor was 5. The total number of times the majority had to file cloture  to get that vote was less than a handful in the entire first 2 years.   For President Trump, the average number of days for a nominee to be  voted on is 55, and the majority leader had to file cloture 128 times  even to get a vote. We are going through some of those votes this week.  The 30 hours of debate almost never includes debate about the nominee  who is using up floor time that could be used for debating how we spend  our money, how we defend our country, or what our foreign policy  oversight responsibilities are going to be.   We are going to continue to look at the options and continue to talk  to our friends on the other side about how 60 Senators can work  together to change the rules in a way that they would be changed going  forward to get the rules back more to the days of Ronald Reagan, George  Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and all of their predecessors, where  nominees were never used as a way to use up time. Nominees were never  held hostage so that other legislation or debate couldn't occur.   We are working hard to find 60 of us who want to return to a time  when legislative priorities in the Senate still had the protections of  the minority that have always been there, but those protections  couldn't be used to the disadvantage of people who have stepped up and  are willing to serve and are often voted out of committee on a  bipartisan basis, only to be held up on the floor.   I look forward to the debate on the Green New Deal. I look forward to  the other debates we are going to have on the floor of the Senate this  year.   For the people who are willing to serve, who have been reported out  of committee, who have been thoroughly questioned and investigated but  can't get that vote and get to work, that is not what we want to do.  That is not who we should want to be. I hope we can work together to  find a way to change that rule as well.   I see my good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, is here. We are  working on some things together right now that we would like to get to  the floor and have those bills voted on later.   I yield the floor.
