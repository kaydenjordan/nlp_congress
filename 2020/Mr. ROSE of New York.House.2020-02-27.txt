 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  constituent, Dr. Mohammad Khalid, a man who truly embodies the American  Dream.   Dr. Khalid came here from Pakistan and settled on Staten Island in  1975 where he opened his dental practice and worked hard to provide for  his children, both of whom are now successful attorneys.   Dr. Khalid says he considers it his moral and ethical duty to help,  and he shows that every single day, not just in his professional life,  but in all of his extraordinary community service. Dr. Khalid is a  cultural ambassador on Staten Island, serving as the president of the  Iron Hills Civic Association and the Pakistani Civic Association.   After the tragic events of 9/11, Dr. Khalid and the Pakistani Civic  Association worked to bring Staten Islanders together. Now doing this  for 15 years, they have served meals and shared their culture all for  the betterment of our community.   I am proud to represent such a diverse and inclusive community full  of leaders like Dr. Khalid, who exemplify the hard work, grit, and  determination that make this country so great.                            ____________________
