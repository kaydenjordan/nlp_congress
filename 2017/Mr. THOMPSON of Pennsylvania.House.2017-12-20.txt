 Mr. Speaker, as individuals across the  country travel near and far to be with loved ones this holiday season,  I ask that we remember our military personnel who will not be  surrounded by family and friends this Christmas. Instead, our military  men and women  [[Page H10250]]  will be stationed all over the world to protect and defend the United  States of America.   There are about 1.3 million military personnel on Active Duty who  serve in more than 170 countries. While it is not easy to be away from  family, it is especially difficult during the holidays.   But, Mr. Speaker, events like American Red Cross' Holiday Mail for  Heroes card-signing campaign lets our troops know that we are keeping  them in our thoughts and prayers. Since 2007, the Holiday Mail for  Heroes program has provided Americans the opportunity to extend holiday  greetings, expressions of gratitude, and well wishes to servicemembers,  veterans, and their families. Last year, the Red Cross distributed  thousands of cards to troops across the globe.   As we are extending our support to military personnel serving  overseas, the Marine Corps Reserve is giving back to those who are less  fortunate right here in our own backyard. Toys for Tots, which was  founded in 1947 by Reservist Major Bill Hendricks, collects new,  unwrapped toys each year and distributes them as Christmas gifts to  children in need. As of 2016, Toys for Tots collected and distributed  more than 512 million toys to less fortunate children.   That kind of selflessness truly embodies the spirit of Christmas.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget to honor our fallen heroes this  Christmas season. One of our finest holiday traditions that honors our  fallen servicemembers took place last Saturday: Wreaths Across America.   Many Americans can recall the iconic photograph of wreaths on the  tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery. Snow blankets the ground.  Red ribbons adorn the balsam wreaths, which lay on rows of tombstones  as far as the eye can see.   This annual tribute began in 1992 by a Maine wreathmaker named  Morrill Worcester, who donated 5,000 wreaths to Arlington National  Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes.   Today, Wreaths Across America has grown into a national organization.  A total of 1.2 million wreaths were placed on markers across the  country in more than 1,200 locations, with more than 200,000 at  Arlington National Cemetery alone. The mission is to remember, honor,  and teach. Morrill describes the wreaths as a symbol of honor, respect,  and victory.   As we celebrate with our loved ones, let us remember all of our  military men and women, especially those we lost in service to this  Nation. Thank you to Morrill and to all the volunteers who honor their  memory.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of our troops serving at home and overseas.  I wish them a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.   Merry Christmas and God bless America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.

Jarrod, the grandson of a World War II veteran, wanted his Eagle  Scout project to benefit veterans, so he began working in the spring on  a reflection project outside the Veterans Center in Charleston  Township, in Tioga County.   He collected donations to assist with establishing a flagpole, black  metal benches, and a monument. At the project's completion, he donated  the remaining funds to the Veterans Affairs Outreach Fund.   Jarrod worked with 10 volunteers on the project for 3 months, and he  spent about 80 hours working on his Eagle Scout project. The flagpole  and the reflection area were finished on April 21.   Jarrod, who graduated from North Penn-Liberty High School in June,  now works at Sullivan Farms in Mainesburg. His project was dedicated  earlier this month, on the 76th anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day on  December 7.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of Jarrod, his patriotism, and his respect  for those who serve. I wholeheartedly commend Jarrod Davis on this  outstanding project.                            ____________________
