 Madam Speaker, today I come before the House of  Representatives to honor and recognize the sacrifice of Sergeant Bishop  Evans of the Texas National Guard, age 22, of Arlington, Texas.   Sergeant Evans gave his life to save two others. He exemplifies the  spirit of service and sacrifice that those who volunteer to serve in  our Nation's military personify.   He died an American hero. He was a light in times of darkness. May  God bless his family.   Madam Speaker, at this time I request a moment of silence to honor  the life of Sergeant Bishop Evans.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I come before the House of Representatives  to recognize the Midlothian Innovative Learning Experience, or MILE, as  the nonprofit of the year in 2021 for the city of Midlothian, Texas.   This is a state-of-the-art educational facility that is providing  high school students with additional learning pathways throughout the  community. Nonprofits are a fundamental part of America, and I thank  Midlothian Innovative Learning Experience for their dedication to  teaching the future generation.   It is important that we bring awareness to career and technical  education so that people can learn about many different professions at  a younger age. Career and technical education is a perfect way for  students to apply what they are taught in school to a real-world  environment.   MILE offers five career and technical education pathways: culinary  arts, entrepreneurship, civil engineering, aerospace engineering, and  cybersecurity. These programs provide students the opportunity to  utilize industry-standard equipment and practices they have shown an  interest in.   This unique learning space is able to replicate scenarios found in a  professional, real-world working atmosphere. With the support from  industry professionals, MILE is able to thrive and partner with  Midlothian Independent School District.   It is an honor to represent this group of mentors who help contribute  to the outstanding education found all around Texas' Sixth District. I  thank them for all they do.                Recognizing Orise Kopnak on Her 100th Birthday     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Orise Kopnak,  who just celebrated her 100th birthday.   Twice a week, this Waxahachie, Texas, resident volunteers at Baylor  Scott & White hospital to volunteer in the day surgery department  waiting room. Since 2014, she has logged more than 2,400 hours of her  personal time to encourage, serve, and assist people who are waiting  for a loved one to come out of surgery.   Orise's faithfulness to stand with the families, friends, and  caregivers of patients during anxious and often difficult circumstances  is a testament to her character. Even during a pandemic, Orise  continued to volunteer.   People like Orise Kopnak represent everything that is good about our  country. America was built on the volunteer principle. It has been  instrumental in our Nation's advancement and made us, as Americans, a  strong and self-reliant people.   Ronald Reagan once said the volunteer spirit is the engine that  drives the whole history of the United States. It is an extra dimension  of faith, friendship, and brotherhood that makes us good neighbors and  good people and made America a great country.   I thank Orise for showing us how it is done. There is a reason her  generation has been dubbed the Greatest Generation. May God bless her  as she continues to carry out one of life's greatest causes: serving  others.                           Recognizing Demond Davis     Madam Speaker, I take this time to recognize one of my  constituents, Ellis County Sheriff's Deputy Demond Davis.   Deputy Davis was new to the sheriff's force when he responded to a  10-200, which is a drug-related incident. Once he arrived, he witnessed  a drug overdose. The individual was struggling, barely breathing, and  his conditions were intensifying. Deputy Davis rushed to help and  quickly administered Narcan nasal spray.  [[Page H4604]]    According to the account, the individual immediately started coming  to. They were transported to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in  Waxahachie, where they received additional medical attention.   Deputy Davis' actions ensured another person did not fall victim to  the opioid epidemic. Ellis County Sheriff Brad Norman awarded the Life- Saving Award commendation and pin to Deputy Davis for his heroic  actions.   Drug overdoses, especially from fentanyl, have become more prevalent  in the U.S. Deputy Davis and his fellow law enforcement officers are  our front line in responding to this terrible crisis. We cannot thank  our law enforcement and first responders enough. America needs more  heroes like Deputy Demond Davis.                        Congratulating Timothy Redhair     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and congratulate a  resident of Waxahachie, Texas, Timothy Redhair, who was promoted to the  rank of colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve this month.    Colonel Redhair has a long and distinguished career in the military  while also being a steward of our community.   As a lieutenant colonel, he commanded the 2nd Battalion, 132nd  Infantry Regiment of the Texas Army National Guard and later had the  opportunity to lead the Headquarters Battalion of the Texas Army  National Guard's 36th Infantry Division.   During the height of the pandemic, Colonel Redhair deployed with his  division to Kuwait. After returning from the Middle East, Timothy  joined the Army Reserve, where he serves as the emergency preparedness  liaison officer for Texas.   When Colonel Redhair isn't protecting our community, he spends his  time as an assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 520, Circle Ten Council of  the Boy Scouts of America, where he trains young men and women to  become our future leaders.   This commitment to our country and our community is outstanding, and  I am glad to see such a worthy member of our community receive this  honor.   I thank Colonel Redhair again for his service and congratulate him on  his well-deserved promotion.                                time  1645                            In Support of Ukraine     It has been over 2 months since Russia invaded Ukraine.  We are witnessing a war crime forced upon the people of Ukraine.   But from this tragedy we have seen great strength from the Ukrainian  people, as well as a great deal of kindness and support from our fellow  Americans.   In fact, throughout Texas District Six, you will see support with  Ukrainian flags being flown and people donating their time to help the  people of Ukraine. For example, Waxahachie's very own Gregg Burdette  went with a nine-person team from Texas Baptist Men to assist with  Ukrainian refugees in Poland.   Gregg's team spent 10 days volunteering in shelters and receiving and  sorting donated materials. With volunteers from all over the world,  they were able to help many families and children get food, supplies,  and a good night's rest.   Gregg is not the only District Six native giving aid to Ukraine.  Surepoint Medical Centers, a local free-standing emergency room chain  based out of Mansfield, Texas, donated their own medical supplies to  aid the people of Ukraine.   With the help of many District Six residents who work for Surepoint,  they were able to send critical medical supplies that included  tourniquets, bandages, and various other lifesaving items.   I am proud of the work and kindness not just from the people of  District Six, but everyone else who has donated any time, supplies, or  sent prayers to the Ukrainian people in their time of need.   My friend from Arizona, I appreciate you yielding me time.
