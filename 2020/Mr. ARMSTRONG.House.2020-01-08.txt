 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  rise today in support of H.R. 4500, the Promoting United States  Wireless Leadership Act.   American companies have time and again proven themselves as global  leaders in developing and deploying new technology. To ensure we  maintain our competitive edge and advance future wireless capabilities,  the government must work with the private sector to position the U.S.  as a global leader in the development of 5G standards.   H.R. 4500 fosters this relationship by encouraging companies and  other stakeholders to participate in international standards-setting  bodies while also offering technical assistance to participants.   With China seeking to erode our technical advantage at every turn, it  is more important than ever to promote American leadership and  innovation in our telecommunications networks.   I thank Mr. Walberg, Mrs. Dingell, and Mrs. Brooks for sponsoring  this important legislation.
