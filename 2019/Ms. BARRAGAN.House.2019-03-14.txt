 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg and to wish her a happy 86th birthday this Friday.   During this Women's History Month, we celebrate visionary women like  Justice Ginsburg, whose work ethic and achievements have motivated me  and many women across this country.   Throughout her career, Justice Ginsburg has been a pioneer for gender  equality. As a first-year Harvard Law student, she was one of nine  women in a 500-person class and became the first female professor to  have tenure at Columbia.   She would later cofound the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, paving the  way for groundbreaking work around issues like pregnancy and parenting,  education equity and equal pay.   Undoubtedly, Justice Ginsburg has set a precedent for women  everywhere and continues to do so as a Supreme Court Justice.   I wish Justice Ginsburg many more years of health and happiness. She  truly is an American hero.  [[Page H2734]]                                ____________________
