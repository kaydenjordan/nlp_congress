 Will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, at the conclusion of the remarks of the  Senator from Missouri, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for  such time as I may consume.    Mr. President, before the Senator from Missouri leaves,  confession is good for the soul, and I want to share something that  will shock him, which is that there are a number of things that I did  when I was in high school and in college that are not very prominently  displayed in my campaign material. So, there, I have said it.   We had a vote this morning, but a lot of people who have been on the  phone today have not really been sure what we did with that vote this  morning. We had the vote this morning because we had to move forward in  order to have the final consideration of this great nominee  tomorrow. It was filibustered by the Democrats, and, of course, we had  to do a cloture vote. I know this is somewhat in the weeds here, but  that is what we have to do. That vote took place.  [[Page S6578]]    At some time tomorrow we will actually have this vote. I start by  saying that I am enthusiastically a ``yes'' vote tomorrow. I think that  goes without saying.   I met with Judge Kavanaugh in my office back when he was first  nominated. In fact, I have studied him before. I remembered him when he  was nominated the first time, about 6 years ago, and I talked to him at  that time. I thought: Well, has he really changed that much? Is it  necessary? I even said: It is really not necessary; I have followed his  career and all of that. But he came by anyway.   The things that I like--and I am not a lawyer--are the things that he  did that show him as a human being, more than just a nominee to be a  Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court--the human things that he did. I know  for a fact because I talked to her--one of his good friends who died  had a wife and two girls, like his two girls. When back-to-school night  comes, he takes those two girls with his to back-to-school night. This  is the type of thing he does.   We have heard all of the warm things about what he has done as a  coach and other things. That is the human being I know. Meeting with  him wasn't necessary because I was sold on him anyway after looking at  his record.   On the eve of Kavanaugh's nomination, heading toward certain  nomination, we were hit by a bomb. It was an uncorroborated attack that  the Democrats sat on for 2 months. That is critical. You have to stop  and think about that. Why would they take something they thought was so  important to destroy this fine man and wait for 2 months and sit on it?  I am surprised they didn't let it slip. It is just because they wanted  to make sure people were talking about it.   The details of the allegation were of the worst kind--an aggressive,  ugly sexual attack.   Sexual assault and violence is wrong, period. It is wrong, and so  many women who experience sexual assault and harassment do not feel  empowered to come forward even years later--maybe never.   It is also unjust for someone to be accused of a crime that he or she  did not commit and be convicted in the court of public opinion without  any evidence or corroborated accounts.   It is hard to wrap your head around the fact that someone who has  been in the public eye for decades, respected by his colleagues, his  law clerks, his students, his friends, his family--everyone--and never  had a whisper of wrongdoing in all of those years, and all of a sudden  he is accused of such a heinous crime.   Like many Americans, I watched the hearing last Thursday in the hope  that it would provide more clarity and some answers, and I think it  did. It would be easy to get wrapped up in the conflicting media  coverage and all the spin and so on; instead, I looked at what we know  to be true--what we know to be true.   The people Dr. Ford places at the scene that night have either denied  the events or do not recall any party or gathering that matches her  description, so that is an idle accusation.   Her lifelong friend--in fact, some people characterize her as her  best friend--is a person Dr. Ford named in her allegations as the only  other girl at that small gathering. So here is a small gathering; she  is accusing him of this behavior. There was one other girl there, and  the other girl says that she does not know Brett Kavanaugh and has  never attended a party where he was there. It can't be more definite  than that, and that is from her best friend.   When Dr. Ford's testimony is compared to other statements that she  made to her therapist, to the Washington Post, to the ranking member,  and her statement for the polygraph exam, there are various  inconsistencies that should not be ignored.   Dr. Ford's inability to remember key details of the alleged attack-- things like the date, the place, and other circumstances surrounding  the event--places Judge Kavanaugh in a difficult position to defend  himself as Democrats and the media unjustly shift the burden of proof  from the accuser to the accused. I don't remember that happening  before. This is still America.   From the beginning, Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the  accusations and has not wavered or equivocated on this point.   He has cooperated with the Judiciary Committee's investigation--that  is Senator Grassley's committee--every step of the way, including  speaking with committee staff under oath several times over the course  of the last couple of weeks and providing documentation to help clear  his name. He has done it all. Everything we have asked of him, he has  done.   On the other hand, Dr. Ford's attorneys have refused to turn over key  evidence that her testimony relied on to corroborate her claims: her  therapist's notes that were shown to the Washington Post but not to the  committee, messages she exchanged with the reporter, the documentation,  and the recordings related to the polygraph test she took in early  August. They were refusing to turn over key evidence. They didn't have  any evidence they could turn over, so no wonder there are no witnesses  who can corroborate the accusations that have been made against this  fine man.   I am not going to go into the other allegations. There are two others  that came along.   The timing of this is kind of interesting. First of all, they  withheld this document that Dr. Ford had for 2 months. It is hard to  keep a secret around this place, and I am surprised that didn't come  out. They did it for a purpose. What do you think that purpose was?  What other purpose could it have been, other than they were waiting for  the last minute to come out with something that was never discussed  before? No other accusation had been made. That is what happened.   Based on the totality of what we know, to condemn anyone for an  offense that has been denied and not proven--I would caution anyone  against doing the same thing.   John Adams, our second President of the United States, wrote--now  listen to this--``But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and  condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say `whether I do good  or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no  protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind  of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever.'' That is  what he said.   Let's look at what Scripture says. Numbers 35:30 says:         If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to       death on the evidence of witnesses. But no person--    No person--         shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness.    Think about that. That is a direct violation of what they are trying  to do.   So you have Adams, you have the Bible, and then there is our judicial  system. It is reflected in our judicial system as well: innocent until  proven guilty. It is more than just a phrase; it is a cornerstone of  the rule of law since before our founding, and its wisdom has been  borne out time and again throughout history: Innocent until proven  guilty.   That is really what is on trial here: innocent until proven guilty. I  have never seen this happen before, and I have been around for a long  time. It cuts through the drama and focuses on the facts. That is why I  continue to support Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation.   Judge Kavanaugh's name has been unjustly run through the mud by these  subsequent allegations that even the New York Times did not deem fit to  print and that were brought forth by a known publicity seeker with an  ax to grind against the President, looking for nothing but attention  and more fame for himself   I am dismayed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  taken these uncorroborated and fantastical allegations at face value  and run with them. I feel the Democrats showed their hand in the days  since last week's hearing when the agreement on the supplemental FBI  background investigation was made. The narrative has shifted from  allegations of sexual misconduct to ones of judicial temperament, as my  friend from Missouri pointed out.   I am not a lawyer, but everyone knows the saying that if the law is  on your side, argue the law. If the facts are on your side, argue the  facts. If neither the facts nor the law are on your side, pound the  table. That is what we are hearing right now. The difference here is  that the Democrats are trying to outdo each other in pounding the  table.  [[Page S6579]]    They know the allegations are not proven. They know that Judge  Kavanaugh remains committed to his innocence and the process, and they  know that Republicans will remain committed to the facts, so they must  change tactics, move the goalpost one more time, and attack him on  other grounds.   The first of these is to question his temperament. Because he  defended himself, his family, career, and his name so forcefully and  passionately, he did not demonstrate the calm, measured, and detached  demeanor that one should expect of a judge. Well, the problem with this  characterization is that it ignores the fact that Judge Kavanaugh was  not a disinterested party while hearing the arguments of opposing  counsel. He was the subject of the accusations, and it was he who was  being attacked and condemned. There is a big difference there.   I dare anyone to be calm and dispassionate if they had to sit by for  10 days and watch and listen to everything they have worked for and  have built over a long career of public service be torn down in an  instant without any proof--without any proof at all--to see your high  school yearbook picked apart by conspiracy theorists who seek nefarious  meanings behind juvenile jokes and 30-year-old slang, to see your  friends and family be threatened and harassed, and you can do nothing  to stop the angry mob.   This idea completely ignores the fact that Judge Kavanaugh has  proved, over the 12 years that he has been on the bench of the second  most powerful court in the country, that he does have the temperament  we look for in our judges. This fact is supported by an ABA ranking of  unanimously ``well qualified''--which is considered to be the gold  standard for Democrats--and the countless testimonies by people across  the political spectrum who have worked with him, who have argued a case  in front of him, and who know him well.   In the last few days, the discourse has further devolved into perjury  claims based on the judge's drinking habits in high school and college.  I will leave the legal arguments to those more knowledgeable than I in  that department who have thoroughly debunked that particular myth.  Suffice it to say, he testified that he liked beer. He drank beer, and  sometimes he drank too much. He did some things in high school and  college that maybe he now thinks he shouldn't have done, but that is  what he did. He wasn't hiding anything when it came to drinking in his  youth. He said that right up front in one of the earlier hearings.   There were six background investigations by the FBI over the course  of lengthy public service, decades in the public eye, and never has  anyone brought any allegations or concerns to the attention of the  investigators or the press in all of that time.   I was here when he was up for the appellate judgeship, and none of  this came up at that time. There is a difference here. I think the  other side is--let's face it. The Democrats said at the very beginning:  It doesn't matter who our President nominates to be on the Federal  bench, we are going to oppose him. So here we have them opposing him.   Well, with each new breathlessly reported account of a party, alleged  ice-throwing incident, or juvenile jokes about passing gas or cussing  from the early to the mid-1980s, it becomes clearer and clearer that  Democrats are not serious in their concern about the more serious  allegations as the focus of their attacks become more and more absurd  and desperate.   The fact that they have to focus on Judge Kavanaugh's school days  further reinforces the idea that Brett has led an exemplary life as a  husband, a father, and a public servant.   I would like to take just a moment to commend my good friend from  Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. My wife called this  morning, and she said: Be sure you single him out and sit him down and  tell him how proud I am of him. My wife and I have been married for 59  years, and when my wife is proud, I am proud.   Once he was made aware of the allegations that the Democrats kept  from him for weeks, he and his staff went right to work to investigate.  They postponed the committee--this is the chairman we are talking  about. They postponed the committee vote, gathered statements and other  evidence, and offered Dr. Ford the opportunity to provide her testimony  in any way that would be comfortable for her, eventually scheduling a  follow-up hearing. All along the way, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh were  treated by our chairman of the Judiciary Committee with the respect  they deserve and should have received, starting when the allegations  were first brought to our attention.   He and his staff have kept us informed in the Senate of the various  investigations at almost every step in the process. The chairman has  built a well-deserved reputation for protecting whistleblowers. This is  one of the things he has been outspoken about for a long time, and he  has protected them over the course of his career. He has proven himself  once again during this process.   I look forward to voting for Judge Kavanaugh. I would hope that we  could put an end to the search-and-destroy campaign that is being waged  by the Democrats and their enablers and this media, but I won't hold my  breath.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
