 Mr. Speaker, more than ever before, we need leaders from  across the Nation to raise our voices, elevate our awareness, and come  to Washington, as stated in the First Amendment, to petition the  government for a redress of our grievances.   Now, more than ever, we need the people most affected by the  decisions that are being made in this hallowed place, the people's  House, and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to make sure that this  representative government is indeed being held accountable for both its  actions and inactions.   On this special day, I am proud of my brothers in Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity, and I am honored to welcome them back to Washington for  their annual visit.   I stand with my brothers to ensure that we never forget how our  decisions on issues like health care, education, housing, jobs, voting  rights, and even the use of military force are more than just political  or policy judgments. They have life-and-death consequences for real  people in the communities that we represent and across this great  country as well.   I thank my Kappa brothers for their steadfast friendship, support,  and devotion to advancing freedom and equality for every American.                            ____________________
