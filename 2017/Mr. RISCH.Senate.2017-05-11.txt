 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  remarks of Senator Murphy, there be 20 minutes of postcloture time  remaining on the Lighthizer nomination, equally divided between the  chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee; that following  the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the  Lighthizer nomination; and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table, and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    I yield the floor.
