 Mr. Speaker, Governor Newsom made a groundbreaking  discovery regarding COVID-19 last week. Apparently, it has learned to  tell time. Thus, acting under the strictest of scientific standards, he  has ordered Californians to run home before 10 p.m., lock their doors,  and hide from this insidious virus until daybreak.   Unfortunately, COVID doesn't seem to be following the curfew, so  Newsom is now threatening yet another hard lockdown of virtually the  entire State throughout the Christmas season. Don we now our plague  apparel.   There is just one nagging question the Governor hasn't bothered to  answer. If these lockdowns are so successful, why do we need to keep  having them?   Now, we are told not to worry. We are cheerfully assured that the  jobs that are being destroyed are nonessential. That is their term,  nonessential.   Well, I have news for these self-absorbed elitists. If a job is  putting food on your table and a roof over your head that job is  essential for you and the family that depends upon you.   Last spring, I asked Anthony Fauci if he had taken into account the  human cost of these lockdowns, the suicides, the drug and alcohol  abuse, the domestic violence, the deferred health screenings and  treatments, and the poverty related deaths that his policies were  setting into motion. No, we really haven't considered that, he breezily  replied.   Don't know, don't care.   But before Fauci and his followers took a wrecking ball to our  Nation, poverty had dropped to its lowest rate since 1959. Unemployment  was the lowest in 50 years. The income gap was narrowing. Wages showed  their strongest growth in 40 years.   How many millions of these jobs have now been wantonly destroyed by  autocratic officials who seem oblivious to the damage that they are  causing?   Now, according to the CDC's best estimate, those under 50 have a  99.98 percent chance of recovering from COVID, if they get it at all;  99.98 percent. And 40 percent who get it don't even know they have it.   Even for the most vulnerable group, over 70, the survival rate is  94.6 percent.   Now, Sweden did not force its businesses to close. Sweden didn't shut  down its schools and abandon its children to the streets. Sweden didn't  even adopt a mask mandate.   Sweden did what free societies do; they gave the best advice they  could, and they trusted their citizens to use their own good judgment  of what measures made sense to them.   The result? Well, as of this morning, Sweden's mortality rate from  COVID is 154 deaths per million below that of the United States. If we  had Sweden's rate, that would mean over 50,000 fewer American deaths  from COVID.   Meanwhile, Sweden has sustained a fraction of the economic damage  that our lockdown leftists have inflicted on innocent Americans.  Globally, the United Nations warns that 130 million people will starve  to death around the world because of the economic damage caused by  these measures.   Mr. Speaker, this has to stop. The good news is that more and more  Americans are questioning the lunacy of these policies and the  hypocrisy of those who impose them. Newsom's curfew order was met with  spontaneous defiant demonstrations across the State. Elected sheriffs  are increasingly refusing to enforce these autocratic orders. Pastors  are reopening their churches. Businesses are reopening, even as their  owners are taken away in handcuffs.   All mass hysterias are driven by blind fear, fanned by politicians  and  [[Page H6052]]  charlatans who see opportunity in them. And we have, sadly, learned  that such fear can cause a free people to abandon their legacy of  freedom and independence, their prosperity, and their common sense, but  only for a while.   Every time in history that this has happened, there is always a  moment when the fear fever breaks, and the hysteria suddenly burns  itself out. The French Revolution, the Salem witch trials, the  Communist hysteria of the 1950s all had a moment when the absurdity of  it all became so apparent that it overcame the fear and the people  turned on their tormentors.   Now, I don't know if the recent wave of business and religious  persecutions, the unlimited home detention orders, and the demonstrated  hypocrisy of those who have ordered them signals that moment. But every  shopkeeper who defies these petty tyrants, every parent who confronts  their school officials, every person who refuses to submit to the  dysfunctional dystopian world created by the lockdown left brings us  one step closer to that turning point. It can't come soon enough.                            ____________________
