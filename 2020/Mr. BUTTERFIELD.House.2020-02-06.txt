 Mr. Speaker, for the life of me--for the life of  me--I just cannot understand why 14 States have flatly refused to  expand their Medicaid program to provide healthcare to their low- income, healthy, childless adults, a demographic that was omitted from  Medicaid in 1965 when it was enacted into law.   North Carolina, my home State, would greatly benefit from Medicaid  expansion. Other congressional districts would benefit.   And to my Republican friends: The fact is that your low-income  constituents would greatly benefit. Talk to your doctors. Talk to your  hospitals. Talk to your providers. The coverage low-income individuals  would receive will not only benefit them, but the entire economy of  your State.   Let's cooperate on this one. Let the States know that Medicaid  expansion will benefit them, and it will not break their budget. We,  the Federal Government, will pay 90 percent of the costs in perpetuity.   For the President to direct the block granting of Medicaid to the  State will be absolutely beyond his executive authority.   I repeat: To direct block granting to the State will absolutely be  beyond his executive authority.   To cap and slash these benefits is unlawful, and it is cruel. It will  require authorization from this Congress.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this resolution, H. Res. 826.
