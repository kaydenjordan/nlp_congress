 Mr. Speaker, after a divisive election season, allegations  of election fraud, objections to the electoral college, and  impeachment, a friend of mine on the other side of the aisle recently  asked what it would take to unify our country. My answer is that it is  certainly not this legislation which, from my standpoint, is the most  divisive, unconstitutional, and destructive piece of legislation in my  time in Congress.   They call it the For the People Act, but it should be called the for  the politicians act because it would force taxpayers to fund political  campaigns, including the campaigns of politicians with whom those  taxpayers disagree.   Maybe a better name would be the election power grab act because it  would normalize the chaos, uncertainty, and irregularities surrounding  mail-in voting in the 2020 election by centralizing the administration  of elections in Washington, D.C., commandeering States to permanently  expand mail-in voting without safeguards, legalize ballot harvesting,  disregard voter ID laws, permit same-day voter registration without  citizenship verification, among other egregious measures.   Mr. Speaker, election laws should make it easy to vote and hard to  cheat. This bill would not only make it easy to cheat, but it would  also effectively make it legal to cheat.   At a time when half of Americans have lost confidence in the  integrity of our elections, this bill will only drive distrust and  division higher.   Mr. Speaker, for the sake of ending division in our country, I urge  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this power grab of our elections.
