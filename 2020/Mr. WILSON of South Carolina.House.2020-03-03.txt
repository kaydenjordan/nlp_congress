 Mr. Speaker, this year, Midway  Elementary School in Lexington, South Carolina, commemorated its 25th  anniversary and celebrated international recognition of its French  immersion program.   Midway Elementary is the only recipient in South Carolina, one of  just five in the Southeast.   I appreciate Midway Elementary Principal Jan Fickling, Lexington  County District One Superintendent Dr. Greg Little, Lexington One  School Board Chair Cindy Smith, State Superintendent Molly Spearman,  and all the dedicated teachers and administrators who work tirelessly  to ensure student success and opportunity.   As co-chair of the French Caucus, I am grateful for our State's  French heritage, our first ally.   Lexington County hosts the largest manufacturing facilities in the  world for Michelin Tire Corporation, with over 2,000 appreciated  employees.   We look forward to welcoming Ambassador of France Philippe Etienne to  visit South Carolina next month.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.   ``Je parle Francais, un tres peu.'' ``I speak French very little.''                            ____________________
