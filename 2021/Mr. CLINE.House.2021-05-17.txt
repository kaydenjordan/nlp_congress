 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Roanoke native and World War II Navy veteran Suttie Economy,  who passed away earlier this month at the age of 95.   While Economy was proud of his service and the time he spent on the  USS English in the South Pacific, he never forgot his fellow veterans  who didn't make it home. Economy made it his life's mission to honor  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who gave their lives for the  cause of American freedom.   Known for his efforts to maintain the Roanoke War Memorial, driving  around town in his red, white, and blue Yugo, and handing out Juicy  Fruit gum, Economy made an impression whenever he went.   In 2008, he said one of his proudest moments was having marble flower  vases added to the Star City's war memorial after years of lobbying,  urging folks to: ``Never forget those veterans.''   His daughter said his work was never about him, but rather, it was  always about the veterans who served and gave their lives.   With traffic stopped, a police officer standing at attention, and  members of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association serving as  pallbearers, Economy was laid to rest with the respect he deserved.   Fair winds and following seas, Suttie.                            ____________________
