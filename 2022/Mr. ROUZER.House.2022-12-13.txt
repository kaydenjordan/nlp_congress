 Madam Speaker, I rise today and join my colleagues in  support of H. Res. 1156, expressing the commitment of the House of  Representatives to building on 20 years of success of the George  McGovern-Robert Dole Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.   During the past two decades, McGovern-Dole has provided more than 5.5  billion school meals, benefiting more than 31 million school-age  children and their communities.   I have seen this program in action, up close and firsthand, and it is  a special sight to see.   Having traveled with then-chairman of the Committee on Agriculture  Mike Conaway several years ago to some Third World countries where food  is scarce and extreme poverty, like most have never seen, is the norm,  it is easy to understand how imperative this program is for so many  children who would likely never have a nutritious meal.   Just as important and because of how the program was crafted, the  McGovern-Dole Program provides an opportunity to learn, laying the  foundation for an improved life through knowledge and then achievement.  For many of these children who come from very poor means, this meal  provided at school is, quite frankly, the only good meal of the day.   It is also important to recognize the support of the American  agricultural producers who make this program possible. America's farm  families have produced more than 1.3 million metric tons of  agricultural commodities for donation, doing their part in reducing  hunger and improving primary education in countries around the globe.                                time  1445    Congress must continue to lead by example in tackling hunger and  poverty around the world for years to come. These efforts not only help  feed those who cannot help themselves, but it builds good will and  provides so many hope and a future. Many laws have been passed by this  Chamber, but none have been more impactful to the lives of so many  children who desperately need the help around the world.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution expressing  Congress' commitment to carrying on the success of this program along  with the great legacies of Ambassador McGovern and my great friend,  Senator Bob Dole. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.
