 Mr. Speaker, recognized each April, Child Abuse  Prevention Month has brought awareness to the needs for families and  communities to work in tandem to prevent child abuse and neglect, while  promoting the social and emotional wellbeing of both children and  families.   Texas' Third Congressional District is incredibly fortunate to have  court appointed special advocates, or CASAs, of Collin County serve our  communities. These volunteers work tirelessly on behalf of abused and  neglected children in our community, and we are incredibly grateful for  their work.   Mr. Speaker, today and every day, let us come together as a community  to make a positive difference in the lives of these children to ensure  their futures are safer, brighter, and healthier.                            ____________________
