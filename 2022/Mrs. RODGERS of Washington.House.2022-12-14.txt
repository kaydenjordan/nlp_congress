 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Charlie Bourg.   Charlie lives in Chewelah, a small town in northeastern Washington.  He is an Army veteran. He served in Vietnam, and he is a fierce  advocate for his fellow men and women who have served in the Armed  Forces.   Charlie also has terminal cancer. He received the devastating news  months ago after a yearlong delay in receiving care from the Spokane VA  due to a broken electronic health record system.   This could have been prevented. He should have more time to spend  with his wife, Debi, his children, and his grandchildren. My heart  breaks for them.   Charlie is here sharing his story this week, and I would like to make  him a promise: No matter how long it takes, we will fix this system.   You will be the reason that it never happens again. You will not be  forgotten. Matthew 28:11 says, ``Come to me, all you who are weary and  carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in recognizing Charlie  Bourg. He is an incredible American and an even better husband, father,  and grandfather.                            ____________________
