 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Dreiband nomination expire at 2 p.m. today and  that the Senate vote on confirmation of the Dreiband nomination with no  intervening action or debate; further, that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, there are no more consequential words  spoken than those spoken by the President of the United States.   The words of a President reverberate around the world like no other  world leader's, and as attentive as Americans are to what our President  says, the rest of the world is probably paying even closer attention,  as it is often their fate that hangs in the balance when our President  speaks.   Americans can ignore certain utterances from the President. The rest  of the world often has no such luxury.   Another audience for Presidential utterances is the despot, the  strongman, the authoritarian, and the dictator. From this President,  that horrible focus group has received a great deal of sustenance.   In fact, the oppressors of the world have taken to parroting some of  their favorite lines from the White House. Anything critical of their  regimes has become ``fake news,'' and the press is the ``enemy of the  people,'' just to name two of our President's greatest hits.   As I mentioned in this Chamber in January of this year, a State  official in Myanmar recently said:         There is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news.    He was, of course, referring to the persecuted ethnic group.   In February of last year, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad brushed  off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been  murdered in his military prisons by saying:   [[Page S6791]]              You can forge anything these days. We are living in a fake       news era.    In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being  ``demonized'' by ``fake news.'' Last year, according to a news report,  with our President ``laughing by his side,'' Duterte called reporters  ``spies.''   In July 2017, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the  Russian propaganda outlet that the world media had ``spread lots of  false versions, lots of lies'' about his country, adding: ``This is  what we call `fake news' today, isn't it?'' And on and on. This  feedback loop is appalling.   We are in an era where the authoritarian impulse is reasserting  itself to challenge free people and free societies everywhere. We  cannot give convenient language to authoritarians, language that is  used against their own people.   Now, with the apparent brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,  some of the real enemies of the people and enemies of freedom seem to  have taken license to eliminate a man their regime viewed as a threat.   We need to know exactly what happened in that Saudi consulate in  Turkey earlier this month. Put bluntly, we cannot do business with the  Saudi Government if they directed or were complicit in the murder of  Jamal Khashoggi. We in this body had best be very careful about who the  enemies of the people are and who they are not.   The free press is the guardian of democracy and the enemy of tyrants,  and the man or woman who speaks from behind the Presidential Seal needs  to remind the country and the world of this truism again and again, as  long as the world will listen.   I yield the floor.
