 Mr. President, I come forward today to recognize  the Massacre Rim Wilderness Study Area's designation as an  International Dark Sky Sanctuary. Located 150 miles north of Reno in  Washoe County, NV, Massacre Rim Wilderness Study Area is a region with  rolling hills, buttes, plateaus, and narrow canyons, covered in  sagebrush and junipers. Massacre Rim is a natural, undisturbed, and  isolated environment that offers visitors rare opportunities to enjoy  scenic vistas of up to 60 miles, as well as solitude away from  development and distraction. Thanks to the location's remoteness,  Massacre Rim's night views are completely uninhibited by light  pollution. These unique qualities allow for nearly unparalleled  stargazing, which has attracted visitors from around the world.   On March 30, 2019, the International Dark-Sky Association designated  the Massacre Rim Wilderness Study Area as an International Dark Sky  Sanctuary, only the fourth location to achieve this distinction in the  United States and the seventh in the entire world. The International  Dark-Sky Association deemed Massacre Rim worthy of this honor due to  its qualifications as ``land that has an exceptional or distinguished  quality of starry nights and a nocturnal environment that is protected  for its scientific, natural, or educational value, its cultural  heritage and/or public enjoyment.''   For most of human history, a night sky teeming with stars and  shooting comets was a regular occurrence for our ancestors. Prior to  the Industrial Revolution, one could look to the sky and find awe- inspiring wonder, intrigue, and entertainment. For most of us, that is  no longer the case. According to a 2016 National Geographic article, 80  percent of Americans cannot see the Milky Way due to light pollution.  While light pollution is a necessary and small consequence to our  growth and development as a society, it is imperative that we recognize  the significant value in our increasingly rare dark sky places, such as  Massacre Rim. Fortunately, for visitors and residents of the great  State of Nevada, views of both the Milky Way and our neighboring  galaxy, Andromeda, are available at Massacre Rim.   Our State's booming outdoor recreation economy is a testament to the  success of our public lands and highlights the importance of keeping  our invaluable natural resources available for all to utilize and  enjoy. I commend the nonprofit organization, Friends of Nevada  Wilderness, for spearheading the Massacre Rim Wilderness Study Area's  Dark Sky Sanctuary designation, and for continuing to educate others  about the natural wonders available in the Silver State.   From Massacre Rim, to the Lake Tahoe Basin, to the Ruby Mountains,  residents and visitors can attest that  [[Page S2267]]  our public lands allow us to connect with our collective past and  preserve our shared treasures for future generations.                            ____________________
