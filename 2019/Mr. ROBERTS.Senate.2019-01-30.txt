 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important  piece of legislation I just filed, aptly named after the young Kansan  whose life and bright future was cut short by a senseless act of  violence and whose case now is the inspiration for why we desperately  need to update the law.   Almost 12 years ago, on June 2, 2017, 18-year-old Kelsey Smith was  abducted in broad daylight from an Overland Park, KS, parking lot.  Kelsey's abduction was captured on the store's closed-circuit security  camera, which left little doubt about the emergency sense of the  situation. This was an emergency.   Here is the tragedy. Four days after Kelsey disappeared, authorities  were able to locate her body after a wireless provider finally released  the call information from her cell phone--4 critical days. Providing  location information as fast as possible is absolutely critical to  ensure that law enforcement officials can rescue victims in imminent  danger of death or serious physical harm and hopefully prevent future  fates similar to Kelsey's.   This legislation is the culmination of years of work among  legislators at both the Federal and State levels, including industry  stakeholders, privacy advocates, and, most importantly, Kelsey's brave  parents, who spearheaded this initiative and have advocated to create  commonsense reforms that properly balance the needs of law enforcement  with Fourth Amendment protections for all of our citizens.   Through their advocacy and tireless efforts, Missey and Greg Smith  have helped enact laws, oftentimes with unanimous support, in 23  States, including my home State of Kansas. This law provides law  enforcement with the necessary tools to rescue individuals in emergency  situations where the threat of death or serious bodily injury is  imminent.   The impact of this law at the State level has been real and  measurable. For example, in May 2012, one month after the enactment of  its State's version of the Kelsey Smith Act, local authorities in  Tennessee were successful in saving the life of a child who had been  abducted by a suspected child rapist. Because the child was believed to  be in imminent danger, the police were able to successfully receive the  location of the suspect's cell phone in a window of time that led to  the safe recovery of the child alive and before she was assaulted.   In February of 2015, Kelsey's Law helped save the life of a 5-month- old Lenexa, KS, girl when a car with a baby in the back seat was stolen  from its mother. Through Kelsey's Law, police were able to ping that  mother's phone, which was left in the car, and, within an hour, the  baby was reunited with her parents.   According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,  the first 3 hours are critical to recovering a child alive. That is why  it is necessary that in these narrowly defined, isolated instances in  which a person's very life is at stake, an exemption should be made to  allow wireless carriers to immediately ping an individual's phone and  release to law enforcement the whereabouts of that individual.   Understanding this, my legislation would provide law enforcement with  the ability to recover the location of children, other missing  individuals, and only in very specific emergency situations; namely,  where there is risk of death or serious bodily injury.   Don't just take it from Pat Roberts. Public safety professionals with  experience in the field support this lifesaving legislation. According  to the retired Johnson County sheriff, Frank Denning:         Time is of the essence in these types of incidents and the       narrow exception for law enforcement to act with immediacy is       key here. For this not to be a Federal law seems unjust to       those who have loved ones in harm's way and this type of       intervention can and will save lives.    Major Scott Boden with the Johnson County Sheriff's Office in Kansas  says:         Over my 22-year law enforcement career with the Johnson       County Sheriff's Office, 17 years have been spent in our       dispatch/911 center. During that time, the Kelsey Smith Law       has been the single most important piece of legislation       related to potentially saving the lives of suicidal subjects,       assisting endangered children, and addressing live threats       when cell phone location is necessary and seconds count. The       difference this law has made cannot be overstated and I look       forward to the day it becomes available all across this       country as a resource to assist first responders in their       most critical service saving lives.    Jennifer Lanter, the 9-1-1 director for Loudon County, TN, says:         In Tennessee, we have had the privilege of having Kelsey's       Law enacted for several years. There are multiple examples of       how utilizing this law has resulted in lives being saved that       otherwise would have been lost.        This law enables the men and women that have dedicated       their lives to the protection of others to ensure they are       able to do everything possible to locate someone that needs       help. The benefits of this law being passed at the Federal       level will be far-reaching, and countless lives will be       saved.    It is not just these individual law enforcement officials who support  this bill. The bill is also supported by the National District  Attorneys Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Association, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the International  Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America,  the National Association of Police Organizations, the Fraternal Order  of Police,  [[Page S771]]  and the National Sheriffs' Association. I don't know of any law  enforcement organization that has been left out, and if it has been  left out, it would certainly support the bill. CTIA, the wireless  association, also supports this commonsense legislation.   Just this morning, I received a letter of support from John Walsh,  who is the cofounder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children and was the well-known host of the television show,  ``America's Most Wanted.'' Mr. Walsh has dedicated his life to  advocating for victims' rights. It began with his fight for the passage  of the Missing Children's Assistance Act following the abduction and  subsequent murder of his son Adam.   Fortunately, for my colleagues, voting for this bill will not take a  blind leap of faith. Kelsey's Law is already saving lives in States  like Kansas, New Jersey, Nebraska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North  Dakota, Tennessee, Hawaii, Missouri, Utah, West Virginia, Colorado,  Nevada, Rhode Island, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Iowa, Washington,  Louisiana, Delaware, Indiana, and Alabama. Yes, I wanted to repeat all  23.   Oftentimes, the approval by State legislatures has been unanimous,  and that is because Kelsey's Law strikes the appropriate balance  between ensuring that law enforcement has the tools it needs to help  individuals who are in grave danger and ensuring that the proper checks  are in place to guard against government overreach.   My legislation requires all law enforcement agencies to maintain a  record of all requests made under the Kelsey Smith Act. This record  will include the name of the officer who is requesting location  information from a wireless carrier, a description of the request that  explains the need for the disclosure of location information, and a  declaration that an individual's location information is needed in  order to offer him life assistance during an emergency situation that,  again, involves a risk of death or serious physical harm.   I stress that nothing--absolutely nothing--in the Kelsey Smith Act  prohibits wireless carriers from continuing to operate the robust law  enforcement verification systems that they use today in order to make  absolutely certain that when a request is made, it is coming from an  authorized law enforcement official.   Kelsey was never given the opportunity to attend college or to get  married or to have children and experience the American dream that many  of us take for granted every day. Yet what she did do was to inspire  her mother and her father to make it their mission in life to help  educate and empower communities and children in order to help prevent  another case like this from ever happening again.   Kelsey's father, Greg, who is a former law enforcement officer  himself and a Kansas State senator, said it best when he quoted  President Abraham Lincoln to describe what Kelsey had accomplished:         In the end, it is not the years in your life that count. It       is the life in your years.    I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak on the floor today  and to offer what, I think, is a commonsense bill that will help  prevent tragedies like Kelsey's. I also thank Senator Moran, Senator  Fischer, and Senator Blunt for their strong support and cosponsoring of  this bill. I welcome the President's support as well.   I ask every colleague in this body to consider one question: If it  were your children, your grandchildren, your spouses, would you not  want law enforcement to have immediate access to information that could  potentially save their lives and bring them home?   Let's honor Kelsey's memory by passing this legislation in Congress.  I see no reason why it could not pass by unanimous consent.   I thank the Presiding Officer.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE:   S. 281. A bill to provide for a period of continuing appropriations  in the event of a lapse in appropriations under the normal  appropriations process, and to prohibit consideration of other matters  in the Senate if appropriations are not enacted; to the Committee on  Appropriations.
