 Mr. Speaker, last night, we had our annual  Congressional Baseball Game and some healthy competition with our  colleagues. But today is the big showdown, when the Bensalem High  School baseball team will play for the State championship versus Canon- McMillan at Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park.   Led by Coach Harry Daut, Bensalem beat La Salle in a come-from-behind  victory in the semifinals, initially down three runs with only two at  bats remaining. This come-from-behind victory was propelled by Nick  Fossile's sacrifice fly to left field, sending home Dave Barnett from  third base. That left it up to pitcher Nick Dean, who closed out the  game and finished what starter Stephen Aldrich began.   I wish these players, the entire team, the entire coaching staff, and  the entire Bensalem community the best of luck today, and I know they  will make all of us proud. Go Bensalem.                            ____________________
