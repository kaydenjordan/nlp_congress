 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize a Grammy Award-winning  country music artist and a proud native of Mount Airy, North Carolina,  Donna Fargo.   On July Fourth, the town of Mount Airy unveiled a mural honoring  Donna and the countless contributions she has made to the country music  community.   I was incredibly fortunate to attend this event and to hear Donna  speak about her unwavering faith in God, her small-town roots, and why  she believes that Mount Airy is the best place in all the world to  live. It is no wonder why  [[Page H3182]]  hundreds of Mount Airy citizens lined the streets that day to celebrate  Donna, view her mural, and listen to her speak. Her story and her music  continue to touch the lives of many.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Donna on this well-deserved  recognition. Not only is she Mount Airy's favorite daughter, but she is  also a shining example of the best that western North Carolina has to  offer.                         Charter School Success Study     Madam Speaker, it is undeniable that charter schools  provide students with excellent opportunities in education, which give  them capabilities they can use to pursue the American Dream.   When students are allowed to learn in an environment that works best  for them and one that accounts for their individual proficiencies, they  flourish. This is a simple fact.   A recent study conducted by Stanford University's Center for Research  on Education Outcomes analyzed the educational performances of 1.8  million charter school students. The study found that these students  outperformed their traditional public school counterparts on multiple  metrics.   The typical charter school student gained the equivalent growth of 16  additional days of learning in reading and 6 additional days in math  compared to their peers in traditional public schools.   At a time when the reading and math scores of our Nation's students  have plummeted, the results of this study serve as a beacon of hope for  millions of American families.   Simply put, charter schools serve as conduits of opportunity.   For example, the study revealed that, on average, Black students who  were enrolled in charter schools gained the equivalent growth of 35  days in reading and 29 days in math compared to their public school  counterparts. Hispanic students in charter schools were recorded as  having a sizable leg up, as well. When it came to reading, they were 30  days ahead. In math, they were 19 days ahead.   These results make a succinct and compelling argument as to why  charter schools are viable alternatives to traditional public schools.   Unfortunately, the success of charter schools is being outright  ignored by the Biden administration. This is predictable behavior,  mainly because the educational bureaucracy and teachers unions have  President Biden wrapped around their little fingers.   The defenders of the status quo, those who fight tooth and nail to  prop up failing public schools, can rest assured that the Education and  the Workforce Committee will not be joining them in their future  efforts. Instead, the committee will continue to promote choice so  parents and students are empowered to choose the best learning  environment that meets their needs.   The status quo is withering and dying on the vine. This is sad, but  there is an alternative, and that is something to celebrate.                            ____________________
