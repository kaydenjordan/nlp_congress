 Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 86, the confirmation  of the nomination of Seema Verma to be Administrator of the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, I was not recorded because I was absent  due to a flight delay. Had I been present, I would have voted nay.                            ____________________
