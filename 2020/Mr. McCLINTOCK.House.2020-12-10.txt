 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have before us today a bill that will very  effectively put most swordfish boats on the West Coast out of business.  I believe it is yet another battle on a multifront war by the far-left  Democrats against America's working class.   The swordfish boats on the West Coast harvest a Pacific fishery that  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has classified as  ``underutilized.'' There is no shortage of swordfish thanks to the  responsible management of this fishery under the Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery Conservation and Management Act.   The principal means of harvesting swordfish is the drift gillnet,  which has been a target of environmental extremists for years. Despite  their lurid tales of indiscriminate catches of other species,  particularly endangered species, this is, in fact, a very rare  occurrence.   With respect to endangered species, the National Marine Fisheries  Service reported: ``It is NMFS' biological opinion that the proposed  action of continued management of the drift gillnet fishery is not  likely to jeopardize the continued existence of these seven endangered  species and is not likely to destroy or adversely modify any ESA-listed  designated critical habitat.''   So here we have an industry that some of the hardest working men and  women in America depend upon to feed their families--and, by the way,  feed ours, as well--in an underutilized fishery by means of drift  gillnets that have an extremely low incidence of inadvertent bycatch.   So what does Congress propose to do for these families? Commend them  for their hard work? Thank them for the contribution they make to  America's food supply and to the American economy? Well, no, not  exactly. Instead, Congress proposes to shut them down.   Those aren't my words. When Gary Burke, one of the swordfishermen  threatened by this bill came before our subcommittee, he said: ``I want  to be very clear regarding the impacts of this legislation on the  driftnet gill fleet. It will shut us down.''   And for what possible reason?   The fishery is sound; the industry is responsible; incidental takes  are extremely rare. Why would anyone want to decimate these families  and American consumers as well? Just for the hell of it seems to be the  only logical explanation.   The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act has been  lauded by conservationists for many decades. It has stood the test of  time and proven itself to be a program that works.   The Regional Fishery Management Council process works because it is  collaborative, and it involves the parties with a direct stake in  keeping the fishery healthy.   This legislation is a ham-handed, iron-fisted, top-down diktat that  goes against everything that Magnuson-Stevens stands for.   Now, we just heard: Don't worry. There is an alternative that will  work just fine. It is the deep-set buoy gear.   And, yes, it is sometimes used to supplement the drift gillnets, but  it is not economically viable by itself.   As the actual swordfishermen explained, the costs of running a  fishing vessel--fuel, debt service, and labor--often means a very tight  profit margin. To make a trip viable, the boat must achieve enough of a  catch to at least offset its costs.   The alternative this bill would force on them simply doesn't catch  nearly as many fish and certainly not enough to make the trip  profitable. Reduce the catch below the break-even mark--as this bill  surely does--and there is no catch because the boat can't go out.   How do we know that? Because the very fishermen who use the deep-set  buoy gear have told us so. They state in a letter to the committee:  ``Our concern is based on the fact that while there is potential for  alternative gear to be used in this industry, currently there is no  existing gear that can be substituted for the drift gillnet and still  allow fishermen to earn a living.''   Those are the people who use that equipment.   So let me repeat that: Our fishermen will not be able to earn a  living using this experimental gear. The majority knows this; it is  just they don't care.   This legislation does nothing to improve fisheries management but,  instead, does great harm in two respects: It takes away the earnings of  American fishermen, and it raises the price of seafood for American  families.   Again, don't take my word for it, or even the fishermen whose  livelihoods are being cast aside. The Natural Resources Committee  received testimony from NOAA which stressed to our members that this  bill ``does not reflect the progress made to date in minimizing bycatch  in the U.S. West Coast drift gillnet fishery. Based on the best  available science and 26 years of observer data, bycatch of threatened  or endangered protected species is a rare event.''   Now let's talk about the unintended consequences of putting the  American West Coast swordfish industry out of business.   It doesn't protect the fishery because the fishery isn't endangered.  It doesn't protect other species because incidental taking of those  species is rare.   The ultimate irony is that this bill doesn't even stop the use of  drift gillnets except, of course, for Americans. This bill will  effectively remove West Coast swordfish from the market, but it doesn't  remove the market demand.   So what happens? Consumer prices will go up and the market will meet  that demand by shifting to swordfish caught by foreign fleets where  they are not strictly regulated and where they will enjoy an enormous  competitive advantage by being unrestricted in their use of the very  same drift gillnets that Americans--and only Americans--are forbidden  from using.   Again, that is not my conclusion. That is the conclusion of NOAA  itself, which told our committee: ``NOAA is concerned that shifting to  alternative gears that are not economically viable could decrease U.S.  swordfish harvest and reduce the U.S. West Coast large mesh drift  gillnet fishery's competitiveness against foreign fisheries with less  restrictive environmental regulations during the phaseout.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this cruel and ill-conceived  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  the California fishermen who participated in the experimental  technology demonstration project expressing their concerns with the  bill.                                                       May 6, 2019.      Re: H.R. 1979--Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction           Act       Hon. Ted Lieu,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Lieu: We are participants in the       experimental Deep-Set Buoy Gear (``DSBG'') fishery off the       California Coast. A majority of us participate in, or have       participated in, the drift gillnet fishery. We are writing to       express our concerns regarding H.R. 1979, the Driftnet       Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. H.R. 1979 includes       language which will phase-out the use of drift gillnets       (``DGN'') to harvest swordfish and require the ``. . .       adoption of alternative fishing practices that minimize the       incidental catch of living marine resources''. Our concern is       based on the fact that while there is potential for       alternative gear to be used in this fishery, currently there       is no existing gear that can be substituted for the DGN gear       and still allow fishermen to earn a living.        The Pacific Fishery Management Council (``PFMC'') is       currently working towards authorizing Deep-Set Buoy Gear       (``DSBG''), a swordfish gear type that was developed to       provide west coast fishers with an additional gear option for       use during periods of reduced landings. DSBG has been allowed       to operate under an Exempted Fishing Permit (``EFP'') since       2015. As noted in the initial EFP application DSBG was       designed to ``. . . provide fishers with a complementary gear       type that can be used in conjunction with harpooning . . . .       and also compliment ongoing DGN activities.''        Participants in the initial EFP had extensive experience       targeting swordfish with DGN and harpoon gears and       participated in the research trials so that they could expand       domestic fishery options for the West Coast. This continues       to be a priority for managers and the fishing community, as       current restrictions limit summertime harvest off California       waters, forcing markets to import swordfish even when the       resource is available in local waters. The coupling of DSBG,       harpoon and DGN techniques provides the tools needed to       capitalize on this federal resource throughout the entire       fishery season. This is critical given that different gear       types have different seasons in which they work optimally.        Because DSBG landings peak in the months prior to that of       the DGN fishery, our community has largely supported the       advent and trial of new techniques, as they have the       potential to augment and revitalize our declining fishery.       Now that H.R. 1979 proposes to phase out DGN and replace it       with DSBG, we are concerned that this will further impact the       viability of west coast swordfish operations all together. We       are certain that the DGN market share will be filled with       additional unregulated foreign-caught swordfish. As shown in       2018, increases in unregulated imports drives market price       down, reduces domestic profitability and deters participation       our US fisheries. Collectively, we feel that H.R. 1979 will       negatively impact local livelihoods, increase our reliance       upon foreign fleets and decrease the productivity and of our       west coast fishery.        We are also concerned over the proposed transition of the       traditional DGN fleet to a future DSBG fishery. Some of the       DGN vessels are larger than those currently used in the DSBG       fishery and many of them only fish for swordfish during the       fall window in which DGN works optimally. We are troubled       that the proposed transition will create an inequity among       the fleet and negatively impact fishing operations and       profitability. We feel that H.R. 1979 is premature and should       be contemplated only after it is demonstrated that DSBG can       be profitable for the entire DGN community. Until then, we       hope to continue to provide domestic west coast swordfish       caught using highly regulated techniques that continue to       operate in full federal and state compliance.            Sincerely,          Chugey Sepulveda, PhD, EFP Lead, Pfleger Institute of             Environmental Research, Oceanside, CA; Donald Krebbs,             F/V Goldcoast, San Diego, CA; Ben Stephens, F/V Tres             Mujeres, Vista, CA; Freddie Hepp, F/V Plumeria, Santa             Barbara, CA; William Sutton, F/V Aurelia, Ojai, CA;             Nathan Perez, F/V Bear Flag II, Newport Beach, CA; Jack             Stephens, F/V DEA, Vista, CA; Kelly Fukushima, F/V             Three Boys, San Diego, CA.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I implore the majority to consider the damage that it  will do with this bill. The West Coast swordfish fishery is healthy  and, indeed, underutilized. The drift gillnet results in very little  incidental take of other species. To put a number on it, in 17 years,  only 10 whales interacted with these nets, and 4 of them were released  alive. Six of them were killed.   Now, to put that in perspective--6 in 17 years--roughly 80 whales are  killed by ships off the California coast every year. Six were killed by  driftnets in 17 years; 80 are killed by ship collisions every year.   Does my friend see the difference?   Banning the nets will reduce the catch below the level that is  economically viable. It will shut down the industry. The result will be  devastating to the families that run these businesses. It will be  harmful to the consumer who will pay higher prices for this product,  and it will encourage increased use of driftnets in foreign waters to  fill the shortage caused by banning them in our own.   Why in God's name would anyone want to do that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
