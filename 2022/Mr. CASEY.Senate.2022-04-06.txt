 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of  Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme  Court of the United States.   When confirmed later this week, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be  the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court in its 233-year  history.   Yesterday morning, I had the privilege of meeting with her, and we  discussed her judicial methodology as well as her story and her path in  the law. Rising up to overcome so many barriers, Judge Jackson's story  and her family's story is truly an American story. It is a story of  hard work and sacrifice. It is a story of commitment to excellence.   Judge Jackson's academic credentials are impressive: graduating from  Harvard College and Harvard Law School with honors from both college  and law school.   Her unparalleled professional credentials and the breadth of her  legal experience equal or exceed that of any nominee in recent history.  She has worked in private practice. She has worked as an assistant  public defender--Federal public defender--and as a law clerk at every  level of the Federal judicial branch, including a law clerk to Justice  Breyer, who is going to be retiring from the Court. Perhaps most  important, she has worked as a Federal judge for nearly 10 years,  presiding over trials and later hearing appeals.   During our meeting yesterday, Judge Jackson spoke about her career  transition from attorney to Federal judge and specifically highlighted  how her career as a trial attorney helped her grow into becoming a  Federal judge.   Often lost in our discussions regarding Federal judges are the  people, the people who are impacted directly by our legal system in our  judges' decisions. At its core, our court system, more so than any  other institution, is dedicated to the idea that everyone--everyone,  not just the wealthy or powerful--should have a fair shot at justice  and that no one--no one--is above the law.   The Beatitudes in the New Testament speak to this idea of justice. We  have all heard it over and over again:         Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for       they shall be satisfied.    The power--the power--of our judicial system and our judiciary stems  from the integrity and the independence of our judges. It stems from  their unrelenting commitment to the rule of law and to equal justice  for all Americans.   Throughout her career but particularly as a public defender--a  Federal public defender--Judge Jackson has fought for a more equitable  and a more just America, representing individuals accused of committing  crimes and those who cannot afford a lawyer. All of those cases are  difficult cases for any lawyer. The lawyer must be committed to  upholding a core American value that our legal system must protect all  Americans, including defendants, to ensure ``Equal Justice Under Law,''  as is inscribed on the front of the Supreme Court itself.   Judge Jackson has lived this commitment to justice, to equal justice.  She understands the awesome power that will be bestowed upon her as a  Supreme Court Justice. She has seen firsthand the impact that a judge's  decision can have on plaintiffs and defendants alike. It is why Judge  Jackson has discussed how, when she was a district judge, she would  often take extra care to communicate with defendants in her courtroom  to ensure that they understood the complexities of the legal  proceedings happening before them. For when a defendant is before the  bar of justice, their liberty is at stake, and Judge Jackson wanted to  make sure that they understood what was happening before them and what  could happen to them.   Her commitment to equal justice is also evident by her impartial  rulings and the widespread support she has received from across the  political spectrum.   As a district court judge and as a circuit court judge, Judge Jackson  has ruled for and against the government, in favor of prosecutors and  for criminal defendants, for labor and for business, for civil  plaintiffs and defendants.   Her nomination received the support from several Republican Senators,  Republican-appointed judges, and former Republican-appointed officials.   She received broad support from law enforcement organizations,  including the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association  of Chiefs of Police, and other top law enforcement officials, including  former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, as well as  crime survivors, and other advocates.   Her nomination has received further support from civil rights  organizations as well as business organizations.   Of course, Judge Jackson's nomination is about more than simply the  great support that she has received and her impeccable credentials.  Both are important, but that is not it.   Yesterday morning, after my meeting with Judge Jackson, she was kind  enough to meet with several members of my staff who have graduated from  law school or who are getting ready to apply to law school, some of  whom have been accepted. She offered some salient advice about law  school. I won't disclose what it was here, but it was good advice. And  she encouraged them to keep going, to persevere.   Now, Judge Jackson is already today, and has been for weeks and  months now, an inspiration to tens of millions of Americans. Her  graciousness, her humility, and her legal acumen are simply unmatched.  Her confirmation to the Supreme Court will also inspire many future  generations, those yet to come and not simply future lawyers and  advocates. And certainly and particularly, her nomination and her  confirmation will be particularly inspiring to young Black women and  girls to persevere, as she said to our staff yesterday.   The day of her confirmation will be a good day for America. She lifts  our spirits at a very difficult time for our Nation. And while we have  a long way to go, Judge Jackson's nomination is an important step to  bringing us closer to having our institutions better reflect the great  diversity of our Nation as we strive to be a more perfect Union.   I will go back to the Beatitudes again. ``Blessed are they who hunger  and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied.'' Judge Jackson, I  have no doubt, will continue her work to strive for justice, to act  with justice, as one of the great hymns tells us. She will do all of  this as she discharges her duty as Justice Jackson.   I look forward to voting for her to serve as an Associate Justice on  the Supreme Court of the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
