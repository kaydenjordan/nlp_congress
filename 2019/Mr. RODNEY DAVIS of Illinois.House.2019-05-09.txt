 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Mrs. Susan Converse, who was recently named the 2019 Illinois Teacher  of the Year by the Illinois State Board of Education.   Mrs. Converse teaches functional life skills at Edwardsville High  School in my district. She takes a personal interest in her students,  ensuring they have all the tools they need to succeed in the classroom  and beyond.   If you ask her, she will tell you that the work she does every day is  a dream come true.   As a functional life skills teacher, Mrs. Converse manages the Tiger  Den at Edwardsville High School. It is a coffee shop staffed and run by  students with disabilities.   Her students take the orders and work the register, teaching them  consumer service skills and equipping them with vocational training to  prepare them for life after they exit the school system.   As a father, I know the difference a teacher can make in the lives of  our kids, and Mrs. Converse certainly has made a profound impact on  each and every one of her students.   I am proud to recognize her today as one of the best educators in not  just the State of Illinois but the entire country.   I congratulate Susan. It was great to see her out here in Washington  last week, and I look forward to seeing her back home very soon.                  Recognizing Audrey Ephraim Women's Center     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Audrey Ephraim Women's Center in Carlinville, Illinois, and Pastor  Don and his wife, Deneane, who run this great facility.   As the southern Illinois site for Adult & Teen Challenge Illinois,  this center is a critical resource in providing effective care to women  who struggle with life-controlling problems.   Audrey Ephraim Women's Center is a residential program with a one-of- a-kind approach to caring for women in need of treatment.   For some, this program is a last chance before serving time in jail.  For others, they come at their own will for help in seeking a road to  recovery.   When I visited the center, I spoke with three women who told me that,  upon their arrival, they had found a path to bettering their lives and  finding purpose. For so many women, this center is a safe haven. It is  a place for hope and a promise of a brighter tomorrow.   I am proud to represent facilities like the Audrey Ephraim Women's  Center that provide this life-changing care to women who are in their  most desperate times.   To all those at the center, I thank them for all they do. I am going  to continue to pray for each and every one of them.   I really want to thank my new friends--Katrina, Alicia, and Rhonda-- who were not just an inspiration to me and my team but are an  inspiration to this entire institution and our great country. I look  forward to seeing them again.                            ____________________
