 Mr. Speaker, small businesses are the economic engines of  our economy.   There are over 800,000 small businesses in North Carolina, generating  $800 million annually, accounting for half of all private sector  employment in our State, and regularly creating more than 20,000 jobs a  year.   We have seen a 38 percent increase in minority-owned businesses in  the last decade, and across the U.S., 85 million people rely on 25  million small businesses for employment.   As vice ranking member of the Small Business Committee and ranking  member on the Investigations, Oversight and Regulations Subcommittee, I  recognize the impact that small businesses have on our communities.  Lawmakers must continue to encourage innovation and support legislation  that allows local companies to grow.   I am proud to introduce the Score Act of 2017 during the 54th annual  National Small Business Week, legislation that authorizes the SCORE  program, connecting experienced businessowners with budding  entrepreneurs for advice and mentorship, and it ensures its funding for  at least 3 years.   Small businesses make the American Dream possible, and I am committed  to standing up and speaking out on their behalf.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my strong opposition to H.R. 1180.   H.R. 1180 encourages overwork by encouraging workers to spend more  time at work in order to earn paid time off, which employers may or may  not allow them to use in the future.   Many hardworking families throughout the 12th District of North  Carolina need overtime pay just to make ends meet each month. They  should not be compelled by their employer to accept comp time when  their monthly budget depends on how much overtime they receive in their  paycheck. Overtime pay can be the difference between paying for sending  a child to college or going into debt. Parents who earn an hourly wage  need overtime, not comp time, to care for their families.   Nothing in the Working Families Flexibility Act strengthens existing  workplace protections or promotes workplace flexibility. That is why I  offered an amendment last week when H.R. 1180 was considered in  committee to exempt comp time arrangements from mandatory arbitration  agreements.   This amendment would have ensured protections for employees that H.R.  1180 seek to take away. Unfortunately, the majority decided not to  support my amendment or any other amendments offered by my fellow  Democrats on the Education and the Workforce Committee.   Instead of today's bill, the House should consider legislation that  would create good jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits. I  strongly oppose H.R. 1180, and I encourage by colleagues to vote ``no''  on this bill.
