 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mahlon Paul  Manson, a Montanan and decorated veteran of the Vietnam war.   Montanans and all Americans owe Paul the deepest gratitude for his  service to this Nation.   Paul was born in San Diego, CA, on September 17, 1948. When he was in  first grade, his mother and three sisters moved to Deer Lodge, MT,  where he spent his youth. Paul completed high school in 1967 and  enlisted in the Army immediately following graduation.   During the summer of 1967, Paul worked for the Forest Service shortly  before starting military training at Fort Lewis, WA. He also received  advanced training to be a combat engineer at Fort Leonard Wood, MO.   Before leaving for Vietnam, Paul returned home for 2 weeks where he  got a glimpse into the strength of shared ideals. When he landed at the  airport, his bus was not scheduled to arrive for 6 more hours. Not one  to wait idly by, Paul decided to try his luck hitchhiking home.   In a moment of serendipity and brotherhood, a military car driving by  saw Paul walking along the side of the road in his uniform, offered to  give him a ride, and drove him home. This moment left a deep and  lasting impact on Paul, who felt an instant bond with his fellow  servicemembers.   Paul arrived in Vietnam in early 1968 with this sentiment in mind.  That year, he fought--and survived--a number of attacks, including one  of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam war, the Tet  Offensive.   He also showed incredible courage when his convoy came under attack  near Lai Khe. While heavily engaged with the enemy, Paul put his own  life on the line by jumping out of his military vehicle to encourage  the convoy to keep moving. His heroic act helped the U.S. facilitate a  counterattack against the Viet Cong, ultimately clinching an important  victory. Paul's heroism did not go without recognition--he received a  Bronze Star, with a ``V'' for Valor on August 20, 1968 for his  leadership.   After retiring from Active Duty in 1970, Paul returned to Montana to  work for the Milwaukee Railroad. He also continued his devotion to  service by becoming a recruiter for the Montana National Guard.   When he retired from the Army, Paul attended the University of  Montana. He graduated in 1996 and began working for U.S. Customs and  Border Protection in Missoula and Sweet Grass and in Washington State  as a Port Director. In total, Paul has given the Nation over 20 years  of Federal Service and continues to serve the Nation in a different  capacity today, as a volunteer for Team Rubicon.   Paul and his wife, Fran, have been happily married for 48 years.  Together, they have a son, Mahlon Patrick, and a daughter, Michelle, as  well as two grandchildren.   Although Paul has undeniably led an eventful life, he humbly  maintains that he is simply doing his job. ``Life is a buffet'' he  says, a perfect idiom for how he is able to make the most of the  opportunities that come his way.   I have the profound honor of presenting Paul with his military honor.  For his bravery in the line of duty, Mahlon Paul Manson is receiving a  Bronze Star Medal with a ``V'' for Valor. This medal serves as a small  token of our country's appreciation for his service and profound  sacrifice. Paul is an American hero and has made Montana proud.                            ____________________
