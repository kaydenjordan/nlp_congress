 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, half a century ago, members of the  LGBTQIA+ community, who were tired of being accosted and abused and  assaulted just because of who they were or whom they loved, took a  stand to say ``enough is enough'' and pushed back against the forces of  history that said they were anything less than.   Thanks to the sacrifice of freedom fighters like Marsha P. Johnson,  Sylvia Rivera, and so many others both named and unnamed who dared that  day to live their entire truth, countless others today have been set  free. Now, 50 years later, through dogged persistence and sacrifice, we  have been able to pass laws and create policies that respect and  protect members of the LGBTQIA+ community--from challenging hateful  bans against lesbian and gay relationships, to securing landmark civil  rights protections against hate crimes, to, finally, making marriage  equality the law of our land.   This year, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall  protests that sparked the modern movement for LGBTQ equality, I am very  proud to stand here on the floor of the Senate as an unapologetic ally  for this vibrant community.   As we close out this month's annual celebration of Pride, I come to  the floor today to reintroduce legislation to further protect gay,  lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and gender  nonconforming individuals from the dogma of our Nation's homophobic and  transphobic past because, even as we reflect on the progress we have  made, we have a lot more to do to achieve equality.   In the Senate, I have been very proud to stand shoulder to shoulder  with the community in Washington State and around the country in order  to continue our progress and work to expand protections to help members  of the community thrive, from our efforts to reduce bullying and  harassment at colleges and universities through legislation named after  Tyler Clementi--a student who tragically died by suicide in college--to  reducing the epidemic of harassment and discrimination in workplaces  through the Be HEARD Act, which is a bill I recently introduced that  would hold businesses accountable for harassment and discrimination,  give workers the resources and support they need to seek justice, and  clarify that discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and  gender identity are unlawful under the Civil Rights Act.   I am very grateful to my colleague Senator Booker and our friend  Representative Lieu for joining me today in reintroducing the  Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act--the first Federal ban on so-called  conversion therapy--because, in 2019, we know that being a member of  the LGBTQIA+ community isn't an affliction, a disease, or some chronic  condition that requires medical treatment; rather, the politicians who  say it is are on the wrong side of history.   In fact, we know that conversion therapy is a painful and  discriminatory practice. The American Psychological Association has  said it ``is unlikely to be successful in changing someone's sexual  orientation'' and would ``involve some risk of harm'' contrary to the  claims of practitioners and advocates. It is also a practice that is  especially harmful to LGBTQIA+ children, who we already know are  vulnerable to increased harassment and discrimination because of who  they are.   I am proud that my home State of Washington has already banned  conversion therapy, but that is not enough so long as any child or any  person in our country can be harmed by this sham practice. That is why  I am very proud to be here to reintroduce the Therapeutic Fraud  Prevention Act and to remind all of our friends that we stand with them  throughout history and throughout the future to make sure they are  protected with their rights.   The Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act is legislation that would  classify conversion therapy as the fraudulent practice our communities  and science know it is. It would clarify in our Nation's laws that  providing or facilitating commercial conversion therapy or facilitating  or advertising such services is an unfair and deceptive practice, and  it would ensure that Federal regulators and State attorneys general  have the ability and authority to enforce this ban.   We have come far in our long battle for LGBTQIA+ equality, and I am  ready to get to work to get this important legislation over the finish  line because, after 50 years of struggle, as a nation, we have come to  know that love is love and that love wins. However, after 50 years, we  also know it gets better but only if we work to make it so.   From the horrors of the Pulse massacre, to the ever-climbing number  of murdered African-American and Latinx transgender women, to President  Trump's transgender military ban and his administration's continuous  assault on LGBTQIA+ rights, so many of the challenges that face the  community today mirror the critical struggles they faced all those  years ago at the Stonewall Inn. Like then, too many in the community  are still threatened by even greater danger because they are also  women, transgender, people of color, poor, and the list goes on.  [[Page S4632]]    That is why this legislation and recognitions like Pride Month are so  important. All month, I have been thrilled to see the photos from Pride  celebrations back in Washington State--from Spokane, to Yakima, to  Olympia--filled with so much cheer, resilience, and strength, only to  come back here to Washington and argue in this Chamber about why we  shouldn't confirm people to judicial or executive posts who don't  believe in the full humanity and equality of so many of our family  members, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.   It is obvious that this work is still very important, and we have it  cut out for us, but I remain hopeful because I have seen how far we  have come in just 50 years. By continuing to honor the righteous  tradition of Marsha, Sylvia, and so many others by raising our voices  against injustice and taking key steps like this legislation to make  life easier for the next generation of LGBTQIA+ Americans, I know we  will see even more progress in the next 50 years.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Jones):   S. 2018.
