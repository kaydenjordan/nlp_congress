 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor today as  National Hire a Veteran Day.   This day is crucial to the spirit and health of both America's  veterans and our communities. Set aside to raise awareness to the  unique skills and useful abilities of servicemembers after military  service, we must use this day to recognize the sacrifice and the  strength of our veterans.   In America's private and public sectors, qualities like dedication,  determination, and tenacity are highly valuable. These are features  fostered during military service and can be even more useful in  nonmilitary employment. As 200,000 military members retire and become  veterans each year, more and more qualified potential employees are  eligible to join the greater American workforce.   Madam Speaker, as employers look to hire, they must value the talent  present amongst our American troops. Each and every servicemember  deserves the opportunities to create unique and positive impact after  they have made sacrifices to defend our great Nation.                            ____________________
