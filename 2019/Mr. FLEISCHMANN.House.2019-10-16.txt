 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the great people  of Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, as we all celebrate the 50th anniversary of  this community.   Mr. Speaker, I am so privileged and honored to represent 11 wonderful  east Tennessee counties in this great people's House. My largest county  is Hamilton County. Perhaps you have heard of a city there called  Chattanooga. That is our largest city. But right up the road is a very  special place: Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee.   Soddy-Daisy has a great history. It has been a city for 50 years. But  long before that, it all started with the construction of Poe's Tavern  in 1819, which Hasten Poe of Soddy-Daisy called home. In the years to  follow, the tavern served as a hospital during the Civil War and was  torn down later, but a replacement is there today.   Depending on whom you ask, you may get one of several stories about  how Soddy-Daisy got its name. Some say it was an adaptation of an  Indian name meaning ``sipping place''; others will tell you it derived  from the name of a trading post owned by William Sodder, nicknamed  ``Soddy.''   As time went on after the Civil War, it was home to mostly Scots;  then, later, Welshmen came, and they brought coal mining to the region.  The industry grew and the Daisy Coal Company was founded by Thomas  Parks, who named it after his daughter, Daisy. The coal company  expanded, and the region became known as ``Daisy.''   Mr. Speaker, in 1969, America put a man on the Moon, and a little  ball club I am very fond of in New York, the Mets, won the world  series. I was 7 years old then, and I didn't know that somewhere in  Hamilton County, Tennessee, the great people of Soddy and Daisy were  coming together to put together a beautiful city.   About a week or two ago, I celebrated their 50th anniversary as a  city. And today, joining us in this great people's House are the men  and women who serve on that commission. These are people who volunteer.  They serve without pay. These are truly great American citizens. I want  to talk about them right now.   We have got Mayor Gene-o Shipley and his wife, DeDe; Vice Mayor  Robert Cothran and his wife, Wanda; Commissioner Jim Adams and his  wife, Shirley; Commissioner Max Lowe and his wife, Teresa; and  Commissioner Rick Nunley and his wife, Katherine.   I also want to recognize Soddy-Daisy City Manager Janice Cagle; and  at that celebration, the very first mayor of Soddy-Daisy, Max Orr, was  present, and he is still a prominent figure in that great community  today.   I know in Soddy-Daisy and in Sale Creek and communities in Hamilton  County today, right now, Mr. Speaker, schoolchildren are watching us in  the public schools. I want to tell them that their parents,  grandparents, and the founders of this great community have been great  Americans.   Soddy-Daisy has a rich past. I have been with this wonderful  community in times of triumph and in times of tragedy. I have been  there when they had floods. Their community is a great community--good,  good people, wonderful people.   Now, as bright as the past has been, I want to tell the students who  are watching today that the future is going to be even brighter for  Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee. This is a community that loves God, loves our  country, and loves our veterans. It is a special place.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Soddy-Daisy and the great citizens there a very  happy birthday and Godspeed.                            ____________________
