 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to be with you today  and to tell everyone how excited I am that on July 15 checks are going  to be arriving at the homes of families with children who have been  struggling for a year and a half, and many have really come to the  brink because of the pandemic that we are facing.   This is the child tax credit that is actually going to reduce child  poverty by half in the United States of America. It was part of the  American Rescue Plan, which we passed in January, and now it is going  to come to help people in the form of a check. These payments provide  poor, working- and middle-class families with meaningful tax relief.   In my district, over 70 percent of children will benefit from the  expanded credit; over 100,000 families in total. This is the result of  our work to make sure that families are no longer suffering because of  the pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and  for his kind words.   I also thank the authors of this legislation, Representatives  Cardenas, Davis, Castor, and Upton, a bipartisan leadership group on  this legislation.   And I also thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr.  Bilirakis, for his cooperation on this and so many other issues.   Mr. Speaker, children are particularly vulnerable to risks associated  with household consumer products. These risks have been magnified by  the pandemic as families spend more time at home and parents juggle  working from home and supervising children.   This legislation will direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to study and report injuries and deaths associated with consumer  products during the pandemic. A lot of progress has been made, but the  pandemic is not yet over.    Americans deserve up-to-date information about emerging threats to  the safety of their children, and so this legislation is very  important.   This legislation also directs the Department of Commerce to study and  report to the Congress on the impact of the pandemic on the travel and  tourism industries.   These industries were really hit hard by the pandemic. Over 15.7  million Americans work in travel or tourism. Many of these jobs are  just now starting to come back. Industries that depend on travel or  tourism like the arts, live events, hotels, and restaurants are still  hurting. We must understand the full impact of the pandemic on travel  and tourism so that we can help these industries to be able to build  back better.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the authors of this bipartisan  legislation, Representatives McNerney, Burgess, Soto, Guthrie, and  Davidson.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government should put the incredible  technological innovation of the last few years to work for the American  people, and that is exactly what this bill does. It promotes the use of  artificial intelligence in product safety and studies how blockchain  can protect consumers.                                time  1500    Regulators will be stronger and the American consumer safer when we  consider how these technologies can help them achieve this mission.   Part of the mission of the Federal Trade Commission is to protect  consumers from unfair and deceptive business practices. It is important  to keep track of any such practices in the digital token ecosystem  where unscrupulous businesspeople may be seeking to take advantage of  the vast wealth created by digital tokens. This bill directs the  Federal Trade Commission to report on its work keeping users of the  digital token system safe.   Emerging technologies pose both perils and promise. That is why we  must direct Federal agencies to make sure that consumers are safe.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone and my ranking  member because this is such an important bipartisan bill that is  designed to save lives.   My colleague, Tony Cardenas, and I introduced the Safe Sleep for  Babies Act after the release of several devastating reports linking  inclined sleep products and crib bumpers to infant deaths. This  urgently needed legislation will add these dangerous products to the  list of banned hazardous products under the Consumer Product Safety  Act.   The science is clear: The safest sleep environment for babies is a  flat, firm, bare surface with no restraints or soft bedding. Infant  inclined sleep products and crib bumpers are dangerous and should not  be on the market at all.   If we do not pass this legislation, companies will continue to sell  and market these products that can harm and even kill infants, and  infants will continue to be harmed if we don't act now. As a mother and  grandmother, I know that we must act now to ensure that no more babies  die from unsafe sleep products.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, since 2000, more than 460 children have died from  furniture tip-overs, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission has  reported that tip-overs cause an average of 25,500 emergency room- treated injuries every year as children are crushed, trapped, or stuck  by furniture.   These deaths and injuries should never have happened in the first  place, but they continue to happen because current furniture stability  standards are both inadequate and only voluntary. We can't continue to  allow the furniture industry to regulate itself. It hasn't worked and  it has come at a cost of children's lives.   That is why I have reintroduced the legislation, the STURDY Act, H.R.  1314, which would strengthen and make mandatory furniture stabilization  standards for clothing storage units.   No parent should have to worry about their children being injured, or  worse, by a piece of furniture.   I want to give a special shout-out to the organization Kids In Danger  that has been advocating for this for a long time, and for the moms who  came to this Congress and told the stories of their lost children  because of these tip-overs. Their stories have moved everyone who has  heard them.   It is time now that we act. We can do something to help prevent these  furniture tip-overs that put our Nation's children in danger.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
