 Madam Speaker, it is my privilege today to rise to honor  the life of Foster Friess, an American patriot who was a warrior for  conservative and Christian values.   Foster truly lived the American Dream. He started his own business  that led to incredible success. But Foster leaves behind a legacy that  is far greater than success, as his generosity impacted the lives of  countless people.   His favorite Bible verse from Galatians: ``Carry each other's  burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.''   To Foster and his wife, Lynnette, that verse was more than words; it  was put into action daily. They were passionate about charitable giving  and always looking for ways to lend their support to people in need.   He will be missed by many, and my prayers are especially with his  wife, Lynnette, their 4 children and 15 grandchildren.   Foster's life glorified God, and his legacy will live on far beyond  his years. We must all learn from his example.                            ____________________
