 Madam President, in a State as big as mine, reliable  transportation infrastructure is absolutely essential. We are home to  both the largest network of highways, as well as the largest number of  bridges in the country. We are also a major hub for imports and exports  both along the gulf coast and the southern border.   As we continue to welcome more new Texans every day, the strain on  our infrastructure is growing. It takes a lot of planning and  maintenance to get all 29 million Texans, our visitors, and crucial  cargo around the State safely and efficiently. When you add in  broadband, airports, levees, waterways, it is easy to see how big an  undertaking this entire process is.   I continue to hear from my constituents back home, like I am sure we  all do, about the need for Federal funding to help repair, maintain,  and expand infrastructure across our States. But we just can't keep  adding expenses to the taxpayers' credit card. We have to figure out  how to pay for it.   Earlier this year, President Biden floated his idea for an absolutely  massive infrastructure bill totaling $2.6 trillion. It included a broad  range of controversial and, frankly, overpriced programs, all funded by  massive tax hikes on the American taxpayer.   The good news is, that is not the bill we are considering today. A  bipartisan group of our colleagues worked with the White House to find  common ground and get a bill to the floor with support from both sides.  The 2,700-page text was just released last night, and I know, like  everybody else, I am still in the process with my staff of evaluating  just how it will impact my State and our Nation.   Our colleagues who negotiated and drafted this legislation put in a  lot of long hours and hard work to reach an agreement. I commend them  for their efforts.   I am eager to see a score from the Congressional Budget Office to  provide a better understanding of the true cost of this legislation.  But even the proponents who negotiated this deal concede that, at least  before the $118 billion transfer from the general revenue fund last  night, that even then, only about half of it was paid for.   I believe there, so far, have been some missed opportunities, one  being reforms to the highway trust fund itself. For years, the highway  trust fund has faced major shortfalls and, to a serious degree, Texans  have footed the bill for those shortfalls because we are one of the  States that receive less than we contribute. For every dollar we put in  the highway trust fund, only 95 cents comes back to my State. That is  not the same treatment of every State. In fact, we received the lowest  rate of return than any other State.   I don't think it is a stretch to say it is unfair that Texans  subsidize infrastructure projects in every other State, but that is  only part of the issue here. The highway trust fund has been operating  in the red for more than a decade. The current state of the highway  trust fund is unsustainable, and unless something changes, we are going  to be in dire straits--even more dire straits in just a few years.   The importance of the highway trust fund is that we have always  believed in a user fee model when it comes to infrastructure. The  people who use it are the ones to pay to maintain it and expand it. But  rather than make reforms to the formula to make the fund solvent, this  bill throws more borrowed money at the problem.   As I said, just this morning, I learned that another $118 billion was  proposed to be transferred to the highway trust fund with no reforms to  help put it back on sound financial footing. This is quite a step away  from the user fee model where those who use the infrastructure are the  ones who pay for it. This is a transfer from general revenue, from the  taxpayer, into the highway trust fund. This inclusion was a big  surprise to me, and in all the conversations we have had about this  legislation over the past several weeks, I didn't hear a word about a  highway trust fund bailout.   The massive bill, as I said, was dropped last night, and we are still  trying to comb through the 2,700 pages of text, which, at this point,  appears to be full of surprises, and I will just mention one of them.   This bill should not be rushed through the Senate without providing  all Members a chance to read it, to understand it, and offer their  suggestions to improve it. I have been working with some of our  colleagues on amendments to this legislation to provide legitimate pay- fors. Since this bill didn't go through the regular committee process  but was really cobbled together by a negotiation--again, in a  bipartisan fashion that I commend for their efforts--but it makes it  all the more important that since this is the first time that many of  us have seen the entire 2,700-page bill, that it be subject to an open  amendment process.   This legislation will have impact on every State in the country, and  every Member of the Senate should have the opportunity to weigh in and  offer changes. Members of the bipartisan group have committed to a  process that allows Senators on both sides to offer changes to this  bill, and in the days ahead, I hope the majority leader will allow that  to happen, and we will have a robust amendment process.                                 Gun Violence    Madam President, on another matter, my State is no stranger to  tragedy. In recent years, we have experienced hurricanes, tornadoes, a  crippling winter freeze, and other natural disasters that have tested  our resiliency. Sadly, too, some of our communities have experienced  mass shootings.   Tomorrow, Texans will mark a solemn anniversary: 2 years since a  gunman stormed into a Walmart in El Paso, TX, and opened fire. Twenty- three people died; dozens were injured; and the lives of countless El  Pasoans were forever changed. My friend, the former mayor, Dee Margo,  said at the time:         Hate will not overcome love. Hate will not define who we       are.    This shooting was, undoubtedly, hate in its purest form. The shooter  was a White supremacist who carried out an act that could only be  described as domestic terrorism. Our Hispanic neighbors and friends  were purposely targeted, and both Texans and Mexicans were killed by  this wicked individual.   In the face of this pure evil, El Pasoans responded with love. Off- duty surgeons and doctors rushed to the hospital to save as many lives  as they could. El Pasoans were comforted by their faith leaders, like  Father Marquez, who stayed up all night with 17 families and sat beside  them as they were told their loved ones had not made it. And hundreds  of Texans lined up to give blood. I was proud to be one of those 3,000  donations at the Vitalant centers in El Paso and Las Cruces.   A young El Pasoan, Ruben Martinez, was just in sixth grade when this  mass  [[Page S5551]]  shooting took place. In the days that followed, he created the El Paso  Challenge, where he and his mom performed 23 random acts of kindness in  honor of the 23 victims. Two years later, they are still keeping up  that tradition and recently gave out roses at San Jacinto Plaza to  remind people to spread love and kindness.   El Paso, a community that saw the face of evil, unequivocally chose  love, and I am grateful to Texans like Ruben who have continued to make  the choice, day after day, to honor the lives of the 23 whom we lost.   As we remember the lives that were lost just 2 years ago and the  families and the victims that many of us comforted in the hospitals in  the aftermath of this, we are also--we also carry the painful reminder  that justice has not yet been served. Last week, the Federal hearing  for the accused shooter was postponed until November, and the State's  case continues to await a trial date due to delays stemming from  COVID's impact on our court system.   My heart is with the families and friends looking for closure who  must now deal with this additional delay in justice being served.   I know I speak for all Texans when I say that the 2-year anniversary  approaches tomorrow; that, as it approaches, we all stand in solidarity  with El Pasoans and remember the enduring strength and spirit of this  vibrant community.   I yield the floor
