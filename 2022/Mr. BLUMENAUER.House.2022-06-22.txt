 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased we are taking up this  bipartisan legislation today to reauthorize critical programs to  address mental health.   We cannot, however, address mental health without acknowledging and  addressing the climate impact. Our children are experiencing twin  crises of mental health and climate change anxiety.   Last week, the Oregon Health Authority released a report raising the  alarm of the effect of climate change on our youth. From the impact of  climate-related disasters to climate anxiety, our children are facing  stress and trauma that we need to address with them.   If we want to invest in our youth and their mental health, we must  acknowledge the impact and give them hope that we understand and are  working to reduce that threat. We simply cannot leave climate out of  the conversation.   I appreciate the work that Chairman Pallone has done for both youth  mental health and climate, and I look forward to working with him to  address both these critical issues.
