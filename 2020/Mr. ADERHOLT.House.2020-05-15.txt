 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding to me.   I rise today in strong opposition to this bill. No doubt, as has been  said, State and local governments across this Nation are hurting  because of the economic downturn this virus has created. However, these  times call for cooperation. The Democrats, unfortunately, have chosen  partisanship.   America needs us to come together to address this pandemic, but the  Democrats chose their own way, shutting out the Republicans in  discussing this bill. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership seems  more interested in shaping the debate for November than solving the  real problems that this country is going through today.   Among the many concerns of this package is the election mandates. The  Democrat pipe dream would lead to widespread voter fraud by allowing  voter harvesting and prohibiting even States from requiring voter  identification.   Let me be clear: This bill is chock-full of proposals that have  absolutely nothing to do with addressing the economic harms from the  pandemic virus that we are experiencing in this Nation. A $3 trillion  liberal wish list is not a serious proposal. The United States of  America, this country, deserves better.
