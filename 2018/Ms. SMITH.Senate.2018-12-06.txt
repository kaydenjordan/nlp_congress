 Madam President, I rise to discuss the urgency of  addressing climate change. I will also address the nomination of Mr.  Bernard McNamee to be a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, which we are debating on the Senate floor today.   Recently, the Trump administration released the latest installment of  the National Climate Assessment. This report is the work of over 300  expert scientists and 13 different government agencies, including the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, NASA, and  others. The report makes an urgent case for action by detailing the  extreme threat that is posed to our Nation and to our world by climate  change.   The need for forward-looking environmental and energy policies is  obvious to anyone who reads this report, and it is telling that this  report was mandated by a law signed by the late George H. W. Bush in  1990--a President whose life we came together to celebrate yesterday.   The Trump administration doesn't want to talk about the report's  findings, but the problems of a changing climate are already well known  to us in Minnesota. Our winters are milder than they used to be. Rain  patterns are changing. We are now prone to long, hot dry spells in the  summer, but when the rains do come, they are more intense. Big storms  used to be rare in Minnesota, but now we suffer more than almost  anywhere else in the country from these climate-driven increases in so- called mega-rain events. When it rains 6 or 8 or even 10 inches all at  once, houses flood and fields flood. The water can't run off or soak  into the soil fast enough. As Minnesota's Lieutenant Governor and now  as a Senator, I have seen the consequences of these storms.   Without action on climate change, these problems are only going to  get worse. Even to those who have long accepted the scientific  consensus on climate change, the new report makes for a sobering read.  The assessment tells us that if greenhouse gas emissions continue  unabated, ``the Midwest is projected to have the largest increase in  extreme temperature-related premature deaths.'' By 2090, the Midwest  can expect 2,000 additional deaths a year alone due to heat. That will  be more than in any other region in the country.   We know that there are health consequences to a warming climate and  also important impacts on our food supply. Minnesota is a vital  contributor to our world's food supply. We rank fourth in the country  in corn production, and corn is our No. 1 agricultural commodity. In  2017, Minnesota farmers produced $4.5 billion of corn on 8 million  acres. This agricultural productivity is threatened by climate change.  The problem going forward is that corn doesn't tolerate extreme warm  temperatures. Corn plants grow best at approximately 80 degrees, and  above 95 degrees, reproductive failure is a risk. U.S. corn yields per  acre grew 60 percent from the 1980s to today. Because of warming  temperatures, the climate assessment warns that we risk losing all of  these productivity gains by 2050.   A world with nearly 10 billion people at midcentury is going to need  American farmers to produce even more than ever. Climate change  threatens our farmers' ability to rise to that challenge. This is why I  agree with the National Farmers Union, which says:         We can't wait for technology to solve climate change. We       must take action now.    We grow more than just corn in Minnesota. For example, the  Anishinaabe people in my State harvest the world's finest wild rice.  The climate assessment states: ``Declines in production are expected,  related to increases in climate extremes and climate-related disease  and pest outbreaks as well as northward shifts of favorable growing  regions.'' The loss of wild rice in Minnesota would be a cultural,  ecological, and economic tragedy.   The climate assessment also highlights the economic stakes. Climate  change threatens to reduce the size of the U.S. economy by up to 10  percent by the end of this century--a loss of hundreds of billions of  dollars per year.   In response to the extreme challenges that we face from climate  change, I see two potential ways to respond.   First, the path offered by Mr. McNamee would be that we do nothing to  acknowledge this problem.   As the Department of Energy's deputy general counsel, Mr. McNamee  pushed a dirty coal plant bailout that would have cost American  consumers billions of dollars a year with there being no discernible  benefit to our energy system and a huge loss in our fight against  climate change. That is why the proposal was rejected unanimously by  the five FERC Commissioners. Now Mr. McNamee is nominated to be one of  those Commissioners.   To avoid dealing with the climate change problem, Mr. McNamee has-- like many in the Trump administration--decided that the first, best  tactic is to deny there is even a problem. In February of this year,  Mr. McNamee spoke at a policy orientation for legislators in Texas.  When he was asked about how his son and other students should react to  being taught climate science in schools, Mr. McNamee said:         Just deny it. I don't care if you get an F. I don't care.    I reject Mr. McNamee's head-in-the-sand approach, which is a  fundamentally pessimistic approach to America's ability to lead the  fight against climate change by leading the clean energy revolution. I,  by contrast, am an optimist.   The thing about the clean energy transition is that it is going to  happen with or without American leadership. Between now and 2050, the  world will invest $11.5 trillion in building new electric generators.  Almost 9 in 10 of those dollars will be spent on renewables and other  technologies with zero carbon emissions.   The United States should lead the way in developing, making, and  deploying clean energy technology; however, right now, China is leading  the way. China leads the way in renewable energy investments, and it  spent $127 billion in 2017, which outspent the United States by more  than 3 to 1.   We know that Americans want to step up. California and Hawaii have  put themselves on a path to 100-percent clean energy by 2050. Just this  week, Xcel Energy, which is the largest utility in my State, pledged to  deliver 80 percent in carbon dioxide emission reductions by 2030, with  a goal of having 100-percent emissions-free electricity by 2050.   States, companies, and individuals can help lead the way, but that  doesn't take the Federal Government off the hook. We must pull together  as a country. The scale of the challenge requires national and  international coordination and cooperation. The United States can lead,  or we can be left behind. We led the way during the fossil fuel  revolution, and we were rewarded with world-leading prosperity. There  is a new revolution happening.   Mr. McNamee and President Trump both believe that we can prosper by  doubling down on outdated thinking regarding energy and climate, but  they are wrong.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this nominee. It is the duty of  those of us in Congress to push for a clear-eyed but optimistic path  forward and not to let misguided ideology leave us stuck in the past.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for Abigail  Regitsky, a fellow in my office, to be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of this Congress.
