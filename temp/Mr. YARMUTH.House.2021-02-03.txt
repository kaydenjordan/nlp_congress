 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 85, I call up  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 11) establishing the  congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year  2021 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal  years 2022 through 2030, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 11.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it has been roughly 1 year since the first COVID-19 case  was diagnosed in the United States. Since then, more than 26 million  Americans have been infected, and more than 440,000 have lost their  lives.   Millions of Americans remain out of work as families are pushed to  the brink of devastation. Our economy faces lows unseen since the Great  Depression.   Food insecurity is climbing. Widespread school closures threaten to  derail our children's education. And our most vulnerable communities  are being forced to bear the brunt of these twin crises as underlying  health and economic inequities grow worse.   Congress has previously come together to pass relief packages, but  COVID is getting worse, not better. Our  [[Page H289]]  recovery is painful and the most unequal on record. We are still deep  in the trenches. We have to do more, a lot more.   As chairman of the Budget Committee, I promised that we would do  everything our committee could do to support our recovery, which is why  I introduced the 2021 budget resolution being considered today. This  budget resolution was designed solely for one task: providing Congress  with the option of using reconciliation to implement the American  Rescue Plan and deliver the critical relief we need.   President Biden's American Rescue Plan lays out an aggressive  legislative package to change the direction of these crises, including  a national vaccine program; testing and tracing, paid sick leave to  stop the spread, an extension of lifeline unemployment benefits that  are set to expire in March; direct financial support for families; and  support so schools can operate safely.   Our country desperately needs this relief, and economists across the  ideological spectrum agree. Past crises have made it clear that doing  too little will cost us far more. Weak support will lead to a weak,  prolonged, and K-shaped recovery, posing more severe risks to our  economic and budget outlooks than any deficits we might incur.   Without the American Rescue Plan, CBO estimates that it will take at  least 3 years before employment returns to prepandemic levels. But with  this vital support, economists estimate that we can bring the economy  back to near full employment in a little over 12 months.   We have the plan and the ability to do this. And, thankfully, we can  also afford to do it. Interest rates and inflation are at historic  lows, lower today than even before the pandemic, and the return on  smart investments in the economy has never been higher.   Economists of all stripes are telling us, begging us, to use the  fiscal space we have. They are warning that if we don't go big, we will  be responsible for a long, painful, and unequal recovery, one that will  cost more lives and more jobs, that will cause more businesses to close  and result in more damage to our Nation's economy, both in the short-  and long-term.   The resolution's budget reconciliation framework sets a budgetary  target of up to $1.9 trillion, the estimated cost of the American  Rescue Plan, allocated across the 12 committees that have jurisdiction  over some portion of the plan. The resolution instructs these  committees to report legislation consistent with these budgetary  targets to the Budget Committee by February 16. The Budget Committee  will then combine the legislation and prepare it for floor  consideration.   There will be plenty of opportunities for my colleagues across the  aisle to engage in this process and offer amendments, but we cannot  afford to slow down our response to these urgent crises while  Republicans decide if they want to help or not.   The American Rescue Plan can be the difference between getting a  vaccine or a virus, advancing to the next grade or falling behind,  keeping the doors open or shutting down businesses for good.   The choice is clear. I look forward to passing this resolution and  ensuring Congress delivers the American Rescue Plan to the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the passionate words  of the ranking member, and I failed to hear one instance in which he  expressed concern or any ideas about how to help the hundreds of  thousands of Americans who will die if this government does not act  quickly and aggressively; or the hundreds of thousands of businesses  that will close; or the schools that he wants to reopen, which we all  want to reopen. We are looking for ideas, but so far all we have had is  resistance and obstruction.   The President this week actually met with 10 Republican United States  Senators in an effort to get a bipartisan approach to the crisis we  face. I would still hope that we can do that, but we can't afford to  wait for that to happen. That is why this process is in place, giving  plenty of opportunity for the Republicans in both the House and Senate  to participate and to help us find a better plan to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), who is the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to respond to the notion that  this is a radical plan. The radical, very radical chairman of the  Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump, Kevin Hassett,  said:         But I think we need to be risk-averse and pass another       relief package. There are so many businesses treading water,       barely hanging on. Now they are getting hit by another shock.       You could end up in a negative spiral for the economy.    January 22, 2021, the radical Kevin Hassett.   Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the distinguished chairman  of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield 2\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), the distinguished  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I welcome the gentleman from California to  both Congress and the Budget Committee and I look forward to working  with him. I will advise him that in just a few weeks he will have the  opportunity, as a member of the Budget Committee, to go through a  markup, offer amendments to the plans that will be proposed in another  budget resolution that will actually come to the floor. So I look  forward to that discussion and hope that will satisfy the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the chair of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Johnson), the distinguished chair of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I welcome the gentleman from Iowa to the  House of Representatives, and I will correct him.   There is no 10-year budget outlook in this budget. This is a single  budget resolution, only for this fiscal year, designed to facilitate  the use of the reconciliation package to implement the President's  American Rescue Plan, which, by the way, he campaigned vigorously on  throughout his campaign.   While Republicans were saying, ``Oh, it is too early to do something.  Let's pause. Let's wait. Let's do this,'' the President was aggressive.  The President was creative, forceful, and the American people rewarded  him with a victory.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I welcome the gentleman from  Florida to the House of Representatives. I really think that we ought  to stop talking about States bailing other States out. The next time  that a major hurricane hits Florida, we are not going to say that New  York and California don't want to help them. That is not the kind of  body that I hope we are.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I know it is fascinating, and I have heard  this argument now year after year after year talking about how much  every individual in this country has owed because of the debt--the  national debt. We have been accumulating debt in this country for most  of our 240-year history.   I ask the gentleman: Has there ever been one American citizen or one  American citizen's ancestor who has ever paid any of that debt or who  has ever been asked to pay for that debt?  [[Page H295]]    Of course not. That is because we are a sovereign currency nation. We  don't pay attention to that.   And just to clarify one thing he said, he said spending money has  never helped in a crisis. Well, you will find virtually no economist  who will not say that what we did last spring when we passed the CARES  Act helped us mitigate the very first few months of this disaster. We  didn't do enough then. We can't make the same mistake now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chair of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman from Georgia said that this plan is going to destroy  the economy. I think it is interesting that the American Rescue Plan  has received praise from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business  Roundtable, the National Retail Federation, among other business  groups, and top economic advisers from the last four Presidents: Kevin  Hassett, who I mentioned earlier from the Trump administration; Gene  Sperling; R. Glenn Hubbard; and Alan Blinder have all said that  additional spending is needed to rescue the economy.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished chairman of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my friend from Texas, and  I remind him that this, as I said in my opening statement, is plan B.  We would prefer not to do this. We would prefer to have a bipartisan,  regular order solution to this. We could do it actually more  expeditiously than the reconciliation process.   But when Republicans, in an effort to be supposedly bipartisan, offer  $600 billion--when virtually everyone says we need relief and rescue  money approaching the $1.9 trillion figure--it is not genuine,  bipartisan, good-faith negotiation. That is posturing.   We will have several weeks to reach a bipartisan agreement. I hope we  can. But this is plan B. And we will proceed with it because the  American people can't wait as long as the Republicans seem to be able  to.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), the distinguished chairman of the  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Georgia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Small Business.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the gentlewoman from Iowa  to the House of Representatives and just remark that when she said that  this is a plan that was crafted in secret, this plan was crafted during  the 2020 campaign. It was part of President Biden's agenda, and every  American voter had a chance to register his or her support for that  plan.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the Chair as to how much time remains  on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), who is a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to respond to my friend from Texas, to say that, in about 3 weeks or a  little less, the Budget Committee will have a piece of legislation  which actually goes into the details of the American Rescue Plan and  includes those. There will be a markup. The gentleman will have every  opportunity to offer amendments, and then that bill will come to the  floor as well. So don't give up hope.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    We will have a floor debate as well. In regular order,  the gentleman will go through the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member  of the Budget Committee.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Chu), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), another distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names of the  Budget Committee staff who worked so tirelessly and competently on this  piece of legislation.                    Budget Committee Majority Staff List         Erika Appel        Ellen Balis        Samantha Carter        Edward Etzkorn        Jose Guillen        Jocelyn Harris        Emily King        Sarah Lee        Sheila McDowell        Diana Meredith        Kimberly Overbeek        Barbara Pike        Katie Raymond        Scott Russell        Laura Santos        Raquel Spencer        Greg Waring        Alexandra Weinroth        Christie Wentworth        Jennifer Wheelock        Ted Zegers        Grady Stevens (intern)     Mr. Speaker, for the record, nothing in this proposal  should come as a surprise. The resolution's budgetary target matches  the estimated cost of the American Rescue Plan, every detail of which  was put forward during President Biden's campaign. Further, many of  these provisions have already passed the House but languished on  Senator McConnell's desk.   Nothing we are doing here precludes a bipartisan deal. But let's be  clear, the American people overwhelmingly support President Biden's  plan.   And I can assure you they couldn't care less about House procedures.  They want us to act and get them the relief they need now.   January was the deadliest month yet for COVID. Every 28 seconds, an  American died from the coronavirus. At that  [[Page H305]]  rate, more than 385 Americans will have died while we are debating this  resolution.   We cannot afford to slow down. We need to hurry the hell up.
