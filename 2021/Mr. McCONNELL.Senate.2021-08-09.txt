 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last election cycle, Americans elected  a 50-50 Senate, a closely divided House, and a President who promised  unity and moderation.   What have Washington Democrats done in response?   They have set out trying to tax and spend our country into oblivion.  They have handed the keys to domestic policymaking to Chairman Sanders  and some socialist House Members.   In the spring, they passed a massive, inflationary, liberal spending  bill that Democrats bragged was the most liberal bill in American  history.   Now, this week, just a few months later, they want to start ramming  through trillions more that will make that disaster look like child's  play.   They call it $3\1/2\ trillion in spending. Nonpartisan experts say  those plans would more likely cost Americans about $5\1/2\ trillion-- trillions more borrowing and trillions more spending, when inflation is  already sticking American families with higher costs; new permanent  welfare, with no work requirements, when small businesses are already  struggling to find workers; sweeping amnesty, when the southern border  is already in crisis; Green New Deal regulations, when Americans' gas  prices have already shot up; and crushing tax hikes for family  businesses and farms, as they fight to recover from the recession.   So, apparently, tragedy and comedy really are two sides of the same  coin. The tragedy is that Democrats want to inflict all this pain on  middle-class families. Here is the comedy: They won't let Republicans  have any say in this monstrosity, but they want our help raising their  credit card to make it happen.   Democrats want Republicans to help them raise the debt limit so they  can keep spending historic sums of money with zero Republican input and  zero Republican votes.   So imagine a friend tells you he is flying off to Las Vegas to blow  all of his money. He doesn't care that you think it is irresponsible.  You aren't invited to come along, but he wants you to cosign a loan for  him before he leaves.   Now, I understand the administration sent out the Treasury Secretary  to argue that, historically, both parties have addressed the debt  ceiling together. Of course, it is our Senate Democrat colleagues who  have no interest in what is historically normal. Their borrowing and  spending are historically abnormal. Democrats keep boasting about how  wild and revolutionary their partisan vision is.   So our friends across the aisle should not expect traditional  bipartisan borrowing to finance their nontraditional reckless taxing- and-spending spree. That is not how it is going to work.   Democrats have all the existing tools they need to raise the debt  limit on a partisan basis. If they want 50 lockstep Democratic votes to  spend trillions and trillions more, they can find 50 Democratic votes  to finance it. If they don't want Republicans' input, they don't need  our help. It couldn't really be simpler, and it really couldn't be more  fair.   Besides, I thought my colleagues were literally thrilled to present  another reckless taxing-and-spending spree to the American people. I  thought middle-class families were supposed to be delighted with their  socialist shopping list.   So shouldn't Democrats be proud to own all the debt it requires?   Our colleagues seem confident that Chairman Sanders' vision is worth  sticking our kids and grandkids with a massive bill. They deserve to  have total ownership of that decision                                 Afghanistan    Now, Mr. President, on a totally different matter, when the Biden  administration announced its reckless retreat from Afghanistan in  April, I made my opposition perfectly clear.   But I wasn't alone. One of the most prominent liberal editorial  boards in the country responded to the President's move with this  headline: ``Biden takes the easy way out of Afghanistan. The likely  result is disaster.''   The administration's own top intelligence experts made a similar  prediction:         The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and       the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at       bay if the coalition withdraws its support.    The Director of the CIA told Senators that withdrawal would make his  Agency's job harder. And needless to say, the last time a Democratic  administration tried a hasty retreat from the region offered a  cautionary tale.   Reality was clear to everyone but the very top of the Biden  administration. From their bizarre choice of a symbolic September 11  deadline, to the absence of any concrete plan, the administration's  decision appears to have rested on wishful thinking and not much else.   The notion that Afghan Forces might be able to stop the Taliban's  advance with only ``over-the-horizon'' support? That has proven to be  wishful thinking.   That the Taliban might respond to the diplomatic plying of the  international community? Wishful thinking as well.   As the administration's withdrawal proceeds at full speed, expert  warnings have become deadly realities.   The Afghan people and their democratic institutions are literally  being ripped apart by murderous theocrats. Nearly 1,000 Afghans have  reportedly been killed already by Taliban death squads in the Province  of Kandahar alone.   In the last 2 months, the militants have taken more territory--more  territory in the last 2 months--than they have held since 2001. And in  just the last 4 days, the Taliban have raised their flag over six-- six--provincial capitals, including northern cities far, far from the  group's historic base of power.   Militants are engaged in a campaign to assassinate crucial members of  the remaining resistance, from military pilots to top government  ministers.   All across the country, women and children are already suffering, in  particular. One recent report claimed Taliban militans beat a child to  death because his father--listen to this: Beat a child to death because  his father served in the Afghan Armed Forces.   What is more, the prospect of an emboldened al-Qaida--capable of  threatening not only the region, but the American homeland--is now a  near certainty, no matter what the Biden administration tells itself  about the state of that threat today.   And yet the State Department still mouths unbelievably naive  platitudes, like ``expectation'' is that the Taliban will work toward  ``political settlement,'' even as the Taliban spokesman asserted that  the most recent attacks are just ``the beginning of retaliatory  operations.''   So does this sound like a group committed to peaceful means?   Goodness' sake, get a grip.   This willful denial isn't just costing Afghanistan; it is already  costing the American people and our interests.   It has forced loyal coalition partners to second-guess whether we can  be trusted to finish what we start. It has led brave Afghans, who  earned promises of assistance, to fear they would be abandoned amid our  incompetent--  [[Page S6064]]  completely incompetent--retreat. It has even left overwhelmed Embassy  personnel to urge remaining Americans in Afghanistan to leave  immediately by any means available.   This morning, I attended a classified briefing from administration  officials about current conditions on the ground. Look, needless to  say, the briefers faced some tough questions about an entirely  avoidable--entirely avoidable--situation that is deteriorating faster  every single day; and they will certainly face more as global  terrorists feed from the rise of an extremist government in  Afghanistan.   I, for one, have warned repeatedly that those who seek to harm us,  our friends, and our interests simply do not abide by our political  time tables. They do not care if our leaders get tired of the task at  hand.   And this is not what victory looks like.
