 Madam President, today I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the School Infrastructure Modernization Act, with my  colleague Senator Warner.   To claim the Federal tax credit for historic preservation, a building  renovation must be for a different purpose than that for which the  building was previously used, a requirement known as the prior use  rule. This bill waives that requirement for renovations of K-12 public  school buildings. This will make it easier to restore historic-but- dilapidated school buildings across the country so our children have  safe, modern spaces in which to learn.   As a Richmond City Council member and later mayor, I faced challenges  familiar to many municipalities--overcrowded schools, aging buildings,  and limited dollars in the budget. But in one particular case, I and a  group of local stakeholders identified a creative solution. On one  hand, we had an overcrowded Thomas Jefferson High School with in-zone  and magnet students. On the other hand, we had a closed Maggie Walker  High School that needed renovations. We put together a financing  package that made use of Federal and State historic tax credits to  renovate Maggie Walker High School and satisfied the prior use rule by  consolidating the magnet program from Thomas Jefferson into a new  Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and International  Studies. Today, some 30 years later, this is one of America's highest  performing public high schools. Without the Federal historic tax  credit, this would have been too expensive to make happen.   This bill will make it easier to do similar projects around the  country. More modern school buildings will bolster the quality of  public education, and carrying out these projects will generate private  sector infrastructure investment and jobs. In Virginia alone, according  to a 2021 study, more than 1,000 K-12 schools are at least 50 years  old, representing more than half of all the K-12 schools in the  Commonwealth.   I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense incentive that  is good for education, good for infrastructure, and good for jobs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar):   S. 1539. A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act and the  Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to make the  native sod provisions applicable to the United States and to modify  those provisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
