 Madam Speaker, every day the American people wake up to  more concerning news at the southern border, and they are beyond  outraged. Thousands of illegal immigrants continue to overwhelm ports  of entry, the flood of illicit narcotics continues to skyrocket, and  yet, this administration refuses to act.   Over 1.2 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at the  southern border since February of this year, and in August, President  Biden released close to 44,000 illegal immigrants into the U.S.   Madam Speaker, this is yet another failure that President Biden can  add to his growing list. If this administration does not act with a  sense of urgency, America's communities are in danger. It is time for  action.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.   This amendment would require private lenders automatically to  discharge loans for borrowers who die or become totally and permanently  disabled.    As you can clearly see, this amendment, like so many others we are  debating, has no relation to our Nation's defense.   In addition to being irrelevant to the bill we are considering, the  language is also completely unnecessary.   Private lenders, as my colleague has already said, already discharge  loans for borrowers and their families who find themselves in these  horrible circumstances.   They do this not because they are required by the government to do  so, but because it is the right thing to do.   All this amendment would do is waste valuable time to create a  government mandate for a feature already commonplace in the industry.   This amendment is yet another example of Democrats finding ways for  the Federal Government to take over every aspect of our lives and  destroy as much as possible of the private sector.   I urge my colleagues to object to the inclusion of this unneeded  policy.
