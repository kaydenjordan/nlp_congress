 Mr. President, today I recognize Chief Judge Sidney  R. Thomas, a dedicated public servant who is celebrating 25 years on  the Federal bench on March 11.   Born and raised in Montana, Judge Thomas's skill as a decisionmaker  was evident from the start. Even as a high school debater, he earned  the respect of competing schools with the combination of his success at  meets and affable spirit. Both his tenacity and good nature would be  enduring legacies. Judge Thomas went on to attend Montana State  University and obtain his J.D. from the University of Montana School of  Law. He was twice appointed to the Board of Regents of Higher Education  as a student member.   After graduating, Judge Thomas entered private practice. A quick  learner with a deft ability to understand even the most complex cases,  he became a senior partner. During his tenure in private practice,  Judge Thomas specialized in commercial litigation, along with  bankruptcy, government, and media law. He further applied his expertise  as the standing bankruptcy  [[Page S1274]]  trustee for all bankruptcy cases filed in the U.S. District Court for  the District of Montana's Billings Division. Judge Thomas also helped  shape future lawyers by serving at Rocky Mountain College for over a  decade as an adjunct instructor in law.   On July 19, 1995, recognizing Judge Thomas's outstanding record,  President Bill Clinton nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit. The U.S. Senate confirmed Judge Thomas in January  1996, and he served as a judge for nearly two decades, before becoming  chief judge on December 1, 2014.   Throughout his impressive career, Judge Thomas has earned the  confidence of his colleagues and the American people. He is a respected  leader who is trusted for his sound judgment and integrity, as well as  beloved for his warm personality and wit. These qualities landed Judge  Thomas on President Barack Obama's short list of candidates to replace  Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010.   Thanks to his extraordinary commitment public service, his  intelligence and legal acumen, and his commitment to justice, Judge  Thomas is a credit to our Nation's judiciary. His fairness on the  bench, along with his tireless work ethic and compassion, sets a model  for all of us.   I applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in congratulating Chief Judge Sidney R. Thomas on attaining 25 years  on the Federal bench.                            ____________________
