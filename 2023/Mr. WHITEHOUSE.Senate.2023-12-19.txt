 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here today for the 26th time to  detail the special interest billionaire-funded scheme that has overrun  the U.S. Supreme Court. This evening, I would like to discuss some  things about Republican Judiciary Committee members' performance in the  Senate Judiciary Committee recently as we voted on authorizing  subpoenas for billionaire Harlan Crow, some of his holding companies,  and the court-fixer, Leonard Leo.   At the end of last month, we voted, through the authorization for  Chairman Durbin, to issue subpoenas, and it was greeted with a barrage  of talk about a whole variety of things. But one was how Democrats were  destroying the Judiciary Committee. We were absolutely totally going to  destroy the Judiciary Committee. It was on us that the Judiciary  Committee was going to be destroyed.   Well, all the talk about destroying the Senate Judiciary Committee  came, rather, in the nature of a threat. It was actually more like, if  we did something that we are perfectly entitled to do to pursue  subpoenas after being persistently obstructed, then Republicans would  destroy the committee, would undo any good will or any bipartisanship  or any collegial effort.   Somehow that Republican threat to destroy the committee morphed into  Democrats destroying the committee. But that doesn't make any sense. If  you think of a kidnapper shooting his hostage and then blaming the  family for the murder of the hostage because the family hadn't yielded  to the kidnapper's demands, that is kind of backward logic.   Also backward logic is the argument that the subpoenas were an effort  to destroy not the committee but the Supreme Court. The subpoenas would  destroy or damage the Supreme Court.   OK. Let's think about that for a minute.   There is only one possible way that it could be true, logically, that  these subpoenas could do damage to the Supreme Court--only one--and  that is if the information the subpoenas would disclose is so damaging  that it would damage or destroy the Court. Subpoenas that turned up  nothing would be no harm, no foul. If there is nothing evil to see in  the information the subpoenas are pursuing, there is no harm. The  necessary logical predicate of the destroy-the-Court argument made by  our colleagues is that subpoenas would reveal that something truly  horrible happened at the Court that now needs to be covered up--covered  up.   But that is not how ``appearance of impropriety'' works. Justices of  the Supreme Court are supposed to avoid doing things that might create  even the appearance of impropriety. The appearance-of-impropriety issue  is not that you do impropriety and then go out and cover up its  appearance.   We also heard a lot that day about the problem of subpoenaing  ``private citizens,'' as if that were something unusual. If that is a  problem, it was a very new problem because just days before, the  committee had subpoenaed private citizens in the tech sector on a  bipartisan basis without anyone's objection.   As always, our Republican friends persisted in the argument that this  committee has no business looking at Supreme Court gift disclosures.  That argument was, is, and will always be a phony. The Judiciary  Committee has every right to oversee how an Agency that Congress  created--the Judicial Conference--is implementing a law that Congress  passed, the judicial disclosure law. It is within the jurisdiction of  the committee; it is a congressionally established body; and it is a  statute passed by Congress.   If Congress can't oversee how Agencies it creates oversee laws it  passes, there is no oversight left. Obviously, understanding what gifts  went undisclosed is essential to that inquiry.   We then heard that you can't have subpoenas because a related bill is  out of the committee. But Congress has every right to oversight and  subpoenas at any stage in legislation--and even at no stage in  legislation. Because the bill in question has not passed here in the  Senate--it has come to the Senate floor, but it has not passed in the  Senate--and because the Republicans not only stonewalled our  investigation but threatened very plainly a partisan blockade of the  bill here on the floor--``not a single Republican vote'' was, I think,  what they threatened--that makes it all the more obvious why continuing  to build the factual case for reform is appropriate. There is precisely  zero basis for the theory that a Senate committee can't look into a  subject of legislation once some related legislation is out of  committee. Preparing for a successful floor vote on that bill is only  one obvious reason why that theory is painfully wrong.   If you look at all of that noise and fuss that was put up, it is hard  not to deduce that maybe something else is going on here. Here is my  theory of the case, as I have said in previous speeches: Very powerful  rightwing billionaires spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars  on a scheme to influence--and even control--the Supreme Court. Those  very powerful rightwing billionaires are also massive funders of  Republican politics, including Republican Senate politics.   The problem is that those very powerful rightwing billionaires got  sloppy,  [[Page S6044]]  and their gift program to take care of certain Supreme Court Justices  started breaking gift and disclosure rules--very likely tax rules, as  well, with a few of the amenable Supreme Court Justices whom they were  rewarding with lavish entertainments.   What we already know about that gift program is bad enough. How far  the billionaires' hands are in the cookie jar and how coordinated and  orchestrated this secret gift program was is information that they  desperately want to suppress. So they do what megadonors do and  pressure Members of Congress to do what they want, and, in this case,  it was help the billionaires suppress the truth of what went down here.   I will close by observing that the argument that Democrats are  behaving improperly in our work to clean up the mess at the Supreme  Court is an argument that has some very powerful rebuttals.   The first rebuttal comes from the billionaires who are actually  cooperating with our investigation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  at the conclusion of my remarks as exhibits several letters reflecting  that cooperation: the first, dated July 25, 2023, to Chairman Durbin  and Senator Whitehouse; the second, dated Octobers 18, 2023, to  Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse; the third, dated October 31,  2023, to Senators Durbin and Whitehouse; the fourth, dated November 6,  2023, to Senators Durbin and Whitehouse; and the fifth, dated November  7, 2023, Dear Committee.   I would also note that another--yet another wealthy donor, not one of  these in the letters--yet another wealthy donor has cooperated with the  Finance Committee's investigation into the tax ramifications of all  these secret gifts and what was disclosed and what was not disclosed.  And that donor revealed to the Finance Committee compelling evidence  that he collected only interest--only interest--on a quarter-million- dollar-plus loan to Justice Thomas; that the donor never collected  any--any--principal payment; and that he ultimately stopped collecting  either interest or principal on that quarter-million-dollar-plus loan.   So the cooperation of people with our investigations rebut the  argument that we have no business. The second rebuttal comes, actually,  from within the Judiciary itself because this is not the only avenue we  are pursuing to get to the bottom of the mess at the Supreme Court.   When I got the Judicial Conference to review the Scalia trick, which  was to have intermediaries solicit dozens of personal invitations from  hunting resort owners, whom Scalia had often never even met, and then  failed to disclose the free vacations because, in his view, the  personal invitation made it personal hospitality, within the terms of  the disclosure statute--well, the members of the Judicial Conference-- the chief judges of the circuits and of district courts who together  comprised the Judicial Conference--those chief judges blew that trick  to smithereens. They didn't criticize me for being a bad Senator asking  bad questions and going places I shouldn't be going. They dropped the  hammer on the Scalia trick. They put a dead finish end to it.    And later, when I got the Judicial Conference to look at the  billionaire-funded flotillas of amicus briefs that they send in through  phony front groups to tell the Justices what it is that they want them  to do in cases and the phony front groups were not disclosing their  true funders or their true interconnections or their true  commonalities, again, this array of very distinguished chief judges  didn't look and say: Well, here is a Senator on an improper rampage. We  can't have any of this. No. They announced that they were revisiting  the amicus brief disclosure rule because it needed fixing, and they are  in the process of finalizing that right now. So two for two. When  questions related to this investigation have been taken up by the  Judicial Conference, they have actually been handled perfectly  consistent with the thrust and tenor of our investigation.   The third rebuttal that you will have to trust me on, I am afraid, is  that over and over, I have heard from Federal judges that this  investigation is important; that we are doing good work; and that we  should keep the pressure on and don't let up and get to the bottom of  this mess. I don't mean my home State judges, either. From all around  the country, I am getting messages of support from judges appointed by  Democratic and Republican Presidents that what has happened at the  Court is a disgrace and that I should keep at it; that the Judiciary  Committee should keep at it for the good and the health of the  judiciary itself.   By comparison, when you look at the frantic complaining about our  work, it mostly comes from a small handful of dark money mouthpieces  actually linked to the Court-capture scheme. Obviously, Mr. Rivkin, who  is Leonard Leo's lawyer, is out to blockade our investigation. So there  is one. He represents Leonard Leo against our investigation, and he  summoned Justice Alito to offer an opinion to his and Leonard Leo's  benefit in the pages of the Wall Street Journal editorial page.   Another voice is Leonard Leo's painting pal--you may remember this  painting that was done at Harlan Crowe's Adirondack estate with  billionaire Crowe, Justice Thomas, and Leonard Leo, the Court fixer.  Well, also there is painting pal Mark Paoletta. He is another  persistent voice; and he couldn't be more in the scheme than that  painting shows.   Also, Carrie Severino turns up. She is Leonard Leo's dark money  sidekick-successor at the dark money funded Federalist Society and the  dark money funded fictitious name group, Judicial Crisis Network.   And then, of course, there is the Wall Street Journal editorial page  whose people have received a million dollars in personal cash from the  dark money Bradley Foundation at the middle of that dark money amicus  flotilla. At attorney Rivkin's request that I mentioned, Justice Alito  even provided a cameo performance in the Wall Street Journal editorial  page that defended the position of his friend Leonard Leo in plain  violation of multiple judicial ethics guidelines.   All that Rivkin-Leo-Alito stunt--Wall Street Journal editorial page  stunt--needed was Paoletta and Severino to make it a clean sweep of all  the major mouthpieces.   Steering away from troublesome facts is a constant theme in the mess  we are trying to dig into over at the Court. In the January 6 and  Arizona cases, what Justice Thomas knew about his wife's insurrection  activities and when he knew it is the salient question about recusal.  He has never been asked. What made Justice Alito say that in that Wall  Street Journal editorial, attorney Rivkin was acting just as an  interviewer and not as Leonard Leo's lawyer, even though Rivkin was  under contract to Leonard Leo as his lawyer at that time? That question  has never been asked. What became of Thomas' quarter-million-dollar  loan, and why was it not reported? That question has never been asked.  What made Justice Alito think that he should suddenly start answering  legal questions likely to come before the Court in the pages of the  Wall Street Journal editorial page, despite every Justice in their  confirmation hearing saying: That is inappropriate? That question has  never been asked.   What made Thomas think the Judicial Conference action that I  described--blowing the Scalia trick to smithereens--was a change in the  rules and not a clarification of the rules? That question has never  been asked. But it is a question that matters because the Judicial  Conference actually called it a clarification and Thomas' lawyers  treated it as a change. And the difference is this: If it is a change  in the law, you don't have to go back and clean up your prior  incomplete and false filings. If it is a clarification, you have to go  back and clean up your prior defective filings.   So to say that this was a change despite the fact the Judicial  Conference said it was a clarification is a very significant legal  leap; and no justification for it was offered at the time or has been  proposed since.   In all of these matters, the common theme is that factfinding--the  very basis of due process--factfinding is not performed around the  Supreme Court Justices. Factfinding, despite being the essence of due  process, this Court avoids like the plague.   All of this--the behavior of our friends in the committee, the  cooperation and support from billionaires and judges and others, the  mischief of not  [[Page S6045]]  answering basic fact questions--all of it signals that there is a lot  going on here; that there is a lot to investigate; and that our  investigation must and will continue.   To be continued.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              Erickson | Sederstrom,                                                Attorneys at Law,                                                      July 25, 2023.      Re Response to Letter Dated July 11, 2023, to Robin P.           Arkley, II, Our File No.: 00018.010802.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts Oversights, Agency           Action and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse: We write this       letter on behalf of Robin P. Arkley, II in response to your       letter dated July 11, 2023, which requested information       concerning Mr. Arkley's interactions with Supreme Court       Justices. While we respect the Senate Committee's oversight       role, we believe that this inquiry exceeds the limits placed       on the legislature by the Constitution. For our stated       reasons, we refer you to the relevant portions of the letter       dated July 25, 2023, from Baker & Hostetler directed to you       on behalf of Mr. Leo.        Thank you very much.            Sincerely,      Samuel E. Clark.                                   ____                                              Erickson | Sederstrom,                                                Attorneys at Law,                                                   October 18, 2023.      Re Response to Letter Dated July 11, 2023, to Robin P.           Arkley, II, Our File No.: 00018.010802.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts Oversights, Agency           Action and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin and Senator Whitehouse: This letter is       written in response to your letter dated October 5, 2023.        Mr. Arkley reaffirms his position that, as a private       citizen whose hospitality was wholly unrelated to the       business of the Supreme Court, there is no legislative       purpose that requires him to report the same to your       Committee. If the law required or should require a government       official to report hospitality or travel, that certainly does       not apply to Mr. Arkley, and you should take the matter up       with that official.        Your request that Mr. Arkley further provide the names of       friends to whom he might have provided hospitality is without       purpose and suggests that presence at a private social       occasion at which no official public business was discussed       or undertaken somehow subjects one to congressional scrutiny.       This is an unreasonable affront on a citizen's privacy.        Mr. Arkley is not accused of violating any laws, has no       disclosure duties, and has nothing to add beyond what has       already been reported in the press. We must respectfully       decline to respond to your request for the names and       circumstances surrounding his personal hospitality.            Sincerely,      Samuel E. Clark.                                   ____                                                 GreenbergTraurig,                                                   October 31, 2023.      Re Response to September 14, 2023 Letter to Paul Anthony           Novelly.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency           Action, and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Durbin and Whitehouse: We write on behalf of       our client Paul Anthony Novelly in response to your letters       dated September 14, 2023 requesting information regarding       ``gifts, payments or items of value exceeding $415'' provided       by Mr. Novelly or his affiliated Companies to ``any Justice       of the Supreme Court or member of the Justice's family.''       Your letter sought a response no later than September 27,       2023. Your Committee staff members subsequentjy granted an       extension until October 31, 2023.        To begin with, we are aware of no evidence that Mr. Novelly       or his affiliated Companies, gave anything to anyone as       specifically defined in your letter or engaged in any       transactions with those identified in your letter that were       unusual, inappropriate, improper or contrary to law. In       particular, any claims made by what your letter characterized       as ``investigative reporting'' sources regarding the presence       of Justice Clarence Thomas on a yacht owned by Mr. Novelly       travelling in the Bahamas are false. Mr. Novelly is not aware       of any basis whatsoever to support any suggestion or claim of       yacht trips or vacations provided by him to Justice Thomas.        Furthermore, and with due respect, we do not concede that       the Committee has the authority, constitutional or otherwise,       to seek the information sought in its September 14th letters       or to compel production or compliance by Mr. Novelly. We       explicitly reserve any and all rights Mr. Novelly may have to       object to such requests.        Nevertheless, in the interest of cooperation and to       minimize the further expenditure of time and money, below is       a description of the two instances where we are informed that       Mr. Novelly provided something of ``value'' to Justice Thomas       as defined by and requested in your letter that Mr. Novelly's       staff was able to locate.        1. August 22, 2016--a one-way return flight from Jackson       Hole, Wyoming to Washington, D.C. by Justice Thomas, his wife       and Senator Joseph Manchin and his wife, who were dropped off       in Charleston, West Virginia after attending a social       function attended by a number of members of the Horatio Alger       Association among others, including Terrence Giroux, the       Executive Director of the Horatio Alger Association, who was       also a passenger on the flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming to       Washington, D.C.;        2. March 30, 2018--a one-way flight, by Justice Thomas and       his security detail from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida to       Washington D.C. The Justice and Mr. Novelly were attending       the funeral services for a mutual friend and Horatio Alger       Association member.        These airplane trips are the sole instances of which Mr.       Novelly and his staff are aware that may be responsive to       your requests.        We trust that Mr. Novelly's voluntary cooperation and       provision of this information will end any further inquiry of       Mr. Novelly.            Respectfully submitted,                                                   Dennis J. Block,      On behalf of Paul Anthony Novelly.                                   ____                                              Erickson | Sederstrom,                                                Attorneys at Law,                                                   November 6, 2023.      Re Response Robin P. Arkley, II.       Hon. Richard Durbin,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Federal Courts Oversights, Agency           Action and Federal Rights, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Durbin and Whitehouse: Mr. Arkley has asked       that I provide you additional information in response to your       letter of July 11, 2023.        In response to your request for a list of any gifts,       payments and items of value exceeding $415, and all       transportation or lodging given by Mr. Arkley, or by entities       owned or controlled by him, or for which he has served as a       partner, director, or officer, to any Justice of the Supreme       Court or a member of the Justice's family, he recalls only       two items, which have both already been reported on:        In 2008, Justice Samuel Alito attended a fishing trip and       stayed at King Salmon Lodge (``Lodge'') in King Salmon,       Alaska. The Lodge was owned by Mr. Arkley's company, Security       National Master Holding Company (``Company''). For the period       of time that the Company owned the Lodge, Mr. Arkley hosted       dozens of employees and friends. He sold the Lodge more than       a decade ago.        In addition to a number of friends he invited who were       personal friends from his hometown or from college, Mr.       Arkley also invited Mr. Leonard Leo, a friend through his       association with the Federalist Society. After one of his       conversations with Leonard, Mr. Arkley invited a number of       Mr. Leo's friends to join the trip, including Justice Samuel       Alito, Judge Ray Randolph, Mr. Paul Singer, and Mr. John       Fund. To the best of Mr. Arkley's recollection, the trip       lasted three or four nights. As he had done with other       friends and guests who stayed at the Lodge, Mr. Arkley       covered the expenses for the lodging, meals, and costs       associated with the fishing expeditions.        Mr. Arkley did not provide Justice Alito transportation to       or from the Lodge.        In 2005, Mr. Arkley invited Mr. Leo and Justice Antonin       Scalia on a fishing trip in Alaska, in addition to inviting a       number of friends from his hometown and college. His       recollection is that he provided air travel on his private       aircraft for Justice Scalia and Mr. Leo from the continental       United States to Alaska. To the best of Mr. Arkley's       recollection, they stayed at the Karluk Lodge and fished in       the Karluk River. As the fishing was poor, they travelled to       the Situk River to fish and stayed at another lodge. The trip       was four to five days, and Mr. Arkley paid all expenses for       those who were his guests on this trip.        With respect to your requests for the itinerary or costs       associated with these trips, Mr. Arkley does not have that       information. The private aircraft owned by the Company during       the relevant period was sold ten years ago and records of its       use are unavailable. Further, in accordance with industry       standards, the Company has had a long-standing retention       policy, originally adopted in 2008, that requires all       records, not subject to litigation holds, be disposed of       after seven years. As these two trips occurred well after       that timeframe, no company records exist. Mr. Arkley also       does not have any personal records regarding these two trips.        These are the only two items that are relevant to your       request for information.        While we continue to believe the Committee's request for       this information exceeds its constitutional authority, as set       forth in letters of July 25, 2023, and October 18, 2023. Mr.  [[Page S6046]]       Arkley has provided this information in an effort to be       cooperative and put this matter behind him. I trust that this       does so. Nevertheless, we reserve all rights to object to the       Committee's request for any additional information.        Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,      Samuel E. Clark.                                   ____                                                   November 7, 2023.        Dear Committee: I have reviewed the letter dated November       6, 2023, prepared and signed by my counsel, Samuel Clark. The       letter reflects my recollection of the individuals and dates       of the fishing trips. Any other contact that I may have had       with the relevant individual referenced in your July 11, 2023       letter does not fall within the scope of your request,       including that I have not provided any gift over the $415       threshold to any relevant person.        In order to refresh my recollection and to provide the       requested information, my staff searched for any responsive       records. As my counsel noted in his letter, my company has a       retention policy in place that requires the disposal of all       records, not subject to any litigation hold, after 7 years.       Thus, there are no responsive records. Additionally, I       searched my records and found no responsive records.            Sincerely,                                                Robin P. Arkley II.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
