 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Long County Deputy Sheriff Sheldon Whiteman, who died in the line of  duty on January 23 at the age of 44.   Deputy Whiteman was assisting in a vehicle pursuit in the First  Congressional District of Georgia when his vehicle left the roadway.  Deputy Whiteman had been with the Long County Sheriff's Office for only  4 months at the time of the incident.   Previously, Deputy Whiteman worked with the Chatham County Police  Department and was a POST Certified Peace Officer since 2016.   Deputy Whiteman is survived by his wife, Alisa Ann, and his three  sons.   It is, unfortunately, times like these when we remember the risks  that our law enforcement officers take every day that they put on their  uniforms. I encourage everyone to take some time to thank our law  enforcement officers for the work they do to keep our communities safe.   Deputy Whiteman's family and friends, as well as the Long County and  Chatham County police departments will be in my thoughts and prayers  during these most difficult times.
