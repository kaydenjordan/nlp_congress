 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  extraordinary San Diegan and World War II veteran, U.S. Navy Commander  William ``Bill'' Vogt. Bill passed away in February, at the age of 107,  and will be laid to rest at Miramar National Cemetery today.   Bill served with honor and distinction as an intelligence officer for  nearly 30 years and was, according to Navy records, the oldest living  U.S. military officer.   Bill joined the U.S. Navy Reserve in 1940 and was called to Active  Duty on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. His  first assignment was to the District Intelligence Office covering the  southern coast of California. There, he searched for submarine activity  and intercepted Nazi mail bound for Mexico and sent summaries of it up  the chain of command.   He served in Guam, where he headed an operation that led to the  surrender of the last two Japanese army holdouts, who had hidden in the  jungles there since the U.S. landings in 1944.   Later, Bill served in the Pentagon as an intelligence watch officer  during the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1969, during  his last tour of duty in San Diego, William debriefed sailors of the  USS Pueblo after they had been held captive in North Korea for 11  months.   At one point during his remarkable career, during a time of  significant labor unrest, Bill was contacted by Roy Cohn, Senator  Joseph McCarthy's lawyer. Cohn asked Bill to conduct domestic spying in  support of McCarthy's anti-Communist hearings. Bill viewed the request  as illegal and refused it, and he refused to turn over the files Cohn  wanted on the Longshoreman's Union. Then, and until the very end, Bill  Vogt was a fierce defender of our Constitution.   Bill was one of the first students to attend San Diego State  University and lived to be its oldest known graduate. In 1934, he  completed his degree in commerce.   The Nation was in the midst of the Great Depression, so Bill set off  immediately to begin working and so never received his official  diploma. Eighty-four years after earning it, San Diego State President  Adela de la Torre presented it to him at the age of 105.   Bill met his beloved wife, Lillian, in Coronado, and they were  married for 67 years. He is survived by his son, Bob; his daughter,  Michelle; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. Bob  described his father as a ``best friend, a hero, and a role model.''   Bob wrote to me in 2019 and told me his father lived near me and  wanted to spend some time talking about his country with his  Congressman and have a drink. It was an honor to spend some time with  Bill, to raise a glass with this great American.   Still sharp at 106, with somewhat diminished hearing, I must say, he  shared stories from his extraordinary military career. He showed me his  collection of books about history and politics, and he told me of his  deep concern over the state of our democracy. He urged me to keep  fighting to protect it and to never give up the fight. He still had  not.   Bill Vogt represented the best of San Diego and the best of America.  On behalf of a grateful Nation, we thank him and wish him and his  family fair winds and following seas.                            ____________________
