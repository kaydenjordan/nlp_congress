 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7240, the  READ Act Reauthorization Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill, I authored  with Africa Subcommittee Ranking Member Chris Smith, is a  straightforward reauthorization of the Reinforcing Education  Accountability in Development (READ) Act of 2017, which was signed into  law in the 115th Congress.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 19, 2022, on page H7900, in the first column, the  following appeared: Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time Mr BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7240,  the READ Act Reauthorization Act of 2022. This      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  yield back the balance of my time  Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 7240, the READ Act Reauthorization Act of  2022. This    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The original READ Act required a five-year Comprehensive Strategy to  equitably expand access to basic education for children around the  globe and measurably improve the quality of basic education and  learning outcomes in literacy, numeracy, and other basic skills that  prepare an individual to be an active, productive member of society and  the workforce.   The READ Act Reauthorization Act, which passed the Committee on  Foreign Affairs by voice vote, would extend the original authorization  by an additional five years. I have also worked closely with the  authors of the original READ Act, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin and  Senator Marco Rubio, who have introduced companion legislation in the  Senate as S. 3938.   As implemented in the READ Act, it is the policy of the United States  Government to work with partner countries, other donors, multilateral  institutions, the private sector, and nongovernmental and civil society  organizations, including faith-based organizations, to promote quality  basic education through programs and activities.   Since the READ Act's implementation, we have begun to see significant  progress in building the foundational skills necessary for students to  thrive and succeed in their educational endeavors. For example, in FY  2021 alone, U.S. basic education programs reached more than 33.4  million pre-primary, primary, and secondary students in 73 countries  and more than one million additional individuals with tertiary,  vocational, and other workforce training.   The READ Act also required the President to submit a comprehensive  integrated United States strategy to promote basic education. The U.S.  Government Strategy on International Basic Education for Fiscal Years  2016-2023 emerged from this effort and was designed to promote basic  education in partner countries for all children, particularly children  from vulnerable groups, including women and children, and measurably  improve the quality of basic education and the achievement of key  learning outcomes. The strategy has been carried out by the United  States Agency for International Development (USAID), through a Senior  Coordinator of International Basic Education, since 2017.   Since the launch of the USG Strategy on International Basic Education  in 2018, agencies and departments have: Created harmonized indicators  and streamlined yearly reporting to Congress; Launched the first  international basic education website that includes information across  all U.S. agencies involved in supporting basic education worldwide; And  has increased coordination among U.S. federal agencies and departments  by establishing a process for sharing research, tools, and resources to  better leverage taxpayer dollars.   Although the READ Act has seen initial success, our partners at USAID  and other Federal agencies require time to update the current Strategy  and adapt it to new and emerging issues in global education, such as  the COVID-19 pandemic which closed schools and resulted in learning  loss around the world.   USAID has already begun consulting implementing partners and think  tanks at the working and local levels to update the Strategy, and they  plan to have a full rollout by September. This update will focus on  equitable learning outcomes and joint reporting on global learning  poverty from COVID-19 among other issues.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has received bipartisan and bicameral  support, backing from USAID (which implements the Strategy) as well as  endorsements from 38 international education organizations. I ask my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this  important reauthorization measure.
