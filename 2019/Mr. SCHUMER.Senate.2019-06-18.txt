 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I speak in  leader time.    Mr. President, last night, the Defense Department  announced that 1,000 additional troops would be deployed to the Middle  East. This is the second deployment of 1,000 or more troops in the past  30 days, ostensibly to deal with Iran's increased activity in the  region.   Despite these two announcements, the President has yet to address the  Nation about these developments. The President has yet to articulate a  strategy about American involvement in the region. He has yet to send a  single military commander to testify before the Armed Services  Committee. And he has yet to explain what his policy of ``maximum  pressure'' on Iran is supposed to achieve. All we have heard is the  Secretary of State, our chief diplomat, rattling the sabers of war.   As U.S. troops again prepare to deploy to the Middle East, this  administration has an obligation to explain to the American people  exactly what is happening and why. If they have a case, they must make  it public. Americans are rightly skeptical and tired of endless wars in  the Middle East--a reticence that many on the Republican side don't  seem to share. Americans know that smaller actions have a tendency to  escalate into larger actions even when there is no congressional  authority and no check.   The administration has offered to send various officials to give  classified briefings, but, frankly, that is not nearly good enough. We  have learned a hard truth from our experience in Iraq--that the drums  of war start beating behind closed doors. The President must make his  pitch to the Nation instead of another closed-door meeting with  Senators. As the Commander in Chief, he owes that to every American but  especially to the American servicemembers, and their families, whom he  is sending into the Middle East.
