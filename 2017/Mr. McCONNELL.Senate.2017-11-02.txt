 Mr. President, the Senate continues to press forward  confirming President Trump's outstanding nominations to the Federal  courts. Already this week, we have confirmed two strong, smart, and  talented women to serve on our Nation's circuit courts. Today we will  consider two more well-qualified nominees: Allison Eid and Stephanos  Bibas.   First, we will confirm Allison Eid, whom the President has nominated  to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Justice  Eid has big shoes to fill in taking that seat--it became vacant when  Neil Gorsuch ascended to the Supreme Court. It is a hard act to follow.  Yet I have every confidence she will excel in the role. You see,  nominees such as Justice Eid and Professor Bibas are more than just the  sum of their credentials--although theirs are indeed impressive, and I  will expand on those credentials in just a moment--nominees such as  these also believe, like Justice Gorsuch, that the role of a judge is  to apply the law equally to everyone and to do so as the law is  actually written, not as they wish it might be.   As Judge Gorsuch said, ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches  is very likely a bad judge--stretching for results he prefers rather  than those the law demands,'' or, put a different way, ``I don't think  there are red judges, and I don't think there are blue judges. All  judges wear black.'' That is the view of Neil Gorsuch. That is the view  of Allison Eid and Stephanos Bibas. That is just the kind of fair- minded judge we want serving on the bench and just the kind of fair- minded judge we are confirming this week, including the exceptional  nominees before us.   Justice Allison Eid graduated from the University of Chicago Law  School with high honors. She earned the opportunity to clerk for Fifth  Circuit Judge Jerry E. Smith and then for Justice Clarence Thomas  before joining the faculty of the University of Colorado School of Law,  where she served as a professor for our colleague Senator Gardner. When  he introduced his former professor before the Judiciary Committee,  Senator Gardner noted how much she cared about ``robust debates and  hearing the views of others.''   ``Justice Eid,'' he said, ``was open to their views, engaging with  them, and [was] never biased against different perspectives.''   Later, Justice Eid was appointed to serve as Colorado's solicitor  general and, in 2006, to the Colorado Supreme Court. Two years later,  75 percent of Coloradans voted to retain her. Her time on the State's  high court has been marked by clear and precise writing and judicial  independence.   One of Justice Eid's former clerks wrote a column in the Denver Post  in support of her nomination. As a jurist, this clerk wrote, ``Eid  commits her full mental energy and attention to each case, carefully  mastering every legal and factual detail in order to conduct a rigorous  analysis dictated ultimately by the law.'' In addition, this former  clerk added a personal touch to Justice Eid's incredible resume:         For women striving to achieve that elusive balance between       family life and a successful career, it can be hard to find       strong role models. But Colorado's Allison Eid is a shining       example.    Justice Eid is clearly well qualified for the position to which she  has been nominated. She is just the kind of fair-minded judge people  would want hearing their case. I look forward to supporting her  nomination today, and I ask each of my colleagues to join me in  confirming the nomination of this extremely well qualified jurist.   I would ask them to join me in supporting Professor Bibas too.  Professor Bibas has served as assistant U.S. attorney. He has  experience in private practice. He has clerked for a circuit court  judge and for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Today he is a  professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where,  according to the former dean of students, he ``enjoys  [[Page S6976]]  the give and take of discussion'' and is ``very fair, considerate, and  encouraging.''   Moreover, as a bipartisan group of more than 100 law professors put  it in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Professor Bibas's ``fair- mindedness, conscientiousness, and personal integrity are beyond  question,'' and in their view, ``his judicial temperament will reflect  these qualities and . . . he will faithfully discharge his duty to  apply the law fairly and evenhandedly in all matters before him.''   Professor Bibas also reminded us that he, like Justice Gorsuch and  Justice Eid, believes in a fair-minded approach to the law. In his  words, ``People need to know and believe that judges will apply the law  impartially and evenhandedly to all litigants, regardless of their  wealth or power.'' He is right. Let's join together in supporting him  today.   I would like to once again thank Judiciary Committee Chairman  Grassley for all his work to bring these impressive nominees to the  floor. Together with the President, we will continue working hard to  put judges on the Federal courts who will uphold the law as it is  written, not as they wish it were.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the Obama years were  not easy for America's middle class. For many, steady work became  harder to find, paychecks stagnated, and opportunities faded. America's  middle class deserves better after a decade of drift, and we are  working hard to deliver for them.   Tax reform is the single most important thing we can do today to get  the economy reaching for its true potential again. That is why the  Senate recently passed the legislative tools to advance it. That is why  the House recently did the same. And because we did, later today, after  months of hard work, the House's tax-writing committee will unveil its  version of tax reform legislation.   I commend Chairman Brady and the members of the Ways and Means  Committee for their hard work in unveiling this critical legislation  today. This announcement is more positive momentum from our colleagues  over in the House, and I look forward to continued work with them as we  move forward. Here in the Senate, the Finance Committee will continue  its work on tax reform legislation as well.   Both Chambers are working on this at full steam because we are  committed to achieving our mutual tax reform goals for the middle  class, working families, and small businesses. Our main goal is this:  We want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in  yours. This goal is shared by the American people, it is shared by the  President and his team, and it is shared by Republicans in the House  and in the Senate.   The goals of tax reform used to be shared by our Democratic  colleagues as well. Over many years, multiple Senate Democrats,  including the Democratic leader himself, have called on Congress to  pass reform. But then something changed. It was the President who  changed, it seems.   Now we are reading reports that our friends across the aisle plan to  oppose any tax reform bill at all, regardless of what is in it. It  seems that Democratic leadership is praying that this chance to put  more money in the pockets of the middle class will not succeed. But  why? To protect incentives and encourage companies to ship jobs  overseas? I thought they were against those. To prevent working  families from keeping more of what they earn? I assumed we were all for  that. According to recent news reporting, Democrats apparently want to  tank tax cuts for the middle class because it might give them a  political leg up. In other words, it seems that this is some kind of  game to them.   I certainly hope what we read is not true. I certainly hope Democrats  will take note of the fact that their latest false talking point about  tax reform just got debunked today as well. This effort is way too  important for any of that. I hope our friends will decide to work with  our colleagues in a serious way instead. That is what their  constituents sent them here to do, and that is what their constituents  deserve after the last decade of economic disappointment. There is no  reason for our Democratic friends not to work across the aisle in a  serious way to help shape this critically important effort.   I thank Chairman Hatch and Chairman Brady for their commitment to tax  reform and regular order. Through the committee process, Members on  both sides of the aisle will have the opportunity to offer input as the  tax reform effort advances. Today's announcement is an important step  forward for that process, as well as for our once-in-a-generation  opportunity to fundamentally rethink our Tax Code and deliver real  relief. It has been 30 years since we did that. It is time to do it  again.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
