 Mr. Speaker, allowing the NFIP to expire is simply not  an option. It would be catastrophic on financial markets. But more  importantly, for that family sitting around the table, it would be  catastrophic.   Chairman Hensarling and Majority Whip Scalise had a good reform bill,  but the Senate needs to act. Until that happens, we have to reauthorize  this, so that the next hurricane doesn't have a devastating effect on  the economy and families.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
