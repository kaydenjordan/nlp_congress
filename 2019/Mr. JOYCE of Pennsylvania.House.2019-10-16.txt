 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a  concerning issue. The chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence, whom House Democrats have chosen to lead their sham  impeachment inquiry process, has brazenly misled the American people  and has hidden the truth.   Chairman Schiff must be held accountable for his actions, and this  body must take a vote on H. Res. 630. As House Democrats pursue their  partisan impeachment inquiry and clandestine Soviet-style hearings,  this majority has proven that they cannot be trusted to act with  integrity.   If House Democrats want to impeach President Trump, they should do so  in a transparent, nonpartisan process. The American people won't be  fooled by these cheap tricks. It is time to restore order and decorum  to this House.                            ____________________
