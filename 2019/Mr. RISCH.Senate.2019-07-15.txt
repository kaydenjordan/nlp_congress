POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Government of Germany--Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missiles                              Segment Enhanced         The Government of Germany has requested to buy fifty (50)       Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missiles Segment       Enhanced (MSE). Also included are PAC-3 MSE launcher       conversion kits; Missile Round Trainers (MRTs); Empty Round       Trainers (ERTs); Launcher Stations (LS) heater controllers;       PAC-3 ground support equipment; concurrent spare parts;       documentation and publications; PAC-3 MSE shorting plugs;       Quality Assurance Team; missile canister consumables; missile       skid kits; PAC-3 MSE repair and return; missile Field       Surveillance Program (FSP) for PAC-3 MSE; U.S. Government       transportation; MSE launcher spare parts; PAC-3/MSE GMT kits;       MSE DC motor kits; targets; Telemetry; U.S. Government range       support; MSE flight test support; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering; technical and logistics support       services; and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The total estimated value is $401 million.        This proposed sale will support to the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a NATO ally, which is an important force for       political and economic stability in Europe. It is vital to       U.S. national interests to assist our German ally in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        The proposed sale will enhance Germany's capability to       maintain the largest air defense capacity in Europe. The       purchase of these additional missiles will allow Germany to       build a more robust air defense capability and increase its       air lethality against air defense threats. This purchase also       assist Germany with its NATO commitments. Germany will have       no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Dallas, TX.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require       additional contractor representatives to travel to Germany.       It is not expected additional U.S. Government personnel will       be required in country for an extended period of time.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-42       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The PATRIOT Air Defense System contains classified       CONFIDENTIAL hardware components, SECRET tactical software       and critical/sensitive technology. The Patriot Advanced       Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE)       hardware is classified CONFIDENTIAL and the associated       launcher hardware is UNCLASSIFIED. The PAC-3 MSE is a high       velocity, hit-to-kill, surface-to-air missile that provides       critical air and missile defense by intercepting and       destroying Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM), Air-Breathing       Threats (ABT), cruise missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Systems       (UAS).        2. The PAC-3 MSE sensitive/critical technology is primarily       in the area of design and production know-how and primarily       inherent in the design, development and/or manufacturing data       related to certain components. The list of components is       classified CONFIDENTIAL.        3. Information on system performance capabilities,       effectiveness, survivability, missile seeker capabilities,       select software/software documentation and test data are       classified up to and including SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that the recipient country       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Germany.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
