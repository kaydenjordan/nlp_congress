 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to explain my opposition and vote  against the bill that was on the floor earlier today, H.R. 1423, the  Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act. I would like to highlight its  negative impact on financial services.   Financial services providers and their customers use arbitration to  settle disputes because it is easier, faster, and less costly for  consumers than litigation. Forcing parties into litigation would  dramatically extend the time before a customer is made whole and would  significantly increase legal fees for all parties.   These increased costs are ultimately passed along to consumers  through higher fees and fewer options, and they would negatively impact  any American who has a bank account, credit card, or retirement plan.  We have had that debate before.   Dodd-Frank directed that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  promulgate a rule on mandatory arbitration. While Congress overturned  that rule in 2017 because it would adversely impact consumers, the  Obama administration's own study found that the average consumer  receives approximately $5,400 through arbitration and only $32 through  a class action lawsuit. That means the average customer who prevailed  in arbitration received 166 times more than the average class member in  class action settlements.   Mr. Speaker, my time has expired, but I would urge opposition to this  wrongheaded idea in the United States Senate.                                time  1200                 RECOGNIZING BURMA BEAL'S 100TH BIRTHDAY
