Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 542, the Elizabeth Dole  Home- and Community-Based Services for Veterans and Caregivers Act of  2023, or the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023, as amended.   The bill is a pivotal piece of legislation aimed at transforming the  landscape of long-term care for our Nation's veterans. I commend  Representative Brownley for her bipartisan work with me on it.   Veterans, like all Americans, are living longer. This requires the  Veterans Administration to adapt to this evolving veteran population to  ensure that eligible veterans entering their later years have access to  long-term care that meets their needs.   As of fiscal year 2022, approximately 3.1 million veterans, roughly  half of VA's active patient population, were 65 years or older. These  veterans, often older, sicker, and poorer than the general population,  and often residing in rural areas, demand a tailored approach to  healthcare.   Veterans want to remain at home for care, avoiding admission to long- term care facilities. This preference is not only understandable but  becomes imperative given the current challenges with long-term care  facilities and limited admissions nationwide.   By expanding VA's noninstitutional long-term care services through  Representative Brownley's and my bill, we would allow aging and  disabled veterans the option of staying in their homes. Institutional  care can be reserved for veterans who truly need intensive round-the- clock care and services.   While many States have shifted investments from institutional to  home- and community-based care, VA has not kept pace. The lack of a  statutory mandate has led to inconsistent availability of home- and  community-based services, leaving many veterans underserved simply  based on where they live. That is unacceptable.   Veterans and veteran service organizations have consistently urged VA  to focus on expanding access to home- and community-based services to  allow veterans to age comfortably and safely in place.   The Veterans' Affairs Committee answered these demands head-on, and  we held numerous hearings on the issue and focused on equitable long- term care access. Our bill would also rightfully eliminate the annual  cap on noninstitutional care to include greater flexibility in meeting  the needs of veterans living with ALS or spinal cord injuries, for  example.   Under current law, these veterans are often forced into institutional  care simply because funding cannot be provided for home care. This bill  would ensure availability of all programs, such as veteran-directed  care, homemaker home health aide, home-based primary care, and  purchased skilled home care at all VA medical centers.   In addition to expanding access, the Dole Act urges the VA to take a  more active role in helping veterans and their caregivers navigate the  multiple options that may be available to them as they consider long- term care.   It is no secret that the Nation is facing a shortage of qualified  professionals capable of taking on the tasks required by home- or  community-based care.   Representative Brownley's and my bill would create a pilot program to  bring in more professionals to serve veterans through homemaker and  home health services.   Finally, I want to emphasize that we are committed to fiscal  responsibility and have identified an offset to fully fund these  programs that will ultimately address the pressing needs of America's  aging veteran population.   The Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act of 2023 is a pledge to ensure  veterans receive the care they deserve, preserving their dignity and  independence, whether they are catastrophically disabled or in the  twilight of their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank Representative Brownley for her  dedication to this issue and her bipartisan work with me on this  legislation.  [[Page H6101]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  letter from 46 organizations, including all of the major veterans  service organizations, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, and many other  groups, and I thank them for their dedication to caring for and serving  veterans.    Mr. Speaker, while we are considering this bill today, I  would remind my colleagues that this legislation is also a part of a  comprehensive veterans package being negotiated between the House and  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the days  ahead to collectively advance not only this legislation, but many other  proposals that support the interests and the well-being of all  veterans.   Finally, I thank the numerous veteran service organization partners  who have worked with us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 542, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I strongly encourage all  Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3581) to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify the  family caregiver program of the Department of Veterans Affairs to  include services related to mental health and neurological disorders,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3581         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 6. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``March 12,       2032''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on H.R. 3581, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3581, as amended, the  Caregiver Outreach and Program Enhancement Act, or COPE Act.   Representative Kiggans' COPE Act would allow for grant awards  expanding access to mental health counseling, treatment, or support to  caregivers of veterans participating in the Program of Comprehensive  Assistance for Family Caregivers.   VA's caregiver program provides caregivers of seriously ill or  injured veterans with resources and services to help them with the  important role they play in their veterans' lives.   Becoming a veteran caregiver is a noble undertaking and caregivers  often put their entire lives aside in pursuit of caring for their loved  ones. Mental health support is an important component of the caregiver  program, but too often caregivers are reluctant to seek care at VA.   Whether it is because of stigma, not wanting to take provider  resources away from veteran care, or the fear that seeking mental  health care may in some way jeopardize their standing as a caregiver,  caregivers should have access to every option without barriers.   The 3-year pilot program the COPE Act would create would expand  caregiver mental health access to outside of VA. Ensuring caregiver  wellness is critical to ensuring the highest quality of care for the  veterans caregivers serve.   This new pilot program is an important next step in continuing to  meet caregiver needs. Representative Kiggans' bill would also allow VA  to assist local and State authorities with funding help for the  mitigation of flood risk on non-VA property that may be adjacent to VA  facilities. Many VA medical facilities are at least 60 years old. Some  of these facilities have, over the years and due to locations in low- lying areas, been subject to flooding that impact veteran and staff  access or even threatens building function.   Flood preparedness is a prudent focus for all VA facilities that are  historically at risk of flooding from storms or from water  encroachment. It is important that VA has the means to work with local  authorities on issues that impact the operation of its facilities.   Finally, this bill would require a review and report to Congress on  the security environment at VA facilities. We know that crime has been  increasing at VA campuses, and while VA claims it has reworked its  policing structure and hired a record number of officers, our committee  lacks the data needed for proper oversight.   Veterans and the staff that support them need to be confident that  the facilities they use are safe places to receive care and seek  benefits.   This review will go a long way toward identifying ways to enhance  safety and improve security within the Veterans Administration  buildings and campuses.   I thank Representatives Kiggans and Mace, both members of the  committee,  [[Page H6105]]  for their work on the various elements of this bill and for their  unwavering commitment to the veterans we serve.   Additionally, to maintain our commitment to fiscal responsibility, we  have identified an offset and fully funded this bill to ensure the best  possible outcome for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 3581, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Kiggans), an esteemed colleague, distinguished naval  officer, and nurse practitioner.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all Members to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
