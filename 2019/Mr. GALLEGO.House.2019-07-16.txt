 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in proud support of the amendment  sponsored by fellow marine and public servant, Mr. Pence.   October 23, 1983, remains seared in the memory of all marines. On  that day, over 300 innocent people were killed in a surprise terrorist  attack sponsored by the Government of Iran. Most of the people killed  36 years ago were my brothers. They were U.S. marines. They were  serving our country and doing their best to preserve the peace in war- torn Lebanon.   We know that the wheels of justice turn slowly, Madam Chair. It took  over 35 years for victims to get traction in U.S. courts. But now that  they are getting that traction and winning judgments, marines in  Congress are here to help to ensure that Iranian funds cannot be hidden  from them in secret foreign bank accounts.   This amendment helps the families of those killed and wounded by  making sure that Iran is held liable for this attack. It makes it  harder for Iran to hide money in overseas bank accounts when it should  be paying for the pain and suffering of its victims. It shows that,  even 36 years after the attack, we have not forgotten, and it once  again proves that U.S. marines remain ``no better friend, no worse  enemy.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
