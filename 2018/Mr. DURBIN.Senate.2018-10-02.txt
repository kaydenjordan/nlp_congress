 Madam President, what is the business before the Senate?    I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.    Madam President, I have been in politics for a long time,  but I have never seen anything like what I witnessed when I went back  to Chicago last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. From the minute the plane  landed at Midway Airport in Chicago through the entire weekend,  everyone--everyone--was engaged. People were coming up to me--total  strangers--expressing themselves about the hearing that had just been  completed with Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I was stunned, and I have  done this for a long time. There was the doorman in the rain holding an  umbrella at the hotel talking about what he heard and what he  remembered from the hearing. The taxicab driver, the person on the  street--everyone wanted to speak to me about this.   It has been estimated that 6 out of 10 Americans listened or watched  the hearing last week. I am not at all surprised. The response I found  on the street and in the neighborhoods and in meetings around my State  of Illinois and in the city of Chicago certainly gave evidence to that.   It was an interesting response, too, primarily from women but not  exclusively--women who came up to me, and I could tell by the look in  their eyes and the tone of their voice that something had just happened  publicly in America that touched them personally. Some would confide in  me and whisper about a personal experience they had. Others would look  into my eyes, and I realized this meant a lot to them for reasons they  didn't want to share.   That hearing last week was a moment I have never seen before in  American politics in the time I have been around.   The second thing I noted was the comments about Dr. Ford. Except for  a still photograph, I had never seen her before she walked into the  committee room last week to testify under oath. I didn't know what to  expect as she sat down, after taking the oath, and began her testimony.   Time and again the people who worked with her described her condition  as fragile. In her own words during the course of her testimony, she  said she was terrified--terrified. And why wouldn't she be--at this  point in her life, to become a national person, a national profile, a  national celebrity; to see her experience turn her family life upside  down to the point where she was forced to move out of her home and she  and her family had to take refuge and safety in a secure location.  There was all of the attention that was being paid to her, some with  praise and some with criticism. It is the kind of thing that even  politicians are supposed to get used to and never do. So imagine that  scenario for an ordinary person.   I listened to her testimony, and I heard what she had to say about  why this event took place. I realized that this woman from California  believed she had what she called a civic duty to come forward before  the White House made its final decision on the choice of a Supreme  Court nominee because she believed she had important information about  Brett Kavanaugh that the President should know and that Congress should  know, and she didn't know where to turn.   For those who argue that she was part of some political conspiracy,  she didn't know which way to turn. She ended up turning to the place  most would, to her local Congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, and sitting down  with her in California and talking about this confidential letter that  she wanted to put in the hands of somebody who would make a decision  about the future of the Supreme Court. It was a perfectly reasonable  explanation of what an ordinary citizen would do, and that is what she  did.   When she finally got in contact with the Senate Judiciary Committee  with this same confidential letter and had communications with Senator  Feinstein, she stressed over and over that she wanted this to remain  confidential and that she didn't want her identity to be disclosed for  fear of what it would mean to her and her family--a natural human  reaction.   I want to say a word about Senator Feinstein. You may quibble, you  may debate, you may argue with the way she handled this, but I think  she did what she thought was right for the very right reasons. She  believed that she had an obligation to Dr. Ford--an obligation to  protect her identity. I know Senator Feinstein. She is a person of  character and values and principles. I have been saddened and, in fact,  angry at times when my colleagues from the other side of the aisle  accused her of so many things--of plotting some political conspiracy to  bring down this nominee. In fact, two of them suggested she was the one  who leaked the letter to the press. I am as certain as I stand here,  after years of working with her, that neither of those things are even  close to the truth. She was trying to do what she felt was the right  thing--first, for this woman, this mother, this resident of her home  State, and, second, for this country. I don't question in any way  whatsoever--and no one should--her efforts and good faith to serve this  Nation in a very difficult process.   But Dr. Ford came forward and told her story. I asked her a question  point-blank: ``We are now being told that perhaps you were mistaken.  Perhaps it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh who assaulted you in that bedroom in  the Maryland suburbs. I wanted to ask you: With what degree of  certainty do you believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the assailant?''   Her answer to me was very short and direct: ``100 percent.'' She was  100 percent certain.   You think to yourself: It happened 36 years ago. How could she be so  certain? It was so long ago, but then you realize that, at that moment,  it impacted her life in a way that few people ever want to experience.  For 36 years she has been carrying the memory of that party, that  bedroom, that assault in her life, to the point where she sought  therapy--couples therapy with her husband--and told her therapist, as  well as her husband, the name of the assailant 6 years ago, long before  Judge Kavanaugh was proposed as a nominee for the Supreme Court.   I came away with strong feelings about Dr. Ford--her credibility, her  composure, the fact that she was resolute, and the fact that she showed  a degree of character that is extraordinary under the circumstances. I  believe Dr. Ford, and I believe what she told us.   That is why I am troubled to hear Republican Senators come to the  floor today and say: Well, you know, we feel that she was mistreated.  Some of the same Senators, including the majority leader, have said  that. They came to the floor on 3 successive days last week and  dismissed her complaint as a smear. That is the word that was used-- ``smear''--on the floor of the Senate. Even before she had testified,  even before they had seen her under oath say what she did, they  dismissed this as a smear. I don't think that is an indication of  respect for Dr. Ford to have said that on the floor of the Senate, and  I think that she deserves  [[Page S6421]]  more, as anyone would, who is willing to testify under oath.   I would also say that the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh last week was  a revelation. He stayed with his story that he was mischaracterized and  was improperly and wrongly accused, and he, too, was certain that this  event had never occurred, but in his testimony, in his opening  statement last week before our Judiciary Committee, I saw something  that I had never seen before in the Senate. I saw a level of emotion,  which was understandable, considering the accusations that had been  made, but there was a level of anger that I have seldom seen, and  perhaps have never seen, in the Senate.   Judge Kavanaugh attacked those who had raised these questions about  him. He said that he bore no ill will toward Dr. Ford, but then he  called her allegations ``a calculated and orchestrated political hit,''  citing ``apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016  election,'' and then he added: ``revenge on behalf of the Clintons.''   It is hard to imagine that a person aspiring to serve on the highest  Court of the land--where your temperament is so important, where you  have to make certain, as best you can, that you take politics out of  your legal equation--would be so direct and so specific in blaming his  plight on ``revenge on behalf of the Clintons.''   This political grace note from Brett Kavanaugh--this ``lock her up''  grace note--may be appealing to some on the political spectrum, but it  speaks volumes about this judge and how he would serve if he ever had  an opportunity to be on the Supreme Court.   It has been said over and over by the Republican majority leader that  the Democrats are in the midst of a big delay tactic. I have to echo  the comments of Senator Schumer earlier. It is very difficult to take  the Senate majority leader credibly when he makes a statement that we  are trying to delay filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The Senate  majority leader set the record in delaying Merrick Garland's nomination  for more than 300 days when he even refused to meet with the man, let  alone consider a hearing, when Judge Garland was nominated by President  Obama. To have this majority leader now tell us that we are the ones  responsible for delaying really is to ignore history and to ignore the  reality of what has occurred here, because of the courage of his  Members, three of whom have stepped up and said: We will not dismiss  Dr. Ford's allegations with just a staff phone call; we want an actual  hearing. That was inspired by three Republican Members of the Senate,  and we backed them up. We thought their request was right.   As for this FBI investigation, I know a little bit about that because  I asked Judge Kavanaugh directly during the course of this hearing what  he wanted us to do. I did not ask him what the White House wanted us to  do and not what the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican leadership  wanted to do, but what he, Judge Kavanaugh, wanted to do when it came  to this FBI investigation. My point was, if Dr. Ford is willing to  submit her allegations to an FBI review, why wouldn't you, Judge  Kavanaugh? If you believe there are no credible witnesses and no  credible evidence, otherwise, why wouldn't you want a complete  investigation done by the nonpartisan professionals at the FBI? But  even then, he refused that thought of an FBI investigation.   It wasn't until Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican of Arizona, made it  clear that he would not move forward on a vote on the floor without  that FBI investigation, joined by Senator Coons of Delaware and many  others, that this FBI investigation was under way. So give credit where  it is due. Any delay of a week for us to consider this is really  inspired by Senator Flake's request, with the support on the Democratic  side of the aisle. So to blame us for this delay, unfortunately, again,  is not accurate.   It appears now that Senator McConnell, the Republican majority  leader, is determined to plow through this, as he has said. He has said  this nomination will be on this floor this week. If the FBI  investigation is completed Thursday or Friday, there will be a report  that is available for Senators to review, as they should, and to read  the results of this investigation and draw their own conclusions. That  is the regular process of the Senate, but it appears that Senator  McConnell can't wait. He can't wait for that to be completed and  thoughtfully considered by his colleagues in the Senate.   It has to be this week, he has determined, and has said it over and  over again. He blames us for delay, delay, delay. If we take a day or  two or more to thoughtfully consider whatever the FBI finds, isn't that  our constitutional responsibility filling a vacancy, a lifetime  appointment, to the highest Court in the land? That, I think, is my  responsibility and should be his as well.   Let me close by saying, this has been a celebrated chapter in history  and will be remembered. To have a Supreme Court nomination for the  swing vote of the Court that may tip the balance for decades before us  is something we obviously consider seriously. That it would come at a  moment when these allegations have been made about sexual harassment as  we are facing this issue at every level and every sector of American  culture really dramatizes the importance that we get this right; most  importantly, that we be fair--fair both to Dr. Ford, who had the  courage to step forward, and fair to Judge Kavanaugh, who has the right  to tell us his memory of events and to be taken seriously as well. The  FBI investigation, though it was resisted by Judge Kavanaugh, is a step  in the right direction.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have not  declared where they are and how they will vote on the Kavanaugh  nomination will wait until the FBI investigation is complete, review  their findings, and reflect on the very basic question: Is Brett  Kavanaugh the right person at this moment in history to be given a  lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, one of the clearest indicators of the  success or failure of any public health system is average life  expectancy. Between the United States and other countries around the  world, there are dramatic differences in life expectancy compared to  the United States.   But you don't have to fly thousands of miles to see a place where  people live sicker and die younger than their neighbors. In Chicago,  hop on the Blue Line and go from the Loop to the ``L'' stop in West  Garfield Park. Between those two neighborhoods--just 5 miles apart-- life expectancy plummets 16 years. How can that possibly be?   Chicago is home to some of the greatest hospitals in the world. The  best doctors, the best nurses, the best technology--it is all there,  but not for them. As it turns out, how healthy we are and how long we  live depends more on our ZIP Code than our genetic code.   While countries overseas face challenges with infectious disease or  high child mortality rates, children in Chicago are dying preventable  deaths of another form: an epidemic of gun violence. Yes, we need  better gun laws, but the reality is that this Congress and this  President do not want to take commonsense action.   So what else can be done to address the root causes of violence?   Last year I introduced a bill that would increase funding to train  more teachers, doctors, and social service providers to identify and  provide care to children with emotional scars left from witnessing  violence and exposure to other adverse childhood experiences. Major  parts of this bill were included in the opioid package that already  passed the House and I hope will pass the Senate soon.   But I asked myself: What else can we do? Then it hit me: hospitals.   The hospitals in Chicago are on the frontlines of the city's gun  violence epidemic, providing high-quality care to heal bodies ripped  apart by bullets, but the ability of hospitals to reduce violence in  Chicago goes far beyond the extraordinary, lifesaving care they provide  in the ER.   Hospitals in Cook County, IL, pump $49 billion a year into the local  economy, and they employ 232,000 people. Hospitals are often the  largest employers in their communities.   For several months, I brought together the CEOs of the 10 largest  hospitals serving the city of Chicago. I asked them three questions:  What is your hospital is doing to make your neighborhoods safer and  better? What more can you do? And how can I help?   We identified a number of Chicago neighborhoods that they serve--or  are  [[Page S6437]]  too often underserved--to focus our efforts.   Remember, these institutions compete with each other every day, but  together, we came up with unified roadmap--a set of common goals and  commitments that are endorsed by all 10 hospitals.   Over the next 3 years, these 10 hospitals will expand economic  opportunities for local residents by: increasing local hiring by 15  percent--that means hundreds, or thousands, of new local hires;  increasing the goods they purchase from local businesses by 20  percent--meaning millions in procurement dollars; and expanding summer  employment, internships, and job training programs for residents in  health fields.   The 10 hospitals are committing to opening new health clinics in  schools and community centers and expanding the availability of mental  health services.   They will enhance their clinical healthcare practices by increasing  lead screening rates by 15 percent, reducing opioid prescribing by 20  percent, prioritizing maternal and infant health outcomes, and  researching gun violence.   This new hospital-led effort is focused on two things: reducing gun  violence and healthcare inequality. It is called the Chicago HEAL  Initiative: ``Hospital Engagement, Action and Leadership.''   According to the American Hospital Association, it may be the first  such regional hospital partnership to tackle a local issue. The  hospitals in the Chicago HEAL Initiative are already working on many  these goals through an impressive variety of programs, but this new  initiative will drive real change by bringing a new sense of  partnership and focusing on activities outside of hospitals'  traditional services within their four walls.   I am pleased to launch this new effort, and will do whatever I can in  Washington to help reduce violence and uplift communities.                            ____________________
