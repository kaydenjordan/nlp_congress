Madam President, on Thursday, the February inflation  numbers were released, and the news wasn't pretty. Inflation for  February was 7.9 percent, the highest inflation since January of 1982-- January of 1982, 40 years ago. We are in the grip of the worst  inflation in 40 years.   American families have been hit hard by this crisis as the price of  everyday necessities has soared, and energy prices, particularly gas  prices, are one of the top challenges facing Americans. Energy prices  are up 25 percent on average from a year ago. Electricity is up 9  percent. Propane, kerosene, and fire wood are up 19 percent. Utility  gas services are up 23 percent, and prices at the pump for gasoline are  up 38 percent.   The national average for a gallon of gas was $4.31 on Tuesday, up  from $2.86 a year ago. That is $1.45 more per gallon. That is a big  problem for American families. That is a big problem for our entire  economy.   High energy prices don't just have an impact when Americans fill up  their cars; they affect prices across the economy. High energy prices  drive up the cost of operating a factory. They drive up the cost of raw  materials, and they drive up the cost of getting goods to customers.   President Biden would like to blame the inflation situation,  particularly high energy prices, on Vladimir Putin. I don't need to  tell anyone how ludicrous that is. Our inflation crisis has been going  on for a year. Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine 3 weeks ago. I am afraid  passing the buck to Putin doesn't hold water.   Now, it is true that the uncertainty surrounding Putin's war and  corresponding sanctions on Russia are partly to blame for the most  recent spike in gas prices. But had gas prices been lower to start  with, Americans wouldn't be feeling the sanctions-triggered bump to the  extent that they are.   Democrats' American Rescue Plan spending spree helped create our  inflation crisis. Americans need to look no further than the White  House when wondering how the United States, a recent net exporter of  energy, is not on stronger footing to weather these tumultuous times.   The President has pursued an energy agenda that has done next to  nothing to help drive energy prices down and is, in fact, almost  guaranteed to increase energy prices long term and increase our  reliance on foreign sources of oil.   From the moment he took office, the President sent a negative signal  to energy producers by making it clear that his administration was not  going to be embracing conventional energy production.   He set the tone for his administration on day 1 by canceling the  Keystone XL Pipeline--an environmentally responsible pipeline project  that was already underway and that was to be paired with $1.7 billion  in private investment and renewable energy to fully offset its  operating emissions.   He also almost immediately froze new oil and gas leases on Federal  lands, sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that his  administration would be reluctant to work with them to increase  American energy production.   Now, President Biden has recently been touting the number of  available permits for oil and gas development, which is positive as far  as it goes, but new permits have dropped precipitously this year. And  issuing permits alone isn't enough to get development going.   The Biden administration has thrown up roadblock after roadblock to  actual energy development. Companies are struggling to break through  regulatory redtape to actually get oil and gas development up and  running. For example, they have struggled to obtain right of way to  build essential development infrastructure, like access roads to oil  rig sites. They are also struggling to get timely pipeline permits to  transport the oil and gas that they extract.   Unfortunately, they know exactly how this administration feels about  building pipelines. And the Biden administration is fully responsible  for  [[Page S1206]]  these problems. The administration has the ability to immediately take  action to expedite American oil and gas development by clearing away  the redtape that companies are facing.   It is refusing to do so. Instead, President Biden seems ready to  increase our reliance on energy imports from despotic governments in  volatile areas of the world. That is not acceptable. Energy  independence, relying on homegrown production instead of foreign energy  sources, is key for a number of reasons.   For starters, energy security is national security. The more we rely  on imports from other countries, the more that we are dependent on  those countries. We have seen that during the current conflict in  Ukraine. European companies like Germany have been unable to divest  from Russian energy because they rely on that production.   Without Russian energy, more than one country in Europe would face a  dire energy shortage--as Putin is well aware. We don't want to give  another country that much power over us.   Energy independence, and the robust energy production that comes with  it, also reduces the risk to Americans from price hikes in the global  market. The more oil and gas the United States produces as a share of  the global market, the more we are able to influence global supply,  which is the leading driver of cost.   The Biden administration has not been good for American energy  independence. We have increased our reliance on foreign sources of  energy during this administration, including our reliance on Russian  energy production.   And now that we have banned Russian energy imports, President Biden  seems ready to replace Russian energy, not with increased American  production but with oil and gas from human rights-challenged countries  like Venezuela.   I realize that President Biden and many Democrats would like to see  the United States focus solely on alternative energy production, but  the fact of the matter is that we are a long way from being able to  rely exclusively on alternative energy technologies. Whether Democrats  like it or not, our country is going to need oil and natural gas for  quite a while yet, and all of Democrats' wishful thinking isn't going  to change that.   The answer is not to get that oil and natural gas from despots in  volatile areas of the world but to get it from American energy  production.   President Biden and his administration may not be solely to blame for  high gas prices, but they have the power. They have the power to help  lower energy prices by unleashing American energy production--all of  it, both alternative and conventional--and they are responsible for  their failure to do so.   We need an ``all of the above'' energy policy that embraces  everything from oil and gas to hydroelectric and nuclear, to solar and  wind. And when it comes to alternative energy production, we need to  invest in all proven clean energy technologies, not just the  administration's preferred technologies like electric vehicles. The  administration has neglected important clean energy technologies like  biofuels, which have demonstrated significant emissions reductions  versus conventional gasoline.   As a resident of a rural state, I would like to see the  administration get serious about leveraging agriculture as an energy  solution and work to expand biofuel production and consumption. This  means not only setting robust blending targets and rejecting specious  small refinery exemptions but approving advanced fuels from corn kernel  fiber and restoring the year-round sale of E15.   Last week, I led a letter to the President with the Democratic whip  and colleagues from both parties urging the President to enable E15 to  be sold during the upcoming travel season to provide Americans with a  lower cost fuel that would help displace Russian oil.   Yesterday, the President's Press Secretary said that ``E15 was on the  menu.'' Well, it deserves real consideration. American drivers can't  afford for the President not to take action. The President could get us  on a path to lower energy prices today--today--by announcing that his  administration will get serious about expediting American production of  oil and natural gas. If he fails to do so, then he really will be  responsible for the prices that Americans are facing at the pump and  for the hit that our national security will take from our increasing  reliance on foreign sources of energy.   I hope the President will decide to unleash American production and  put our Nation on a path to long-term energy independence.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Ohio (Mr. Portman).
