 Mr. Speaker, today my community gathers in Orlando to  remember 49 victims of gun violence. The Pulse shooting, 3 years ago  today, was the worst terrorist attack in our Nation since 9/11.   Recall for a moment that, even now, there is no Federal law to ban  LGBTQ discrimination. The House passed the Equality Act, but the Senate  has refused to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote.   Yet in spite of these challenges, there are still places in America  that are meant to be safe havens. The Pulse nightclub was such a place,  a place where patrons could, as my bishop put it, enjoy a late night  fellowship.   The victims of Pulse were not in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They had every right to be there. And while Congress continues to offer  thoughts and prayers, the victims were gunned down while they  celebrated birthdays and family and friendships.   Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle what the  Bible says. It says that ``faith without works is dead.''   Today we remember the victims, but their stories did not end in the  early morning hours 3 years ago. The memories of those who died live on  in our hearts, and the struggles and triumphs of the survivors are ever  before us.   Some survivors suffered severe injuries. Others were not physically  injured but still carry the invisible wounds of that tragic moment.   One survivor, Orlando Torres, said that the mental scars are never  forgotten. Orlando spent hours trapped in the bathroom at Pulse, his  clothes soaked in the blood of the people who had been shot. He says:  ``I still worry about it happening again. No matter where I am, I  always look for the exit. You don't want to get cornered.''   Orlando spoke about the networks of survivors who, in America, help  each other after each mass shooting. He pointed out what we all now  know, that after New Zealand's shooting, New Zealand took immediate  action.   How many more innocent Americans need to die before we take action  here?   But still, after all that Orlando has gone through, he remains  positive--simply amazing. The attacks, he says, allowed the survivors  to share with the world the humanity of the LGBTQ community and show  that we are all God's children. He also said: ``I still go out. If we  stop dancing and loving each other, they win.''    Sadly, mass shootings are the product of our failure to pass  legislation designed to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Many victims  in the Pulse nightclub shooting and shootings across our Nation did not  stand a chance of survival because they were shot with weapons designed  for war. This is not the America that we were created to be.   In the days and weeks following the Pulse nightclub massacre, many of  us spoke about how central Florida came together, on one accord, to  help our community. I could not be prouder of the people in my hometown  who came together to stand up for and stand with brokenhearted families  and friends and to protect our community.   The victims of Pulse nightclub belong to us, and we will never forget  the lives they lived or their tremendous potential that will never be  realized. Today we remember and, through that remembrance, we transform  hate into love and loss into strength.                            ____________________
