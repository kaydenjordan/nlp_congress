 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Babin  for yielding.   The Biden socialist spending bill provides amnesty to eight million  illegal immigrants, including illegal aliens who are active gang  members, have convictions for sex crimes, and have multiple DUI  offenses.   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee actually said he was okay  with allowing illegal immigrants to remain in our country even if they  have 20 DUI convictions. Does that make our country more safe?   The Biden-Harris open border policies have allowed over 200,000  illegal immigrants to cross our border each month with a caravan of  400,000 on the way. This is equal to the population of Minneapolis.  They are about to cross our border in the next few weeks.   Tragically, the Biden administration has allowed 125,000 children to  be trafficked into our country by criminal cartels. These children  often face sexual assaults by cartel predators who are only able to  operate because the Biden administration eliminated remain in Mexico  and brought back catch and release.   The invasion at our border plus amnesty is truly the end of our  country as we know it.   Americans oppose mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. We want strong  borders and a border wall.
