 Madam Speaker, yesterday President Trump launched a rather  ridiculous effort called the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement  Office, or VOICE. They are going to be focusing on talking about people  who were victimized by people who are here illegally.   First of all, the statistics aren't with him. It turns out that  people who are undocumented are among the least likely groups to commit  illegal acts, and studies show that they are one-fifth to one-half less  likely to commit a crime.   So I want to start an effort that is similar. I am going to start a  task force called SAINT, Saved by American Immigrants National  Taskforce, to talk about Americans whose lives were saved by people who  are here undocumented--people like Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, who  became a brain surgeon, saving countless lives; people like Antonio  Diaz Chacon, who chased down a child abductor and saved a 6-  [[Page H1402]]  year-old girl from a horrific fate, even though he is undocumented; and  another undocumented immigrant named Jesus Manuel Cordova, who rescued  a 9-year-old boy in the Arizona desert.   These are the kinds of lifesaving efforts from our undocumented  immigrants where they save American lives. I bet our efforts at SAINT  talking about saving American lives will match, life for life, all of  the things that President Trump tries to drum up through his VOICE  effort.   Of course there are good and bad people. Of course there are good and  bad hombres. Let's celebrate the good with the bad. I look forward to  sharing their stories with my colleagues.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the rule and both  underlying bills, H.R. 1009, the OIRA Insight, Reform, and  Accountability Act; and H.R. 1004, the Regulatory Integrity Act.   These two bills that would be debated under this rule were both  reported out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  without a single Democratic vote. So these are not bipartisan bills.  They were reported out of committee only by Republicans. The bills  threaten transparency, undermine the independent authority of  government agencies, and weaken the separation of powers between our  three branches of government at a time in our history when we need it  the most.   I sat in this Chamber last night as President Trump spoke about  fixing healthcare and immigration systems, but we haven't seen those  plans yet. Instead, all we have seen are these kinds of not-bipartisan  bills that don't accomplish a lot.   Now, these two bills claim to offer accountability and integrity in  the rulemaking process, but when you look past their title, you see  what they really are is just another backdoor attack on American  workers, an attack on our environment and protecting our public health.   First with regard to H.R. 1009, much has been said since the start of  this Congress about the importance of our checks and balances in our  system. We have a new President who isn't shy about blurring the lines  of separation between the executive, legislative, and even the judicial  branches of government. He publicly condemned a judge based on his  ethnicity in a private case. He also attacked a judge who struck down  his order on immigration. I find it troubling to be debating a bill  that would make government agencies even more dependent on the judgment  of the White House when many of us question the judgment of the  gentleman currently occupying the Oval Office.   Under current law, independent agencies, like the Environmental  Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal  Communications Commission, and many others don't need approval from the  administration to move forward with a new rule or regulation.  Misleadingly characterized as simplifying the existing executive order,  what this bill would actually do is require all rules made by  independent government agencies to be sent to the White House,  centralizing the power of the White House and the power of the  President.                                time  1245    This bill effectively mandates improper influence by the White House.   In addition, the bill repeals language that exempts rules considered  to be lifesaving from having to undergo a full review process.   If those reasons weren't enough to dissuade my colleagues from voting  in favor of this rule, let me briefly discuss the unlimited review  window this bill would create to derail and delay important rules.  Frankly, important provisions like this are the reasons why the  American people, often rightfully, accuse the government of waste,  fraud, and abuse.   By giving the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs unlimited  time to review rules, Congress would effectively allow the White House  to bury rules in red tape and paperwork, the very red tape and  paperwork and bureaucracy that the American people are frustrated with.  This bill is a recipe to make government less efficient rather than  more efficient. It would grind the rulemaking process to a halt by  burying the very limited staff of the White House under a whole array  of rules from independent agencies that, with no timeline, would simply  sit in the White House either going nowhere or being studied by  committee after committee after committee. Perhaps, after several  years, they will see the light of day after even more bureaucrats have  had the chance, at your taxpayer expense, to read those rules.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill  makes the  [[Page H1406]]  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs somehow more accountable  by Congress by authorizing the statute, but that is not the case. This  bill, like many other bills we have seen in this Congress, frankly, is  a solution in search of a problem.   I don't disagree that the rulemaking process should be simplified,  but there is a collaborative, bipartisan way to do that. This bill does  not represent that idea. If passed, H.R. 1009 would reduce the ability  of independent government agencies to work effectively, create  additional paperwork and bureaucracy, and transfer significant power  and authority to the White House and the President.   Frankly, this bill is a serious threat on our checks and balances at  a time we need it the most. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to take that into account when voting on the rule and the bill  today.   The second bill under this rule is H.R. 1004, the so-called  Regulatory Integrity Act. It is another example of Republican attacks  on health and safety protections.   The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 requires executive agencies to  provide extensive and, often, gratuitous information on their websites  related to any pending regulatory action they are seeking to make.  Again, it is difficult to find a Member of this body who doesn't  believe that we want more transparency, more accountability, and more  streamlining of regulations. Of course, those are priorities for the  country. This bill does not do that.   I don't believe an outright attack on our rulemaking process meant to  protect our health, meant to protect people from fraud and abuse, and  giving yet more hoops for agency officials to jump through in doing the  job that Congress has asked them to do, in no way is that the correct  way to go about increasing transparency in government. This bill makes  it more difficult for all of the agencies that we have set up, that we  have directed, to do their job: to protect the American public.   The new reporting requirements that are included in this bill will  distract agencies from their core missions of keeping Americans safe  and, again, bury them under mounds and mounds of additional paperwork  requirements. Many of these agencies have seen their budgets cut by the  Republicans, and the reporting requirements will take up even more of  their very limited capacity that they have under the budget constraints  they operate at.   As many of us know, this bill was born out of a 2015 GAO study that  determined that the Environmental Protection Agency had violated  certain restrictions during the rulemaking process for waters of the  U.S. To me, the fact that that determination was made by an independent  government agency is proof that our oversight process works. If there  is a bipartisan bill we can do to implement best practices, I think  that we could have strong Democratic support for that. This bill does  not do that.   Republicans are ignoring the fact that the GAO also concluded that  ``the agency complied with the applicable requirements,'' and were so  concerned with providing the public with opportunities to comment that  the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers conducted over 400 meetings across  the country. If this bill passes the House, the ability of agencies to  do those kinds of outreach efforts and stakeholder involvement efforts  would be limited. It would be limited by vast and unnecessary  additional work, red tape, and bureaucratic reporting requirements that  would be mandated under this bill with the same limited resources they  have today. I think that it would be better use of their limited  resources to do those kinds of field opportunities across the country,  giving American stakeholders and people involved the opportunity to  testify about how those rules affect them.   The most immediate and certain effect of this bill would be to  virtually prohibit agencies from disclosing to the public any benefits  that agency actions would have in protecting the American people. If an  agency is no longer allowed to explain how the rulemaking process would  benefit and protect the American people, the public, of course, would  view this as some sort of burdensome regulation. Perhaps that is the  goal of this bill from a propaganda perspective.   Finally, this bill will ban agencies from soliciting support for  their regulations, seemingly forgetting that current law already does  this. If there is need to clarify it again, we can certainly do so in a  bipartisan way.   This unsettling trend of trying to, in fact, regulate regulations  actually leads to additional bureaucracy and paperwork. It is a  disservice to American workers and families, to our environment, and  to many Americans who don't know if they can make their rent or have  health insurance at the end of the month. It is a disservice to the  thousands of military and civilian workers no longer able to seek  employment in the Federal Government and a disservice to so many  American children and adults.    The fact that we are even considering these bills illustrates that  the priorities in Congress are not in line with the priorities of the  people that we represent. I have not heard an outcry from my  constituents on any of these issues. I hear about health care. I hear  about immigration reform, improving our schools, making college more  affordable, not that we need more administrative hurdles to the  rulemaking process. I haven't heard it once from a single constituent  at 51 townhalls I had last session.   The passage of this bill will put a significant administrative burden  on government agencies that issue rules to protect Americans. It would  limit the ability of the agencies that we set up under our authorizing  statutes to do their job: to protect the health and safety of the  American people.   I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and reject these bills.   I reserve the balance of my time.    I would like to inquire if the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions) has any remaining speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are all deeply concerned over the reports from our  intelligence community regarding foreign interference in our most  recent election. When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up bipartisan legislation, H.R. 356, the  Protecting Our Democracy Act, which would create an independent  commission to investigate the foreign interference in our 2016  election.   This is not a partisan matter. Both Democrats and Republicans have  called for this investigation and a full accounting for the American  people. Frankly, the American people deserve to know what happened, and  Congress has the responsibility to get to the bottom of it.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, when I was back in my district earlier this  year, again, I didn't have a single constituent raise issues over  regulatory reform. I did have people ask if we can have a full  accounting of foreign interference with our more recent election, and,  if we defeat the previous question, that will give us an opportunity to  do that.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question.  I will also urge them to vote ``no'' on the rule, and ``no'' on the  underlying bills.   Just so no one is here under any illusions, Republicans do currently  control the House, and the Senate, and the White House. Frankly, they  have the ability to set the agenda, and they could use that agenda to  advance real reforms like infrastructure, or tax reform, or fixing our  broken immigration system, repairing broken roads and bridges. Today,  instead, we are debating something so obscure that I don't think the  American people know what OIRA does or how to pronounce it; another  bill that has to deal with whether regulations are seen and signed off  on by the staffers in the White House; and two bills that don't do  anything but undermine the separation of powers, undermine the  authority of this institution, the United States Congress, and make it  harder for public agencies to do the job that we have instructed them  to do to keep the American people safe.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so we can bring up H.R. 356, the Protecting Our  Democracy Act, and oppose the underlying legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman  Bonamici's amendment.   Today, our country owes over $1.3 trillion in student debt. In  Colorado, the average student loan borrower owes $26,000.   Why would we want to risk abolishing consumer protections for our  borrowers?   These are very personal numbers. The stories I hear, the burden of  student loan debt affects people's ability to own a home or buy a car.   A recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found  that the number of student loan borrowers over the age of 60 has  quadrupled. People haven't even paid off their loans as they enter  retirement age.   Now, the Obama administration did take important steps to protect and  support student loan borrowers. They made it easier for them to pay  back their loans and ensured they were treated fairly by student loan  services. Rolling back these protections would have far-reaching  negative effects for our borrowers.   I strongly support Congresswoman Bonamici's amendment, exempting  Federal protections that support consumer protections for student loan  borrowers from the SCRUB Act. The last thing we need to scrub away is  protections for people to take out student loans.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman  Bonamici's amendment, which I am also proud to cosponsor.   When ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was first  passed in 1965, it truly was a landmark and important piece of civil  rights legislation. It is written with the intent that every student-- no matter their race, their economic background, their ZIP Code-- deserves a great education in our country.   Title I of ESEA gets at the heart of the civil rights spirit for  providing additional funding for schools with significant populations  of high-needs and at-risk students. Now, title I also provides  important performance and equity parameters for States and districts  and gives some direction about how States can comply with these  requirements to support our most struggling schools.   Of course, the text of the law doesn't do everything, which is why we  rely on the protections that have been put in place through rule.   The SCRUB Act would allow an unelected panel to carelessly do away  with important civil rights protections and transparency, the opposite  of the legislative intent in the ESEA.   The Department of Education regularly goes through an extensive  process for finalizing regulations, and to do away with these  protections on a whim by an unelected, all-powerful panel may somehow  score political points, but it is at the expense of students across our  country.   I strongly support Representative Bonamici's amendment that would  exempt title I from this harmful bill, and I urge its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
