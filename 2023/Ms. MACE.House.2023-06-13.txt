 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Luther  Reynolds, the city of Charleston's police chief who died recently to  cancer. He  [[Page H2818]]  was an exceptional leader and dedicated public servant who served the  Charleston community and beyond.   His legacy will leave a testament of courage, service, and love, and  I offer my deepest condolences to Chief Reynolds' family, his wife, his  children, his friends, and the Charleston Police Department. We mourn  his untimely passing and honor his unyielding spirit.   I have very fond memories of Chief Reynolds. In fact, he was the guy  that called me when my house got spray-painted at 7:30 in the morning,  making sure that I was aware and that it was safe and sound and would  be protected.   There are so many instances of threats that I have had on my life and  my family's life where Chief Reynolds was there for us each and every  day. He was a neighbor, he was a friend, and he was a protector of the  city of Charleston.   We remember his dedicated service and his commitment to our  community.            Remembering the Victims of Emanuel AME Church Massacre     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize some of the comments  made by my colleagues today.   Four days from now will be the anniversary of Mother Emanuel, a day  that was a very dark day in South Carolina's history where nine Black  church members of Mother Emanuel were murdered in cold blood by a white  supremacist, by a young man who wanted to commit evil atrocities on our  State and our Nation.   I recognize those individuals: Clementa Pinckney, who was a pastor  and State senator; Cynthia Graham Hurd; Susie Jackson; Ethel Lee Lance;  DePayne Middleton-Doctor; Tywanza Sanders; Daniel Simmons; Sharonda  Coleman-Singleton; and Myra Thompson.   As a State lawmaker, I believe that we need to strengthen our  background checks, because in the State of South Carolina, the reason  that the killer was able to purchase that gun, though he was  ineligible, was because of our weakened background systems. We have  dozens of databases across the State that don't talk to one other about  the criminal information of bad guys who are trying to purchase a gun.  It is an issue that I worked on as a State lawmaker, and it is  something I am advocating for today in Congress.   I hope that we can find a way to strengthen our background checks so  that bad guys who are breaking the law and shouldn't be able to buy a  gun, don't have the ability to commit such atrocities as those  committed at Mother Emanuel.   We stand South Carolina strong and Charleston strong, and I recognize  our heroes from that day.            Recognizing Berkeley County Adult Education Graduates     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Berkeley  County Adult Education graduates.   As a high school dropout, as someone who understands how challenging  it can be to finish education, I congratulate the adult education  graduates.   From my home county and Berkeley County, I offer a heartfelt  congratulations to this graduating class. They have demonstrated  exceptional persistence and have overcome so many hurdles that life has  thrown their way.   They are an aspiring example of learning at any age and under any  circumstances. Their perseverance prevails, their determination reaps  rewards, and their learning is lifelong--something that everyone can  commend today.   Madam Speaker, I extend my best wishes for their future endeavors in  everything that they do.                  South Carolina's Aquarium Turtle Releases     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize South Carolina's  aquarium releases of their turtles. We are celebrating the release of  two loggerhead turtles, named Bea and Pluto, by South Carolina  Aquarium's Sea Turtle Care Center in Charleston.   The turtles were found in distress, each missing a flipper, and  underwent extensive rehabilitation to recover.   Despite their physical challenges, the turtles displayed remarkable  resilience and this is something that the Coast of South Carolina  certainly is proud of.   Madam Speaker, I offer gratitude to the Sea Turtle Care Center team  led by Melissa Ranly.                          New Summerville Fire Chief     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the new Deputy  Chief Brent Melcher taking over the fire chief for Summerville from  Richard Waring on June 23.   We thank Chief Waring for his 30 years of service to Summerville and  Dorchester County. We also recognize that Chief Melcher wants to  continue the strong family atmosphere in the department and expansion  into Nexton.    Melcher has served Summerville since the year 2000. I recently was  able to connect and meet with him and was very proud of his  achievements of Summerville's new fire chief.        Special Bond Formed at MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the special bond  formed at MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital.   A story of resilience and friendship among three young boys: Bennett,  Jackson, and Marcelino formed a strong bond at Shawn Jenkins Children's  Hospital as they awaited their heart transplants.   Despite their medical challenges, they have supported and comforted  one another. Their friendship demonstrates the power of human  connection during difficult times.                            ____________________
