 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of thousands of  families in my district that have been exposed to PFAS in their  drinking water.   Last week, my friend Michael Hickey testified before the House on the  prevalence of PFAS contamination in Hoosick Falls and in Petersburgh,  two communities in my district.   Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh are not alone. Hundreds of communities  across the country are dealing with PFAS contamination.   Here is what we know about these forever chemicals. PFAS  contamination can cause autoimmune disorders, thyroid conditions or  disorders, and cancer. It is time for action.   As a named conferee for the National Defense Authorization Act, I  will forcefully advocate for pretreatment standards and that PFAS be  designated a hazardous substance.   Too many families are living with the consequences of PFAS  contamination in our Nation, and it is due in large part to our  inaction.                            ____________________
