 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Equality  Act.   America must live up to its values, and that means treating everyone  as equals and ending discrimination. The Equality Act is about making  sure all Americans, regardless of sexual orientation or gender  identity, can participate in our society without fear.   New Mexico is home to diverse religious and traditional communities  and has stood up for its LGBTQ population for a long time. We stood up  early to ban the cruel practice of conversion therapy.   The Equality Act allows us to adhere to our faiths while prohibiting  harmful and isolating acts of discrimination experienced by too many  LGBTQ Americans.   Consider this: 38 percent of transgender New Mexicans are unemployed;  40 percent live in poverty; 26 percent have been discriminated against  during the hiring or promotion processes; 41 percent have been homeless  at some point; and 33 percent have been discriminated against at a  place of public accommodation.   No one should have to worry about being discriminated against when  planning their wedding or struggle to simply get a cake. The Equality  Act will outlaw such discrimination, which is why we should pass it as  soon as possible.                            ____________________
