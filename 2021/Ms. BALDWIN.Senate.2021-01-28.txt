 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  distinguished life of Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Shirley  Abrahamson, who died  [[Page S194]]  on December 19, 2020, at the age of 87. Justice Abrahamson was a  consummate public servant who was passionately driven by the principle  of fairness when applying the law and serving the people of Wisconsin.  Her unparalleled commitment to judicial independence and justice had an  immeasurable impact on Wisconsin's judicial system and the countless  women and men who have been inspired to work in public service by her  leadership. She was the first woman to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme  Court and the first woman to serve as chief justice, but her legacy is  even richer than those exceptional accomplishments.   Justice Abrahamson's life had modest beginnings in New York City in  1933, as the child of Polish immigrants. Her passion for the law  started at the tender age of 6, when she decided she wanted to become a  lawyer. Those who knew her at all stages of life--from childhood to  retirement--consistently commented on her thirst for learning. She was  a voracious reader even at a very young age and a dedicated student,  earning honors in high school and college.   Justice Abrahamson graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree  from New York University in 1953. She earned a law degree with high  distinction from Indiana University in 1956 and a doctor of law in  American Legal History from the University of Wisconsin Law School in  1962. Justice Abrahamson began her career as a practicing attorney and  distinguished professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School.   Justice Abrahamson's career is an inspiration to all women who are  fighting forces that tell them they don't belong because of their  gender. She faced significant discrimination when she entered the legal  profession in the 1950s. From being denied employment at a law firm  after graduating first in her class at Indiana University, to the  denial of jobs, clients, and even social club memberships because of  her gender, Justice Abrahamson remained undaunted by prejudice. She  refused to back down from those who stood in the way of a woman's path  to success in the legal profession. She carried that steadfast  commitment to fairness and equality in her work on the court.   In 1976, Justice Abrahamson broke the glass ceiling in Wisconsin's  judicial system by becoming the first female justice on the Wisconsin  Supreme Court. She again changed the judicial landscape in 1996 when  she became the first woman to serve as chief justice. For the chief,  serving on the supreme court meant serving the people of Wisconsin as  an independent, fair, and impartial justice because, after all, the  court and our court system belong to the people, not powerful special  interests. That is why she spent a lot of her time traveling the State,  meeting with people. Whether it was meeting with local judges, riding  along with local law enforcement, or meeting with advocates for victims  of sexual assault and domestic violence, she always understood that you  can't serve the people if you don't walk in their shoes. That is why  the people of Wisconsin elected her to the supreme court four times and  she served 43 years on the court--serving the people.   The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Justice Abrahamson was  ``most courageous and sage, and ever mindful of the people--all the  people--that the law exists or should exist to serve.''   Justice Abrahamson was cherished and respected as a mentor, teacher,  advocate, wife, mother, grandmother and friend. She was known for her  strong work ethic, often the last person working at night at the State  capitol preparing for a case. Even as she faced pancreatic cancer at  the end of her last term on the State supreme court, Justice Abrahamson  fearlessly continued working, noting, ``On any day in this state, more  than a quarter-million people are facing a cancer diagnosis.'' She  tried to make the law more accessible and understandable to clients and  the general public and brought a caring perspective to her professional  and personal interactions. Her passion was also seen outside of the  courtroom in her travels and treasured relationships with family and  friends.   Justice Abrahamson was a true American hero. From her incomparable  tenure on the Wisconsin Supreme Court to her efforts as a pioneer for  gender equality, Justice Abrahamson lived a life devoted to service and  justice for all. Her greatest legacy is the trail she blazed for  countless young women, who can see themselves in a courtroom or on a  judicial bench because of the barriers she fearlessly broke through.  She will shine in Wisconsin's history as one of the most influential  women who shaped not only our judicial institutions but the State as a  whole.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to honor Neil Heinen,  editorial director for WISC-TV and Madison Magazine, on his retirement.  Throughout his remarkable career, Neil has been steadfast in his  commitment to fair and honest reporting, clear-headed editorials and  fascinating stories about the community he loves.   Born in Milwaukee, WI as the oldest of 11 children, Neil first  attended St. Norbert College in Green Bay in 1969. He dropped out to  spend 4 years working in a mental hospital, where he said he received  his real education. He worked as a bartender and actor in Madison  before deciding to study journalism at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. He began his career at WIBA radio station, spending 10 years  on the air before joining the team at WISC-TV News as a news assignment  editor.   It was there that Neil worked with longtime station manager Tom Bier  to create an editorial director job just as most stations were  eliminating their editorial departments. Neil delivered more than 7,400  on-air editorials since he first conveyed the station's views in April  of 1992. He also hosted a Sunday morning public affairs program, ``For  the Record,'' that ran 1,500 episodes over 30 years.   Perhaps Neil's greatest legacy is his leadership in guiding the  growth and creativity of Madison Magazine, which won countless awards  for providing its nearly 170,000 readers with interesting coverage of  local people, entertainment, and issues. Neil's contributions included  monthly columns on issues of importance to Madisonians and a monthly  food column he coauthored with his wife, Nancy Christy. Madison readers  particularly enjoyed his cover stories focused on leadership and  visions for Madison's future.   Neil has been a familiar and trusted voice in many of Madison's most  important events and controversial issues for the past 30 years. He is  known for his support of major community projects such as the Monona  Terrace Convention Center, the UW-Madison Kohl Center and Overture  Center for the Arts. He helped launch We the People/Wisconsin, one of  the most successful civic journalism projects in the country in the  1990s, and worked to start Schools of Hope, an initiative to help close  the achievement gap in Madison schools.   While Neil's last day of work was this past September 15, I know he  will remain active in the community for many years to come, lending his  voice to complex community conversations and championing causes that  bring us together. I will be forever grateful for Neil's commitment to  the Madison community and for offering his wise perspective in critical  times.                            ____________________
