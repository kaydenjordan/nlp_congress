 Mr. Chairman, a budget is a moral contract between  elected officials--the government--and the people we were elected to  represent. That is why I am proud to rise in support of the people's  budget, presented by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. This budget  serves as a Progressive alternative to the GPO's cruel budget plan, a  plan that prioritizes tax breaks for billionaires over the need to fund  care for seniors in nursing homes and children and struggling families  in places like Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.   I was proud to help draft the people's budget, which invests $200  billion to ensure that families in Texas, Louisiana, Puerto Rico,  Florida, and the U.S. territories have the immediate assistance they  need right now.   The people's budget would also reduce the deficit by $700 billion  over the next 20 years by investing in human capital. We would do this  while enacting comprehensive immigration reform, protecting DREAMers,  and ending funding for family detention centers.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support the people's budget  and reject H. Con. Res. 71. Let's stands with the working class, the  middle class, and the immigrants in our country. This is the right  thing to do for our people and for our economy.
