 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to celebrate Black History  Month and to pay tribute to Pennsylvanians whose work has made a real  difference in our Commonwealth.   This year we will honor three individuals who have dedicated  themselves to uplifting the lives of others. We know that Dr. Martin  Luther King, Jr., once said: ``Life's most persistent and urgent  question is: `What are you doing for others?' '' For purposes of  today's remarks, I will substitute one word. I will substitute the word  ``children'' for the word ``others'' and ask: What are you doing for  our children?   It is an important question, not only for those of us who gather for  Black History Month today and to celebrate this month, but it is also  an important question for every Member of Congress to ask themselves.   This year we are going to honor these three Pennsylvanians: Kathy  Elliott, Rosemary Browne, and Ellyn Jo Waller. All three have dedicated  their lives to answering this urgent question and to building pathways  toward hope for children in their communities.   I can think of no calling more important and no mission more  essential than this one: to help our children. It is an honor for me to  have the privilege to recognize these remarkable Pennsylvanians. They  are beacons in their communities, and they are each, in their own way,  an inspiration to me in my work in the Senate and, I know, to the work  of our staff as well.   American children face a crisis created by policy choices made by  adults over now several decades. Despite low unemployment and overall  economic growth, children are being left out and left behind. Almost  half of young children in the United States of America live in poverty  or near poverty, with infants and toddlers at greatest risk.  [[Page S1097]]  Nearly half of children live in those circumstances.   According to the Census Bureau's ``Supplemental Poverty Measure,''  which takes into account many of the government programs designed to  assist low-income families and individuals, childhood poverty  worsened--worsened--in 2017 for the first time since the Great  Recession.   Poverty harms children both immediately and for a lifetime, the  National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded in  their 2019 seminal report, ``A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty.''  They found that poverty itself, especially when it occurs in early  childhood or is persistent over time, is damaging to children in ways  that last a lifetime.   Specifically, the report finds the following--and I am quoting the  National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine: ``We find  overwhelming evidence . . . that . . . a child growing up in a family  whose income is below the poverty line experiences worse outcomes than  a child from a wealthier family in virtually every dimension, from  physical and mental health, to educational attainment and labor market  success, to risky behaviors and delinquency.''   This is a crisis of untapped potential opportunities. It is a crisis,  as well, of contributions not made. When a child faces needless  obstacles to becoming the person he or she might become, it is a  profound tragedy that affects all of us because we are denying not just  that child but also that family, that child's family, their community,  and our country the contributions that child could make if we were  investing in that child.   Over time, corrupt forces have perverted the basic notions of freedom  while creating a society that works for corporate interests rather than  our children's best interests. Freedom, as we know, is not simply the  right to be left alone. Real freedom must include the opportunity--the  affirmative ability--to achieve one's dreams.   A country that claims to support the freedom of its people must  provide opportunities to its citizens. For example, in his second  inaugural address, President Obama said the following:         We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved       for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no       matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at       any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home       swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to       each other . . . these things do not sap our initiative, they       strengthen us. They don't make us a nation of takers; they       free us to take the risks that make this country great.    President Obama was right, and he knew then that there were and are  today extraordinary people across the country who are working to give  our children the opportunity to achieve and grow and contribute so much  to our Nation.   Today I will speak about three women who are doing this work in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: first, Rosemary Browne of Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania. For over 35 years, Rosemary Browne has been a leader in  South Central Pennsylvania. During that time, she has held a number of  critical roles in both the government sector and the nonprofit sector.   She is currently the President and CEO of Alder Health Services, the  mission of which is to improve the health and well-being of persons  living with HIV/AIDS and members of the LGBTQ community in a culturally  competent, affirming, and empowering environment. The agency provides  behavioral health, primary care, case management, wellness services,  HIV/STD testing and treatment, family planning, and a host of other  programs.   Critically, Alder Health provides a safe haven for LGBTQ youth, and  we know that significant progress has been made in advancing the rights  of LGBTQ individuals. However, the progress has been uneven, and we are  still falling far short, for example, in serving transgender young  people, especially transgender young people of color who face  disproportionally higher rates of suicide and violence. Alder Health,  under Rosemary Browne's leadership, has played an indispensable role in  helping us better understand the challenges of LGBTQ adolescents and  providing them with the services they need.   In 2018 Rosemary was appointed to Governor Tom Wolf's Pennsylvania  Commission on LGBTQ Affairs, the first-of-its-kind statewide commission  in the Nation. Rosemary's work at Alder builds on her primary work at  the Highmark Foundation, where she led efforts to address emerging  community health challenges and to make sure that uninsured and  underserved populations in South Central Pennsylvania had the attention  and the services that they needed. In this capacity, she spearheaded  efforts to address bullying in our schools and our communities as a  public health problem and also provided leadership on a strategy to  reduce childhood obesity through school and community-based  partnerships.   Prior to her work at Highmark Foundation, Rosemary spent a decade at  the Foundation for Enhancing Communities as a program officer and then  director of programs and community investment, where she oversaw tens  of millions of investment in community services and tuition assistance,  giving hundreds of area college-bound students the opportunity to  pursue higher education.   Over her career, Rosemary Browne has heeded the call of service and  lent her considerable passion and expertise in many different  capacities. Whatever the role, the work has been the same: putting a  spotlight on the needs of the underserved populations--LGBTQ youth,  girls of color, and other underserved populations who lack access to  healthcare, higher education--and always--always--helping them to  obtain the services they need and to remove the obstacles that stand  between them and their full potential.   Service has always been a part of Rosemary's work, believing, as she  does, that we are given resources and influence not for ourselves but  for others.   Also, like Rosemary Browne, Dr. Kathi Elliott's career has been  defined by her service to others and to the children and young people  of Pennsylvania. In this case, in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Kathi came  to this work naturally, having had those values instilled in her by her  late mother, the former police commander of Pittsburgh, Gwen Elliott.   We have had South Central Pennsylvania with Rosemary Browne. Now we  are in Southwestern Pennsylvania with Dr. Kathi Elliott.   Kathi's mom, Gwen, the late police commander, was herself a  trailblazer and someone whose story also should be told. We don't have  time for two stories in one family today, but I will tell part of  Gwen's story as well.   Gwen was one of the first African-American women officers in the  Pittsburgh Police Department, joining the department in 1976 and  eventually rising to the rank of commander. In 2002, Gwen founded  Gwen's Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering girls and young  women through holistic, gender-specific programs, education, and  experiences through after school--school and community-based  programming throughout the communities in Southwestern Pennsylvania.  Gwen's Girls has grown to provide service throughout the region with  sites in Pittsburgh, Wilkinsburg, and Clarendon, PA.   Given her mother's leadership, it is no surprise that Dr. Kathi  Elliott has demonstrated the same commitment to and passion for  leadership, development, and empowerment of girls.   Prior to accepting the position of CEO of Gwen's Girls in 2015, Kathi  spent years providing leadership in social service, community, and  individual mental health treatment. Kathi began her career as a victim  advocate at the Center for Victims, working mostly in the juvenile  justice space. She also remains a practicing psychiatric nurse  practitioner. In that capacity, she provides psychiatric evaluations,  medication management, and clinical consultation services and treatment  at the VA of Pittsburgh--their outpatient mental health clinic.   Dr. Elliott completed dual master's degrees in nursing and social  work from the University of Pittsburgh and earned a doctor of nursing  practice degree from Chatham University in 2014.   Through Dr. Elliott's leadership, Gwen's Girls has become recognized  as a frontrunner in the integration of evidence-based, clinical  prevention and intervention policies and practices that enhance the  child and social welfare system.  [[Page S1098]]    Gwen's Girls convenes an annual equity summit for Black girls to  address the racial and gender biases that exist within the juvenile  justice, health and wellness, child welfare, and education systems.   Dr. Elliott has also remained a constant leading force and convener  of the Black Girls Equity Alliance--a collaboration of over 75  stakeholders committed to addressing systemic inequities in the  juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and healthcare systems.   Dr. Elliott currently serves on the board of trustees at Chatham  University. In December 2017, she was appointed by Mayor Bill Peduto to  serve as a commissioner on the newly formed Gender Equity Commission  for the City of Pittsburgh.   Our third honoree today, Dr. Ellyn Jo Waller, though she was born in  Queens, NY, we are proud to call her a daughter of Pennsylvania. Many  in Philadelphia know her as a member and a leader at Enon Tabernacle  Baptist Church, as well as the partner, in both life and ministry, of  Dr. Alyn Waller, senior pastor of Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. Ellyn  Jo Waller earned a bachelor of special education from Ohio University,  a master of education in curriculum, instruction, and technology in  education, and a doctor of education and curriculum, instruction, and  technology in education, with an emphasis on literary education, from  Temple University.   Dr. Waller has devoted her passion and her time to promoting women's  education and empowerment. She has especially devoted much of her time  to combating human trafficking, both here in the United States and  internationally. She is an active member of the Philadelphia Anti-Human  Trafficking Coalition and serves as cochair of the religion  subcommittee.   In 2011, Dr. Waller founded She's My Sister, an anti-human  trafficking ministry at Enon Tabernacle. She's My Sister works to  ensure that the faith community in Greater Philadelphia is aware of the  issue of human trafficking and also partners with the Greater  Philadelphia Salvation Army on the issue of participating in street  outreach, supporting and strengthening the drop-in centers, and  advocating on behalf of victims of human trafficking and sexual  exploitation.   In October of 2015, under Dr. Waller's leadership, the ministry  hosted its Inaugural Human Trafficking Awareness 5K Walk/Run to raise  funds for a transitional residential program for young women exiting  the life and aging out of the child welfare system.   Internationally, Dr. Waller regularly participates in rescue and  restoration efforts in Italy and South Africa. Dr. Waller also serves  on a number of boards and provides community leadership in other ways.  She is a member of the board of the City School in Philadelphia, on the  advisory committee of the United Negro College Funds, Delaware Valley  Women of Faith for Education annual luncheon, and is president of the  Charitas Foundation, which is the philanthropic Waller family  foundation established to positively impact the lives of individuals by  sowing financial seeds into organizations that change lives through  their missions.   Dr. Waller has served on the Foundation Board of the Community  College of Philadelphia since 2014 and currently serves as the  president of the Foundation Board.    Each of our honorees today--these three remarkable women--have worked  tirelessly to ensure that our children can flourish and can fulfill  their potential. When others may look the other way or even wash their  hands of the solemn duty to help our children, our honorees have  instead volunteered for service over and over again.   To refer back to the first question I started with, ``What are you  doing for our children,'' each of us has an obligation to answer that  question. Each of our three honorees today have answered that question  by devoting their lives to the urgent work of helping our children.  These three remarkable women--all Pennsylvanians--have provided  pathways to hope. For that, we owe them our deepest gratitude.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
