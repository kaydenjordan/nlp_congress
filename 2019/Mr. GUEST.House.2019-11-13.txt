 Madam Speaker, the Founding Fathers understood the  important role that our farmers and ranchers would play in the  construction of our great Nation, and Congress has always played a  pivotal role as a friend to our agriculture community.   The USMCA is an agreement that would strengthen trade relations with  two of our largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and would give  a much-needed boost to the American farmer.   In August of this year, I toured Mississippi with the Mississippi  Farm Bureau Federation. During these visits, and in subsequent  meetings, the Mississippi agriculture community has consistently  discussed the importance of the USMCA and asked for its approval.   Unfortunately, the House majority has chosen impeachment instead of  ratifying this trade agreement. The majority is prioritizing a partisan  political process over substantive policy issues that would strengthen  our country.   Madam Speaker, I ask that we focus on the real work that needs to be  accomplished this year and pass the USMCA in support of our Nation's  farmers and ranchers.                            ____________________
