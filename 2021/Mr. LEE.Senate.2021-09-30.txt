 Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on HELP be discharged from further  consideration of S. 2843 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, immunizations are nothing new. To a degree,  immunization requirements might not be new, but sweeping immunization  mandates issued by a single individual within the Federal Government-- that is, the President of the United States--are entirely new, entirely  unprecedented, entirely unfounded, and dangerous to our constitutional  order, to say nothing of its tendency to discourage those who have been  reluctant to get the vaccine from getting one.   So I have returned to the Senate floor today, for the third time this  week, to express my profound objections to that sweeping mandate--to  President Biden's sweeping, promised, and still inchoate vaccine  mandate--and to offer legislation that this body could have passed  right now; that it could have passed in order to protect countless  Americans from this Federal intrusion.   Now, look, the Federal Government has no legitimate role mandating  COVID-19 vaccination for all Americans. In fact, the President of the  United States has acknowledged that. It doesn't have that role. It  doesn't belong to this government. Yes, there have been vaccine  mandates in the past. They have never been from the Federal Government,  directed at the entire country.   During a really difficult time, economically and otherwise, in which  inflation and the jobs market are causing a whole lot of businesses  around the country to have to close their doors, President Biden has  announced that he is going to enforce this mandate with a really hefty  fine. Each incidence of a business not fulfilling the mandate could  cost a business $14,000. President Biden, under the threat of massive  punishment, is co-opting businesses to enforce his mandate. They will  have to police their workforce's personal medical decisions and order  the receipt of a vaccination or, alternatively, be forced into  bankruptcy.   Now, some on the other side of the aisle think that the President's  punishment doesn't go far enough. In fact, in the reconciliation bill  draft currently being circulated on the other end of the Capitol in the  House of Representatives, Democrats are pushing to increase the fine to  $70,000 per violation.   Look, unvaccinated Americans are not the enemy; they are not the  virus; and they are certainly not the enemy. Some are frontline doctors  and nurses and other healthcare professionals who worked overtime  throughout the pandemic, throughout the darkest of the dark hours of  the pandemic, treating patients and saving lives.   Others are workers whose industries were deemed essential and who  showed up to work to ensure Americans kept having access to food and  electricity and other essential items and services. Others still are  simply neighbors, family members, and other loved ones who  [[Page S6814]]  have supported friends, families, and entire communities as Americans  as a whole struggled through quarantines, shutdowns, financial  difficulties, and social isolation.   Let me reiterate, as I have said many times before and I will  continue to repeat: I believe the vaccine's development is nothing  short of a miracle. It is an answered prayer. I have been fully  vaccinated, as has every member of my family, with my encouragement.  But we certainly should not be forcing employers, through the Federal  Government, without congressional authorization or constitutional  authority, putting employers in a position where they have to fire some  of their most valuable and now increasingly hard-to-find workers.   We shouldn't be threatening business owners with closure simply  because they don't have any desire to police their workforce's personal  medical decisions. That is not who we are as a country. I don't care  whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent or a  Libertarian; Americans, as a whole, don't believe that that is who we  are. We are not into that kind of draconian micromanagement associated  with a nanny state, nor are we into the excessive accumulation of power  in the hands of a few or, even worse, in the hands of one person. Many  simply cannot incur the cost of this enforcement--certainly not in this  economy.   Additionally, this fine really amounts to a tax. It is government  revenue collected from the American people, and the Constitution has a  thing or two to say about how revenue bills must be enacted. The  Constitution does not vest any taxing or, for that matter, any other  revenue raising or fining authorities in the President alone--no. This  is a power that is reserved to the people's representatives in Congress  who are charged with precisely that responsibility. We have exclusively  that authority, and that authority is not to be exercised by the  President of the United States.   It is no accident that the Founding Fathers, through the  Constitution, put this power in the hands of those people occupying  positions in the branch of government most accountable to the people at  the most regular intervals and in no one else within our government.   President Biden's mandate would impose really significant costs on  Americans and on American businesses and on our Nation's economy that  is already in some really rough times.   Look, it is unconstitutional. It hasn't been passed by Congress. It  is wrong for America. And that is why, today, as I did yesterday and  the day before, I came here to offer a proposal that, if enacted, as we  could have enacted it today, it would protect Americans from some of  the most disastrous effects of the mandate.   While I believe the mandate will, I am quite certain, eventually be  invalidated in court, it is going to take some time for us to get there  because right now we don't even have the mandate itself; we just have  the threat of the mandate. And it is the imminent apprehension of the  mandate's eventual issuance that is causing HR departments and general  counsel's offices in corporate America throughout this country today to  scurry to try to get ahead of the curve, develop their own policy, so  that they are in compliance as of day one when the mandate hits.   But, in the meantime, there is nothing to sue. There is no one to sue  because there is no final Agency action. There is no order in place.  There is just the threat of it.   This, I fear, is a feature, not a bug, because by the time we  actually have something on which to sue and by the time lawsuits are  brought, by the time that litigation works its way to its natural  conclusion--which, I believe, inevitably, culminates in a finding that  it is invalid; it is unconstitutional; it is not warranted by law-- months, if not years, will have elapsed, and a lot of the damage will  be done.   So, until that day--until that day I consider inevitable when a court  rules that this is unlawful--these bills like the one that I have  offered today can provide businesses and the American people with the  certainty that they need to make their own decisions.    My bill that I have offered up today, the No Taxation Without  Congressional Consent Act, would prohibit OSHA and other executive  branch Agencies in the Federal Government from imposing fines, fees, or  taxes with respect to these mandates. It would protect our  constitutional order by requiring that revenue measures be voted on by  Congress, the branch of government most accountable to the people and  the only branch of government empowered to enact such policies. The  other two branches cannot.   As I mentioned yesterday, the people concerned about this mandate are  everyday Americans. I have now heard from 158 Utahns who are at risk of  losing their jobs due to the mandate, and that number continues to grow  every day. They are not our enemies; they are our neighbors. Many of  them have been advised by board-certified doctors that they ought to  not receive the vaccine. We shouldn't be punishing them or forcing them  into second-class status.   So today we have a choice. I hope that, at some point, my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle will allow us to provide this certainty  and peace of mind to those individuals and businesses at risk of  suffering under the mandate.   We can defend Congress's role as the branch of government that  determines how and from whom revenue is to be raised. Not only can we  do that, but we have an obligation to do that. We have all sworn an  oath to uphold and protect and defend the Constitution of the United  States, and that document doesn't give the President this power. In  fact, that document precludes, it prohibits the President from  exercising this power in the absence of congressional authorization,  which we have not provided.   So this bill, one of a dozen that I have submitted, could have passed  this body today. I wish, for the sake of millions of concerned  Americans, that it had, but regardless of this result today and of the  objection that precluded it from passing the Senate today, I am going  to continue to fight. I will keep coming back for as long as it takes  in order to end this egregious and legally baseless and  unconstitutional mandate.   I find it interesting that my friend and colleague, the distinguished  Senator from the State of Washington, referred to this as  ``outrageous,'' as outrageous that we would be attempting to put in  place protections for those Americans who are going to be victimized by  the vaccine, who are going to have to choose between, on the one hand,  receiving a medical procedure that they don't want and, on the other  hand, being fired. Nobody should have to choose between submission and  financial ruin. They especially shouldn't have to do that under the  direction of an invalid, unconstitutional directive by the Federal  Government.   She also referred to what she described as ``our efforts,'' ``our  efforts to end this pandemic.'' This isn't about whether we want to end  the pandemic. There is not a single person--Democrat, Republican,  Independent--in this Chamber or in the other Chamber--I am not sure I  know a single American anywhere who wouldn't want to end this pandemic.  This is not the pandemic. This is not going to end the pandemic. If  anything, this will cause more people to be more reluctant to get the  very vaccine that they are wanting to encourage others to provide.   This is not about that. The minute we lose control of the government  that is supposed to work for us, the minute we start to erode,  willfully, even for those who might be convinced that it is good  policy--and I would disagree with them on that. The minute we decide to  give this power to the President of the United States and stand  silently as he usurps authority that under article I, section 7, and  article I, section 8, plainly belongs only to Congress, to the extent  we have any business operating in this area to begin with as a Federal  Government, which we do not--then we have simultaneously undermined  both the vertical protection that we call federalism and the horizontal  protection we call separation of powers.   Now, lest anyone might be left with the impression that this would be  an esoteric or academic exercise or that that is not something that  affects their freedom--there are those who would make that suggestion-- they are sorely mistaken. You see, because anyone, anywhere can have a  Bill of Rights.   In fact, as the late Justice Antonin Scalia used to point out, any  ``tin horn  [[Page S6815]]  dictator'' around the world can have a Bill of Rights. And most of them  do. Many of those Bills of Rights are scintillating documents; they are  glowing in terms of their expression of individuality and the right of  each human to exist and flourish. They will articulate a list of rights  that is, in some cases, comparable to, if not even more protective of,  individual liberty than our own Bill of Rights.   Yet, as Justice Scalia continued, whether or not that Bill of Rights  or any Bill of Rights is worth more than the paper that it is printed  on ultimately rests on whether there are protections in place that  guard against the dangerous accumulation of power in the hands of the  few. That is what makes that difference.   So if we allow a President today to adopt whether you want to call it  a tax or a fine or whatever revenue-raising tool that you choose to  identify this as being, the President doesn't have the power to impose  that. That is a legislative function.   Article 1, section 7 is very clear: You cannot enact legislation,  including any legislation collecting revenue from the citizenry without  passage in the House, passage in the Senate, and presentment to the  President of the United States. He can't do it alone.   That is what this is about. This is about so much more than just this  vaccine mandate. But this vaccine mandate in and of itself is wrong. It  is unconstitutional. It is harmful, and it has a tendency to undermine  the very interest the President purports to be advancing.    Mr. President, back in 1987, a 23-year-old mill worker named  George Alexander struck a tree spike--a tree spike like this one--in  the log that he was processing. His sawblade shattered, and it caused a  wound  [[Page S6821]]  stretching from his eye all the way down to his chin. His teeth were  smashed, and his jaw was brutally dashed in half. The incident made  national news.   Just 2 years later, Tracy Stone-Manning rented a typewriter to  disguise her identity. She then typed and sent a letter to the U.S.  Forest Service on behalf of an ecoterrorist group. She conspired to  spike trees with spikes just like this one--hundreds and hundreds of  pounds of spikes just like this one. In so doing, endangered the lives  of foresters, of loggers, and of firefighters. She ended the letter  with the following words:         You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could       get hurt.    Unfortunately, it wasn't until after her nomination hearing that we  learned of her work with the ecoterrorist organization EarthFirst!. It  wasn't until after her hearing that we learned that she had been issued  a target letter by a Federal grand jury and had hired an attorney to  negotiate an immunity deal prior to testifying in the tree-spiking  case.   It wasn't until after her hearing that we read her words in a  newspaper saying that she ``could have been charged with conspiracy  were it not for her agreement with the U.S. attorney.'' It wasn't until  after her hearing that we learned that she was compelled by that same  Federal grand jury to submit fingerprints, writing samples, and hair  samples.   Now, beyond her involvement with the ecoterrorist group, since her  hearing, we learned of public statements she made just months ago  calling for homes to burn in forest fires. We learned of statements she  made saying grazing is destroying the West and calling for population  control measures and even labeling children as environmental hazards.   After all of this, a White House official called her nomination a  ``massive vetting failure.'' It was that, but it is so much worse than  that. She was and is a radical. She supported a criminal conspiracy to  engage in ecoterrorism.   Our committee asked her if she had ever been the subject of a  criminal investigation. She, in a sworn statement, lied. Our committee  never had the opportunity to ask her about these shameful acts. Her  past actions, her positions, her statements, and her goals would each,  individually, disqualify her from service. But combined, they make her  a, frankly, offensive candidate to the countless people in Utah and  throughout the West and beyond who rely on Bureau of Land Management  cooperation for their livelihoods and for their way of life.   Now, inexplicably, President Biden has not withdrawn this nomination,  though Ms. Stone-Manning has seemingly gone into hiding. She has left  unanswered dozens of questions formally posed to her by me and by my  colleagues. If confirmed, she will lack the credibility with  constituents throughout the Nation that she would otherwise need to  perform this job. She just won't have it. And any accomplishments made  by the Biden administration to steward our lands will be overshadowed  by her specter of deceit.   The Bureau of Land Management controls 42 percent of the land in  Utah. In fact, the BLM controls more land in Utah than Utahns do--a lot  more.   So I speak for a lot of people back home today, people who are  insulted by President Biden's nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to run  the Bureau of Land Management. Her confirmation would be bad for Utah,  bad for the Bureau of Land Management, and bad for honesty and  accountability in government.   Needless to say, she will not receive my vote. It defies logic,  reason, and the greatest traditions of this body to think that we would  confirm her today. I urge my colleagues to reject this nomination.
