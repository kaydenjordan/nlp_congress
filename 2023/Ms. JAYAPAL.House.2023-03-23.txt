 Mr. Chair, Congress should be supporting parents,  students, and teachers, not advancing this politics over parents act  which would punish teachers for giving history lessons, ban books, and  sow hate and divisiveness against trans kids.   Parents have the utmost confidence in their kids' teachers. When it  comes to writing curricula, 76 percent of parents trust their child's  school. But when it comes to writing laws, political gimmicks, like  this bill, keep them from saying the same thing about this very body.   Instead of manufacturing outrage over curricula and books, why don't  we just listen?   Mr. Chairman, 84 percent of parents would rather Congress give free  school meals, and 79 percent want support for mental health services.  In a survey of parents' top concerns by The Pew Charitable Trusts, 40  percent said they were extremely or very worried about their children  struggling with depression, 35 percent said they were concerned about  bullying, and 22 percent were worried about their kids being shot.   Not a single one of those issues on the top list of parental concerns  is addressed in this bill. So don't tell me this is a parents' bill of  rights. This is not addressing gun violence. It is not addressing  mental health. It is not addressing childcare, pre-K, and all of the  other things that would be a part of a parents' bill of rights.   Instead, we are spending time on a bill that sows doubt about public  education and our teachers and also targets our very vulnerable trans  kids who are absolutely no threat to anyone in this body.   Please understand that the provisions in this bill that out trans  kids are cruel and dangerous. I say that as a mom of a trans kid. I was  very embracing to my daughter when she came out, but not every family  is. The reality is that 75 percent of trans kids experience  discrimination and harassment.   So why do Republicans want schools to require outing LGBTQ students?   That does not make them better students.   Congress has the constitutional authority to write laws. What a  mockery and betrayal of that duty it would be to pass this stunt of a  bill that doesn't address a single priority of parents, bans books,  undermines teachers, and hurts our kids.   Democrats are the party of parents and families. We reject this bill,  and we commit to fighting for childcare, for universal pre-K, for a  child tax credit, and for the ability of people to be free for who they  are and express themselves.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two letters. One is from the  National Education Association, and one is from the American Federation  of Teachers.                                 National Education Association,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of       the National Education Association, dedicated and trusted       professionals who teach and support nearly 50 million       students in public schools across America, we urge you to       vote NO on H.R. 5. Votes related to this bill, including       extreme amendments that would create a national private       school voucher program, may be included in the NEA Report       Card for the 118th Congress.        H.R. 5 is unnecessary and ignores the partnerships that       exist between parents and educators. Parents and guardians       already have the right and the opportunity to partner with       educators to ensure students have the learning opportunities,       resources, and support for success. Across America, parents       are strategizing with educators when children face hurdles       and celebrating with them when students achieve milestones,       volunteering at events, chaperoning field trips, leading       PTAs, mentoring students, and actively engaging in many other       ways with students and educators.        In a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent of parents with       children in public K-12 schools said they were satisfied with       their children's education. Instead of building on what       exists, H.R. 5 would stoke racial and social animosity.       Instead of bringing us together to focus on what will really       help students--an inspiring, inclusive, and age-appropriate       curriculum that prepares them for the future in schools that       are safe from gun violence--H.R. 5 would encourage parents to       view educators as the enemy. This us-versus-them mindset       hurts students, disregards educators' professionalism, and       diverts our attention from a basic American value: All       students--no matter their race, ZIP Code, gender orientation,       sexual identity, or background--deserve the support, tools,       and opportunity to learn and succeed.        H.R. 5 dismisses educators' education, experience, and       dedication.        The legislation tells educators that, despite their       expertise, they cannot be trusted to determine what materials       are appropriate for learning, design curricula that are age-      appropriate and meet students' needs, or ascertain students'       progress. This will only exacerbate an educator shortage       that, from small towns to major cities, is now a five-alarm       fire. In an NEA survey last year, 55 percent of educators       said they are ready to leave the profession they love earlier       than planned. Congress should not pass laws that will       accelerate this trend.        H.R. 5 will exacerbate book banning and censorship.        The legislation's library requirements, including the       mandate that school libraries maintain online catalogs that       are available to parents and students, are redundant; this is       already standard practice. The real aim of the legislation is       to elevate the voices and power of a few who wish to foist       their ideas about what should be read and taught onto other       people's children. This is already leading to shocking       outcomes.        The PEN America Index of School Book Bans lists more than       2,500 instances of book bans across the country from June       2021-June 2022, affecting more than 1,600 titles. Affected       books are most often those that look honestly at history and       the difficult events that have shaped America, or tell       stories of the struggle for self-acceptance in hostile or       oppressive circumstances. The banned or censored books       include:        Maus, by Art Spiegelman, a graphic novel depicting the       experience of the author's father, a Holocaust survivor;        Walk Two Moons, by Sharon Creech, about a girl of Native-      American heritage coping with the disappearance of her       mother;        The Bluest Eye, by Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, about a       young African American girl's struggle to appreciate her       humanity in a culture that devalues her; and  [[Page H1352]]         Separate is Never Equal: Sylvia Mendez and her Family's       Fight for Desegregation, by Duncan Tonatiuh, about a family's       efforts to desegregate California schools.        We cannot prepare young people to succeed in our diverse       Nation and interconnected world by removing books from       library shelves and curricula. We prepare them for the future       by planting the seeds for lifelong curiosity and growth.        H.R. 5 will impose several unfunded mandates on already       overburdened schools and school districts.        Committee-passed amendments to H.R. 5 include one that       would require a ``review period,'' occurring at least every       three weeks for a minimum of three school days at a time,       during which parents could review any materials to be used in       the next three weeks, or that had been used in the past.       Districts would be required to find the money, and the time,       for this mandate within budgets and school days that are       already stretched thin.        H.R. 5 suggests the federal government should be a national       school board.        The bill would undermine local control and educators'       autonomy to do their jobs by inserting the federal government       as a national school board. In fact, the legislation actually       undermines the stated goal of H.R. 5. By utilizing the       federal government to pave the way for influencing what books       should be part of the curriculum and in libraries, H.R. 5       suppresses the voices of many parents and local communities       that want their children to receive an honest and accurate       education.        While we urge a NO vote on H.R. 5, we support any       amendments that highlight the many real needs schools face,       including those that: provide more resources for school       counselors and parent engagement; ensure books remain       available for any student who wants to read them; highlight       H.R. 5's true costs to local schools and ensure those costs       are not passed on to already resource-deprived schools; and       remove extraneous requirements.        We ask you to vote YES on the following amendments:        No. 1 by Rep. Bacon (No. 52 in Rules): Requires Local       Education Agencies to provide parents of a student in       elementary or secondary school with the number of school       counselors in the school);        No. 5 by Rep. Bonamici (No. 40 in Rules): Replaces H.R. 5       with new language regarding: public education and parents'       rights to access to public schools; creation of a parent       coordinator position in public schools; increased funding       authorization for Full-Service Community Schools; increased       funding authorization for Statewide Family Engagement       Centers; and establishing rules that prohibit bans on books       and curricular materials.        No. 8 by Rep. Fitzpatrick (No. 2 in Rules): Requires a GAO       report on the cost of H.R. 5's requirements to State       Education Agencies, Local Education Agencies, and schools.        No. 9 by Reps. Garbarino and D'Esposito (No. 37 in Rules):       Provides that nothing in H.R. 5 or its amendments be       construed as authorizing parents to deny any student who is       not their own child from accessing any books or other reading       materials otherwise available in the school library.        No. 12 by Rep. Jacobs (No. 4 in Rules): Strikes ``at no       cost'' in the bill to ensure that some requirements in H.R. 5       do not fall on overburdened schools that already lack       sufficient resources to meet the needs of students.        No. 13 by Rep. Jacobs (No. 6 in Rules): Strikes the       provisions relating to reviewing professional development       materials in sections 104 and 202.        We oppose amendments that target transgender youth,       eradicate inclusive curricula, potentially open our public       schools to frivolous lawsuits, create a national private       school voucher program, and eliminate the U.S. Department of       Education.        We ask you to vote NO on the following amendments:        No. 2 by Rep. Foxx (No. 45 in Rules): Manager's amendment       to the bill that also directs courts to use the strict       scrutiny test to evaluate laws involving parents' rights.        No. 3 by Rep. Boebert (No. 46 in Rules): Targets already       vulnerable transgender youth by amending Section 104 to       include Parent's Right to Know if their child's school       operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs or       activities to permit a person whose biological sex is male to       participate in an athletic program or activity that is       designated for women or girls.        No. 4 by Rep. Boebert (No. 47 in Rules): Targets already       vulnerable transgender youth by amending Section 104 to       include Parent's Right to Know if their child's school allows       a person whose biological sex is male to use restrooms or       changing rooms designated for women or girls.        No. 6 by Rep. Crane (No. 54 in Rules): Adds a private right       of action for parents beyond current law that may lead to       more frequent lawsuits, costing taxpayers more.        No. 11 by Rep. Hunt (No. 44 in Rules): Adds a provision       that targets diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in       schools.        No. 15 by Reps. Massie, Boebert, Gaetz, and Self (No. 7 in       Rules): Adds a sense of Congress that the authority of the       Department of Education and the Secretary of Education to       operate or administer any office or program related to       elementary or secondary education should be terminated on or       before December 31, 2023.        No. 19 by Rep. Roy (No. 57 in Rules): Creates a national       private school voucher program, decimating Title I and taking       public funds out of public schools to boost private schools       that are not held to any of the requirements included in the       underlying bill.        No. 20 by Rep Roy (No. 61 in Rules): Makes all funds       available under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of       1965 block grants, which will lead to cuts to key programs       serving students.        Educators are devoted to partnering with parents to       discover students' interests and unlock their potential. We       urge Congress to avoid spending time on divisive issues that       do not contribute to student success. Instead, please focus       on getting students the individualized support they need,       keeping guns out of schools, and addressing educator       shortages. If Congress joins with parents and educators, we       can support learning by ensuring that students across our       great Nation--no matter their race, background, sexual       orientation, or gender identity--have the resources, one-on-      one attention, and well-rounded curricula they need and       deserve. Please vote NO on H.R. 5.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                  American Federation of Teachers,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2023.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I write to express       our views on H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act.        Educators know that involving parents in their children's       education is essential to student success. We need parent and       family engagement, and we welcome Republicans' desire to be       engaged in strengthening parents' involvement in schools. We       have fought for parental engagement for generations, mostly       on a classroom, school and district level, where the       connection between parents and educators--the most important       adults in students' lives--is real. But we must do it right;       we can't make this work conditional on measures that will       hurt kids, hurt parents who disagree with these conditions,       or heap unnecessary burdens on educators' already-overflowing       plates. We must listen when teachers and parents tell us what       will actually help them, but we must also ensure we don't       make it harder for teachers to teach and students to learn.        The Parents Bill of Rights Act gets an A for branding, but       some of its provisions are genuinely concerning. The bill       fails to acknowledge what is already widespread practice in       schools--teachers collaborating with parents and families       every day to meet the needs of kids and their communities.       While it is great to reaffirm current law and practice       encouraging parental involvement in schools, why not build on       what Congress has already enacted, on a mostly bipartisan       basis, by considering what families need and what educators       need to support families. We embrace the desire of both       Democrats and Republicans to strengthen parental engagement.       And we encourage our representatives to spend more time in       the classroom with our members to see all the ways we engage       parents and where we could use support in helping our kids       succeed.        We are concerned about aspects of H.R. 5 that would require       schools to divert their limited resources from teaching kids       and open avenues for bad actors to censor education, ban       books and harm children who are just trying to be themselves       and live their lives in peace. That is why we support Rep.       Suzanne Bonamici's substitute amendment (No. 40) and urge its       adoption by the full House. This amendment keeps some of the       positive aspects of H.R. 5, and it amends the parts that       would hurt our most vulnerable students and make educators'       jobs harder, replacing them with measures that would invest       in and support student learning, a goal Democrats and       Republicans can all get behind.        The Bonamici amendment proposes a real pathway to improving       parental engagement by calling for parent coordinators and       increasing funding for family engagement centers and       community schools. It also removes parts of the bill that       would harm kids, eliminating measures that would target trans       kids and restrict the teaching of Black history; Latino       history; Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander       history; LGBTQIA+ history; women's history; Native American       history; and the history of the Holocaust or antisemitism.       And it would ban book bans, putting decisions about who is       allowed to read certain books in the hands of parents, not       the government. This would ensure that parents who want their       children to have access to books have the same rights as       parents who don't want their children reading particular       books.        While we are pleased that the Rules Committee provides for       consideration of the Bonamici substitute, it is disappointing       that the final rule does not allow for consideration of other       important amendments to H.R. 5 focusing on what our students       need, such as:        Providing parents with more leave so they can attend       parent-teacher conferences and school events;        Increasing students' access to mental health professionals;        Enacting gun safety measures that keep our kids safe and       protect parents from the unimaginable;        Supporting increasing starting teachers' pay to $60,000 a       year, so we can start addressing the teacher shortage;  [[Page H1353]]         Increasing funding to support our most vulnerable schools       and students;        Helping school districts recruit and train diverse teachers       to alleviate the teacher shortage; and        Increasing students' access to healthy meals.        We will outline our positions on the amendments made in       order in a subsequent message to the full House later today.        We want to ensure any action Congress takes supports, not       undermines, the capacity of schools and educators to fulfill       their responsibilities. And that is what parents and voters       want too. Our recent polling demonstrates clearly that voters       overwhelmingly reject the increasing polarization and       division in schools. Instead, voters favor solutions like       investing in public schools and providing educators with the       resources they need to create safe and welcoming       environments; boosting academic skills; and paving pathways       to career, college and beyond.        We are glad Republicans are thinking about parents and want       to address the issues keeping them up at night, but H.R. 5       fails to deliver on what parents want and kids need to       succeed. Our students and their families face new and       emerging challenges that the House should be focusing on       today, working to advance solutions that protect our Nation's       students, value our parents and support our educators.       Unfortunately, H.R. 5 does not meet that standard, and, at a       minimum, it must be amended to include the Bonamici       substitute.        Thank you for considering our views on these issues.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                        President, American Federation of Teachers.
