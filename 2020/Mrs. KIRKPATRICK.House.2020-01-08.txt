 Madam Speaker, this is a very emotional day for me.  This is the day, 9 years ago, that Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded  in Tucson, and Federal Judge John Roll was killed.   Gabby had been my mentor in the State legislature. She was somebody I  looked up to and admired. She had gone to Scripps College, and I was so  happy when my daughter Ashley got accepted at Scripps, because that is  where Gabby had gone. She is just outstanding in every single way and  remains so, and thank heaven for that.   I was a law clerk for Judge John Roll, another outstanding man. I  have to tell you, this is so personal for me. I grew up hunting in  rural Arizona, and I was a very strong advocate for the Second  Amendment--still am--but we have to do something about gun violence in  this country.   I thank my colleagues for standing here with me: Speaker Pelosi, the  Senators, and all of the Arizona delegation. We stand united today in  wanting to honor Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and Federal Judge  John Rolls.   I ask all to please rise for a moment of silence.    Madam Speaker, if I may, I want to mention the  other people who were killed that morning and wounded, and I yield to  my colleague Ruben Gallego to read the names.
