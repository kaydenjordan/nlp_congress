 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, I rise today to speak about the  historical and unprecedented wildfires that burned through southwest  Kansas last week. We had fires in 21 of our Kansas counties, roughly  one-fifth of our State. High winds and dry conditions caused fires of  the highest classification that blazed across central and western  Kansas some 30 to 40 feet high, burning more than 700,000 acres of  land, making this the largest wildfire in our State's history. The  Kansas Division of Emergency Management has said it could take weeks to  determine the full extent of devastation from the fires. Clark County,  KS, officials--that is the county that was the hardest hit--estimate a  devastating loss of anywhere from 3,000 to 9,000 head of cattle. That  is just in one county. As I indicated, Clark County was the hardest hit  by the windblown fires, with over 85 percent of the land in the county  consumed by these prairie fires. This is hundreds of thousands of acres  in one county and over 700,000 in regard to our State.   On Friday, I drove south from Dodge City, KS, through range and  ranchland I didn't even recognize. What used to be gently rolling  prairie, dotted with herds of cattle and crisscrossed by fencing, is  now reduced to blackened dust. Friends of mine lost their ranch when a  40-foot wall of fire roared out of the valley over the bluff and burned  out their operation. We have unimaginable damage to land and property,  but also heart-wrenching scenes of cattle and wildlife burned, wounded,  and wandering.   Many Kansans lost everything. According to Sheriff John Ketron of  Clark County, 31 houses and over 440,000 acres were burned there. We  have longtime friends there, John and Carol Swayze. We have known them  for years. John said with tears in his eyes: ``Pat, it took me 43 years  to build up this operation, and it took about an hour to take it all  down.'' Riding with Sheriff Ketron, we were assessing the town of  Ashland, where a volunteer firefighting force managed to save the town  when it became surrounded in flames. Some volunteers were fighting  fires elsewhere in the area and learned their own homes had been  engulfed and lost.   I met with brave people in the towns of Englewood and Ashland, KS, in  the heart of Clark County, who had just come through frightening  experiences fighting the unpredictable and unstoppable fires. Some were  out driving cattle away from the fires and had become separated from  loved ones. When the flames turned, they were left to pray for their  safety.   Kylene Scott, with the High Plains Journal, calls it ``the worst day  of her life.'' She wrote a courageous and honest account of the day. I  will read her words now:         I think I had them going the right way, then the wind       switched. Now I just don't know. When I heard the crack in my       husband's voice yesterday afternoon, I knew it was bad. He is       normally the calm, cool, collected one.        A family friend alerted him to the fire in Clark County       very near the Scott farm after we'd returned home from       burying my Dad yesterday.    Coming back from a funeral.         When they said the closest neighbor was being evacuated he       went as quickly as he could fearing for the cattle herd he'd       worked the last five years to build following the death of       his own Dad. I stayed behind with the boys at our house 40       miles away.        When the wind switched at my house from south/southwest to       the north, I began to worry even more and called him. At this       point he was waiting out the fire and smoke in the wheat       field, helplessly watching the house and barn burn. I wanted       to be at the farm so bad, but there wasn't much that could be       done. When he made it home unscathed I was pretty happy, but       sad at the same time. Knowing there was nothing we could do       to fix what it took for Mother Nature mere minutes to       destroy.        Fifty-two cows are on the farm, with about half or \3/4\ of       them with young calves. Most are accounted for. All the grass       is gone, as is the hay stockpile. He went and hauled water to       the cows this morning and some are scorched and others have       udders with burns. One cow was bawling for her missing calf.       ``Those poor mommas,'' was my text reply to him this morning.        I made my way early this afternoon to see the farm or       what's left of it with my own eyes. As bad as I wanted to be       down there, a piece of me dreaded the drive. The closer I got       to the farm, the worse it got. Blowing dirt, darkening skies       because of the dust and awful winds. I pulled in the drive,       like I had done a hundred times in the nearly 20 years I have       been part of the family, and I had to stop my vehicle. The       tears came and the heartbreak overwhelmed me.        I thought of the old white farm house with the wonderful       front porch, where my husband spent a large majority of his       childhood in and around. My fondest memory is when we'd stop       and see my husband's Grandma Pauline. She'd always have       something sweet to eat and a cold drink at the kitchen table.       The home had been around for 100 years and still had a large       portion of the family momentos in it. It was reduced to ashes       and rubble. All that's standing is the chimney.  [[Page S1762]]         I couldn't see the barn around the trees, but I again had       to stop and sit when I pulled around the corner. The barn.       The old barn with its red siding. I remember when my father-      in-law had it painted and how proud he was because it looked       so good. I remember when he laid the brick in front of the       tack room and built a new door for it. My boys explored every       inch of it when we worked calves last fall. You could       ``almost'' hear the horses munching in the stalls decades ago       when you stood in the center alley. Now it's just a charred       pile of tin.        I realize the house and barn are just buildings. Things can       be replaced. But dang, it's so hard to see it all reduced to       ashes and rubble. To see part of the Scott family history,       more than a hundred years, just be gone. Just like that. It's       hard.        We've had incredible friends and family offering help, hay       and feed, and it's heartwarming to know how much people care.       Like I heard an Ashland, Kansas resident on the news this       morning being interviewed, it's just what southwest Kansas       people do. Help and survive.    Here is a picture that was taken on Kylene and Spencer Scott's  wedding day in 2009 up here. It is a beautiful sight. Off in the  distance is the Clark County Lake. It is rolling hills, cattle country,  cattle, and grass. Looking at this picture now, it is not hard to  wonder how this land will come back to provide for so many, as it has  for generations of Kansas farm and ranch families whose sweat and blood  have produced for Kansas, our Nation, and, yes, the world, as well.   There is the other picture. They got married here. It was the  happiest day of their life. They saw this, and that became just about  the worst day of their life. And yet, having seen this devastation  firsthand, I don't wonder about Kansas and our ability to rebuild. It  is in our State motto: Ad astra per aspera--to the stars through  difficulties.   In one of the emergency management centers I met Joyce Edinger. When  I asked her what I could do to help, she just said: ``The Lord will  provide.'' She had lost virtually everything. I think that pretty well  sums it up. The faith of Kansans gives us courage to rebuild--the  courage to come through fire. Ashland banker Kendall Kay emotionally  said:         Senator, we are going to need help. We really don't want       it, but we are going to need it.    I am so proud of the people of my State who have come in with that  help before they were even asked. I had been in contact with all of our  producer groups in Kansas--the Kansas Livestock Association, the Kansas  Farm Bureau--who along with our State agencies had been leading the  voluntary relief effort. I commend them for their efforts in collecting  hay for cattle, as well as monetary donations, coming in from all parts  of the United States, and volunteer coordination for repairs to  property and fencing.   With Congressman Roger Marshall of the First Congressional District,  and my colleague here and friend in the Senate, Jerry Moran, we have  been in touch with the Department of Agriculture with regard to  assistance that should be available to farmers and ranchers in counties  that have suffered losses.   Here is what we are trying to fix. This fellow is walking across here  to that bluff that overlooks that valley that Spencer and Kylene looked  over, and this fellow here is Chad Tenpenny, my top guy in Kansas. That  is me with my hands in my pockets. It is pretty rough to see ground  like this that was grass and to look at the utter devastation. Folks,  when that wind blows and when that dust starts up again, we could be in  for even more trouble. So cleanup is under way, but we are trying to  get help to cut through the redtape and get a disaster declaration.   I talked to the Governor this afternoon. Primarily, it is the  Emergency Conservation Program, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and  Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, that are the key  programs. It won't make people whole by any means, but it will give  them hope. So cleanup is under way.   Kansas is a bootstrap State. It is not just about building new  fencing. We have families who have lost the farmhouse and all the  equipment they need to rebuild. Many livestock producers have had the  gruesome task of euthanizing cattle that have been badly burned. We  have to remove the carcasses. We have to find land for the survivors to  graze. And we have a lot of uncertainty. How long will it take for the  grasses to come back? When can we get rain to avoid a dust bowl? It is  really too soon to tell. But we have been through disasters before.  Almost 1 year ago, we had the Anderson Creek fire, and we have come  through tornadoes and ice storms. Recovery from disasters of this  magnitude, however, requires us to cut through the redtape. It requires  getting the right information to producers so they know how to apply  for aid and then to expedite it. Yes, it requires us to look at our  programs to see where we can improve them.    Now, this fire has not received much attention in the national media.  You see, we are a flyover State. All we do is produce food and fiber  for Kansas and our Nation and for a troubled and hungry world. But I do  want to commend members of the press in Kansas, especially photographer  Bo Rader of the Wichita Eagle, who took this photo of my State Director  Chad Tenpenny and me walking through rangeland outside of Ashland.   The Wichita Eagle has gone out of their way to show the world what  this fire looks like to real people. The Hutchison News, the High  Plains Journal, and the Dodge City Daily Globe have all told and are  telling this story. The same is true for the TV and the radio crews who  have helped get the news of town evacuations safety notices to our  people. This is what they do.   Rest assured that, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I  am committed to the Kansans I serve. They know me. I know them.   I know that Clark County and the other 20 counties will come back. We  will ensure they get the help they need. Ad astra per aspera--to the  stars through difficulty. It is not just a motto; it is who we are.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
