 Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, border  security is national security. That is why I rise today to speak on my  amendment No. 4236, to block President Biden's outrageous taxpayer- funded handouts to illegal immigrants who broke the law and entered our  country illegally.   At a time when American families are struggling because of  Bidenflation, when families are paying more for everything from gas to  groceries, to heating their homes, the President wants to give up to  hundreds of millions of your taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants as  a reward for breaking the law.   Don't forget, we still have a crisis on our southern border, and we  should be doing all that we can to secure our southern border, not  incentivize illegal immigration.   These taxpayer-funded handouts to illegal immigrants are outrageous,  and I would urge my colleagues to allow a vote on my commonsense  amendment.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to modify the request to include  my amendment No. 4236.    I object.
