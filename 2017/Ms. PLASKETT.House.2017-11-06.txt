 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to anchor this CBC Special Order hour. The Congressional Black Caucus,  under the leadership of the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), is  committed to sharing with this Congress, as well as with the American  people, the issues of great importance to the Caucus, to Congress, and  to the constituents we represent.   For this Special Order hour, at this time, we believe it is very and  vitally important to discuss the temporary protective status of Haiti  and other countries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs.  Love), to discuss this very important issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very much for  her moving words. I know that this is an issue that is very close to  her heart, being of Haitian-American descent, and we are grateful for  her leadership on this, being supportive of the letters to the  President, letters to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for her  working in a bipartisan fashion to support the people of Haiti as well  as other countries on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond),  the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who is leading us in this  discussion that is affecting the people of Haiti as well as other  countries, along with the President's tax plan and how it would affect  those Americans who are the least of us and would have the most  repercussions for that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. We  are grateful and thankful and proud to have him as the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, particularly in the time period that were  are in, because the energy and passion that he has for people of color  and for all Americans is extremely evident.   The fact that we are not having discussions that are based on  emotion, but really based on facts, digging more into policy and the  actual effects that those policies have on Americans and throughout  this country, is something that is what I think this Congress should be  driven by, rather than emotion or visceral reactions to actions that  people have that take our eyes off of the things that we should be  focused on.   We are grateful that he is continually not moved by the shiny object  that is in the room, but on the real bread-and-butter issues that  affect Americans. When he talks about the talent of the members of the  CBC, part of that talent is in its grounding, in those members of the  Congressional Black Caucus that have been engaged in this battle, in  this struggle, in this fight, that have had this passion for many  years.   I am happy to yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), who  has been at the forefront in fighting for people who have been  underserved not only in this country, but around the world. It is  through the work of this Member that individuals and countries in  Africa have been able to receive the support from this country as this  country was trying to pull it away in other parts of the world. We are  grateful for her doing it in her own backyard in California, but also  in those inner cities throughout this country and rural areas as she  sits on the Appropriations Committee to support Americans throughout  the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, as we give condolences to those  individuals in Texas, of course, we would be remiss not to give  condolences out to our colleague and one of the former chairs of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has lost one of  her siblings. We just want her to know that our prayers are with her  and with her family as they grieve, and we are there for the  gentlewoman throughout this mourning process and however she may need  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke).  The gentlewoman is my dear sister. She is a tireless champion of the  issues of Caribbean people throughout the United States and throughout  the world. Congresswoman Yvette Clarke is not just from New York, but,  in particular, Brooklyn. She knows how that is very dear to me having  been a child of Brooklyn myself.   Congresswoman Clarke's work and all the efforts she has made in being  one of the co-chairs of the Caribbean Caucus, being the member at large  of the Congressional Black Caucus, the work that the gentlewoman is  doing, and she has really forged a partnership with the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus as well as Mia Love to make sure that the  issue regarding Haiti, regarding the Haitians, and the temporary  protected status are here. It is because of the gentlewoman's work that  we are now having the Special Order hour and are continuing to push the  pressure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman to discuss with us, with the  American people, with this Congress, and with the Speaker how we should  be moving forward with the issues regarding the people of Haiti and how  extending the temporary protected status is not only good for the  Haitian economy, it is good for America as well.   I thank the gentlewoman for leading us in this effort.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the  U.S. Virgin Islands for her leadership on this matter, serving as co- chair for the Caribbean Caucus, and being an outspoken advocate and  fighter on behalf of the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands who are  still reeling from the two hurricanes that wreaked havoc on the three  islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands. I want to thank the gentlewoman for  organizing us this evening and really moderating what we all have to  say here today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concern for the more than  300,000 temporary protected status beneficiaries who are under attack  from this administration.   Temporary protected status was signed into law with bipartisan  support by President George H. W. Bush as part of the Immigration Act  of 1990. Since then, it has been used in roughly equal numbers by  Democratic and Republican Presidents alike. This program is based on a  simple idea that we can all agree upon: the idea that it is immoral to  send someone back to a country suffering from famine, disease, war, or  governmental collapse where they could reasonably expect to perish.   Today, instead, we, as a society, decided long ago as a humanitarian  gesture to extend ourselves as a safe haven and to temporarily allow  such people the ability to lawfully remain in the United States for up  to 18 months at a time and seek gainful employment as conditions in  their home countries would improve.    This is not citizenship, and this is not amnesty. Rather, it is a way  of protecting human life while allowing eligible individuals from  Haiti, Yemen, Honduras, Nicaragua, and numerous other countries across  the world to earn wages for themselves and their loved ones abroad.  Unfortunately, this administration's antipathy toward immigrants-- particularly immigrants of color--has found its way to some of the most  vulnerable amongst us and threatens the existence of this commonsense  program rooted in human decency and respect for life.   This program of agreement is now being totally undermined with real  lives hanging in the balance. For example, while it would seem obvious  to extend Haiti's temporary protected status in light of the  catastrophic 2010 earthquake, subsequent cholera epidemic, food  insecurity crisis, and the damage inflicted by Hurricanes Matthew,  Irma, and Maria, this administration only extended Haiti's status for 6  months in the month of May, while, at the same time, the administration  insinuated that Haitian TPS recipients were criminals.   The administration now appears ready to ignore the advice of Haiti  experts in the United States and the request of the Haitian Ambassador  by forcing some 50,000 Haitians to subject themselves to life- threatening conditions in Haiti. This would not just be tragic for  those forced to return, it would also be detrimental to Haiti's economy  which benefits significantly from the hard-earned remittances that  Haitian TPS beneficiaries send back to their loved ones. It is also no  way to treat a neighbor that is located less than a 2-hour flight away  from American soil, the most impoverished nation of the Western  Hemisphere. Indeed, such a decision would be cruel and unusual  punishment.   For this reason, I have worked with Congressman Cedric Richmond,  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and my colleagues of the  Congressional Black Caucus in sending a letter to Acting DHS Secretary  Elaine Duke, signed by the entire Congressional Black Caucus,  requesting a full 18-month extension of Haiti's TPS status. I also  asked that Acting Secretary Duke take the Haitian Ambassador up on his  invitation to visit Haiti and to see the conditions for herself.   However, Haiti is not the only country that clearly merits an  extension. Nearly 60,000 Hondurans and Nicaraguans currently await news  of their fate, as will thousands of other immigrants from Africa, Asia,  and the Middle East.  [[Page H8516]]    While I hope that Acting Secretary Duke will do the right thing and  make an evidence-based decision in light of the human cost to her  actions, our experience teaches us that we must also prepare for the  worst.   Where this administration refuses to respect decades of bipartisan  agreement, Congress must assert its constitutional powers and act to  safeguard human life and American interests. I, therefore, call upon my  congressional colleagues to come together and pass bipartisan  legislation that will protect the hundreds of thousands of TPS  beneficiaries from around the world--Black, brown, Asian and other--who  are, at this moment, relying upon us for their very lives.   Although we live in times of great division, now is the moment to  come together and recommit to the basic values that unite us all. This  country was founded upon the idea of human dignity, and TPS is yet  another test of whether we will be true to that idea or fall painfully  short. We must not fall short, but instead we must rise to the  occasion.   Mr. Speaker, TPS is something that falls within our purview to  address. It is my sincere hope that we will address this impending  crisis.   When I think about Haitians who are living here, many who, at this  stage, had children born in the United States, and many who are here  during the most productive time of their lives when they can work  because of their strength, their ability, and their intellect, it would  be a travesty to begin separating families and to wrench from these  individuals the opportunity to add value to our civil society while  undergirding the nation of their birth, the nation that many hope to  return to at the appropriate time by summarily excusing them from our  civil society.   Having said that, I, too, stand with my colleagues to extend on  behalf of Chairman Richmond, the executive officers, and members of the  CBC a heartfelt condolence in this season of bereavement to our dear  colleague, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, on the loss of her  sister. She remains in our prayers at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands,  once again, for her leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for the  insight she has given us into the conditions not only in Haiti but the  responsibility we have as Americans to our near neighbor, to a neighbor  which supported us during our own Revolution, and who was there for us  at the inception of the United States.   Haiti has been ravaged by so many natural disasters, and the benefit  that we are receiving and the benefit that so much of Haiti is  receiving from those individuals who are really industrious people here  in the United States is just bar none.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr.  Payne). Mr. Donald Payne has worked tirelessly on behalf of so many  people throughout the world as he sits on the Committees of Homeland  Security as well as Transportation and Infrastructure where he works on  issues related to developing and building. It has oversight in homeland  security and over the issues that affect us.   I am sure Congressman Payne has particular insight into how this  temporary protected status would affect the people of Haiti and what it  means to the security of this country to allow that temporary protected  status to be continued from the gentleman's perch on the Committee on  Homeland Security.                                time  2000     I thank the gentleman for the information that he has  shared with us, and, more particularly, for causing us to reflect on  who we are as Americans and what we stand for, and for reminding this  Congress and this House how we have a responsibility to those in need,  and that with greatness comes responsibility. Too whom much is given,  much is required. That requirement goes particularly to our neighbors.  We know that Haiti is, in fact, our neighbor. We have a responsibility  to be there for them.    I thank the gentleman for all that he is doing and how often he is  here for the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour to give us  information and give us time to reflect. I am extremely appreciative of  that. I thank the gentleman so much for all that he does for the  Congressional Black Caucus, for his steady reliability in being there  to support the issues that are important to the Caucus and to all of us  as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Francis Rooney of Florida). The  gentlewoman has 20 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings). She may be new to this Congress--this is her first  term, as a freshman--but she is not new to supporting issues that are  important to the American people. In her time in Florida, having served  as a public servant on the front lines for all of us and now here in  the Congress, she is continuing that work.   From her position on Homeland Security and particularly to border and  maritime security, this is an issue that she has great insight into. I  know that she has a large number of Haitians in her own community and  recognize the productivity that they provide, the stability that they  provide in the community, how embedded they are in that community.   We are grateful for the gentlewoman being here in part of this  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour on the issue of temporary  protected status for all countries--there are 30 countries and 300,000  individuals that have that--but, in particular, to the 50,000 Haitians  who are living in this country during this time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Demings so much for that  heartfelt appeal to the better senses of us, to the better angels  within us as Americans, but, also, just speaking practicably about what  this policy does not only for Haiti, but for us as Americans.   You know, you hear stories about most people, how this affects them.  We hear the larger numbers: 50,000 individuals from Haiti, 300,000  individual groupings from all other countries. We found out, a report  just came out, that Nicaragua will only have 12 additional months for  temporary protective status, while the conditions in Nicaragua have not  changed.   I heard a story about a woman, Joana Desir, one of the Haitians. On a  recent day in Manhattan, the 32-year-old home healthcare provider races  in between patients. By midday, she has already helped transport one of  her regular patients, a young girl with severe respiratory disease, to  school and visited two senior patients in their home. It is a hard job,  but she says it is rewarding.   ``Most of the immigrants that I know, they have a busy life like  me,'' she says. ``I leave home like 5:45 a.m. and sometimes get home by  like 9 p.m.''   Joana came to the U.S. in 2018 and was still in the U.S. when a  powerful  [[Page H8518]]  earthquake struck Haiti in 2010. Hundreds of thousands were killed, and  the Obama administration granted Haitians temporary protective status.  They were shielded from deportation and given work permits.   Critics say the temporary program for Haiti and others where  disasters and wars took place decades ago has become permanent and  amounts to a backdoor immigration policy. However, what we need to  understand is what is still going on in Haiti right now.   Why this also makes sense for us is that it is estimated by the think  tank Inter-American Dialogue that all Haitians abroad this year--this  year alone, Mr. Speaker--will send home $2 billion in remittances to  that country. That is nearly equal to Haiti's annual operating budget,  that $2 billion. The money that the Haitians that are living in the  United States and sending back home is keeping that economy afloat.  Without the money that the Haitians in the United States, in America,  are providing, there would be a complete collapse in the country of  Haiti, which would then create additional cataclysmic work that we, as  Americans, would need.   We talk about immigrants trying to come into this country. We talk  about the collapse of infrastructure, the collapse of an economy that  will happen if the Haitians who are still living here in the United  States under temporary protective status with jobs are caused to leave.   On May 24, the Department of Homeland Security redesignated Haiti for  6 months of temporary protective status rather than the full 18 months.  It is important to understand that, because of that smaller amount of  time, Haitians still have to apply. It costs almost $2,000 to apply for  an extension of a visa. These people are in flux as to whether or not  they should continue to apply.   In a letter sent on Friday, November 3, the Congressional Black  Caucus urged the Department of Homeland Security once again to fully  extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23  deadline in light of the aforementioned conditions in Haiti, as well as  the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which has exacerbated  these conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that letter from the  Congressional Black Caucus for others to see.                                     Congressional Black Caucus,                                                   November 3, 2017.      Hon. Elaine C. Duke,      Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington,           DC.        Dear Acting Secretary Duke: On May 24, the Department of       Homeland Security re-designated Haiti for 6 months of       Temporary Protected Status, rather than the full 18 months       requested by the Government of Haiti, Haiti experts in the       United States, the Congressional Black Caucus, and others.       This decision was against the weight of the facts on the       ground, which included Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera       epidemic, and the ongoing challenges posed by the       unprecedented 2010 earthquake. We write again to encourage       DHS to fully extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by       the November 23 deadline in light of the clear conditions       that justify such continued treatment, including the damage       caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which has exacerbated       these conditions.        As recently as October 4, 2017, the Haitian Ambassador to       the United States wrote to you to formally request a full 18-      month re-designation in light of the ongoing economic and       humanitarian conditions that Haiti's citizens face each day.       In that letter, the Ambassador explicitly stated that the       goal of this request was to allow Haiti to recover from the       effects of the earthquake, cholera epidemic, and Hurricanes       Matthew, Irma, and Maria so as to continue with Haiti's       recovery efforts and to become more independent of American       assistance in the long term. The Ambassador also graciously       invited you to visit Haiti and see such conditions for       yourself. A government does not undertake such action lightly       and this request should merit considerable weight.        A recent independent statutory analysis of Haiti's       qualification for TPS confirmed the validity of the       government's concerns, finding that the conditions that       justified Haiti's 2011 re-designation remain. The analysis       found that nearly 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010       earthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely       remain unofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate       shelters. The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by       international efforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled       following Hurricane Matthew and is expected to directly       affect more than 30,000 people by the end of 2017. Hurricane       Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in Haiti,       placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--      in the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis. Based on       these clear facts, the analysis rightfully concluded that it       is in the best interest of Haiti and the United States to re-      designate Haiti for another 18 months of TPS because it       continues to face extraordinary and temporary conditions       stemming from the 2010 earthquake and worsened by subsequent       events that justify such relief.        Despite these serious challenges, the Haitian government       has been working diligently for years to improve its economy,       public health conditions, and infrastructure in coordination       with the United States government and international       community. In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in       large part on remittances that its citizens receive from TPS       beneficiaries in the United States. Therefore, the negative       consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS designation would be       twofold. It would end essential remittances that       significantly contribute to Haiti's recovery while also       forcing the poorest republic in the Western Hemisphere to       absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens all at       once. Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery       efforts and run counter to Congressional efforts to improve       American relations in the region through the recently-passed       United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act (Public Law       114-291).        Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS       beneficiaries directly contribute to the United States. They       pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and       Medicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous       sectors, such as the restaurant and food service,       construction, and hospitality industries. About 30 percent of       TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the real estate       industry and contributing to the local property tax base.       Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is       self-employed, meaning they not only create jobs for       themselves, but likely create jobs for others. A recent       report found ``that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost       America $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross domestic       product.        For these reasons, we urge you in the strongest terms to       take advantage of the full amount of time granted by Congress       to study the conditions on the ground and reach the only       appropriate decision--a full 18-month re-designation of       Haiti's TPS designation.            Sincerely,          Cedric L. Richmond, Chair, Congressional Black Caucus;             Yvette D. Clarke, Chair, CBC Immigration Working Group;             Cory Booker, U.S. Senator; Kamala D.

Donald McEachin, Member of             Congress.     Mr. Speaker, in that letter, which is signed by all of  the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who are members in both  the Democratic as well as Republican caucus, Members in the House as  well as the Senate, we urge Secretary Duke that the Ambassador to Haiti  has explicitly stated that the goal of the request was to allow Haiti  to recover from the effects of the earthquake, a cholera epidemic, and  Hurricanes Matthew, Irma, and Maria.   Matthew struck Haiti in 2016 of last year. Of course you are aware of  Irma and Maria. We Americans, unbeknownst to ourselves and the work  [[Page H8519]]  that we have done, also exacerbated food insecurity in Haiti by placing  individuals, causing the cholera epidemic that is there. Unbeknownst to  ourselves, when we came there to give support to Haiti, we Americans  brought the cholera epidemic that is now ravaging Haiti and has taken  about 10,000 people.   Additionally, Hurricane Matthew exacerbated the food insecurity  crisis in Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians, 22 percent of the  population, in the grips of an acute food security crisis.   I have many Haitians who are in my community in the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and we count them as some of our hardest workers, and we  recognize the impact that sending so many of these people back would  have not only on the loss of jobs here and the work that those  individuals are doing in the United States, but on the economy of Haiti  itself.   There is no infrastructure that will support the 50,000 people going  back to Haiti at this time, and that economy will probably completely  collapse without the remittances that the Haitians who are living in  the United States would be able to bring to that country.   Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS  designation would be twofold: such actions would be catastrophic to  Haiti's recovery efforts and run counter to congressional efforts to  improve American relations in the region through the recently passed  United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act, Public Law 114-291.   So the 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan, Haitian, and Salvadoran  immigrants await a mass deportation decision on temporary protective  status, and we are requesting--we are urging, Mr. Speaker--that this  Congress would continue to urge the Department of Homeland Security,  and use our own powers, to ensure the safety of those individuals,  ensure the safety of the stability of the economies of our near  neighbors, of Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador, and urge the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security for their protections not to  expire and not to put these people into difficult choices of returning  to countries that still face many of the same extraordinary conditions  that led to the initial grant of TPS or remaining in the United States  without lawful immigrant status.   We believe that this is the right thing to do, that this Congress  wants to do the right thing, that the Trump administration's 2018  proposed budget cut, budget request to Congress, for example, proposes  to reduce foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to levels not  seen since 2001. Because of that, the remittances of these individuals  is even more important. Remittances from the United States to El  Salvador equal $4 billion; Honduras, $3.3 billion; to Haiti, almost $2  billion. Using GDP estimates from the World Bank, remittances make up  more than 15 percent of the GDP for El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti.   Therefore, if we are going to reduce the budget in terms of foreign  aid to these countries, it is important that we do not allow the  collapse of these countries. It will not only bring economic collapse,  but we know it is very likely to bring political anarchy and political  disruption, as well, to countries that are instable as they are,  countries where we are looking to bring stable democratic governments.  Ensuring that individuals are allowed to stay here in this country and  provide those remittances, provide the support that is necessary to  grow those economies, embed democratic ideals, will be most beneficial  to us and to ensure the stability of the Western Hemisphere at this  time.   Mr. Speaker, this is an imperative that is important to this country,  imperative to the United States, and we are grateful that we have had  this time to share this information with you, with the American people,  with this Congress. We are urging our colleagues, urging Members of  this Congress, to work with members of the Congressional Black Caucus,  individuals you have heard tonight, Mia Love, Cedric Richmond, Yvette  Clarke, Donald Payne, Val Demings, Barbara Lee, all the members of the  Congressional Black Caucus and others who urge that this support be  enacted not only by the Department of Homeland Security, but by this  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee, I rise  today to express my strong objection to the announced intention by the  Trump Administration not to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for  Haiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.   On May 24, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) re- designated Haiti for 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS),  rather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of Haiti,  Haiti experts in the United States, and the Congressional Black Caucus,  among others.   DHS' decision did not reflect the realities on the ground in Haiti,  which include Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera epidemic, and the  ongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented 2010 earthquake.   In a letter sent this past Friday, November 3, 2017, the  Congressional Black Caucus urged DHS, once again, to fully extend  Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23, 2017 deadline  in light of the aforementioned conditions in Haiti, as well as the  exarcerbated damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   In a report published in October 2017, the highly regarded Global  Justice Clinic concluded that conditions justifying Haiti's  qualification for TPS in 2011 remain as acute today as they were then.   The study also found that 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010  earthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely remain  unofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate shelters.   The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by international  efforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled following Hurricane  Matthew and is expected to directly affect more than 30,000 people by  the end of 2017.   Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in  Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--in  the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.   The Haitian government has been working diligently for years to  improve its economy, public health conditions, and infrastructure in  coordination with the United States government and international  community.   In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in large part on  remittances that its citizens receive from TPS beneficiaries in the  United States.   Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS  designation would be twofold.   It would end essential remittances that significantly contribute to  Haiti's recovery while also forcing the poorest republic in the Western  Hemisphere to absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens  all at once.   Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and  run counter to Congressional efforts to improve American relations in  the region through the recently-passed United States-Caribbean  Strategic Engagement Act (Public Law 114-291).   Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS beneficiaries  directly contribute to the United States.   They pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and  Medicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous sectors,  such as the restaurant and food service, construction, and hospitality  industries.   About 30 percent of TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the  real estate industry and contributing to the local property tax base.   Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is self- employed, meaning they not only create jobs for themselves, but also  create jobs for others.   A recent report found that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost  the United States economy more $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross  domestic product.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be both smart and compassionate when it comes  to extending TPS for Haiti.   The compassionate thing to do is extend TPS for Haiti.   But just as important, extending TPS for Haiti is the smart thing to  do because it strengthens the American economy and advances the  national interests of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I also join my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus in drawing attention to the Republican Leadership's latest plan  to hurt the American taxpayers, especially those who did not support  the President during the election.   The Republican tax cut would result in the biggest increase in the  deficit by any President in the history of the United States, likely  growing it by the annual sum of $1 trillion from now on.   Some may wonder if the President would stoop to punishing people  because they did not vote for him--I would point them to the Republican  Tax Proposal and say the answer is found in the 429 pages of H.R. 1,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  [[Page H8520]]    Americans who send their children to private school will be able to  do so--at the expense of taxpayers who send their children to public  schools courtesy of the Republican tax cut plan.   The Republican Tax plan amends Title 26 of the United States Code  Sec.  529 that deals with Qualified tuition programs.   The Code was intended to encourage persons to attain higher education  and provide incentives for persons who pursue doctorates.   Most people know that going back to school to obtain a degree is a  difficult choice to make with full time jobs and family obligations.   Having a degree can substantially increase income and provide choices  that would otherwise be unattainable to the recipient of advanced  degrees.   The benefit to the economy and our nation's leadership in the  sciences rests with the number of people who attain undergraduate and  graduate degrees.   The Republicans have gone into this section 529 of the tax code and  extended the tax write-offs to those sending their children to K-12  private schools.   Other ways the Republican Tax bill hurts taxpayers who pursue college  educations for themselves or their children.   Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit;   Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction;   Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;   Repeal of educational assistance program;   Termination of private activity bonds; and,   Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at private colleges and  universities.   The Republican leadership of the House is also causing problems for  private sector investments in Colleges and Universities.   The tax bill threatens tax write offs for donations to colleges and  universities and will limit tax credits associated with university- industry partnerships.   The Republicans claim that their Child Tax Credit proposal would help  working families, but it simply does not do enough.   The House tax plan proposes a nonrefundable $600 increase in the  Child Tax Credit (CTC), and would make more families earning six  figures eligible to claim the CTC.   This proposal wouldn't help the women who need it most.   In addition, whatever benefits this CTC proposal would provide pales  in comparison to those that would be received by the wealthy and  corporations under this tax plan.   The bill cuts taxes for major corporations who already pay far less  than their fair share.   Republicans claim that economic growth will more than pay for the  lost revenue but we've tried this before.   When trickle-down economics fails again and this bill explodes the  nation's deficit, Republicans will call for huge spending cuts to  critical programs that hardworking Americans depend on to make ends  meet.   The plan's negative impact on the Lone Star state would be  particularly hard.   Independent analyses show the Republican plan would actually raise  taxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of  households next year.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a  $794.00 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on  families struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   According to the IRS, 23 percent of tax filers, or 2.8 million Texas  households, deduct their state and local taxes with an average  deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower  home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues  they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.   Placing further strains on middle-class Texans is the elimination of  the personal exemption, which deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and  dependent on a return from taxable income.   In 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the  Lone Star State.   The GOP's reckless and irresponsible tax plan is made all the more  obscene by its disproportionate and immoral handouts to the wealthiest  few.   According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,  millionaires in Texas, 0.31 percent of filers in 2015 would receive  almost 57 percent of the benefits from the tax plan.   Texans deserve a tax plan that puts working and middle class families  first, not more deficit-exploding tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires.   We need bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, fuels economic  growth, and puts more money into the pockets of hard-working American  families.   A recent Pew Research Center report found little support for cutting  taxes for high-income households, which is defined as more than  $250,000 or large businesses and corporations.   In fact, 43 percent favored raising taxes on high-income households  and 52 percent said corporate taxes should be raised.   The Republicans persist with their scheme of raising taxes on hard- working middle class families to pay for tax cuts for the rich.   It is reckless to explode our deficit which according to the Tax  Policy Center, would skyrocket by $2.4 trillion over the first decade.   The wealthy must pay their fair share, but the GOP tax scheme offers  them a free lunch at the expense of those who are most in need of a  helping hand.   The power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives and it  is our job to make sure that the American People are treated fairly.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, November 7, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
