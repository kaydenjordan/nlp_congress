 Madam Speaker, I rise today to invite my colleagues to  join my call designating September 2019 as School Bus Safety and  Security Month.   Earlier this month, I introduced a resolution to honor and show my  appreciation to the more than half a million school bus drivers across  the country.   Over 26 million children rely on public school transportation to get  them safely to and from school each year, and September is the perfect  month to thank these drivers for keeping our kids safe as they return  to school.   In rural districts like Colorado's Third Congressional District, many  of these drivers find themselves driving great distances facing  inclement weather, wildlife, and other hazards that make driving  difficult, yet they work tirelessly to ensure safe transportation of  our children.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to commend the Child Safety Network  for their 30 years of commitment to America's children and promoting  this resolution. I am truly appreciative of their advocacy on behalf of  school safety, and I thank my colleagues who have joined as cosponsors  for this important resolution.                            ____________________
