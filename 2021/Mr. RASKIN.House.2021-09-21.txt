 Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the  Women's Health Protection Act.   Today in Texas a law has been put into place that transforms  essentially everyone in the country into potential bounty hunters who  can go and collect $10,000 by reporting on doctors, nurses, or family  members who helped a woman exercise her constitutional right to seek an  abortion in consultation with her physician.   There is not even an exception for rape and incest under the  draconian Texas anti-abortion law. A 15-year-old girl could be raped by  her farther or her uncle and then have her mother go and take her to  get an abortion, and the rapist--her father or uncle--could sue them  for $10,000. Or anybody could sue them for $10,000.   We need to codify Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey to  guarantee the constitutional rights of women against the new onslaught  against reproductive freedom and women's healthcare in the United  States.                            ____________________
