 Mr. President, I wish to offer my most sincere  appreciation and gratitude to Erika K. Lunder, legislative attorney  with the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service,  CRS. Erika will be leaving CRS on June 22, 2018, after 15 years of  dedicated and selfless service to CRS and Congress. She was a trusted  adviser on tax law to Members on both sides of the aisle, and her  guidance and counsel will be deeply missed by me and many of my  colleagues.   Throughout her time at CRS, Erika provided substantial legislative  support to Members of Congress and congressional staff who often turned  to her for analysis, brainstorming, and consultation on various aspects  of tax law. Erika covered all aspects of tax law, from individual to  corporate to international, and in connection with every subject on  which Congress legislates, from health and energy policy, to campaign  finance, immigration, and veterans. Her work in these areas included  assisting Congress with interpretations of current and proposed law,  explaining case law and legal developments, and analyzing legislative  proposals at various stages of the process. Erika's work was used by  Congress in hearings, legislative development, markups, and  preconference negotiations.   Erika was a tireless worker who never said no to a request and was  always willing to make herself available, on a moment's notice, 7 days  a week, to help inform the policy process. She was able to describe and  distill the most complex and opaque tax law concepts in layman's terms  in both her writing and her oral consultations to her clients.   During her time at CRS, Erika contributed her tax law expertise in  support of major pieces of tax legislation that were enacted into law,  as well as issues that are still the subject of congressional debate,  such as the taxation of internet sales.   Erika's extensive knowledge of tax law and her keen ability to frame  and analyze issues of paramount concern to Congress often made her the  primary point of contact for congressional staff. In addition, Erika  was an invaluable resource to her colleagues at CRS, working at some  time or another with almost everyone in the Service, providing her tax  law expertise in combination with their legal and policy expertise in  other areas. I thank her for her service to Congress and the Nation and  wish her all the best.                            ____________________
