 Mr. Speaker, in 2017, the Gulf region experienced  one of the greatest catastrophic floods and hurricanes in our history:  Mr. Speaker, 51 trillion gallons of water. Neighborhoods that have  never flooded, flooded. People in desperate conditions, reservoirs  breaking, dams breaking.   And I knew that we had to rescue them. I introduced the first  Hurricane Harvey legislation: $174 billion.   But, Mr. Speaker, there was a group that I did not want to forget  because I know that they are entrepreneurs, and that is why I  established the small business grant program, modeled after 9/11, that  now has come into fruition with $100 million. I will go home and  announce this to my local community.   The grants are grants and not loans--unique. They are not like the  SBA. They are grants. We fought for that from the Federal Government  all the way down to the State government.   I am asking my constituents to meet me in Houston at 2 p.m. for a  grand announcement in order for the small businesses still impacted by  Hurricane Harvey to get grant relief, money that is not a loan, and I  am fighting for those loans to be small enough to help all of our small  entrepreneurs.                            ____________________
