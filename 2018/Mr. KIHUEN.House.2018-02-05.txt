 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Andrea  Castilla. Andrea was a daughter, sister, and a friend. She went to the  Route 91 music festival in Las Vegas to celebrate her 28th birthday  with her friends, her family, and her boyfriend,  [[Page H767]]  Derek. Derek had planned to propose to Andrea that night.   She had a passion for makeup and hoped to use this passion to help  cancer patients feel beautiful. Andrea will always be remembered for  her free spirit and positive outlook.   I would like to extend my condolences to Andrea's family and friends.  Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
