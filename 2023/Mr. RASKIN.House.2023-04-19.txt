 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The good chairman of the committee invoked the name of Mayor Muriel  Bowser, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, who sent us a letter  with the chairman of the D.C. City Council, Phil Mendelson, which  closes this way: ``Not only should our policy decisions not be  overturned by officials not elected to represent our residents, but  piecemeal interference hurts our ability to confront crime and improve  public safety in the District of Columbia.''    What is this about, Mr. Speaker? H.J. Res. 42 seeks to nullify a law  passed  [[Page H1853]]  unanimously by the Council of the District of Columbia to promote  accountability for police officers who use excessive force or abuse  their power, a goal that the vast majority of Americans share.   The D.C. law banned the use of choke holds and other dangerous neck  restraints and set reasonable standards on the use of deadly force. It  required the public release of body-worn camera footage and created a  police officer misconduct database for officers who have been convicted  of a crime or had allegations against them civilly or administratively  sustained. It prohibited D.C. from hiring officers who have engaged in  criminal or official misconduct.   Most importantly for these purposes, Mr. Speaker, the new law  empowered the chief of police to fire or discipline officers who break  the law by removing police disciplinary matters from the control of  arbitrators under collective bargaining. This is the provision that  galvanized opposition to the bill from the police union, the key  provision that has now led our colleagues to want to convert the  Congress of the United States into the largest city council in the  world, a 535-member city council with the job of micromanaging and  superintending the work of the 13-member Council of the District of  Columbia.   The local police union hates this provision, which is their right, of  course. Their chief has been the chief lobbyist against Washington,  D.C., on this law. He was the key GOP witness in the Oversight  Committee hearing on the law.   His union sued when the legislation was first passed, asserting that  it violated the U.S. Constitution not to subject the discipline of  police officers to an outside arbitrator. They lost in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia, they lost in the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the Supreme Court  did not grant cert. Still, the union is running TV ads against this law  and has obviously found friends on that side of the aisle.   Now, in their eagerness to kick around the more than 700,000  taxpaying American citizens who live in Washington, D.C., but have no  voting representation in the House of Representatives or in the U.S.  Senate, our colleagues are embracing a claim that puts them in favor of  an extreme police union position on discipline that jurisdictions  across America are debating and many of them are rejecting.   Why? Well, D.C. is a good example. Before passage of this law that  they propose to repeal, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department had  been forced by labor arbitrators to rehire a significant number of  policemen and -women who had been fired for engaging in serious  criminal misconduct. Here are some examples of the officers who were  fired but the department was forced to reinstate by an arbitrator.   One officer illegally struck a suspect multiple times in the head.  The officer was criminally tried and convicted of criminal assault,  sentenced to 30 days in jail, 3 years of probation, and 500 hours of  community service. Despite strong opposition from the police  department, he was reinstated by an arbitrator.   Another officer, off duty at the time, sexually assaulted a woman and  was convicted of misdemeanor sex abuse and sentenced to a 100-day  suspended sentence and a year of probation. Despite strong opposition  from the department, he was reinstated to the force by an arbitrator.   Another off-duty police officer confessed to abusing a child. The  officer was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 5 years of  probation. Despite strong opposition from the department, he was  reinstated, as well.   Every D.C. police chief for at least the last 25 years has expressed  outrage about the old system of having to rehire bad cops after they  had been fired for perpetrating serious misconduct against the people  of Washington, D.C.   Former D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham openly lamented that he had to  allow ``very bad police officers back onto our department.''   Former Police Chief Charles Ramsey said this: ``It is demoralizing to  the rank and file who really do not want to have those kinds of people  in their ranks. It causes a tremendous amount of anxiety in the public.  Our credibility is shot whenever these things happen.''   The current D.C. Police Chief, Robert Contee, says that giving the  police the power over discipline reduces the risk of returning poor  performers to the force.   Forcing police chiefs to reinstate bad cops fired for breaking the  law is bad for public safety, it is bad for community morale, and it is  bad for the morale of the vast majority of good cops who are doing  their job.   It is also bad for taxpayers. Between 2010 and 2020, The Washington  Post found that D.C. paid out $91 million to resolve claims of police  brutality and misconduct. The taxpayers are also on the hook for  backpay that was paid out to bad cops who were fired for this  misconduct when they were rehired following the ruling of an  arbitrator.   In a recent 5-year period, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department  was forced to rehire 36 officers. According to an Office of the D.C.  Auditor report, D.C. had to pay $14.3 million in backpay to these  convicted and disciplined officers.   The question of whether police chiefs or arbitrators should be the  ones to decide to put disciplined cops back on the force is a matter  for local decisionmaking in Washington as it is in every other  jurisdiction in the country.   Mr. Speaker, 700,000 taxpaying American citizens have decided through  their elected representatives that the chief of police, who is  appointed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, should be the one  to be able to discipline bad actors within the police department.   Reversing the D.C. government on this local matter is outrageous  interference by Congress to impose a bad public policy on the Capital  City.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just a few points about the last contribution from the  gentleman from Georgia.   Georgia reported 892 murders in the last year, the fourth highest in  the country. He said that Washington, D.C., is overrun by violent  criminals. The only time I have seen an institution overrun by violent  criminals was here in the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, an event  that that gentleman described as a tourist visit and has consistently  likened to a tourist visit. I don't know that he is going to be the  best and most reliable witness for determining when an institution is  being overrun by violent criminals.   The rhetoric I hear from the Freedom Caucus is about defunding the  FBI and defunding the ATF. No one on our side of the aisle is talking  about defunding any of them or defunding the police. On the contrary,  we have advanced initiatives to increase local government funding for  police and other services.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  for her eloquent remarks and also for making the specific point that  the D.C. reform legislation is perfectly congruent with the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which we passed in the 117th Congress.   In fact, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act goes further than  D.C. went. D.C. did not touch qualified immunity, which was something  that was dealt with in the Federal legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to correct one other piece of  misinformation that was left by the gentleman from Georgia. He said  that it is against the law under the D.C. law for a police officer to  touch someone's neck. That is not the definition of the law against  choke holds and neck restraints.  [[Page H1855]]    It requires the use of any body part or object by law enforcement  against a person with the purpose, intent, or effect of controlling or  restricting the person's airway or severely restricting the person's  breathing. That does not involve just touching a person's neck.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania for her remarks, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  D.C. (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her point, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, control over local police is an essential facet of  political self-government and home rule. The people of Washington,  D.C., through their representatives, need to be able to control their  own local police. They also need to control their judges.   The problem, of course, is that right now the District of Columbia is  caught betwixt and between. The people have made clear that they want  to become a State. They organized a State and constitutional  convention. They have petitioned for admission to the Union and are  asking the Congress of the United States under Article IV of the  Constitution to exercise our powers to admit them as a State and to  redraw the boundaries of the Federal District given our exclusive power  and our comprehensive power under the District clause to do that.   In fact, in 1846, Congress redrew the boundaries of the District of  Columbia in order to retrocede to Virginia lands there, and that was  perfectly constitutional. Today Congress can exercise its powers under  Article I, section 8, clause 17 to modify the boundaries of the Federal  District to cede the residential lands to the new State that is  petitioning for admission to the Union.   The House of Representatives in the last two Congresses voted to  admit the District of Columbia, or Washington, D.C., as the new State.  The Senate did not act, yet their statehood drive continues.   Alas, our colleagues, rather than trying to help propel another State  into the Union and to allow them to gain equal footing with all of the  other States instead decides to try to micromanage their local affairs  and to drive them back into some kind of semi-colonial status that they  thought they had left behind many decades ago.   So the real question for the Congress of the United States is: Will  we do for the people of Washington, D.C.--taxpaying, draftable citizens  who have served in every war that the Republic has ever fought going  back to the American Revolution--will we treat them the same way that  we treated the people of 37 other States who were admitted by the  original 13?   That is the dynamic of enlargement of democracy that was contemplated  by the Framers of the Constitution and the Founders of the country.  They did not want there to be large, colonized, and subjected  populations subject to the will of other people for precisely the kind  of reason that is on display today.   There is no reason why the local government of Washington should be  lorded over and superintended by other people's Representatives no  matter how well-intended they may be or how politically intended they  may be or how malevolently intended they may be. The Framers of the  Constitution and the people who fought the American Revolution rejected  the idea of virtual representation.   That was the claim of the crown and the Parliament. They said: You  don't need your own representatives because you are represented by  people in Parliament who will be able to take into account your  interests.   The revolutionaries rejected that saying that in real democracy  people get to choose their own representatives, and those  representatives elect their own council and their own mayor, and they  get to choose their own police chief. They get to make their own  decisions.   So really what we see today is a drama that reenacts the basic  struggle for democratic self-government in our country. This is a  chapter in that drama, but it will lead eventually--it must lead--to  the admission of Washington, D.C., as a new State the way that 37 other  States were admitted by the original 13, including my own Maryland,  because those original States understood the logic of democratic  equality and freedom in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the multiple provisions constituting the D.C. police  reform law are mainstream, commonsense reforms unanimously passed by  the Council of the District of Columbia which enjoyed strong public  support and are perfectly congruent not only with the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House in the 117th Congress,  but also with police accountability laws enacted by dozens of States  and localities in recent years in the wake of notorious episodes of  police brutality like the murder of George Floyd.   For example, since May of 2020, at least 24 States have enacted  legislation to limit the use of dangerous neck restraints against  citizens. Thirty-nine States have passed reforms related to officer  education and training. Since May of 2020, 26 States have enacted laws  to improve data collection and police transparency. At least seven  States, including Arizona, Colorado, and Wisconsin, have enacted laws  requiring the creation of public databases on use-of-force information.   States like Colorado, South Carolina, and Maryland have mandated  adoption of body-worn cameras statewide. At least 20 States have  enacted laws that address State-level use-of-force standards.   This joint resolution of disapproval is an attack on local  decisionmaking, federalism, and the policies of oversight and  accountability that Americans clearly want and that our committee as  the oversight committee should be championing.   This resolution would result not only in less political democracy in  America but less official oversight and accountability over policing in  the Capital City. It is amazing to me that our colleagues will not even  have a hearing on the desire of Washington with 700,000 taxpaying but  unrepresented Americans to join the Union as a State, but they will  mobilize all their energy to strip from the local D.C. police chief the  power to discipline cops who commit crimes.    There seems to be no end to our colleagues' willingness to undermine  good police work in Washington. Last month the most memorable thing  they have done so far in the new Congress, Committee Republicans  visited more than 20 January 6 insurrectionists living in D.C. jail-- the vast majority of whom are there because they were convicted of or  charged with violently assaulting our police officers. Our colleagues  liken the extremists who attacked our police officers to political  prisoners--people like Nelson Mandela, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and  Alexei Navalny. Those are people charged with ideological offenses  against authoritarian regimes.   These prisoners they visited were charged with, and in many cases  convicted of, violently assaulting American police officers.   This month now Republicans want to overturn a local law that allows  the chief of police in D.C. to keep cops who commit crimes like drug  dealing or sexual assault off the force. I don't blame the people of  Washington or Ms. Norton for telling them to keep their hands off D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    May I inquire how much time is remaining, Mr. Speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas I think makes the essential  point which is the people of Washington and their representatives are  governing in their best interests. That is the essential gamble of  democracy.   This is why American federalism is such a beautiful thing. The laws  in Kentucky passed by the colleagues of my friend, the chairman of our  committee, the laws in California, the laws in Alaska, the laws in  South Carolina, and the laws in Washington, D.C., differ in certain  ways. That is how federalism works.   It is a massive insult, indignity, and affront to the people of  Washington, D.C., to pull the rug out from beneath their comprehensive  effort to develop good policing in Washington, D.C.   There are lots of States and jurisdictions with higher crime rates.  There are lots with lower crime rates. That is neither here nor there.  Democracy is not something you earn by virtue of the crime rate or the  inflation rate or the employment rate. Democracy is something you earn  by virtue of natural rights that we have recognized under our  Constitution, which is why our Constitution begins with the words ``We  the People.''   The people of Washington, D.C. don't have complete rights yet, which  is why they are fighting for statehood. The last thing we should be  doing is driving them back to the worst days, which as former Speaker  Pelosi evoked, when Congress micromanaged every little thing that took  place in Washington.                                time  1300    It is not fair to the people of Washington, and it is a waste of our  time.   If they think they have a good proposal that will end crime in  America, let's do it nationally and make it apply to everybody.  Otherwise, let's agree with the people from D.C.: Hands off Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
