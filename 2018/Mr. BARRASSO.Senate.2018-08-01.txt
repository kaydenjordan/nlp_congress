 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dave True, who  will soon be honored for his contributions to his local community and  the agriculture industry across Wyoming. Each year, Senator Enzi and I  have the opportunity to introduce outstanding individuals as they are  inducted into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. As one of the 2018  inductees, Dave is an outstanding addition to their ranks.   Seventy years ago, Dave's father moved to Casper, WY, as part owner  of a drilling company and established what would eventually become the  True Companies. In the years that followed, Dave worked with his father  and brothers to expand the company's focus. Today the True Companies is  a  [[Page S5578]]  diversified portfolio of farms, ranches, and feedlots, as well as  businesses in the oil and gas and transportation sectors.   Together with his wife, Melanie, Dave works to make sure the family  business endures for the next generation: their children, Shane and his  wife JoAnn; Christy and her husband Quintin; Bryce and his wife Kelsey;  Ashley, who interned in my office, and her husband Gene; and the many  grandchildren.   Today, Dave manages the agricultural holdings and actively seeks out  opportunities to serve the larger agricultural community. Dave has  given his time to the Wyoming 4-H Foundation, the Casper Rotary Club,  the Farm Bureau, and many other organizations who share his passions.  As a member of the University of Wyoming's College of Agriculture  advisory council and as the current president of the University of  Wyoming board of trustees, Dave plays an active role in guiding  students who make Wyoming's future so bright.   The scope of Dave's leadership is not limited to the borders of  Wyoming. For many years, Dave served as treasurer of the National  Cattlemen's Beef Association and has mentored countless members of the  national agriculture sector. Never too busy to attend educational  workshops, I remember when Dave shared his biggest successes and his  biggest failure during a beef symposium. His willingness to share  obstacles in his own enterprise and offer advice has made Dave an  outstanding resource for the next generation of producers.   This year marks the 150th anniversary of Wyoming's status as a U.S.  Territory and the 106th annual Wyoming State Fair. Although the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame began only in 1992, Wyoming has a longstanding  tradition of recognizing those who are integral to the success of our  State's agricultural industry. Selection as a member of this  outstanding group is one of many honors Dave has received, and it is  one that is undoubtedly well-deserved. The members of this elite club  grow crops and raise livestock while building a strong foundation for  the next generation of successful producers. Together, they will make  the next 150 years of Wyoming's history as rich as the last.   It is with great honor that I recognize my friend as an outstanding  member of our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in  congratulating Dave True as one of the 2018 inductees into the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of John  Jorgensen, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming's 2018 honoree.   Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming has been  working to make a positive difference in the lives of children. Their  mission is to inspire all youth to reach their full potential as  productive, responsible, and caring citizens. Their activities provide  the children in our community with a sense of competence, usefulness,  and belonging.   On August 29, 2018, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming will  host the 20th Annual Awards and Recognition Breakfast. Every year at  this event, the Boys and Girls Club honors a member of the community  who has made outstanding contributions to their organization, Wyoming  youth, and the city of Casper. It is an inspiring celebration. This  year's honoree is John Jorgensen. He is an ideal choice to receive this  honor because of his dedication to advancing childhood literacy and  improving the lives of Wyoming's children. With this award, the Boys  and Girls Club of Central Wyoming shows their gratitude for John's  work, which mirrors the club's important mission.   John is a successful manager, generous philanthropist, and devoted  family man. He is a native of Nebraska and attended the University of  Nebraska, earning a bachelor's degree in Political Science. He served 3  years in the U.S. Army before pursuing his career in banking. His path  lead him to California and the Midwest before finally calling Casper,  WY, home for the past 31 years. He started in Casper as the president  of the First Wyoming Bank and retired in 2015 as the president of  Hilltop National Bank.   John's involvement in his community is immeasurable, and his positive  impact is felt across Casper and Wyoming. He has been a Casper College  Foundation Board Member since 1987 and has served as its President  since 1990. John's leadership grew the foundation to one of the top  five community college foundations nationwide, with assets of over $90  million. John was recently awarded the 2018 Casper College Alumni  Association's Commitment to Excellence Award for his exemplary service.  He was also awarded the prestigious Benefactor Award in 2014 from the  Council for Resource Development. In addition, John has served on the  Natrona County Public Library Foundation, the Nicolaysen Art Museum  Board, the Wyoming Community Foundation, and the Sue Jorgensen Library  Foundation. He was instrumental in the completion of the David Street  Station project and is a member of the Casper Rotary Club.   Any mention of John would be incomplete without the acknowledgment of  the Wyoming Reads program. Inspired by his wife Sue's love of reading,  he founded the program in her memory after her passing in 1996. Sue was  the director of the elementary education and graduate education  programs for the University of Wyoming/Casper College Center in Casper  and was the first coordinator of the UW elementary education teacher  preparation program. Each year, the Governor of Wyoming proclaims the  date of the Wyoming Reads program as Wyoming Literacy Day. The event  started as ``Casper Cares, Casper Reads'' 20 years ago. Since then, the  program has grown to include thousands of children across Wyoming and  delivered more than 180,000 personalized books. John's work has  inspired similar programs in other States, with communities in  California, Oregon, and Minnesota following his lead. John even takes  the time to travel to many of these locations to provide leadership and  encouragement.   John devotes his time to instilling the value of reading in Wyoming  youth. He wrote a fairy tale that he acts out as a play for the first  graders, feeding their excitement to learn as well as honoring Sue. He  quotes her saying that, ``Until someone can read, they can't really do  anything else.'' This is his vision for helping children succeed and  grow. His devotion to childhood literacy ensures the youth of Wyoming  are educated and inspired.   John Jorgensen and his family truly represent the Wyoming values of  courage, generosity, and selflessness. John with his late wife, Sue,  have five children, Matt Jorgensen, Chris Jorgensen, Marty Jorgensen,  Sarah Olsen, and Lindsay Lawton, as well as loving grandchildren.  Children in Casper, WY, and across the country have a bright future  thanks to the efforts of this incredible family.   It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional member of  our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our  congratulations to John Jorgensen for receiving this special  acknowledgement from the Boys and Girls Club of Central Wyoming.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Del  McOmie, mayor of Lander, WY, and one of our State's true leaders.   Born and raised in Lander, Del has worked continually to make the  community and Wyoming better for future generations.   Del married his sweetheart, Patty, in 1975. They welcomed five  children, Delbert, Jr., Alan, Kathleen, Pamela, and Craig. The McOmie  family has since grown to include 14 grandchildren and 20 great- grandchildren. In his everyday words and deeds, Del has passed on his  tradition of excellence and love of Wyoming. Governor Matt Mead  appointed Delbert as the director of the state construction department.  Alan gives back to their community, serving as an officer in the Lander  Police Department. Working for the Wyoming Department of Environmental  Quality, Craig embodies his father's passion for the beauty of our  State.   Del has committed his life to serving those around him. When he  finishes his current term as mayor of Lander, he will have served as an  elected official  [[Page S5579]]  for 30 years, along with providing leadership and expertise to the  Wyoming Department of Transportation for over 39 years. Alongside this  public service, Del has been a small business owner and a champion for  local economic development.   As the cofounder of LEADER Corp., a private economic development  group committed to expanding the economic base of Lander, Del helps  transform his vision of a prosperous community into reality. Known for  his dedication and determination, Del brings all the players to the  table and works to make things happen. Del is a problem-solver, and  Lander and the State of Wyoming are better for it.   Del's neighbors and friends know they can rely on him to get the job  done. They have elected him as mayor four times and sent him to  represent their interests in the State legislature seven times. He has  rewarded their faith in him by finding the funds necessary to build the  new Lander Valley High School.   Del and I served in the Wyoming State Legislature together for 5  years. His opinions and advice carried great weight in both chambers  and across the aisle. Del was known for his integrity and devotion to  Wyoming. He served on the education committee when we passed the  Hathaway Scholarship that ensures every Wyoming High School graduate  has access to higher education. Together, we cosponsored legislation to  fund critical emergency telephone services in our rural State. Del's  legacy will always be working to meet the needs of our State and her  people.   In Wyoming, we have adopted the Code of the West as our guiding  ethical principles. No one embodies these commitments more than Del  McOmie. Throughout his impressive career of service, Del has always  ``done what has to be done'' and embraced that ``when you make a  promise, [you must] keep it.'' Even before Wyoming had an official code  of ethics, Del has always been one to ``ride for the brand''.   It is with great honor that I recognize this exceptional member of  our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our  appreciations to Del McOmie for his service.                            ____________________
