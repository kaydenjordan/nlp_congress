 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's trade war is spiraling  out of control and American workers and businesses are paying the  price.   Back home in Illinois, already more than $3.8 billion in exports have  been targeted for retaliation. I have heard from numerous working  companies hurting from this misguided approach. They are struggling  with new, high costs and are now less able or less likely to hire or  expand.  [[Page H6273]]    Today, I am introducing legislation to help American businesses  affected by the Trump tariffs. Trade Adjustment Assistance was created  in 1962 to help U.S. workers and U.S. firms adapt to competition caused  by changing trade policies. My bill would expand the Trade Adjustment  Assistance for Firms to add reduced exports resulting from retaliatory  tariffs as a qualifying factor for the TAA program.   I also enthusiastically support similar legislation by my Democratic  colleagues being introduced this week to provide similar assistance to  impacted workers and farmers.   President Trump needs to end this damaging trade war. Until he does,  we need to provide relief to the businesses and workers who are  adversely stuck with the consequences.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
