 Madam Speaker, I, as well, support this bill.   This is a bipartisan bill, and people have to realize it has to be a  bipartisan bill. I don't think either party could get 218 votes for  this bill, and of course, the same thing is true in the U.S. Senate.  Therefore, it can't be a bill for extreme people.   There are probably some people who want to get rid of the post office  and just see what happens. Those people are going to vote against the  bill.   However, this is a bill in part negotiated by our current Postmaster  General, Louis DeJoy. I think he has done a tremendous job.   For years, people have said we ought to run the post office like a  business. Now, we have a businessman who doesn't need the job, and he  has negotiated a package.   Admittedly, some people not normally known to sign have signed off.  But it is a good package that will save money.   If this package doesn't pass today, we will probably deal with  another package in 2 or 4 years that is not as good as this package.   We are including new machines, which will improve efficiency. We are  going to switch to more full-time people, which will result in less  overtime. We are going to align the distribution network, and there  will be transportation savings there. These things may not happen in  the future.   I think Mr. DeJoy has done a good job. I think we should stand with  him. I think if we do not vote for this bill today, we are really  sending a message that we cannot vote for something unless it is  absolutely perfect.   I do believe there will be a substantial savings over the next few  years, a savings which would not result if this bill would fail today.  I strongly encourage my colleagues, including my conservative  colleagues, to vote for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to try to add a few additional  things about fentanyl.   I first got here about 7 years ago, and at the time there were 47,000  deaths caused by illegal drugs a year. By comparison, there were 57,000  people who died in Vietnam, but that was over a 10-year period, a 12- year period. This is over 1 year, 47,000 people. And it was a national  crisis. And every politician had to address that crisis.   Well, 7 years later what became of that statistic, 47,000 deaths a  year from fentanyl? It went up to 100,000 deaths a year.   Now, I have been at the border five times. Every time I am down there  the Border Patrol, again and again, emphasizes that with this open flow  of people coming into this country, you're getting unlimited fentanyl.   So we have to do two obvious things to address the problem. We just  passed a continuing resolution today with some increases in there, but  the budget proposed by our President doesn't increase funding for the  Border Patrol at all. You go through that budget, 12 percent over here,  18 percent over here, 7 percent over here. Border Patrol, nothing. Like  these lives don't matter at all. We have got to spend more money at the  border.   Secondly, when it comes down to penalties for people who are selling  this fentanyl or trafficking in fentanyl, they are not great enough.   Right now, your penalties for heroin, which is a fraction as lethal  as fentanyl, are much higher, the mandatory minimums, than the cutoff  for fentanyl.   I have introduced a bill that is going to deal with that called the  Fentanyl Penalties Parity Act, which adjusts the mandatory minimum to  be the same as heroin.   So we have got to throw more people in prison. That 100,000 deaths,  by the way, that is not what we call nonviolent. Ask the parents of the  people who died of these fentanyl overdoses whether that is just a  nonviolent crime, and we will slap somebody on the wrist and who cares?  We have got to up the penalties on people who are selling that  fentanyl. We had 560 people die in Milwaukee County alone last year,  and Milwaukee County is not that big.   And secondly, we have got to do something at that border. The idea  that these fentanyl drugs continue to flow across the southern border,  and we can pretend there is nothing we can do, that we can continue to  allow Kamala Harris to look out at the border, which is just like a  joke on the American people. It is a joke on anybody who has had a  loved one die of this fentanyl. That has got to end.   I hope everybody in this building, those people fortunate enough to  meet the President tell him, Get Kamala Harris off that border and get  us some more Border Patrol agents down there so it shows that we are  taking the lives of these 100,000 people a year a little more  seriously.  [[Page H1065]]                                     time  1900     Mr. Speaker, tonight, we are going to address three  what I consider key issues that have sadly been left largely untouched  by the American media.   The first one is the penalties against married couples in income  transfer payments and the degree to which these income transfer  payments are going to be affected by the Build Back Better bill, if any  of that survives for passage at the end of the year.   We know that Karl Marx wanted to destroy the American family. We know  for a while, last year, Black Lives Matter, which was so important in  last year's campaign, had on their website that they wanted to destroy  the Western-prescribed nuclear family. As a practical matter, this  means they wanted to keep the man out of the house.   People might wonder why I keep bringing this up. It seems like old  news. I would feel better if some Democrat stepped forward and publicly  condemned Marxism and publicly praised the idea that children may  benefit from having a father at home. But that is not going on.   In America, before Lyndon Johnson came in with his Great Society, or  war on marriage, whatever you want to call it, all but 7 percent of  American children started out with both parents.   Now, I know wonderful single parents. I know children who became  wonderful adults raised by single parents. But nevertheless, the  statistics again and again show, whatever metric you have, you might be  better off or it might be easier to raise that child with two parents  at home.   After the Gingrich reforms in the 1990s, that number has since stayed  at about 40 percent of children born without both parents at home. So  it went from 7 percent to 40 percent, a steady increase 35 years after  Lyndon Johnson passed his war on marriage bills in the 1960s. Things  have been relatively static for the last 25 years.   Now, in my opinion, the reason the number of families with both  parents at home dropped is because most government transfer payments  are conditioned upon not having a lot of income or not having a major  breadwinner in the house.   There are about 90 government transfer payments this is true of. But  some of the ones that the average person should be aware of are SNAP,  the food stamp program; the low-income housing program; the earned  income tax credit program; the Pell grants; and the TANF program. All  of these programs are designed to disappear if you have a person who  makes an average income in the household.   In Build Back Better, the earned income tax credit goes up. Joe Biden  increased the food stamp benefits on his own, and there will be large  increases in the amount of low-income housing available.   I want to point out one of the programs, by the way, that we used to  build more low-income housing. It is called section 42 housing. It is  funded by very generous tax credits, which come from, obviously, very  wealthy property developers. As a practical matter, the government  winds up paying for over 80 percent of the housing that a private  person gets through the tax credits. So one of the primary benefits of  this form of low-income housing is we are, quite frankly, making the  rich richer. It is one of the big tax benefits that helps the wealthier  people.   In section 42, because so much of the housing is paid for by the  government, the person who does the building has every incentive to  make that property as expensive as it can be. We are glad the Chair is  listening here because it is something I didn't know about until about  6 years ago.   It creates a situation in which a developer who is building low- income housing can outbid another developer for prime land, and they  can build fancier countertops, that sort of thing, because the  government is paying for 80 percent of it. So if you are somebody like  me, who sometimes thinks our tax code does benefit the ultrawealthy,  section 42 is one of those provisions.   Pell grants are another example of a program that you can benefit  from, either you or your children, provided nobody in the household is  making too much money. It is another program therefore designed--as one  mother told me: Me and my husband work. My poor kids have to take out  such big student loans. Is it fair we are penalized for being married  and working?   That is the way that program is set up. It is designed to penalize  the old-fashioned family, which is what Karl Marx would have wanted.   It is not unusual to have situations in which the penalty for getting  married can be as much as $14,000. Like I said, as we have more low- income housing, as we up the earned income tax credit, these programs  are pushing, I think, America in the wrong direction.   I will direct people who are listening to recent studies that have  been put out by The Heritage Foundation and Robert Rector, who has long  been an expert in this field, describing the degree to which the  penalty on people who get married goes up.   Now, I would hope, for children in the future, that we don't continue  down this path of apparently penalizing both parents for staying in the  home. I hope it is something that is looked at by Republicans if we get  the majority, and I hope more Democrats look into this before we add  too many other benefits conditioned upon a low-income situation if  Build Back Better is passed.   Again, I think it would be good if the press, which hasn't so far-- but I would hope the press would pick up on Mr. Rector's paper and  comment on how America will change if more and more benefits are  targeted at people who are not married with children.   I think this is one of the key stories in America over the last 50  years. I hear a lot of people back home, when they feel that America is  not quite as enjoyable to live in as it was 50 years ago, that one of  those reasons is what they would refer to as the breakdown of the  traditional family. I hope, after hearing my explanation tonight, more  people realize that that was not necessarily by accident. There are  evil, leftwing people who want to break down the family, and the public  policy of the American Government right now is to use their financial  incentives to penalize the average family.    Now, the next issue that, if we look 15 years down the road--and I  always think when we take up issues or address issues or decide how to  vote on issues, we should say: How is this going to affect America not  only today but 15 years from now?   I do believe that the screwed-up welfare system continues to chip  away at America. But I would say the second-biggest--maybe the  biggest--issue is what is going on at our southern border.   Earlier today, I had the chance to talk to a member of the Border  Patrol, who appeared here in the Capitol. Having seen the border five  times last year, I thought I had my fill of bad things that are going  on. But talking to him as far as what is going on right now, it is  worse than ever. They are seeing more people and more drug gangs  operating near the border.   We are at a point in which we are not only seeing Mexican drug gangs  hanging out in California, fighting for the marijuana fields that are  apparently popping up in California, but they are now fighting with  Chinese gangs. I mean, I have been down there several times. I have yet  to see them, but this Border Patrol agent told me what we have going on  in California is violent conflict between Mexican gangs and Chinese  gangs, and they are becoming more aggressive.   You didn't used to see people coming to the border shooting at Border  Patrol agents, but that is what we are getting now. In the past, when I  have been  [[Page H1072]]  down there, they would avoid the Border Patrol agents. Now, you really  have to look out.   I mention that because I think as we work our way through a  continuing resolution today and work toward the budget, we had better  do something to help out the Border Patrol.   The Border Patrol right now has to deal with a lot more people than  they did a year ago. When President Biden took office, there were about  20,000 people coming across here every month. We are now at about  90,000 every month, including a lot more unaccompanied children.   Obviously, when people turn themselves in at the southern border,  which they do under our asylum policy, the Border Patrol agents have to  drop what they are doing, ignore the border, and do the paperwork.  There is even more paperwork when we have unaccompanied minors coming  to the southern border because then we have to check out the young  children, and we ship them around the country, wherever they have to  go.   Now, this drives the Border Patrol up the wall--right?--because if  somebody in this room took their children and dropped them off at the  Washington, D.C., airport and just told the Southwest ticket agent,  ``Oh, here is Johnny. Send him to somebody in Portland, Oregon,''  social services would be after those people. Why are you letting those  people go?   But at the southern border, it doesn't work that way. If Johnny shows  up at the southern border and has on his T-shirt, ``I want to go to 14  East Elm Street, Portland, Oregon,'' we deliver him to 14 East Elm  Street, Portland, Oregon, no questions asked. I mean, presumably,  Johnny knows those people. Hopefully, it is an aunt and uncle or  grandparents. Hopefully, it is somebody, but we don't know for sure.   That is the reason there is a report that the U.S. Government will  lose track of one in three unaccompanied alien children it releases to  sponsors into the country. We don't even know where these kids are.   I don't know, for whatever reason--maybe it is that they like the  current administration--there are not banner headlines about this, but  there should be banner headlines about it. Like I said, if it were our  own children just released to the airlines to go around the country, we  would be concerned.   I have been at the southern border. I have watched as I flew out of  McAllen, Texas, and watched all the people getting on the airplanes,  children getting on the airplane, and people getting on the plane  without identification. Again, you and I, we have to turn in our  driver's license. ``Here I am. Can you let me get back to Milwaukee?''  That is not the way it works with the illegal immigrants. They are let  in, and it is a recipe for trouble.   But the one primary thing I took out today was, again, the large  number of people coming into the country.   I should point out, too--and this says something about the  administration's motivation. In the first 6 months of last year, about  85 percent less people were deported than 3 years ago. Some of that can  be attributed to COVID, but we largely know how to deal with COVID  today.   So, you begin to get even more suspicious of the administration, that  not only are they greatly increasing the number of people who come into  the country, but they are dramatically decreasing the number of people  with criminal records who are being deported from the country. How can  America survive?   Again, when I look at Congress, when I look at what we should do, I  say: What effect is this going to have over the next 15 years?   We are right now accepting people who we know very little about. I  mentioned they don't need IDs. The last time I was down at the southern  border, you looked at a path, which was maybe as wide as this table,  and it was littered with ID's as people from wherever--Venezuela,  Colombia, Chili, wherever--throw their ID's out, I guess because they  want to start a new life and don't want the American government to know  who they are, I guess.   That is how we are changing America. That is how we are determining  who the new people coming into America are, rather than, if we really  want to, doing something under the current system where people have to  check in, where people are monitored, where there is some vetting  process.                                time  2015    Why you would do it this way if you cared about the future of  America, I don't know. And I felt more sorry than ever for some of the  people in California who are having these drug gangs buy up houses,  sometimes at heightened rates, but are also buying up houses that they  are using for their operations. Of course, very quickly, those  neighborhoods change if you have drug cartels owning houses in a given  area.   Now, I am going to address one final issue tonight, and I am a little  frustrated at the media not bringing it up. As I have said before, I am  not the most hawkish person on the Ukraine-Russian situation, but since  Russia and Ukraine are in the news, you would figure the media,  including the conservative media, which hasn't been that loud about it,  but any impartial media person would take it upon themselves to talk  about the Ukrainian famine.   In the early 1930s, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union controlled  what happened in Ukraine, and they were mad at Ukraine because some  people in Ukraine wanted to be independent and hadn't been under the  Communist heel enough.   Ukraine was a very wealthy region as far as agriculture was  concerned, so in order to punish the Ukrainians or make sure the Soviet  Union took over Ukraine, they instituted a famine. They wouldn't let  Ukrainians leave the country. They took over the crops in Ukraine. It  dramatically differs if you look up the numbers, but somewhere between,  say, 4 and 15 million people starved to death in Ukraine in the early  1930s.   Now, isn't that news? If you were a well-informed, well-read American  who went to middle school, went to high school, maybe did some college,  shouldn't you know that 4 to 14 million Ukrainians were starved to  death by the Soviet Union in the early 1930s?   But I talk to people. I talk to people in this building. I talk to  people back home. Somehow, nobody knows it. Well, maybe that has  something to do with some of the animosity between Ukrainians and the  Russians. Regardless, it is something every American should know so  they know why people like me are a little bit concerned when we are  nice to groups founded by Marxists or when a U.S. Senator from  Connecticut shows up at an anniversary for the Communist Party of  America and thinks it is no big deal and we can just laugh it off.   There are many, many things wrong with communism. Suppression of free  speech and the free flow of ideas is one of the things that is scary.  It was not uncommon in places like Red China or the Soviet Union early  on to wipe out all houses of worship. That is something that we find  scary, as well as complete government control of the economy and a  situation in which they determine that your success economically will,  to a certain extent, be dependent upon following the line and bowing to  the government.   I cannot imagine a worse form of government than that of communism.  It is horrible, even without the mass murders. But every American child  should know about the great Ukrainian famine of 1931 and 1932 and the  millions of people who died, both so they are knowledgeable on Marxism  or communism and to know a little bit about historic Ukrainian-Russian  relations.   So, I beg our media to recount what happened. It would be a good time  to recount what happened for the American public, and I hope in the  future members of the American education system do a little bit better  job of explaining some of the horrific things that happened in history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
