 Mr. Speaker, it is a little over 1 month now, 1\1/2\  months, since October 7 and the horrific things that happened to the  good and peaceful people of Israel.   Many, many deaths and unspeakable demonic actions were taken by Hamas  against innocent Israeli citizens attending a festival or other events  in their neighborhoods. I can't begin to speak about how ugly some of  these things are. The rape, the murder, and the beheadings are beyond  polite company. Maybe we need to be a little less polite in talking  about just what kind of horrific activity Hamas has been up to. Even  the Gazan people are subject to the terrorism of not being able to make  a move or make a change in that area they are trying to live in.   Nonetheless, Israelis have bent over backwards for decades in so- called land-for-peace deals and so-called two-state solutions. Yet when  Israel gives 99 percent of what they asked for to the Palestinian  Authority, previously to Arafat, and to Hamas, they aren't really there  at the table to negotiate. They are not there to acknowledge the State  of Israel as a Jewish state or its right to exist. They want it  eliminated.   When they talk about ``from the river to the sea,'' there is no room  for compromise with them for acknowledging a Jewish state and a Jewish  people in the State of Israel.   So why are we pussyfooting around saying, cease-fire, more land for  peace, more two-state solution?   They do not want the existence of Israel.   That is the first question we should ask any of them when we sit  down: Okay, do you want this solution?   Do you want that solution?   Do you agree that there should be the existence of the State of  Israel as a Jewish state?   They will turn away from the table because there is not a  negotiation. There is not an agreement. They do not care to have peace.  They care to wipe Israel off the face of the map.   So what does that mean right now in the short term?   Yes, it looks like a seventh day of cease-fire, at least in the Gaza  area, but when you squeeze that balloon, Mr. Speaker, then you get  other problems like the violence in Jerusalem, on the  [[Page H5997]]  West Bank, and others that will pop up. Whether it is Hamas here one  day or Hezbollah in another area up north, we still know that Iran is  sponsoring this terrorism and that Qatar is happy to help finance it.   It is time to get very real about this. What Israel really needs to  be able to do is to root out the problems, the corruption, and the deep  problems that exist within Gaza. Many, many miles of tunnels go  sometimes 200 feet underground, the shafts go up inside houses, inside  mosques, and inside hospitals and they use the innocent citizens there  as shields. All those areas Hamas happily hides behind so they can try  to make Israel look bad when they surgically go in and try to remove  these evil terrorists.   There is a dramatic difference in the two sides even though our  universities and the media are duping our young people into waving  their Palestinian flags. There is a dramatic difference in the two  sides. One seeks peace, one seeks existence, and the other seeks to  wipe Israel off the map. They don't want peace. They don't want  existence.   So I call upon the Biden administration to stand behind Israel in a  real way and in a meaningful way. The IDF needs to be able to do what  it needs to get the job done in northern Gaza and to finish the job of  wiping out the existence of Hamas who will continue to launch rockets  and commit terrorism against Israel and even its so-called own people.   Allow Israel to finish the job instead of us duplicitously saying,  oh, we need to have a cease-fire.   That is because there wouldn't be a fire to cease to begin with had  not Hamas started, really, with the first moments of deeding the Gaza  strip over to that side years ago when the rockets were launched even  before the ink was dry on the agreement.   That is what we need to have done. The Biden administration needs to  show it is firmly behind Israel and what needs to get done instead of  these half measures.   Israel has a right to exist. Israel needs us as a firm ally. We need  to get off our backsides and get the aid to them that they really need  that we passed in this House.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, earlier this month, we marked 5 years  since the 2018 Camp fire struck Paradise and surrounding areas of  northern California. It was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire  in California history.   Recovery has not been easy and will take continued coordination of  all levels of government and, importantly, also the citizens. One of  the most instrumental people in the recovery efforts was Casey Hatcher,  who sadly passed away just days before the anniversary.   I especially want to recognize Casey, who was the deputy chief  administrative officer for Butte County. We are all grateful for her  fantastic work. Ms. Hatcher served in Butte County's emergency  operations center during many activations, including the 2017 Oroville  Dam spillway crisis, the Wall and Ponderosa fires, the 2017 La Porte  and Cherokee fires, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2020 North Complex fire,  and the 2021 Dixie fire. There is a theme here of fire.   She served Butte County diligently as the Camp fire recovery  director, working closely with the California Office of Emergency  Services and FEMA. Her dedication, perseverance, and leadership have  been paramount to the recovery of the entire region. We would not have  gotten this far without her or in as timely a fashion.   As I remember the 5 years since the Camp fire, I am also remembering  Casey Hatcher, her dedication, and her caring and compassionate  approach to helping her neighbors. God bless her and her family.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, this is a preemptive effort. Why fight so  hard? If a single penny has not been cut loose yet, good. That means we  are taking action here that is going to prevent that. Had the Biden  administration not cut loose the $6 billion in frozen assets to begin  with, we wouldn't have to do this.   Why do we have a nonsensical effort to allow Iran to have the option?  That is why we need to head this off at the pass with H.R. 5961, the No  Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act.   We saw a sophisticated attack launched in Gaza by Hamas, and we are  continuing this process to allow Iran to be the biggest state sponsor  of terror in the world. We need to head it off at the pass, as I said.   It is ridiculous that we have to fight so hard to have this  preemptive effort. I just don't understand it. I don't understand a lot  of things coming out of the Middle East with the pro-Palestinian  efforts all over this country and all over the world when Israel is  simply a country that seeks peace.   Yes, we got five wrongfully detained American hostages in exchange  for these frozen assets, but the President must impose sanctions on the  foreign financial institutions involved in processing the transfer of  these funds. Head it off at the pass. Don't allow it to happen. Why  would we be in the business of helping Iran to destroy Israel?
