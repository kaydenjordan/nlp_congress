 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for  the Joint Economic Committee debate be reserved to occur from 4:30 p.m.  until 5:45 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the  duration of the Senate's consideration of H. Con. Res. 71, the majority  and Democratic managers of the concurrent resolution, while seated or  standing at the managers' desks, be permitted to deliver floor remarks,  retrieve, review, and edit documents, and send email and other data  communications from text displayed on wireless personal digital  assistant devices and tablet devices. I further ask unanimous consent  that the use of calculators be permitted on the floor during  consideration of the budget resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the staff be  permitted to make technical and conforming changes to the resolution,  if necessary, consistent with the amendments adopted during Senate  consideration, including calculating the associated change in the net  interest function, and incorporating the effect of such adopted  amendments on the budgetary aggregates for Federal revenues, the amount  by which the Federal revenues should be changed, new budget authority,  budget outlays, deficits, public debt, and debt held by the public.    Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate Budget  Committee took an important first step toward tax reform by approving a  fiscal year 2018 budget resolution focused on growing America's economy  through tax policies that put more money in the hands of hard-working  Americans.   This week, we take the next step as the Senate begins debating the  budget blueprint to pursue long-overdue tax relief for families and job  creators that will jump-start economic growth. It is  [[Page S6425]]  crucial that Congress approve this fiscal framework in order to  eliminate the dated and stifling tax policies that are holding back  American investment and productivity.   As Budget Committee chairman, I am proud that Congress and the  President are tackling these important issues. After 8 years of  stagnant growth, it is clear our Nation needs a simpler, fairer, and  more transparent tax system that will leave more dollars in the pockets  of hard-working families.   The last time Congress was able to accomplish large-scale tax reform  was in 1986. Just think how much has changed in the country and world  in those 31 years, including our Tax Code. America's tax laws are  incredibly complicated and work to slow our economy and hurt American  families. Incredibly, our current tax system actually benefits foreign- based companies while harming U.S.-headquartered companies and  employers. We continually ask why jobs are leaving this country. A big  reason is the hostile tax landscape.   The Senate budget aims to help reverse this trend by setting the  stage for pro-growth tax reform that will lower taxes on American  families and on job creators by a net $1.5 trillion over 10 years. By  keeping more money in the pockets of hard-working taxpayers, these  reforms--if done right--will boost investment, wages, and productivity  here at home.   Pro-growth tax reform should reward hard work, savings, and encourage  investment. It should broaden the tax base while lowering the marginal  tax rates, streamline our tax laws, and limit government distortion of  market-based decisions. Our tax policy should provide for a globally  competitive corporate tax rate and an international tax system that  does not penalize U.S. companies.   It is no secret that tax policies influence the everyday dollars-and- cents decisions of individuals and small businesses. They help drive  such decisions as to whether to work an additional hour or invest in an  additional unit of capital. This is why economic experts note that  potential economic growth should always be considered when talking  about tax cuts. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation states ``tax  policy can directly influence the level of labor supply, physical  capital, human capital, and technology in an economy by changing the  after-tax returns to certain economic activities or changing the cost  of pursuing such activities.''   Pro-growth reform that removes government distortions of the  marketplace would also allow for resources to be reallocated from what  produces the best tax outcome to what is the best economic use. This  efficiency will lead to increased investment, growth of businesses, and  higher economic output or gross domestic product, GDP. In fact,  increasing GDP from private sector growth can provide additional  dollars to the Treasury. Let me repeat that. Better tax policy will  boost the value of everything we produce, and this will mean more  revenue for the Federal Government.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, an increase in  productivity of one-tenth of 1 percentage point could increase revenue  into the Treasury by $273 billion over a 10-year period. A return to  our historic average growth would decrease projected spending deficits  by over $2 trillion in the 10-year window--more than enough to pay for  the decrease in revenues assumed under static scoring conventions that  don't account for economic growth. That is what we have to operate  under.    In addition to the Senate Budget's key role in reforming the Tax  Code, it is also a serious fiscal plan. If Congress and the  administration can adhere to this blueprint, we will be taking steps to  get our fiscal house in order with a combination of restrained  spending, reduced tax burdens, and a growing economy.   The Senate Budget Committee has put together a responsible budget  that provides a path to creating a more effective, efficient, and  accountable government for hard-working taxpayers. To accomplish this  goal, the budget proposes $5.1 trillion in savings over the next 10  years, while investing in a strong national defense, providing for the  care of our most vulnerable citizens, and not touching Social Security.   From the start, this budget was focused on achieving on-budget  balance by the end of the 10-year budget window. By 2026, the  resolution--with ensuing economic growth from tax reform and an  improved regulatory landscape--will generate a $79 billion on-budget  surplus. This surplus would rise to $197 billion by 2027.   In addition to the fiscal reforms proposed by this resolution, it  also continues efforts to respond to concerns about the broken budget  process. This budget promotes curtailing budget gimmicks, increasing  honesty and accuracy by government scorekeepers, and ending the ``spend  now, pay later'' mentality of Washington.   It is also important to note the thorough and robust committee  process that produced this Senate budget resolution. More than 150  amendments from both sides were filed, and 29 were voted on during our  daylong markup process. This budget reflects bipartisan input and  includes five amendments that were accepted from Democratic members of  the committee.   The next step for tax reform will build on the Budget Committee's  open and transparent committee process. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch have promised that  tax reform legislation will also move through the committee process. In  other words, any speculation people have heard about where the tax is,  is not right because it has a process to go through. This will provide  Finance Committee members the opportunity to offer amendments before  the full Senate considers the legislation. So we will consider it in  committee and then on the floor. Once the bill moves to the Senate  floor, every Member will be able to offer amendments before voting on  the measure.   This budget serves as a framework to expand economic opportunity for  each and every American. It reflects our belief in the American  entrepreneurial spirit and that by allowing American families and small  businesses to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, they will  innovate and invest money in ways that will grow our economy. We  believe our Nation's best days--and those of its citizens--are ahead of  us.   The time to act is now. If we don't change course, our Nation will  continue to experience the sluggish economic growth of the last decade.  I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support America's  hard-working families and employers and help put our Nation on a better  course. Approving this budget focused on pro-growth tax reform does  just that.   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the  time.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1116.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
