 Mr. Speaker, 2020 was a big year for a young lady who  lives six houses from me. Her name is Isabella Johnson, Bella, to  friends.   Bella had a special birthday in April. She was going to be 10 years  old, but her plans for her 10th birthday changed dramatically when her  school closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.   Now, her birthday may have only been with a few friends at her home-- Bella is okay with that--but her mom, Juli; dad, Andy; family; and  friends would not let that suffice. They would not let COVID-19 mar  Bella's special day.   So around 5 o'clock on April 20, they started lining up on the street  outside of my house. Then the signs came out, the horns started  honking, and a parade of 30 cars crawled by Bella's house.   Bella was full of joy, as you can see.   Happy, happy, happy 10th birthday, Bella. We all love you.                            ____________________
