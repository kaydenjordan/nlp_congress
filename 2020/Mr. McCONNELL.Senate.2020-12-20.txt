 Mr. President, our bipartisan, bicameral discussions  on another major pandemic rescue package continued all night and this  morning. We are winnowing down the remaining differences. I believe I  can speak for all sides when I say I hope and expect to have a final  agreement nailed down in a matter of hours.   Yesterday evening, our Democratic colleagues agreed to important  language authored by Senator Toomey. Back in March, in the CARES Act,  Congress funded several new emergency lending facilities to be operated  by the Federal Reserve. Their purpose was simple: to backstop the basic  foundations of our economy and prevent any kind of sweeping financial  paralysis.   Our actions worked. The other historic relief that Congress passed,  combined with the existence of these lending facilities staved off  systemic collapse. American workers and families still need much more  help, but a total financial meltdown never materialized.   These new emergency lending facilities were always intended to sunset  at the end of this year. Senator Toomey and our Democratic colleagues  have landed on compromise language that ensures this will, in fact,  happen.   It also redirects the dormant money in these accounts toward the  urgent needs of working Americans and ensures that these expired  programs cannot be simply restarted or cloned without another  authorization from Congress, all while preserving both the independence  of the Federal Reserve and the proper authority of Congress. It is yet  another example of good-faith bipartisan collaboration that has defined  our discussions all week.   At this point, we are down to the last few differences that stand  between struggling Americans and the major rescue package they need and  deserve.   These days and nights of negotiations have been encouraging, but our  citizens need this waiting game to be over. Yesterday alone, another  3,388 of my fellow Kentuckians tested positive for the coronavirus. The  virus continues to spread throughout our country. Thousands of  Americans are being robbed of their lives on a daily basis.   And while the resilience of the American people have brought along  our economic recovery faster than expected, it will remain both  insufficient  [[Page S7856]]  and tenuous until the vaccines that will end this fight have been  distributed all across the Nation.   For months--literally months--Senate Republicans have been calling  for another targeted package to reopen the job-saving Paycheck  Protection Program, extend Federal unemployment benefits, fund K-12  schools, fund vaccine distribution, and get a lot more help onto the  frontlines as fast as possible. I am relieved that we appear to be just  hours away from legislation that will finally do that.   When we get this done, Congress will not deserve any special praise,  not with this relief having waited until late December and not with  some of our Democratic colleagues openly saying the reason they finally  changed their tuned was that they finally got a President-elect of  their own party. When we finalize this measure and pass it, Congress  will only have done our job. We will have finally done our duty in  getting more relief to those who need it most.   Let's make today the day we join together, put differences aside, and  finally get it done.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators-- and, more importantly, for the American people--we can finally report  what our Nation has needed to hear for a very long time: More help is  on the way.   Moments ago, in consultation with our committees, the four leaders of  the Senate and House finalized an agreement. There will be another  major rescue package for the American people. As our citizens continue  battling this coronavirus this holiday season, they will not be  fighting alone.   We have agreed to a package of nearly $900 billion. It is packed with  targeted policies to help struggling Americans who have already waited  entirely too long. For workers at the hardest hit small businesses,  there will be a targeted second draw of the Paycheck Protection  Program. We have not worked so hard to save as many jobs as possible,  all these months, only to fumble the ball with vaccinations already  underway.   Speaking of vaccines, we can't nullify the success of Operation Warp  Speed by falling asleep at the switch on distribution. This agreement  will provide huge sums for the logistics that will get these lifesaving  shots to our citizens as fast as possible.   Of course, many millions of Americans have lost their jobs--and are  continuing to lose them--through no fault of their own. This package  will renew and extend a number of the additional important Federal  unemployment benefits that have helped families stay afloat.   Across all kinds of families, in all kinds of situations, this has  been a difficult time across the board. So, at the particular request  and emphasis of President Trump and his administration, our agreement  will provide another round of direct impact payments to help households  make ends meet and continue our economic recovery.   We all know this crisis has tested our healthcare providers. This  legislation will continue to fund the frontlines.   But the crisis in American education has been staggering as well. So  this package will supply millions and millions of dollars to help get  kids back in school and to do so safely.   These are just some of the key components. There are many more. And  importantly, we are going to supply this emergency aid in a way that is  smart and responsible. We will be repurposing more than $560 billion in  money that was already set aside by the CARES Act--but not spent-- toward these urgent needs that I have outlined.   We will be appropriately paring back some of the most expansive  powers that Congress temporarily gave unelected officials to stabilize  the financial system back in the springtime. And I want to particularly  thank Senator Toomey for his extraordinary contribution to that effort.   At long last, we have the bipartisan breakthrough the country has  needed. Now we need to promptly finalize text, avoid any last-minute  obstacles, and cooperate to move this legislation through both  Chambers.   This is good news. But I need to close with one observation that is  regrettable. From where I stand, from where Senate Republicans stand,  there is no reason this urgent package could not have been signed into  law multiple months ago--multiple months ago.  [[Page S7863]]    For months, Senate Republicans have consistently supported a targeted  rescue package, under $1 trillion, focused on the same kinds of  policies that we have actually settled on today. As far back as July,  and all autumn, Republicans have consistently supported a targeted  package right in the ballpark of this total amount, with exactly the  same kinds of policies in the mix.   The package that will shortly become law falls exactly within the  ballpark of what Senate Republicans have been proposing and trying to  pass since last summer. This is eerily similar to what we were trying  to pass last summer.   Compare the shape of this major agreement with the shape of what I  proposed all the way back in late July. Yes, some fine details are  different. There is no doubt this new agreement contains input from our  Democratic colleagues. It is, of course, bipartisan. But those matters  could have been settled a long time ago as well.   Why did it take all this time? We know why. We have heard Democrats  say openly that they were not willing to deal all summer and fall but  are willing now--willing now--because they have a President-elect of  their own political party. That is not my accusation; that is their  admission. They have been pretty candid about it.   So, look, I am glad we have gotten this done. My Democratic  colleagues and I have had good discussions this past week. Both parties  have a lot to be proud of. But I really regret that some on the  Democratic side decided that partisan Presidential politics were more  important than getting urgent and noncontroversial relief out the door  much sooner to families who have needed this help badly.   The progress of this past week could have happened in July or August  or September or October. Senate Republicans were advocating for a  package just like this one all along in realtime. I just wish our  partners on the other side had put political calculations aside and  worked with us to make this happen a long time ago.   However, with that said, I appreciate the earnest conversations of  this past week. I want to thank the Democratic leader, Speaker Pelosi,  Leader McCarthy, as well as, in particular, Secretary Mnuchin, who has  been tireless in these discussions throughout. Both sides, in both  Chambers, have really stepped up and worked hard to get this done.   We will be moving forward with the start of the pandemic relief and  full-year funding legislation for the Federal Government, as well, and  I hope we can do this as promptly as possible.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
