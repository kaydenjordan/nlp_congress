 Mr. President, yesterday, Appropriations Chair Patty  Murray and Vice Chair Susan Collins announced they are ready to move  ahead with the first three appropriations bills here on the Senate  floor: MILCON-VA, Agriculture, and Transportation HUD.   This is extremely good news for what has already been a fruitful and  bipartisan Senate appropriations process. Chair and Vice Chair Murray  and Collins have done an outstanding job negotiating this difficult  work, so I thank them, as well as my other colleagues, particularly  those on Appropriations, on both sides of the aisle.   To keep the bipartisan momentum alive, I will file cloture on this  package today, with a plan to hold our first vote early next week. The  Senate appropriations process is a lesson in how governing should work.  All 12 appropriations bills have been passed with bipartisan support  through regular order. Nine of them were either unanimous or just had  one ``no'' vote.   That doesn't mean the parties have to agree on everything--we know  that won't happen. But what it means is that our disagreements have not  paralyzed the process. That is the mark of good governance.   Of course, the work is far from over. When the House gavels back into  session next week, time will be short for both parties in both Chambers  to unite around a plan to keep the government open beyond September 30.   There is only one way--one way--that this will happen: through  bipartisanship. Neither party can afford to go at it alone if we want  to avoid a shutdown. We are going to have to work together, just as we  have done in the Senate, without resorting to extremism and unseemly  tactics. And that message is intended for the House, the House  Republicans, and the House Republican leadership, in particular.   When I last met with the Speaker at the end of July, we had a good  conversation on the matter, so I hope he  [[Page S4244]]  sticks to his guns as this process begins in earnest. Both parties in  both Chambers must come together on passing emergency supplemental  funding to help our fellow Americans reeling from natural disasters, to  stand with our friends in Ukraine fighting against Putin, and to fight  against the fentanyl crisis, among other priorities.   Later this morning, I will attend a classified briefing on the state  of the war in Ukraine, where I expect we will see precisely why, now  more than ever, our friends abroad need our help. We must continue to  show Putin and the forces of autocracy that the United States stands  firmly behind Ukraine. The worst thing we could do right now for our  own national security and for our democratic values is to waver or  hesitate in our support.    What is the point in cutting off support now when we are at a turning  point in the war--an inflection point--after we have invested such a  large amount of resources to get us to this inflection point? It is a  crucial moment right now.   So one more time, let me implore my House colleagues: Follow in the  Senate's example when you return next week and work with Democrats in a  bipartisan way so we can avoid a costly, pointless, and very harmful  and unnecessary government shutdown. We do not need to go down that  road, and we cannot follow the lead of a mindless few who believe a  shutdown is a good thing and who want it and who openly admit they want  it. They are hurting the American people, plain and simple. We should  not follow them.   Democrats and Republicans in both the House and Senate should not  follow this small band of people who are at the extreme. Instead, let's  keep our economic recovery going. Let's keep our investments in  infrastructure and manufacturing flowing, and let's make sure we help  Americans with disaster aid, help our friends in Ukraine, deal with  fentanyl, and fulfill our other needs too.   The Senate, as I said, is off to a very good start. I hope the House  gets off to a good start next week as well by embracing bipartisanship.  We will know very soon whether they are ready or not to follow through  on this very important responsibility they have to the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, nominations, well, it has been a  productive first week back here on the Senate floor for nominations.  Yesterday, I am proud to say, we confirmed Gwynne Wilcox to a second  term on the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board. I am happy she  passed, just as she did 2 years ago when she became the first Black  woman ever to be confirmed to the NLRB. Confirming highly qualified  nominees like Ms. Wilcox to the NLRB is a top priority for Democrats  and for all working Americans, because it is one of the most important  proworker Agencies in the country.   Under the Biden administration, the NLRB has been hard at work  overturning Trump-era rulings that harmed workers and unions. They have  been at work expanding protections in the workplace and safeguarding  the right to organize. All important to maintaining the middle class  and growing the middle class; because after all, it was the union  movement that really created the broad American middle class in the  first place. And when unions were attacked, the middle class declined.   During her first term on the NLRB, Ms. Wilcox was a fervent champion  of the labor movement, so I am pleased that she will be back on the  board again.   Now, later this morning we will confirm Adriana Kugler to be on the  Federal Reserve Board. I was proud to champion this historic nomination  of Ms. Kugler, a Colombian-American economist who will make history as  the first--the first--Latina in the Fed Board's 109-year history. And I  want to thank Chairman Menendez for championing this outstanding  nominee.   Ms. Kugler's historic confirmation will be a great moment for the Fed  and for America, as we elevate fresh, diverse perspectives to our  Nation's central bank and continue our strong economic recovery.   We also confirmed two other very impressive nominees to the Federal  Reserve this week: Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook, another historic  nominee, as Ms. Cook became the first Black woman confirmed to a full  term on the Fed. Both of them again passed with bipartisan support.   And, finally, today we will vote to confirm Anna Gomez as a  Commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission. Ms. Gomez is an  exceptional nominee with considerable telecom experience and broad  support from groups on both sides of the aisle. And if confirmed, she  will be the first Latina on the Commission in over 20 years, another  glass ceiling broken. And these are so important to getting a full,  diverse view on important governing Agencies like the Fed, like the  FCC.   Ms. Gomez's confirmation will fill the fifth and final spot on the  FCC so they can do the crucial work of expanding access to high-speed  internet, administering programs for affordable internet access, and  protecting consumers from junk fees and much more.   So I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  cooperation on these nominees, and I look forward to continuing this  Democratic Senate's historic pace of confirming well-qualified and  diverse nominees.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, finally, on AI. Next week the Senate  will host one of the most important conversations of the year when the  top minds in artificial intelligence convene for our first AI Insight  Forum. It will be a meeting unlike any other that we have seen in the  Senate in a very long time--perhaps ever. A coming together of top  voices in business, civil rights, defense, research, labor, the arts-- all together in one room having a much needed discussion, conversation,  about how Congress can tackle AI.   Both parties recognize that AI is something we can't ignore, but we  need a lot of help understanding the best way forward. Different  countries are taking such different approaches to AI, and some are more  successful than others.    We have to learn from their mistakes and learn from this panel,  illustrious as it is. We need to find an approach that balances both  innovation and savings. That means both creative innovation to develop  new applications, new technologies, new breakthroughs so we can advance  in science and in medicine and in education and in health and in so  many other areas--communications. But we also need innovation on  guardrails so we can find creative and new ways to protect our kids,  our privacy, prevent racial bias, prevent doomsday scenarios.  Innovation must apply to both sides of the equation, innovating so we  can move the advantages of AI forward but innovating so we can deal  with the problems that AI might create and lessen them as much as we  can.   It will not be easy, not easy at all. In fact, it will be one of the  hardest things we undertake in Congress, the hardest thing we probably  ever have undertaken. That is why next week's conversation will be so  important because it will be the first of a series of forums that will  give our committees the knowledge base and thought insights to draft  the right kind of policies. Already our committees have done some  outstanding work on this topic, holding no less than eight hearings on  AI on matters related to national security, intellectual property,  human rights, and more. In fact, as we speak, the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee is holding a hearing on AI and the Department of  Energy's role in preserving competition and new technologies.   One thing I want to underscore before I finish my speech here on my  little talk here on AI is that we are doing this in a bipartisan way.  Senator Rounds, Senator Young, Senator Heinrich, and myself are sort of  steering this effort. We are having this be done in a bipartisan way,  and we expect the committees to work in a bipartisan way because if  this becomes a partisan issue, nothing will happen, and that could  create real problems in our society. So the Senate is ready and  engaging on this most important issue.   I want to thank my colleagues for their work. I want to thank  Senators Rounds, Young, and Heinrich for helping organize these forums,  and I look forward to our conversation, our very  [[Page S4245]]  important conversation, next week. We hope Senators will come--Senators  and their staffs will come, listen, learn, and then act.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
