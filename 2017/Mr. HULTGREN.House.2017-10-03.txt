 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   Multiple scientific studies indicate that, by 20 weeks after  fertilization, an unborn child's brain and nervous system have  developed sufficiently for that child to feel pain. The United States  stands among only a handful of nations that permit elective abortions  after 20 weeks. It should pain us all that we fall into the same camp  as North Korea and China.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will moderate our  extreme position and ensure we protect the most vulnerable, like Micah  Pickering, a lively 5-year-old I met last week. Micah was born  prematurely at the same age children would be protected under H.R. 36.  Micah was able to survive and thrive after spending nearly 4 months in  the neonatal intensive care unit. He is now in kindergarten, and I  found out when talking to him that we share a love of Legos.   The bottom line is this: 20 weeks is halfway through a pregnancy. It  is too late to end the life of an unborn baby. It violates what  Americans want, it violates science, and it violates our country's most  enduring values.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of Micah's Law, H.R. 36.
