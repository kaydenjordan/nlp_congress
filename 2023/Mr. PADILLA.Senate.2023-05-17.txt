 Madam President, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Dr. Daisy Gonzales, who later this month will end her  tenure as interim chancellor of the California Community Colleges, the  Nation's largest system of higher education.   Born in Southern California to immigrant parents and a former foster  child, Dr. Gonzales was among the first in her family to go to college  when she attended Los Angeles Valley College, a public community  college.   Because of her intellect, her work ethic, and the opportunity  provided by California's community college system, Dr. Gonzales would  go on to earn her bachelor's degree, her master's degree, and her  Ph.D., and eventually become the first Latina--and second woman--to  serve as chancellor. She is a shining example of the American dream in  action.   Dr. Gonzales first joined the California Community Colleges as the  system's deputy chancellor in early 2018. Since then, she has helped  guide the system through some of its most tumultuous times. Throughout  a global pandemic that forced nearly all instruction to move online and  exacerbated the basic needs crisis surrounding issues like food and  housing insecurity, Dr. Gonzales provided steady leadership for a  system of 116 colleges and 1.8 million students across the State.   She has been an unrelenting champion for Vision for Success--the  system's north star--helping achieve meaningful progress in improving  graduation and transfer rates, expanding access to on-campus basic  needs services, and implementing groundbreaking reforms to faculty  hiring and tenure policies that will ensure California Community  College instructors are representative of the students they teach.   As she transitions back to her role as deputy chancellor--and as the  system welcomes its new permanent chancellor, Dr. Sonya Christian--I am  grateful for the years of dedication and hard work that Dr. Gonzales  has given to the State of California and to the pursuit of quality  higher education for all.   Felicidades, Dr. Gonzales, and thank you for your service.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Citizenship for  Essential Workers Act.   This legislation would provide a pathway to citizenship for these  workers and their families, who have played a critical role in getting  us through the pandemic and are helping with recovery efforts.   A little over 2 years ago, after I was first sworn into the U.S.  Senate, this was the very first bill I introduced.   Every day, over 5 million essential workers without permanent legal  status kept Americans healthy, fed, and safe during the COVID  pandemic--all while risking their own health and the health of their  families.   They couldn't just Zoom into the office.   Many served us while living in constant fear of deportation.   Back then, for the first time, Americans were waking up to a reality  what families like mine knew for years: that not only were these  immigrant workers saving lives in a time of need but that their work  had always been essential to our country.   As the proud son of immigrants from Mexico whose mother worked as a  housekeeper and father a short order cook--two jobs that today would be  deemed essential--I can only imagine the fear and uncertainty my family  would have experienced every day my dad walked out the door or my mom  set off to enter another family's home in the middle of a pandemic.   The Federal COVID-19 public health emergency comes to an end next  month, but we can't forget the sacrifices these workers made--and still  make every single day--for our country.   And my legislation not only honors their sacrifice but also  recognizes how critical essential workers are to our  [[Page S1709]]  economy even beyond a public health emergency.   They have earned their place in this country.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the Citizenship for  Essential Workers Act.
