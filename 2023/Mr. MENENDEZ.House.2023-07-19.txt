 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Larsen and  Chairman Graves for their leadership on this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to discuss the Securing Growth and Robust  Leadership in American Aviation Act and the positive impact it will  have on air transportation for both consumers and workers in the  aviation industry.   Over the past few months, I have worked alongside my colleagues on  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to develop a strong,  bipartisan bill that delivers for all Americans. That is exactly what  this legislation does.   Under this bill, airlines will be required to develop policies to  reimburse consumers for hotel and meal costs when a flight is canceled  or significantly delayed.   Passengers living with disabilities will be treated with the dignity  they deserve, thanks to the Department of Transportation's creation of  a roadmap to better accommodate wheelchairs onboard planes and to  reduce damage to mobility aids.   Future airline pilots, technical workers, and airline manufacturing  workers will come from communities that have been historically  underrepresented in the aviation industry, with $9 million in funding  for recruitment and retainment efforts for these good-paying, highly  skilled jobs.                                time  1315    Families will have an easier flying experience with airlines being  required to allow parents to sit next to their young children.   I am also pleased that important provisions of my bill, the Airline  Employee Assault Prevention Act, were included in this FAA  reauthorization, ensuring a continued focus on protecting airline  workers from assault and harassment.   This legislation reflects the voices of our residents who have long  been burdened with flight delays, with unjust treatment of passengers  with disabilities, and with conditions that have made flying more  challenging for families.   Mr. Chair, I proudly support this bill, I look forward to voting for  it on the floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing  so.
