 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 323 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 323         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 115) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to provide additional       aggravating factors for the imposition of the death penalty       based on the status of the victim. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-17 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   As a former Federal and State prosecutor, I often hear how Americans  value and respect our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders. We talk about their heroism, their selflessness, their  willingness to protect and serve no matter the cost.   These fearless individuals truly are the fabric that holds our  communities together. However, in recent years, a violent and  disturbing trend has developed. Law enforcement officers, firefighters,  and first responders are increasingly being targeted for violence and  cruelty based solely on the uniform they wear.   According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund,  there were 64 police shooting deaths in 2016. That number is 56 percent  higher than the previous year. The National Association of Police  Organizations also notes that ambush-style killings of law enforcement  officers increased by 167 percent in 2016.   Allowing this appalling trend to continue unchecked is not only  unacceptable, it is indefensible. Congress must take concrete steps to  address this deadly problem.   Current Federal law provides 16 aggravating factors that a jury must  consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted. These  factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous,  cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial  planning and premeditation; whether the victim was  [[Page H4238]]  particularly vulnerable; whether the victim was a high public official,  which includes high-ranking public persons, from the President to a  foreign head of state, to a judge or a Federal law enforcement officer.  However, State and local police officers, firefighters, prosecutors,  and first responders are excluded from these protections.   In response, my friend, Mr. Buchanan, introduced H.R. 115, the Thin  Blue Line Act. This legislation amends Federal law to include  murdering, attempting to murder, or targeting of State and local law  enforcement officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders  as an aggravating factor a jury must consider when determining whether  a death sentence is justified. Furthermore, these protections extend to  all public safety officers who are murdered or targeted while engaging  in their official duties, because of the performance of their duties,  or because of their status as a public official or employee.   This bill sends a clear message: Those who target our police  officers, firefighters, or first responders with violence will be met  with an equally harsh punishment.   We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of our fallen  officers, but we must do more to protect these brave individuals. We  can't stand idly by as the individuals who protect our homes and  communities are targeted because of the uniform they wear. We must act  to ensure those individuals who would commit an act of violence against  our public safety officers know they will face the gravest of sentences  if they go through with their heinous plot.   We must send the message that Congress stands with those fearless  individuals who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities, no  matter the cost. We can't continue allowing them to suffer the price of  our inaction. I support this effort and thank Chairman Goodlatte and  the Committee on the Judiciary for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are here because we are making sure that  local police officers, sheriff's deputies, prosecutors, first  responders, and firefighters have the same protections that those in  the Federal system have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight) to get this debate  [[Page H4240]]  back on track and to protect local law enforcement officials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), a former special agent with the Federal  Bureau of Investigation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  include in the Record four letters which I will briefly describe:   The first is from the Major County Sheriffs of America, supporting  the Thin Blue Line Act; the second is from the National Association of  Police Organizations, Inc., again, supporting the Thin Blue Line Act;  the third is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, supporting  H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act; and then finally, from the Sergeants  Benevolent Association in strong support of H.R. 115, the Thin Blue  Line Act.                                               Major County Sheriffs                                                      of America,                                                     April 25, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: I write to you today on a matter       of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of       America (MCSA) and all of America's law enforcement       professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs       representing the Nation's largest counties with populations       of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100       million Americans.        As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the       MCSA, I am pleased to express our association's support of       your legislation, the Thin Blue Line Act. This legislation       would make the murder of law enforcement officers,       firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor       in capital punishment determinations.        In 2016, one hundred forty-four officers died in the line       of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent.       The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable       and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted       to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers       and other first responders have the right to go home to their       families at the end of their shifts.        The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and       your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We       value your support and look forward to working with you in       the future.                                            Michael J. Bouchard,                                       Sheriff, Oakland County (MI),      Vice President--Government Affairs.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                    Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Buchanan: On behalf of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to       you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line Act.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent       Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more       than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair       and effective crime control and law enforcement.        The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who       harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the       murder or attempted murder of a local police officer,       firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in       death penalty determinations.        This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults,       injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years.       In 2016 alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement       officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter       penalties for those who harm or target for harm law       enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons       contemplating harming an office must know that they will face       serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased       penalties make important differences in the attitudes of       criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure       protection for the community.        We thank you for your continued support of the law       enforcement community and we look forward to working with you       to pass this important legislation. If we can provide any       assistance, please feel free to contact me.            Sincerely,                                             William J. Johnson,       Esq., CAE, Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Hon. Vernon G. Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our       strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line Act.''        The ``Thin Blue Line Act'' increases the penalty for an       individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person       who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other       public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the       performance of his or her official duties, because of the       performance of his or her official duties, or because of his       or her status as a public official or employee.        Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on       duty but within the past few years, officers have become a       target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear.       As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the       current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement       officers for this very reason.        Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in       2016, 21 of them--that's 33%--were ambush killings. These       were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals       who set out to kill a police officer:        The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the       deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5       officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police       Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire;        The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott       Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in       their respective patrol cars;        Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department       (OH) was killed by ambush.        All of these officers died because of the uniforms they       were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in       harm's way. It is our job to protect others but it should not       be ``part of the job'' to be a target of someone who is       looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our       uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to       rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow       against our civil government.        On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this       legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help,       please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director       Jim Pasco in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____           Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City             of New York,                                    New York, NY, January 17, 2017.      Hon. Vern Buchanan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the       more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent       Association of the New York City Police Department to advise       you of our strong support for H.R. 115, the ``Thin Blue Line       Act.''        For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law       enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets.       There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits       impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do       so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to       protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear.       These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated       rhetoric of anti-police elements have led some to declare an       open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers       and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement       officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New       York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and       Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they       sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner.       Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National       Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21       police officers killed in ambush-style attacks. Shockingly,       20 of these officers were killed in eight multiple-shooting       death incidents--such as those that claimed the lives of 8       officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX--the highest total       of any year since 1932.        It is for these reasons and many others that the       legislation you have introduced is so important. The ``Thin       Blue Line Act'' would make the murder or attempted murder of       police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first       responders at any level of government an aggravating factor       in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to       things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is       applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because       of the performance of their duty, or because of their status       as a public official. While we know that law enforcement       officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their       uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or       retired, this legislation sends the message that any action       to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence       will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a       message that is long overdue.        On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you       for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward       to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law.       Please do not hesitate to contact me, or our Washington       Representatives Andrew Siff and Chris Granberg if we can be       of any further assistance.            Sincerely,                                                        Ed Mullins,                                                         President.   [[Page H4243]]          Mr. Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It  provides for the consideration of the Thin Blue Line Act. We often talk  of how resolute our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders are in the face of immense danger. These heroic individuals  charge into burning buildings, face down violence, and stand ready to  jump into the fray at a moment's notice.   Simply putting on a uniform should not be one of those dangers. It is  our duty to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters, and  first responders have every tool at their disposal to do their job  safely and effectively and to ensure they return home to their  families.   Countless spouses and children kiss their loved ones good-bye as they  head to work, praying that it will not be their last day. We must never  forget this as we work to ensure our police officers, firefighters, and  first responders have every possible protection.   There is no greater deterrent than the threat of losing one's life.  It is my hope that this legislation makes individuals who would  consider taking the life of an officer stop to consider the  consequences before going through with an attack; that we one day reach  a point where our Nation's finest can go to work without worrying about  being targeted because of the uniform on their back; that one day our  officers' families have one less reason to worry.   But until that day, we must continue standing resolutely against this  evil. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our law enforcement  community, firefighters, and first responders. Protect them from the  heinous acts of violence. Give their families some assurance that we  have their backs. Vote ``yes'' on the resolution, vote ``yes'' on the  underlying bill, vote ``yes'' to give our law enforcement officers the  protections they so desperately need.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Sessions for  bringing this bill before us.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the rule for H.R.  115, ``Thin Blue Line Act of 2017.''   I would like to acknowledge and commend our law enforcement officers  in the room today and across this country who have worked tirelessly on  our behalf.   I know personally the level of stress and challenges posed, because I  have many friends that have and are currently serving my Congressional  district in Houston and our country very well and with great  distinction.   I support our policies that are necessary so long as we are doing so  with fairness, in accordance with our Constitution, and in a manner  that is not duplicative of statutory measures already in place.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 imposes the death penalty for the killing or  targeting of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first  responders as a 17th aggravated factor for homicide.   H.R. 115 is duplicative and unnecessary because under 18 U.S.C.  3592(c), there already exists an aggravated factor that achieves the  goal of punishing by death, a defendant who kills a law enforcement  officer, thereby, making.   This bill does nothing to protect our law enforcement; instead, it  raises constitutional questions as to its validity because ``targeting  law enforcement'' is substantially vague language that will subject  many innocent lives to death, based purely on their desire to exercise  their First Amendment rights about the well-documented racial disparity  in treatment throughout our communities.   We must ensure that we do not create legislation of broad scope and  vagueness that will have a chilling effect on an insular group.   H.R. 115 is laced with a discriminatory effect that will trigger  strict scrutiny under the 14th Amendment, and open the gateway for  draconian habeas laws.   This bill will create a slippery slope, further adding to recent  turbulence caused by Attorney General Jeff Session's memo and  destroying whatever trust remains between law enforcement and  communities.   This bill sends troubling messages around the world about how we view  and measure life in America in this 21st century.   It is time to get serious about this epidemic and not hide behind  vague language because `all' lives matter, blue, black, brown, white.   Mr. Speaker, while some may say that any adverse effects of the bill  before us are de minimis, and thus, will not severely impact the racial  disparity found in the use of the death penalty, it is neither the  amount of words in this bill nor the amount of time used to utter them  that is significant; rather, it is the discriminatory effect that will  result in communities disproportionately impacted by the death penalty.   Let us take for example, the case of Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. ___  (2017) where the death penalty verdict was based merely on `whether  defendant is likely to commit acts of violence in the future' and a  psychologist opined that being black did increase the probability. The  trial court reasoned that ``introduction of any mention of race was de  minimis,'' in other words, insignificant.   As Chief Justice John Roberts stated for the Court in reversing the  lower court; ``Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 115 is extremely deadly because it will undoubtedly  contribute to the continuation of well-documented and pervasive racial  disparities in the imposition of the death penalty.   Since 1976 only 20 white prisoners have been executed for the murder  of an African American victim, while an alarming 286 African American  prisoners have been executed for the death of white victims, and 42% of  African Americans currently remain on death row.   Death penalty generally, has been criticized over the years by legal  scholars and by Supreme Court Justices who have opined in several  instances, that `the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment, which  prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.'   Even in 1958, when the Court first explicitly spoke about the death  penalty as having constitutional challenges, it said in Trop v. Dulles,  ``the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause must draw  its meaning from the `evolving standards of decency that mark the  progress of a maturing society' rather than from its original  meaning.''   Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that we have evolved and matured  significantly since we first implemented the death penalty in the 1600s  and thus, we must evaluate cautiously, laws that seek to further  advance this flawed, astronomically costly and unjust practice.   Capital punishment does not work; it is discriminatory and is used  disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial,  ethnic and religious communities.   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976,  82% of all executions have occurred in the South (37% in Texas alone),  which contributed to the United States status as one of five countries  in the world to account for the most executions in 2012.   FBI data has shown that the death penalty is not a deterrent and in  fact, 14 states without capital punishment in 2008, had homicide rates  at or below the national rate.   Taking another life does not stop violence.   Like mandatory minimums, public opinion for the death penalty is  currently at its lowest with a 42% opposition, evidenced in a 2016 Pew  Research report, which found that the U.S. now dropped to number seven  worldwide in countries accountable for the most executions.   Mr. Speaker, over two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished  the death penalty either in law or practice, and the U.S. is the only  Western country that still uses the death penalty.   Even family members of murder victims and other individuals who have  witnessed live executions of death row inmates, particularly, in the  recent botched and questionable executions, have called for a repeal of  this practice and ask instead for alternative sentencing.   In fact the death penalty solves nothing, and may even perpetuate the  suffering of the parents, children, or siblings left behind.   We do not need to expand the use of the death penalty where public  opinion is at its lowest, but instead, implement sound and practical  legislation that will save lives of our officers and the people they  serve, where public opinion for this measure is extremely high.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 323 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole  [[Page H4244]]       rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
