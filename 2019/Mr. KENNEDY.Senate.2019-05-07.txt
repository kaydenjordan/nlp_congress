 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  speak on an issue that, as you know, is important to American families  all across the country.   Hardworking Americans long for cheap and efficient sources of energy  for their homes, for their businesses, and for their schools, and one  of the answers--not the only answer, but one of the answers--to this  dilemma is clean-burning natural gas.   Natural gas is an abundant energy source that, unfortunately, in some  cases is being squandered. We can do a better job of getting the fuel  to consumers. In fact, we waste too much of this useable fuel source  through a process known as natural gas flaring. Natural gas flaring is  a practice where the natural gas is intentionally burned off at a drill  site.   What I can happily report, however, is that President Trump and his  administration have begun to take the necessary steps to address the  underlying causes for this inexcusable waste.   Just last month, President Trump signed a pair of executive orders to  expedite the construction of pipelines that will allow oil and natural  gas to be safely and economically transported from drill sites to end  users.   The President took the courageous first step in addressing a problem  that has been present for far, far too long, and I am talking, of  course, about the lack of infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure  not only chips away at the great economic benefits our country receives  thanks to our drilling boom, but without pipelines and other means of  transport, processing, and storage, the cheaper and cleaner burning  natural gas is too often wasted--natural gas, mind you, that could be  powering businesses, schools, and even tens of millions of homes across  the United States.   I would also like to note that I would be remiss if I didn't mention  the environmental benefits of natural gas. Simply put, natural gas is  an environmentally friendly fuel source. This abundant fuel is not only  incredibly efficient, with a 92-percent energy efficiency, but the use  of natural gas reduces carbon emissions as well. When compared to other  fossil fuel sources, burning natural gas results in far fewer  pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, nonmethane organic  gas, and carbon dioxide. In fact, depending on the pollutant, using  natural gas can mean a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 90  percent--90 percent--in some cases.   As our drilling boom continues in America, by implementing greater  direct use of natural gas, we can cut thousands and thousands of tons  of carbon emissions from our atmosphere every year, and these are  numbers that we should all be able to get behind.   Ever since the advent of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal  drilling, we have been able to extract crude oil from deposits that we  not only didn't think we could ever reach but from deposits we didn't  even know existed until a few years ago.   American ingenuity is truly an amazing thing, and that American  inventiveness and perseverance have led the United States in becoming  the world's leader in oil production. Did you ever think America would  lead the entire world in oil production?   Unfortunately, the infrastructure to support this boom has lagged.  When drilling for oil, it is not an a la carte menu. Once the drill  reaches the desired deposit and begins pumping the targeted crude oil  to the surface, what is also brought to the surface alongside the crude  oil is natural gas. You simply cannot drill for shale oil and not  extract natural gas.   The problem, however, is while we should be looking at this  phenomenon as a net positive--one drill extracting two sources of  energy--far too often this natural gas byproduct is wasted because the  infrastructure is simply not there to move the large quantity of  natural gas to consumers. In one of our Nation's busiest oil fields-- perhaps the busiest, at least operating in America today--the Permian  Basin in the great State of Texas and the great State of New Mexico,  our shale drillers have long complained that they have no way to move  natural gas to the market because there simply aren't enough natural  gas pipelines. Adding to the dilemma is the fact that not only is there  a severe lack of pipelines, there is a severe lack of alternative  transportation options as well. When it comes to transporting oil and  natural gas, we have four alternatives: pipeline, train, truck, and  boat--pipeline, train, truck, and boat. Until President Trump signed  his Executive orders last month--one requiring the Transportation  Department to allow liquefied natural gas to be shipped via specialized  rail and tanker trucks--too much of the natural gas extracted had no  way of getting to open markets. In the Permian Basin alone--remember in  Texas and New Mexico--about 3 percent of the natural gas that comes to  the surface with the oil is flared. That means it is just burned off.  It is wasted.   Now, 3 percent may not initially sound like a lot, but when you run  the numbers, it becomes clear that we are wasting a vast amount of  money and a huge source of energy. There is so much oil being extracted  in the Permian Basin alone that over $1 million worth of natural gas is  burned away, flared, wasted every day; $1 million worth of natural  gas--a relatively clean source of energy, better for our environment-- is burned away every single day. To put that in perspective, the entire  daily energy needs of Montana or New Hampshire could be met with just  the gas that is flared in 1 day in the Permian Basin. A further look at  the numbers suggests that by the end of 2018 alone, so much natural gas  was burned off in the Permian Basin that the entire residential energy  needs of Texas for the year could have been met--the entire State of  Texas.   The problem is likely only going to get worse. The Permian Basin is  far from the only area in which flaring occurs today in our country.  Just accounting for the month of October this past year in North  Dakota, it was reported that the amount of gas flared or burned off or  wasted was enough to heat 4.25 million homes. The amount of natural gas  flared, burned, wasted for the month of October, just in North Dakota,  would have heated 4.25 million homes. This has to change. We simply  cannot continue to sit by as millions of dollars are literally burned  off every day into the atmosphere.   I thank President Trump. He took some great initial steps in trying  to solve the wastefulness inherent in flaring from speeding up the  construction of much needed pipelines to ordering increased use of  specifically designed trains and tanker trucks. The American people  will have far more access to this abundant and ever-present fuel source  for their homes, for their businesses, and for their schools. There is  [[Page S2679]]  still a long way to go--a long way to go. Additional miles of pipeline  and specialized train cars are just the beginning. I believe we can do  better--much better, in fact--than simply sitting idly by as we watch  good fuel being burned off into the night sky.   (Ms. McSALLY assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, today I wish to congratulate and  honor two Louisiana students who have achieved national recognition for  exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Kate Walker of Ruston  and Nikki Leali of New Orleans have been named State honorees in the  2019 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor  granted to one high school student and one middle school student in  each State and the District of Columbia.   Ms. Walker, a sophomore at Cedar Creek School, is being recognized  for raising more than $70,000 to find a cure for a rare neuromuscular  disease known as Friedreich's ataxia, FA. In addition to raising tens  of thousands of dollars to bring awareness to FA, Kate used different  kinds of media to spread awareness and educate the public about  disabilities, including hosting a local screening of a documentary film  about FA and starting a YouTube channel featuring weekly videos about  the challenges facing people with disabilities. Kate's mission is to  teach people the importance of treating people with disabilities the  same as everyone else.   Ms. Leali, a seventh grader at Ursuline Academy, is being recognized  for organizing a reading club that brings middle school students and  younger children together. Nikki organized the club after conducting an  annual book donation drive for several years that redistributed more  than 55,000 books in her community. Nikki's club allows young children  to build confidence in reading in a safe and fun environment, while  also providing middle schoolers an opportunity to serve their  community. Nikki has grown her club with a website and corporate  sponsors, and she now has 15 to 30 children regularly attending her  monthly meetings.   It is vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless  contributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to  think about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the  local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and  neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Ms. Walker and Ms. Leali are  inspiring examples for all of us and are among our brightest hopes for  a better tomorrow.   I also would like to salute other young people in my state who were  named Distinguished Finalists by the Prudential Spirit of Community  Awards for their outstanding volunteer service. They are Hailey  Enamorado, 15, of Denham Springs, LA; Julianna Gouthiere, 12, of  Shreveport, LA; Myracle Lewis, 17, of Baton Rouge, LA; and Grace Sun,  17, of Shreveport, LA.   All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and  accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world and deserve  our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young  Americans can and do play important roles in their communities, and  that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise  for the future.
