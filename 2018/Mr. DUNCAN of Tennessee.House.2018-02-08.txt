 Mr. Speaker, the spending bill we will vote  on later today will pass because there is something in it for almost  everyone, but there is nothing fiscally conservative about it. It busts  all the budget caps, adding $300 billion over the next 2 years, when  spending was already going up anyway. There are no pay-fors or offsets  for the disaster billions, as we have done in the past.   I repeat, there is nothing fiscally conservative about this bill. Our  deficit for the last fiscal year was an astounding $666 billion. This  bill makes it certain that this fiscal year it will be even higher.  This bill raises our national debt limit when our debt is already a  mind-boggling, incomprehensible $20 trillion. This bill puts us on a  path to a $30 trillion debt in a very few years. I say again, there is  nothing fiscally conservative about this bill.   The easiest thing in the world to do, Mr. Speaker, is spend other  people's money, but this is getting ridiculous. There is an old saying  about spending like a drunken sailor. Even drunk sailors never spent  money this recklessly.   I will say once again and close by saying, there is nothing  conservative or fiscally conservative about this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I sent my first paycheck as a  bag boy at the A&P--$19-and-some-odd cents--to the Barry Goldwater  campaign. I was 16 years old.   I have been involved in almost every major Republican campaign in my  State and nationally since then. But the Republican Party I grew up in  was the fiscally conservative party. I wish it still was.   But we will pass a spending bill today that is everything but  fiscally conservative. Our national debt is now over $20 trillion. This  bill will speed us down the road to $30 trillion.   Our deficit last year was $666 billion. This bill will make it even  higher this year. There is nothing fiscally conservative about this  bill. Spending was already going up.   Now we are busting the budget caps and adding another $300 billion  more. Anyone who supports this bill cannot accurately say that they are  fiscally conservative.   It is very sad to me that the Republican Party I love is now going  along to get along and spending many, many billions that we simply do  not have.                            ____________________
