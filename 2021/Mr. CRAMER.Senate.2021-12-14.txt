 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we approach the Christmas break and the  advent of the new year, I believe it is instructive to take an  inventory of the year that was. So in honor of the holiday season,  let's take stock of the first year of the reign of Biden, Schumer, and  Pelosi. In fact, in the spirit of the season, I am going to call this  recitation the ``Twelve Biden Blunders of Christmas.''   The first blunder that Joe Biden gave to us is a free Big Government  socialist agenda, otherwise known as the Democrats' Build Back Better  plan, designed to pass with no support from or, frankly, input from any  of these pesky Republicans.   Time and time again, Joe Biden and his Democratic toymakers have  parroted the claim that their Big Government socialist agenda costs  zero--zero. Can you imagine a piece of legislation designed to give  away trillions of dollars but doesn't cost anything? But perhaps they  have some elf dust that makes it possible.   Obviously, this isn't true. Analysis by nongovernment, nonpartisan  [[Page S9145]]  groups, including the Penn Wharton model and the Committee for a  Responsible Federal Budget, did an analysis and concluded that the cost  was much, much higher, like just under $5 trillion. A recent thorough  analysis, based on the history and the traditions of Congress and  spending, by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office agrees. The  Washington Post's Fact Checker even gave Treasury Secretary Janet  Yellen two Pinocchios when she repeated the same bogus claim that this  bill would cost nothing.   The second blunder Joe Biden gave to us is hiding from media  reporters and not taking questions. It is unbelievable to me--it is  hard to imagine the leader of the freest country in the world, in fact,  the leader of the free world, is afraid to take questions from the  fourth estate or that his staffers are afraid of what might come out of  his mouth.   Freedom of the press is enshrined in the First Amendment of our  Constitution on purpose. Yet on David Axelrod's podcast, the White  House Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted out loud that ``a lot of times  we say, `Don't take questions.' ''   The media in the United States is not supposed to be the mouthpiece  of the government or its leaders. Transparency is essential-- essential--in our exceptional self-governing system.   Now, I am not the President of the United States, but reporters who  work in the halls of this temple of liberty and, of course, reporters  back home in North Dakota know I am always willing to engage. I don't  hide from my votes or explanations for them. I am not scripted to the  point of resigning my own thoughts or opinions or even mistakes and  decisions. North Dakotans elected me, not my staff. Americans elected  Joe Biden, not his staff, not some buffer of bureaucracy. He has the  responsibility to be accessible, and the media has the responsibility  to demand it of him.   But the slippery slope doesn't end here. Another third blunder Joe  Biden gave to us is the White House deciding what is  ``misinformation.'' In a news conference, Jen Psaki said:         We're flagging--    Imagine this now, the White House spokesperson:         We're flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread       disinformation. We're working with doctors and medical       experts . . . who are popular with their audience with       accurate information. So, we're helping get trusted content       out there.    That is frightening language coming from a spokesperson for the  President. It sounds an awful lot like the U.S. Government colluding  with the media to decide what, in fact, counts as fact. In fact,  reading between the lines on this one, it seems the White House is  playing the ultimate arbiter of the truth. If this seems a little  Orwellian, well, it is. It is.   While it is easy to see why Ms. Psaki might conclude--and, frankly,  other Democrats--that they, in fact, control a ``state media,'' the  fact is, they don't. Give the American people some credit here. They  are smarter than being spoon-fed information from the West Wing through  their ``elfin folk'' at Facebook.   The fourth blunder Joe Biden gave to us is raging inflation from  pumping trillions of free dollars into the economy. We all saw the  writing on the wall when Democrats and the Biden administration pushed  for $2 trillion in ``COVID relief'' in March, just 3 months removed  from the bipartisan $900 billion relief bill. This was a total  partisan, reckless $2 trillion that came at a time when there was  obvious economic recovery coming out of the pandemic.   And now, Democrats want to spend nearly $5 trillion on their ``Build  Back Broke'' plan. To put these massive numbers in perspective, the sum  of these two bills--just these two bills--is more than the U.S.  Government spent fighting World War II. In 2019 dollars, the United  States spent $4.69 trillion over the course of just under 4 years to  fight and defeat Nazi Germany and the Axis powers.   Liberal and left-of-center economists, including Larry Summers and  Jason Furman, sounded warning bells early this year, but Democrats  forged ahead sending inflation to levels not seen in nearly 40 years.  They continue to insist that inflation is ``transitory,'' but Americans  know better. Americans paying more and more for everything with each  passing month know that this is more than transitory inflation.   The fifth blunder Joe Biden's Cabinet gave to us is Homeland Security  Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas's assessment of the southern border  crisis. Remember the hordes of illegal immigrants camping out on the  bridge in Del Rio, TX? ``Don't worry,'' Secretary Mayorkas said as he  low-balled the numbers, citing:         Approximately, I think it's about 10,000 or so, 12,000. It       could be even higher.    Actually, conservative estimates have the tally upward of 15,000  people.   While we are talking about the crisis at the southern border, it is  important to note Joe Biden made multiple claims that he visited the  border. But guess what. He hasn't. The Washington Post Fact Checker  wrote: ``We cannot find evidence that Biden at one point made a visit  to the southern border'' in his many decades of public office.   It is as though he thinks, if he says it, somehow that makes it true.  The problem is lying doesn't make the lie true. I have been to the  border, most recently, about 6 weeks ago. I can tell you, it is bad. I  can tell you, it is a crisis. Our Customs and Border Patrol agents are  completely overwhelmed. I went on a ride-along and aerial tour of the  Rio Grande Valley and visited the Donna Processing Facility, where  families and unaccompanied minors are processed. If there is any  takeaway from seeing this firsthand, it is this: There is no way to  adequately understand the magnitude of the problem or the severity of  the crisis unless you see it with your own two eyes. So I implore the  President, who has held elected office nearly uninterrupted since 1973,  please visit the southern border and acknowledge what is obvious to  everybody else. This is a national crisis.   The sixth blunder Joe Biden gave to us is a new kind of border wall,  not the wall we need to secure the crisis on the southern border, which  has seen record numbers as nearly 2 million people have attempted to  enter the country illegally under Biden's watch.   By the way, this is just the number of illegal immigrants who have  been apprehended by our CBP heroes. Now, that is more than twice the  population of my home State.   But according to Secretary Mayorkas, a border wall is an affront to-- get this--an affront to humanitarian relief. Obviously, the ranchers  and the innocent American citizens living and working near the border  don't qualify for this humanitarian relief. Yet his Agency secured and  awarded a contract for nearly half a million taxpayer dollars to build  and install a fence around Joe Biden's home in Delaware. What kind of  humanitarian relief does Joe Biden's beach mansion need?   The seventh blunder Joe Biden gave to us is $450,000 settlements for  illegal immigrants, just for being illegal. The Wall Street Journal was  the first to report this absurd plan. While North Dakota families and  businesses are struggling with inflation and skyrocketing costs on  everything because of Joe Biden's spending policies, his administration  wants to hand out hundreds of thousands of dollars to illegal  immigrants.   In comparison to the $450,000 proposed payout for illegal border  crossers, the U.S. Government pays only $100,000 to the families of  soldiers killed in service to our country, and people who are wrongly  accused and incarcerated in Federal prison are eligible for just  $50,000. That is right--$100,000 if you die defending our freedom but  $450,000 if you violate our freedom.   Now, when confronted about this, President Biden said this is not  going to happen, but he was quickly corrected by his own White House  and the Justice Department. Negotiations are ongoing, so we don't know  what any final number will be. I have helped sponsor legislation and  amendments to prevent this policy from ever being implemented. The last  thing we need is another incentive for people to come to our country  illegally.   The eighth blunder Joe Biden gave to us is private jet-setting  climate apologist John Kerry's comments on coal. Kerry stated:         By 2030 in the United States, we won't have coal. We will       not have coal plants.    While a State Department spokesperson walked back Kerry's statement,  ``noting the administration's plan still  [[Page S9146]]  would allow coal,'' it is absurd on its face.   Cutting off coal would shut down American innovation, kill all the  progress we have made on carbon capture technology, eliminate good- paying U.S. jobs, scrap grid reliability, and increase the cost of  energy and everything that is produced that is dependent on the  energy--like we need more inflation--and cede energy dominance to  foreign adversaries who have a total lack of environmental concern and  standards. Canceling coal is merely a transfer of emissions guilt to  other countries with dirtier energy production than we have.   The ninth blunder Joe Biden gave to us is moral authority and other  gaffes from Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Most notably, Secretary  Granholm--while in North Dakota, no less--said: ``We don't have much  moral authority to call out China when it comes to energy production  and emissions.''   This is not just wrong; it is embarrassing. It is not just an  intellectual mistake; it is an embarrassing gaffe. The stringent  environmental and, I might add, labor standards of the United States  are far superior to the lack of any of them in China. And I rest my  case on the facts of the situation here.   One, according to the BBC and several other agencies--but the BBC  says China emits 27 percent of global emissions, and it is a rising  percentage because it is a rising number, while the United States is  around 10 percent and a declining percent.   Two, according to the EPA, total U.S. energy-related carbon emissions  fell by 12 percent from 2005 to 2018 while the United States became the  No. 1 energy producer in the world.   In contrast, global energy-related carbon emissions increased nearly  24 percent. So the United States reduces 12; the globe increases 24  percent. This is significant by any standard and certainly qualifies us  to be able to say we have moral authority over China when it comes to  polluting and greenhouse gas emissions.   In North Dakota, in fact, we are performing ground-breaking research  and piloting innovative demonstration projects. We are in the process  of adding carbon capture technology to facilities like the Milton R.  Young and Coal Creek power generation stations.   Furthermore, the United States has invested more in clean energy,  research, development, and deployment than the next two countries  combined.   We are a global leader in climate mitigation measures for new energy  sources, carbon management, and efficiency. The radical and backwards  energy policy of this administration ignores American exceptionalism  and the real progress that we have made as a nation.   The Chinese Communist Party, Russia, and other polluters have shown  no real interest in doing so, yet Secretary Granholm and Joe Biden  provide cover for them, along, of course, with John Kerry, even  greenlighting their fossil fuel energy projects, while they kill  America's.   The tenth blunder Joe Biden gave to us is a disastrous withdrawal  from Afghanistan. There is a lot to unpack here, and nothing about this  topic is meant to be glib or sarcastic. This withdrawal was nothing  short of a tragic disaster and an international embarrassment.   We will continue searching for answers and accountability from the  administration on this, but let's focus on the failed commitments from  Joe Biden. He said his administration would get all Americans and our  allies out of the country ahead of his arbitrary August 31 withdrawal  deadline.    He also said the United States would stay in Afghanistan until all  Americans who want to leave can do so. This is obviously not what  happened.   After the botched withdrawal, the administration listed numbers  ranging from 85 people to 200 or maybe 400 Americans left in  Afghanistan. The State Department, however, believes as many as 14,000  legal permanent U.S. residents remain in Afghanistan, according to a  foreign policy press report. Whatever the number, the President went on  national television and told the world this withdrawal was ``an  extraordinary success.''   Can you imagine being one of the people left behind and seeing your  President on TV calling what he did an extraordinary success, saying  that we got out successfully? It is abundantly clear there are  significant numbers of U.S. citizens, residents, and important Afghan  allies still stranded in the country if, in fact, they are still alive  at all.   The 11th blunder Joe Biden gave to us is welcoming stiff competition  with China. In October, Jen Psaki was asked about the Chinese Communist  Party's hypersonic missile test successfully circumventing the whole  globe which, from reports, indicate they are capable of delivering a  nuclear warhead. Her response, Oh, we welcome stiff competition.   Really? Really? Why would the White House welcome military  competition from our peer adversary communist China?   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it has been a  priority to ensure the U.S. military maintains a secure and effective  deterrent, a nuclear deterrent. In order to do so, we need to modernize  our nuclear triad. America's nuclear triad of missiles, submarines, and  aircraft are 60-plus years old in many cases, and they are not the same  strong deterrent to our adversaries that they once were. It is clear  and concerning that the Chinese Communist Party is prioritizing a  nuclear buildup, and the White House seems comfortable with all of  this.   The 12th blunder Joe Biden gave to us is the consistent confusion and  alarm in regards to his own comments about Taiwan.   In October, Joe Biden told reporters, ``I have spoken with Xi Jinping  about Taiwan. We agree, we will abide by the Taiwan agreement,'' he  said. Of course, immediately, alarm bells rang out, causing confusion  and a lot of head scratching. You have to remember, we have a backdrop  of Beijing ramping up military pressure on Taiwan, and Joe Biden can't  properly articulate our Nation's foreign policy posture.   The lack of understanding on something as critical as China is  dumbfounding. Taiwan is a strategic ally and important trading partner  to the United States, especially given the increased risk China poses,  not only to the region but to the world. If this was an isolated  incident, it would be one thing, but this isn't the only time his  comments in Taiwan had to be clarified--no. In a CNN townhall, Anderson  Cooper interrupted the President to ask if Joe Biden was ``saying that  the U.S. would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked?''   Joe Biden promptly responded with, Yes, we have a commitment.   The White House resorted once again to walking back these comments,  in what seems to be a recurring occurrence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  One Washington Post article wrote:         Most analysts believe simply that Biden misspoke.    Misspeaking is a kind way to dismiss the obvious lack of clear  understanding of a critical foreign policy issue by our Commander in  Chief. If there were to be an attack, I am not even sure the President  would know what to do if he can't accurately express what our policy  is.   I am not sure I can sum this up as succinctly as two turtledoves and  a partridge in a pear tree, but I can conclude that Joe Biden and his  leftwing extremist allies deserve a lump of carbon-intense coal in  their White House stockings this Christmas.   I yield the floor.
