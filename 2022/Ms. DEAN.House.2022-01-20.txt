 Madam Speaker, I congratulate and thank the Children's  Hospital of Philadelphia on the opening of their second inpatient  hospital, in my district, in King of Prussia.   CHOP's Middleman Family Pavilion will dedicate more than 250,000  square feet of space solely to children. In our continued fight with  COVID-19, we need more facilities like this one that families from all  over our region can access.   As the first pediatric emergency room in Montgomery County, CHOP will  ensure that more children in Pennsylvania will have timely, nationally  acclaimed care.   The Middleman Family Pavilion will also create many jobs for the  Montgomery County community, bringing needed jobs to communities like  Norristown, Bridgeport, and Conshohocken.   Now more than ever, with CHOP, it is all about children. That is the  same for me. We need healthcare facilities that meet the demands of  today, that treat our children with expert care and our families with  compassion. Congratulations to CHOP.                            ____________________
