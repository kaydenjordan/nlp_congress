 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 548 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 548           Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall       be in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 36) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable       unborn children, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.   [[Page H7687]]     The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Wyoming is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Wyoming?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution  548, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 36, the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   This important bill protects and extends compassion to the most  vulnerable among us, the unborn, by prohibiting abortions, with limited  exceptions, after the point at which scientific evidence shows that an  unborn child can feel pain.   Mr. Speaker, this really should be called Micah's bill in honor of a  little boy named Micah Pickering, who was here on the Hill last week  with his mom. He was born at 20 weeks old. And we saw, and we see from  babies like Micah, that with the right medical care, babies born at 20  weeks can survive and grow into healthy adults.   Micah's mother spoke last week about her experiences: ``When Micah  was born, his eyes were still fused shut. His bones were not hardened  yet. He couldn't breathe on his own. He was medicated to stay  comfortable from pain. We were told not to touch his skin, as his skin  was so sensitive it could hurt him and tear the skin. I was there to  see his first set of hiccups, his first sneezes, and his first drop of  milk placed on his lips. His first smile, his first laugh. He was  alive. He was fighting. He wanted to live.''   Today, Mr. Speaker, Micah is a healthy 5-year-old boy.   Babies like Micah at 20 weeks have well developed brains and central  nervous systems, developed enough so that medical evidence has  increasingly confirmed these babies feel pain, and not only pain, but  intense and possibly excruciating pain.   Research also indicates that, after 20 weeks, an unborn baby's  responses to painful stimuli are similar to adult responses, to the  extent that when surgeons, Mr. Speaker, are performing in-utero  surgery, corrective procedures on these unborn children, surgeons have  seen babies flinch, jerk, and recoil from those sharp objects and  incisions.   In response to this, Mr. Speaker, surgeons routinely now administer  anesthesia to unborn children in the womb before performing surgery.  This anesthesia has been associated with a significant increase in  babies' stress hormone levels during medical procedures.   Mr. Speaker, late-term abortions, usually performed by inducing labor  after the fetus has been injected with a lethal pharmacological agent  or by the horrific practice of dismemberment, causing babies intense  pain, should be illegal, and that is what this bill ensures.   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this bill also takes important steps to  protect women, providing exceptions for those cases of rape, and  incest, and the life of the mother.   H.R. 36 also provides women with a cause of action, allowing them to  sue abortionists who don't provide protection for aborted babies who  are born alive.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act protects the sanctity of  life by ensuring protection from pain for the most vulnerable among us.   Mr. Speaker, this is a moral obligation of this House and of our  government. Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for  consideration of H.R. 36.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, an overwhelming majority of  Americans--some 60 to 64 percent, according to pollsters--support legal  protection for pain-capable unborn children at, at least, the 20th  week, or about 5 months.   Today we know that unborn babies not only die, but suffer  excruciating pain during dismemberment abortion, a cruelty that rips  arms and legs off of a helpless child. Even Supreme Court Justice  Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote on the court in the Stenberg vs.  Carhart decision said: ``The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human  adult or child would. It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from  limb.''   He points out that, with a D&E dismemberment abortion, ``the fetus  can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can  survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.''   Mr. Speaker, even if pain wasn't present, dismembering a child is  violence against children, and it is inhumane. But these babies at this  age actually suffer.   Dr. Robert White, a professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve  University, has said: ``An unborn child at 20 weeks is fully capable of  experiencing pain. Without question, abortion is a dreadfully painful  experience for that child.''   Dr. Colleen Malloy, a professor at the Division of Neonatology at  Northwestern, in her testimony before the House Judiciary Committee  said: ``When we speak of infants at 20 weeks post-fertilization, we no  longer have to rely on inference or ultrasound imagery because such  premature patients are kicking, moving, and reacting and developing  right before our eyes in the neonatal intensive care unit. ``   Again, these children are there being assisted, and if you touch  them, if you try to dismember them once they are born, they will feel  the pain. In like manner, an unborn child at 20 weeks' gestation will  feel the pain. She points out that she would never, ever commit such  cruelty to a child.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, H.R. 36.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Utah (Mrs. Love).                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think that it is important to acknowledge the pain of the cases  that those on the other side of the aisle are mentioning. But I would  note, Mr. Speaker, that there has been no mention, no discussion on the  other side of the aisle about the pain that these babies feel, and that  when you are in a situation like the ones that have been described,  what is happening is those babies are being subjected to really,  oftentimes, a horrific procedure. The question is, because a baby is  found to have some chromosomal anomaly, to have some very severe  handicap, whether or not they deserve to be subjected to the pain we  now know they feel.                                time  1315    In fact, Mr. Speaker, we have seen work done by Northwestern  University that demonstrates that the pain that these young preemies  feel may, in fact, be even worse than the pain that older babies feel,  because the pain inhibitors develop later in life than the pain  receptors do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not  to ignore the challenges and the issues involved here with respect to  the pain that these babies feel. I would also note, Mr. Speaker, that  the CBO, in a very unusual step, has assessed that this bill itself  would save 2,750 lives annually. That is something that the CBO doesn't  often do, but it is very important for us to recognize.   I don't think we can have a discussion about this bill, about these  issues, without acknowledging the pain that these babies feel, and I  would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to focus on  that as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that the scientific evidence is  extensive in terms of the pain that these unborn babies feel. In  particular, the standard of care, Mr. Speaker, for babies who are born  prematurely, as well as for babies who are patients in vitro, is to  provide anesthesia. And that standard of care is based upon evidence  that these babies have pain receptors, that these babies react to pain,  and that they feel pain.   Mr. Speaker, I think the notion that there is no scientific evidence  for this is flat wrong. I don't think we can ignore the example of  babies like Micah, babies who are born, babies who grow up to lead very  full and healthy lives and who deserve a chance.   Mr. Speaker, I think that as individuals and as Representatives,  elected Representatives, it is our obligation, in fact, to do  everything we can to protect these babies, and that is what this bill  is about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his work  on this issue and for introducing this important bill. It is undeniable  that we have a much better understanding today of life inside the womb  than we did at the time of the passage of Roe v. Wade.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle express a commitment to  science in all cases except where it matters most, in those cases that  involve the preservation of human life. They don't want to talk about  babies. They don't want to talk about the horrific procedures that we  are dealing with today, and we have to. It is our obligation to.   Mr. Speaker, our country has banned partial-birth abortion in a  decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court, and I would just urge my  colleagues to look at the decision in that opinion, Gonzales v.  Carhart, the decision written by Justice Kennedy: talking in specific,  quoting a nurse, talking about the reaction of a 26-week-old baby who  was a victim of partial-birth abortion, what their physical reaction  is, the mother of little babies reading that, and the description of  what happens to a baby when they are killed--watching their hands  expand and then contract, as any mother of a newborn infant has watched  many times.   It is truly horrific, and I think, as a society, Mr. Speaker, we have  to be willing to face the exact nature of what it is we are talking  about. We have an obligation as elected Representatives, Mr. Speaker,  to protect the lives of these unborn babies. This legislation would do  that.   We have a moral obligation, and it is our job. It is in the interest  of the States to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that we do everything possible  to protect life.   In this case, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a bill that would  protect babies at moments when we know they can feel pain in the womb.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of both the rule and of  H.R. 36 so that we can continue to protect and save lives.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 548 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to  [[Page H7693]]       clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into       the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union       for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the       cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain       individuals who are long-term United States residents and who       entered the United States as children and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
