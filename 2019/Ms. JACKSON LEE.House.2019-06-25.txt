 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts, and let me also indicate to my good friends on the other  side of the aisle how grateful I am to the Democratic leadership who  put children first and have worked with the CHC, the CPC, the CBC, and  the whole Democratic Caucus for the passionate views that Members have,  many of the Members who have made repeated trips to the border.   As a Representative from a border State living with this on a very  daily basis and interacting with my colleagues who live actually on the  border but also seeing the results of it by many of those who have come  to Houston, Texas, I understand that we have to get this right.   Let me also say to my good friend Chris Cuomo, who, night after night  after night after night, would ask the question, ``What is Congress  doing?'' I can assure him that the mess that we are in, unfortunately,  goes right to the foot and the front door of the White House, for if it  were not the overfocus on building a wall, or the insisting on  maintaining individuals on the Mexican border when Mexico is not  prepared, or the steering away of funds from the likes of Guatemala,  Honduras, and El Salvador and the rage of individuals who are fleeing  in desperation to get away from persecution and having the right to  claim the legal right of asylum, which is international law, maybe we  would not be here.  [[Page H5141]]    The reason why I can say that is because, in the last couple of  hours, the head of CBP, in good conscience, in their own moral compass,  and in their own standard of what is right and what is indignity, could  not stand by where almost 100 children were returned back to the filth  that they had had to live in.   Now, I know the people in CBP. I know that there are good,  hardworking people all over the border who work for the Federal  Government, but there is the lack of resources because we are being  held up by individuals who did not want to transfer or to focus on  their needs over a wall or over mass deportation, policies that were  distracting from helping these children.   I also know that when there is a will, there is a way. So the  question of whether or not they could find toothpaste, toothbrushes,  and soap appalls me, that the administration could not readily have  those resources for those border personnel. It is a disgrace.   I know it because I was there holding little Roger, 9 months old, who  had been separated from his family. Roger couldn't speak, so if he  didn't have a clean diaper, he could not speak.   But in this bill that we are dealing with--and we are still making  sure that we are dealing with the administration, telling them that  they have to provide aid to Central American countries--we are doing  something that is not done: $200 million omitted from the Senate bill  for processing a Senate pilot program.    This program would provide medical treatment, food,  clothing, telephone access, legal representation, asylum interviews,  and other services to migrant families and unaccompanied children, the  same children who were down there; and we wonder why this wealthy  country and the executive who has the ability to move dollars around  could not get the minimal, bare needs of those people. $92 million for  medical care, which is what I begged for; $90.6 million for temporary  duty and overtime; $90 million for transport; preventing spending money  for any purpose that isn't specifically described in the measure, such  as expanding border barriers.    More people are coming because they are desperate, from countries,  Haiti and African countries. We are going to get enhanced translators  to help people understand, and if they are determined to be able to be  in this country through the asylum process, they would be allowed.   We are acknowledging the fact that there is desperation. We are  acknowledging the fact that our CBP and others need to do their job,  but we are acknowledging the fact that this is our responsibility. We  are going to help these children. We are going to hold them to us like  they are ours, and we are going to make sure that there are not these  kinds of horrible descriptions and conditions that our little babies  have to suffer through. We are going to do that today.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and Homeland Security, I rise in support of the rule governing debate  on H.R. 3401, the ``Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for  Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act of  2019,'' and the underlying legislation.   I support this legislation because it provides the humanitarian  assistance needed to address the inhumane conditions and treatment of  immigrants, especially immigrant children, that this administration has  created and allowed to persist.   The scenes emanating from the Southern border are heartbreaking, and  they have been for a very long time.   I remember when I was at the border, visiting with children separated  from the border.   I remember young baby Roger, a very young child, who should not have  been subject to these conditions.   We are learning of other children living in squalid conditions.   A chaotic scene of sickness and filth is unfolding in an overcrowded  border station in Clint, Texas, my homestate, where hundreds of young  people who have recently crossed the border are being held, according  to lawyers who visited the facility this week.   Some of the children have been there for nearly a month.   Children as young as 7 and 8, many of them wearing clothes caked with  human excrement and tears, are caring for infants they've just met, the  lawyers said.   Toddlers without diapers are relieving themselves in their pants.   Teenage mothers are wearing clothes stained with breast milk.   Most of the young detainees have not been able to shower or wash  their clothes since they arrived at the facility, those who visited  said.   They have no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap.   The arrival of thousands of migrants at a time, overflowing the  border patrol facilities of the Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration  and Customs Enforcement and Health and Human Services, has created a  humanitarian crisis that has resulted in unsafe, unsanitary conditions  and tragic deaths.   All sides need to come together immediately and commit the necessary  resources and capabilities to manage this situation and provide for the  basic human rights of everyone involved.   If Congress and the administration fail to come to an agreement, the  situation at the border will only deteriorate. Cutting funding to these  agencies now will not punish the agencies or the administration: it  will punish the migrants. Congress has an urgent moral responsibility  to protect children and families, and defend the health, dignity and  lives of those in need.   Conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities along the  border have been an issue of increasing concern as officials warn that  the recent large influx of migrant families has driven many of the  facilities well past their capacities.   In May, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security  warned of ``dangerous overcrowding'' among adult migrants housed at the  border processing center in El Paso, with up to 900 migrants being held  at a facility designed for 125. In some cases, cells designed for 35  people were holding 155 people.   This is why it is imperative to support this supplemental funding  bill, which:   Provides $4.5 billion in emergency spending to address the  humanitarian crisis at the border--securing robust funding for  priorities including legal assistance, food, water, sanitary items,  blankets and medical services, support services for unaccompanied  children, and refugee services, which will relieve the horrific  situation of over-crowding and help prevent additional deaths.   Protects families and does not fund the administration's failed mass  detention policy--funding effective, humane alternatives to detention  with a proven track record of success, placing strict limits on influx  shelters, protecting sponsors from DHS immigration enforcement based on  information collected by HHS during the vetting process and creating  strong oversight by Congress including to protect unaccompanied  children.   Helps address the roots causes of the crisis--reversing the  administration's senseless decision to block the U.S. assistance that  Congress has already appropriated for the Northern Triangle countries,  and ensuring funding is used responsibly to improve border security,  stop human smuggling and drug trafficking, combat corruption and reduce  poverty and promote growth in Central America.   And the bill is sure to guarantee that it does not use the emergency  that is this crisis, for the purpose of advancing any other policy  objectives.   Specifically, the supplemental also contains important oversight  provisions to hold the administration accountable and to protect the  rights and dignity of migrants, including:   No funding for a border wall or barriers, or for ICE detention beds;   Prohibits the use of funds for any purpose not specifically  described;   Places strict conditions on influx shelters to house children by  mandating compliance with requirements set forth in the Flores  settlement;   Protects sponsors and potential sponsors from DHS immigration  enforcement based on information collected by HHS during the sponsor  vetting process;   Ensures congressional oversight visits to facilities caring for  unaccompanied children without a requirement for prior notice;   Requires monthly reporting on unaccompanied children separated from  their families;   Requires additional reporting about the deaths of children in  government custody; and   Ensures CBP facilities funded in the bill comply with the National  Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search.   I urge all members to support the rule and the underlying  legislation.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary and Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 3401, the ``Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian  Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act of 2019.''   I support this legislation because it provides the humanitarian  assistance needed to address the inhumane conditions and treatment of  immigrants, especially immigrant children, that this Administration has  created and allowed to persist.

Toddlers without diapers are relieving themselves in their pants.   Teenage mothers are wearing clothes stained with breast milk.   Most of the young detainees have not been able to shower or wash (  their clothes since they arrived at the facility, those who visited  said.   And it is inexplicable, indefensible, and inhumane that they are not  even being provided toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap.   Just reflect on that for a moment; innocent children and toddlers are  being denied soap and toothpaste at the very same time that similar  treatment to a prisoner of war would violate Article 26 of the 1949  Geneva Convention:         The Detaining Power shall be bound to take all sanitary       measures necessary to ensure the cleanliness and       healthfulness of camps and to prevent epidemics . . . . Also,       apart from the baths and showers with which the camps shall       be furnished, prisoners of war shall be provided with       sufficient water and soap for their personal toilet and for       washing their personal laundry; the necessary installations,       facilities and time shall be granted them for that purpose.    The arrival of thousands of migrants at a time, overflowing the  border patrol facilities of the Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration  and Customs Enforcement and Health and Human Services, has created a  humanitarian crisis that has resulted in unsafe, unsanitary conditions  and tragic deaths.   It is imperative that this House take decisive action to provide the  necessary resources and capabilities to mitigate the humanitarian  crisis created by this Administration and provide for the basic human  rights of everyone involved.   If Congress and the Administration fail to come to an agreement, the  situation at the border will only deteriorate.   Cutting funding to these agencies now will not punish the agencies or  the Administration: it will punish the migrants.   Congress has an urgent moral responsibility to protect children and  families, and defend the health, dignity and lives of those in need.   Conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities along the  border have been an issue of increasing concern as officials warn that  the recent large influx of migrant families has driven many of the  facilities well past their capacities.   In May, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security  warned of ``dangerous overcrowding'' among adult migrants housed at the  border processing center in El Paso, with up to 900 migrants being held  at a facility designed for 125.   In some cases, cells designed for 35 people were holding 155 people.   This shameful episode in American history is capped by the  resignation announced today of John Sanders, the Acting Commissioner of  the U.S. Customs and Border Protection whose tenure at CBP included  children being kept at border stations with deplorable conditions,  including a facility that one of the independent inspectors, a medical  doctor, compared to ``torture facilities.''   This is why it is I strongly support this supplemental funding bill,  which provides:   1. $934.5 million for processing facilities, food, water, sanitary  items, blankets, medical services, and safe transportation;   2. $866 million to reduce reliance on influx shelters to house  children;   3. $200 million for an integrated, multi-agency processing center  pilot program for families and unaccompanied children, with  participation by non-profit organizations;   4. $100 million for legal services for unaccompanied children, child  advocates, and post-release services;   5. $60 million to assist jurisdictions experiencing a significant  influx of migrants and non-profit organizations serving those  communities;   6. $20 million for Alternatives to Detention;   7. $15 million for the Legal Orientation Program to educate migrants  about their rights and legal proceedings; and   8. $9 million to speed up placement of children with sponsors and  manage their cases.   In total, Madam Speaker, this legislation provides $4.5 billion in  emergency spending to address the humanitarian crisis at the border-- securing robust funding for priorities including legal assistance,  food, water, sanitary  [[Page H5159]]  items, blankets and medical services, support services for  unaccompanied children, and refugee services, which will relieve the  horrific situation of over-crowding and help prevent additional deaths.   Equally important, this supplemental protects families and does not  fund the Administration's failed mass detention policy.   Instead, the bill smartly provides funding for effective, humane  alternatives to detention which has a proven track record of success;  places strict limits on influx shelters; protects sponsors from DHS  immigration enforcement based on information collected by HHS during  the vetting process; and creates strong oversight by Congress.   Madam Speaker, the bill before addresses the roots causes of the  crisis by reversing the Administration's senseless decision to block  economic assistance that Congress has already appropriated for the  Northern Triangle countries.   It is significant that this legislation clarifies the intent of prior  year appropriations for Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador which  specifically required these governments to take steps to curb  migration, improve border security, including preventing human  smuggling and trafficking, and trafficking of illicit drugs and other  contraband; combat corruption; and support programs to reduce poverty  and promote equitable growth, particularly in areas contributing to  large number of migrants, among many other conditions.   The bill provides, however, that not less than 75 percent of any  funds that cannot be provided to the central governments of such  countries due to their failure to meet the certification requirements  shall be reprogrammed through nongovernmental organizations or local  entities in such countries and that the balance of such reprogramming  must be to countries within Latin America and the Caribbean.   Madam Speaker, I am particularly pleased that the Manager's Amendment  to this humanitarian emergency supplemental appropriations bill  includes a provision that I worked very hard to have included and which  requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to the Congress a  plan for ensuring access to appropriate translation services for all  individuals encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services   It is simply unconscionable to subject refugee child from Honduras or  El Salvador or Guatemala to legal proceedings conducted in a language  foreign to him or her without the assistance of a translator conversant  in that child's native tongue. Also to be able to translate for new  desperate migrants from Africa and other nations.   Another reason to support this legislation is that it contains  important oversight provisions to hold the administration accountable  and to protect the rights and dignity of migrants, including:   No funding for a border wall or barriers, or for ICE detention beds;   Prohibits the use of funds for any purpose not specifically  described;   Places strict conditions on influx shelters to house children by  mandating compliance with requirements set forth in the Flores  settlement;   Protects sponsors and potential sponsors from DHS immigration  enforcement based on information collected by HHS during the sponsor  vetting process;   Ensures congressional oversight visits to facilities caring for  unaccompanied children without a requirement for prior notice;   Requires monthly reporting on unaccompanied children separated from  their families;   Requires additional reporting about the deaths of children in  government custody; and   Ensures CBP facilities funded in the bill comply with the National  Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search.   Madam Speaker, since December 2018, six minor children have died in  custody after being apprehended by U.S. border agents since December.   We cannot wait any longer to resolve the humanitarian crisis on the  southern border exacerbated by this Administration.   That is why I support H.R. 3401, and urge all members to join me in  voting to pass this critically needed legislation.    Mr. Speaker, earlier today I was very pleased to  have had one of my amendments passed in the Financial Services  appropriations legislation that really many people are not aware of.  That is the utilization of deceased children's Social Security numbers.   Fraudulent individuals add more insult and hurt to those families who  have lost their precious children by stealing their Social Security  numbers and utilizing them in the public arena. It is important to note  that these Social Security numbers are very valuable because,  obviously, children have no long record of any credit improprieties or  bad credit, and, therefore, it seems as if you have a perfect number to  do all manner of havoc and to create a trail of responsibility for  these mourning parents and guardians.   So we have asked for an investigation into the use of these Social  Security numbers and a method in which to stop these fraudulent  individuals from using the Social Security numbers of deceased  children, but more importantly, adding to the absolute devastation of  these families that their little, precious loved one is now being  abused and misused in their death.   I thank my colleague, the Honorable Barbara Lee, who offered the  amendment on my behalf on the floor, but I am grateful to the Financial  Services and General Government Subcommittee appropriations chair,  ranking member, and the full committee chair and ranking member. This  is an important amendment that will stop these tragic incidences from  impacting these mourning families on the loss of their little ones                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 3 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 26, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
