 Mr. Chair, I am proud to represent over 8,000 Lebanese- American families in my district in Illinois who care deeply about our  U.S. national security.   The longstanding U.S. military investment in the independent Lebanese  Armed Forces, known as the LAF, has worked to support U.S. security  interests in the greater Middle East for over 15 years.   As the co-chair of the U.S.-Lebanon Friendship Caucus, we work  closely with the brave men and women in the U.S. military to ensure  robust and stringent oversight of the U.S. investment into the LAF and  any other U.S. foreign military funding abroad.   The stability of the LAF is important not only to the security of  Lebanon, but also to their neighboring countries, and the United  States.   The LAF works to prevent the furtherance of terrorist and extremist  groups like Hezbollah and ISIS in the region. It fights against  weapons, drugs, and human smuggling, and maintains stability in a  country that is a ripe target for terrorists and malign actors.   I agree with my colleagues that we must be stewards of taxpayer money  and reduce wasteful government spending. However, we must also support  successful policies that continue to return on our investment in  protecting the long-term U.S. security interests here at home. That  investment in the LAF has helped to promote U.S. interests in the  greater Middle East and in Lebanon.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.
