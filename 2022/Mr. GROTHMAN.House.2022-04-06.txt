 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.  [[Page H4220]]     Mr. Speaker, I rise to educate my colleagues and the  public one more time as to what sort of disaster we are soon to have on  the southern border.   Recently, we have had frequently 90,000 to 100,000 people cross the  border every month. People of whom we know little. People are skipping  to the head of the line over people who want to come here legally,  people that come from countries that are hostile to us.   But as bad as it is to have 80,000 to 100,000 people come across, the  Biden administration is claiming that within the next month and a half  they will remove title 42, opening up the border to perhaps another  200,000 or 300,000 or 400,000 people a month above what we are already  getting here.   I personally think they are doing this because the Ukraine war is  going on, and they think they can really land a death blow to the  future of this country by opening up the border to people all over the  world.   I call upon American citizens and my colleagues to not forget about  what is going on at the border. I call upon the press to treat this  story with the gravity it should be given and to report on all the  people who are going to come here in the second half of May.   We cannot have 400,000 people a month coming across the border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our country is obviously in bad shape, and  I think our forefathers, if they saw the way we operated today, would  be quite stunned and wonder where in their Constitution they let us  down to wind up where we are today.   I think of the three branches of government. The judiciary is the one  which right now has let down the Framers the most. Our forefathers  realized that a country with elections usually eventually fails because  the majority can either want, or be manipulated into wanting, more  stuff, or ordering other people around to order them to be obeyed the  way they would like other people to be behaved.   The Bill of Rights is almost exclusively about restricting the role  of government in American life. Obviously, the Supreme Court has  largely abandoned that function. Things got bad in the 1930s and 1940s,  and again in the 1960s. Today, one wonders what the Court will ever say  no to.   Where will Judge Jackson fit as we try to defend our Constitution? We  look at her inability to say what a woman is and her inability to talk  about judicial philosophy, and we know where she will stand. She stands  with woke America. I hate that word, but that is what it is. It is  somebody who has no respect for tradition. If you have no respect for  tradition or common sense, you certainly don't have that near  reverence, which should be a requirement for any Supreme Court Justice.   Furthermore, President Biden got himself in a position in which he  said he is going to have to promote a Black woman to that position. The  very idea that you think decisions on a court should vary with the  background of the person who is on that court shows you don't have that  respect for the Constitution.   All Americans should have an originalist view of the Constitution and  consider it the great, almost God-given, document that it is.   In any event, when you don't have that respect for the Constitution,  you know you are not going to respect the Second Amendment. You are not  going to respect the 10th Amendment; it is a disaster we have ignored  it. You are going to continue to stretch the Commerce Clause all out of  whack. You are going to look at every individual as a member of a  group, never as an individual in their own right.   Right now, about 2 percent of the lawyers in the country are Black  women. So, what Joe Biden did is he took 98 percent of the possible  resumes for this very important job and threw them in the garbage.   I wonder if President Biden does that anywhere else in his life? Does  he throw away 98 percent of the resumes or potential resumes when he is  looking for a new dentist, a new plumber, a new clergyman, throw out 98  percent willy-nilly? That is what he has done in picking a new Supreme  Court Justice who could well be on the Court for the next 40 years.   Our forefathers felt that by giving us this Constitution--they  pointed out that this Constitution is fit for moral and religious  people and not fit for anyone else. Will Judge Jackson respect that? I  don't know.   When they finished the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin said: We are  giving you a republic, if you can keep it.   We are, right now, being tested whether we are the moral and  religious people that can keep the republic that the forefathers felt  they described in the Constitution.   It looks to me, from everything you hear about her, that Judge  Jackson is not going to have that reverence to keep that Constitution,  to keep that republic. We will, therefore, with judges like that, wind  up collapsing.
