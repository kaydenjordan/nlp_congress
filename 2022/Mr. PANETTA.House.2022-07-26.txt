 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the heroic service of  U.S. Army Retired Special Forces Major John J. Duffy.   Recently, Major Duffy was recognized as a recipient of the Medal of  Honor--not just for his service, but for his gallantry and intrepidity  above and beyond the call of duty.   A resident of my district in Santa Cruz, California, Major Duffy  served four combat tours in Vietnam, oftentimes operating well behind  the enemy lines. Throughout his time in the military, he was the  recipient of 64 awards and decorations, 29 of which are for valor.   Recently at a ceremony at the White House, Major Duffy received the  Medal of Honor from President Joe Biden. The medal was in recognition  of his actions on April 14 and 15, 1972, when Major Duffy was the  adviser for the 2nd Brigade of the 11th Airborne Division for the  Republic of Vietnam.   Over those 2 days, Major Duffy valiantly defended Fire Support Base  Charlie against an attack from a battalion-sized group of the enemy.  During the battle Major Duffy took charge after his CO was killed in  action. Despite constant attacks by the enemy and being shot multiple  times, he refused to leave, and he returned enemy fire as he tended to  his wounded soldiers. During the eventual evacuation of the base, he  led the operation and continued to tend to his soldiers who were  wounded in action. He finally left the base, but he was the last man to  do so.   Major Duffy exemplifies the heroism that is required to earn this  award and represents the type of service and sacrifice that is at times  necessary in combat for our brothers in arms and for our country. That  is why we in our community, on the central coast of California, are so  proud to call Major John Duffy our neighbor, a veteran, and our  countryman of the United States of America.                 Recognizing the Life of Diane Porter Cooley     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Diane  Porter Cooley, a pillar of the Pajaro Valley and Santa Cruz County  community.   Born to a family that settled in Santa Cruz County in the 1850s,  Diane was raised on Las Lomas Ranch in Watsonville. Diane had a deep  connection to the land and to the people of the central coast of  California. Her father, Tom, was one of the four founders of Driscoll's  Berries, and Diane continued her involvement with agriculture until her  passing earlier this year.   A deeply passionate civic leader, Diane worked tirelessly to protect  and preserve the environment and was an outspoken advocate for the  people of the Pajaro Valley. She was a dynamic agent of change who  championed the creation of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, the Pajaro  Valley Arts Council, the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County, and  the Land Trust of Santa Cruz County.   Madam Speaker, Diane Cooley's outreach and philanthropy extended far  and wide throughout our community. As Santa Cruz County bids farewell  to its beloved daughter of 95 years, may her legacy of giving continue  to inspire all of us for generations to come.                            ____________________
