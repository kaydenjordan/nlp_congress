 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, runaway inflation is crushing working  American families on Democrats' watch. The share of Americans who say  the economy is our most important problem hasn't been this high since  the last time Democrats controlled the White House.   Just this morning, we got a devastating quarterly GDP report. The  economy actually shrank 1.4 percent over the last 3 months. No longer  are Democrats just presiding over a disappointing recovery. Now they  have thrown the recovery into reverse, and we are actually going  backward. We haven't seen inflation this bad in more than 40 years-- month after month of skyrocketing prices.   It is exactly what everyone knew would happen if Democrats dumped $2  trillion in printed money on an economy that was already ready for a  comeback. But Democrats rammed through the far-left spending. So  working Americans are paying dearly.   This week, the same Washington Democrats who drove this inflation  have finally figured out their response. They want to raise taxes on  the American people. The Democratic leader said this Tuesday:         If you want to get rid of inflation, the only way to do it       is to undo a lot of the Trump tax cuts and raise rates. No       Republican is ever going to do that. So the only way to get       rid of inflation is through reconciliation.    Said the Democratic leader. Now, remember, Senator Schumer is the  same person who said in March 2021:         I do not think the dangers of inflation, at least in the       near term, are very real.    Now the same person who predicted that inflation would not happen is  saying we have to fight inflation by dramatically raising taxes on the  American people.   The answer for Democrats hurting families once is for Democrats to  hurt families twice. This is literally the Democratic economic agenda  for your family: high prices and less money.   Republicans' 2017 tax cuts just about doubled the standard deduction  for households. We created a brandnew zero percent tax bracket for the  first $24,000 that a married couple brings in. Repealing that law would  cut that in half and raise your taxes. That is what repealing the 2017  tax bill actually means.   Republican tax cuts also double the child tax credit from $1,000 to  $2,000, a tremendous help for working families. Repealing the 2017 tax  law would slash those credits in half, but that is what Democrats say  they want to do because of the inflation that they created.   This is Senate Democrats' position: Because their bad decisions have  hurt Americans once, the solution is to hurt Americans twice. First,  they hurt you with inflation, and now, they want to hurt you with tax  hikes.   We will see what our citizens have to say about that later this year.                                 Immigration    Mr. President, now, on another matter, yesterday Secretary Mayorkas  testified: ``We will not lose operational control of the border.'' But,  of course, the truth is they already have. The Secretary's own Customs  and Border  [[Page S2201]]  Protection personnel are struggling to keep up with the massive,  massive numbers. Only halfway through the fiscal year, they have  already encountered a million people trying to enter our country  illegally, and that doesn't count all the people they actually never  caught.   But now President Biden wants to rip away the one remaining bandaid  preserving any semblance of law and order. He is canceling the pandemic  authorities that let CBP immediately turn people around and actually  send them back home.   This week, the administration put out a laughable excuse for a new  border security plan. In this new memo, Secretary Mayorkas says he aims  to have a total capacity to hold 18,000 illegal immigrants in custody  at one time. But here is the problem: That is the number of illegal  immigrants that some CBP officials fear we could soon be seeing every  single day. Let me say that again. The administration hopes they will  soon be able to hold 18,000 people total in custody, while the experts  warn we could soon have 18,000 coming in every single day.   So perhaps that is why the second main point in this Mayorkas memo is  this: ``moving with deliberate speed to mitigate potential overcrowding  at Border Patrol stations.'' So if you translate that from Washington  speak into plain English, it means they want to speed up catch-and- release a whole lot faster. They don't have a plan to secure the  border. They have a plan to keep the turnstiles greased up and spinning  as fast as possible--a total abdication and the opposite of what the  American people expect.                               National Defense    Mr. President, now, on one final matter, the free world has rallied  behind Ukraine, including by supplying lethal aid that Ukrainians need  to actually fight and win this war. But it is not enough for Americans  and our allies to help arm Ukraine; we need to modernize and grow our  own defenses at the same time. After just 2 months, our aid to Ukraine  has drawn down a quarter--a quarter--of our entire stockpile of Stinger  anti-air missiles and a third of our Javelin antitank missiles. Our  eastern flank allies' stockpiles of similar weapons have also shrunk as  well.    So this is a wake-up call and not just about our ability to support  the current fight; Ukraine's expenditure rate of critical munitions  should cause us to question whether our own wartime requirements for  weapons systems and munitions are sufficient.   This would be less of a problem if we had a robust defense industrial  base to quickly refill our armories. But defense manufacturers have  admitted that the production lines for some critical components have  actually dried up, and it could be years before they could replace the  weapons that we have already sent to Ukraine.   We live in a dangerous world. Whether it is the prospect of  escalation by Russia against NATO today or the threat of aggression by  China, Iran, North Korea, or some other adversary tomorrow, America  must be prepared to project power all over the globe.   We cannot assume our adversaries will give us time to prepare for  battle or to restock in the middle of one. For the sake of deterring  the next conflict or winning it if deterrence fails, we must invest in  our military readiness.   For 2 years in a row, the administration has submitted budgets that  do not adequately resource our military. They have failed to even keep  pace with President Biden's inflation, meaning a net cut in funding.  And with prices soaring, it won't just take longer to build new  Stingers and Javelins; it will cost more for them as well.   Congress has already given the administration significant tools and  authorities to help America's defense industry address the urgent and  growing demand for critical munitions and weapons systems. This is  precisely--precisely--the situation the Defense Production Act was  designed to address. But instead of invoking the DPA as intended, this  administration has entertained far-left schemes to use it for unrelated  liberal goals like environmental policy.   But I am glad to hear President Biden will be traveling to Alabama  next week to visit a facility that manufactures Javelins. While he is  there, I hope he will reconsider what his administration is doing to  ramp up production of other critical munitions and weapons systems.   I hope he will recognize what is needed to enhance America's security  and that of our NATO eastern flank allies and Asian partners threatened  by China. The President should use the powerful tools he already has-- he already has--to fix this shortfall before it is too late.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
