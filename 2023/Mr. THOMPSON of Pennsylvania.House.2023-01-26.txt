 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage  my colleagues to join the bipartisan Career and Technical Education  Caucus, the Congressional Service Caucus, the German-American Caucus,  and the Congressional Scouting Caucus.   As the proud co-chair of all four of these bipartisan caucuses, these  organizations are a great way for members to get involved and share  interests. As a senior member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce, I have always supported and will continue to support career  and technical education programs that provide learners of all ages with  career-ready skills, restoring rungs on the ladder of opportunity.   Along with my co-chair, Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, the  bipartisan CTE Caucus highlights the importance of preparing a well- educated and skilled workforce.   Through this caucus, we have made tremendous strides in providing  learners of all ages the skills necessary to obtain high-quality,  family-sustaining jobs. One of those successes includes the passing and  enactment of the Strengthening Career and Technical Education 21st  Century Act.   Through these programs, we give individuals the ability to restore  the rungs on the ladder of opportunity. CTE programs exist in every  State and congressional district; therefore, I cordially invite you to  join the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus. Together, we  can improve America's competitiveness and help facilitate job  opportunities for our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join the bipartisan  Congressional Service Caucus, co-chaired by my colleague, Congressman   Jim Panetta of California.   This caucus recognizes the many nonprofit service organizations  across the country and their long history of promoting community  service and humanitarian assistance.   These volunteer service organizations have extensive member clubs in  towns across America and in nearly every country around the world, and  notable examples include the distinguished organizations such as  Kiwanis International, Lions Clubs International, Optimist  International, and Rotary Clubs International.   The caucus will serve as a platform for educating Members, staff, and  the public on policy issues relating to our service organizations. It  will also share positive stories from clubs across the country in hopes  of fostering the future viability and continued growth of local service  clubs and the work of their volunteers.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join the bipartisan  German-American Caucus. I co-chair the German-American caucus with my  colleague, Congressman Bill Keating of Massachusetts.   Today, there are more than 40 million Americans of German descent  living in the United States, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  boasts one of the largest German populations in the country.   Our caucus seeks to bring together members dedicated to strengthening  the German-American friendship and economic partnership, discuss joint  priorities, and work through differences in opinion, as well as  maintain the historical and cultural connection between our two  nations.   The partnership between Germany and the United States is central to  the transatlantic alliance and the US-EU relations. Through networking,  supporting educational and exchange programs, and discussing recent  updates and events around global foreign affairs, the caucus will focus  on advancing the German-American partnership to better support  security, safety, and prosperity within our own countries and on a  global stage.   Madam Speaker, lastly, I encourage my colleagues to join the  bipartisan Scouting Caucus. I co-chair this caucus alongside my  colleague, Congressman Sanford D. Bishop, Jr., from Georgia. The  Congressional Scouting Caucus is a bipartisan group that aims to  promote the values of scouting and support it in all forms at the  highest levels of our government.   As a caucus, we will serve as an informal group of members dedicated  to issues related to scouting and educating other members on this  subject.   Scouting has been an important part of each of our lives and gives us  the tools at an early age to develop personal and leadership skills  that have helped make us successful.   As adults, we have been involved in promoting scouting and believe  strongly in its ability to positively impact millions of American  youths. I would encourage any member interested in supporting scouting  of any kind to join the caucus.
