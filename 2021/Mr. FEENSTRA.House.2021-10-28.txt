 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Louden  Lofgren, the son of my friend and my former colleague, Iowa State  Senator Mark Lofgren.   Louden sadly passed away at 2 years of age after complications from  surgery, where he needed multiple blood transfusions.   After he passed away, his family launched a blood drive, known as  Love Like Louden, to encourage folks to donate blood and draw attention  to hospital shortages of blood.   Every 2 seconds, someone in America needs blood, and over 38,000  pints are needed daily.   If you can, please consider donating blood in Louden's memory.   May God bless the Lofgren family.                            ____________________
