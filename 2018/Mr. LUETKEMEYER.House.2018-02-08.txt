 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for the  time. To say that the current regulatory climate presents challenges  for small financial institutions would be a drastic understatement.  Today, regulators require more and more from community banks in terms  of both regulatory oversight and capital requirements.   The gentlewoman from Utah has crafted legislation that seeks to  alleviate some of these pressures facing our community banks. Small  bank and thrift holding companies confront unique challenges with  regard to capital formation, which is a particular concern at times  when regulators demand more and more capital.   Understanding these challenges, the Fed has recognized that small  banks have limited access to equity financing. The Federal Reserve  small bank holding policy statement gives relief from certain capital  guidelines and requirements, making it easier for a community bank to  raise capital and issue debt, and to make acquisitions and form new  bank and thrift holding companies.   I would like to digress for just a little second here. I haven't  heard anybody talk about it, and I think it is very important, Mr.  Speaker, that we talk about the timeframe prior to 2008, whenever we  were averaging about 150 to 175 new banks and credit unions every year.  But between the timeframe of 2010 and 2006, we averaged one.   That is significant because small businesses get their loans from  small banks. And without this access to capital for small businesses,  we will dry up our small businesses in this country that are the job  creators.   So by increasing the threshold, the Fed's policy statement from $1  billion to $3 billion, we have the opportunity to help more banks  operating in our community, and hopefully be formed in our communities,  and help our lending to our constituents.   Similar legislation has been contemplated in the House on a number of  occasions. The language in this latest iteration is identical to the  bipartisan language proposed in the Senate Banking Committee bill and  is similar to legislation that passed the House in the 114th Congress  and included in my CLEARR Act.   H.R. 4771 will go a long way in ensuring that our Nation's smallest  institutions are able to grow stronger and continue to serve their  constituents.   I want to thank Mrs. Love for her leadership on this legislation and  Chairman Hensarling for his commitment to issues facing community banks  and credit unions.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to have this  opportunity. I thank the chairman as well, and I want to thank the  ranking member for all of the work that she has done in this area. She  has been a part of the avant-garde to protect and maintain  community banks.    One of the great difficulties that we have had with our committee is  defining what a community bank is. We have had testimony to indicate  that a community bank can be $50 billion or more. We want to make sure  that the small institutions that the chairperson is talking about  continue to exist.   It is unfortunate, but if we pass this legislation, there is a good  likelihood that the level of consolidation that will take place will be  antithetical to the very commentary that we are hearing with reference  to the need for community banks, small banks to make sure small  businesses will receive loans. There is a contradiction contained  within the very effort that is being made.   I am honored to have with me a statement from over 200 civil rights  community organizations, labor unions, businesses, investors, faith- based businesses, community and civic groups; and this statement  reads--this is from them, but I concur with it: ``Raising the limit to  $3 billion is a policy well calculated to significantly reduce the  number of community banks in the U.S. First, raising the limit will  allow medium-sized community banks of $2 to $3 billion in size to more  easily acquire smaller community banks. . . .''   That is a significant comment because the acquisition of smaller  banks is going to cause us to have fewer smaller banks, and the  argument that is being made is that the smaller banks are the ones that  are servicing small businesses.  [[Page H987]]    It goes on to read: ``. . . reducing the number of independent  community banks. Second, allowing holding companies to borrow  excessively will raise the risk of bank failure the next time the  financial system is under stress.   ``A $3 billion limit is unjustified, as there is no evidence that  community banks over $1 billion in size are currently too small to  survive. According to a recent FDIC report, `While economies of scale  are important for community banks, historical trends in the size  distribution of community banks that have survived over the last  quarter century do not suggest that economies of scale require a  community bank to grow or merge to asset sizes larger than $1  billion.''   My point is that I am a proponent of community banks.                                time  1145    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional  30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. The point is that I am a proponent of having  small banks. I call small banks community banks. I am a proponent of  this. If I am a proponent of it, then I support the notion that we  cannot allow them to be consolidated such that we will have fewer of  them.   I think this legislation is a little bit misguided in that it  contradicts the very premise upon which it rests.
