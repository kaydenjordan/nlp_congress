 Madam Speaker, I thank President  Trump, congressional leadership, Chairman Neal, Ranking Member Brady,  and members of the USMCA working group for fighting to make significant  improvements to the out-of-date NAFTA agreement.   This is a win for New Mexico's workers, small businesses,  agricultural producers, and our economy as a whole.   In my conversations with constituents from across southern New  Mexico, I have seen just why NAFTA is out of date and why USMCA will be  a better deal.   Dairy producers in Belen and Roswell have talked with me about how,  even when New Mexican dairies aren't selling directly to Canada,  increased market access and new pricing will raise commodity prices  across the country.  [[Page H12263]]    USMCA makes significant progress in protecting American workers by  evening the playing field with meaningful enforcement mechanisms that  will protect hard-won improvements.   Other New Mexicans, like our world-famous New Mexico chili and pecan  growers, now have the certainty of a trade deal.    New Mexico stands to gain real benefits after we pass USMCA today.   Like any deal, it isn't perfect. Environment and enforcement  standards can always be improved. But the USMCA is entirely necessary  for New Mexico's producers, workers, and consumers.   This deal will deliver for New Mexico. It shows that compromise can  be made, that we can put politics aside.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of USMCA.
