 Mr. Speaker, I just saw a report that most minimum wage  workers need 2\1/2\ full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom apartment.   Many of us can't imagine deciding between paying rent and buying  food, but that is exactly the choice that far too many Americans face.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, helps by providing  a small benefit so families don't go hungry. But the farm bill that the  House Republicans have passed cuts SNAP by $23 billion.   Let's remember, most people on SNAP who can work, do work.   Let's also remember that real farmers rely on the farm bill. The  longer Republicans try to use it for entitlement reform, the longer we  hurt those farmers.   The American people made their priorities clear at the ballot box:  They want to create opportunity and possibility for all our families.   Here is a radical idea: Let's listen to them. Let's follow the lead  of Senate Republicans and Democrats who worked together on a farm bill  that helps farmers and maintains SNAP. And let's end hunger now.                            ____________________
