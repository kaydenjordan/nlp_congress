 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life  of Ralph ``Chad'' Colley, Jr., who passed away on January 30, 2021, at  the age of 76. Mr. Colley was a hero in every sense of the word. His  courage, positive nature, and life of service provided a shining light  that inspired everyone around him.   Colley was a veteran of the Vietnam war, a gold medal athlete, an  accomplished pilot, a successful businessman, and a tireless advocate  for veterans and all Americans with disabilities. His military honors  included the Silver  [[Page S571]]  Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Combat Infantryman Badge.   Colley was born in Fort Smith, AR, on May 13, 1944. His father served  in the U.S. Army, and the family lived in Kansas, Georgia, Germany, and  Japan. He attended North Georgia College, where he earned a bachelor's  degree in mathematics, played football, and ran track. After his  graduation in 1966, he followed in his father's footsteps and served as  a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army. A year later, he married Betty  Ann Putnam, and they shared 53 years together. They had two children,  Ryan and Emily.   As part of the 101st Airborne Division, Colley arrived in Vietnam in  November 1967. Within 6 months, he was a company commander. In July of  1968, he was commanding the 3/187th infantry company when he stepped on  a landmine. The blast led to amputation of both of his legs above the  knee and his left arm below the elbow. While recovering, he sent Betty  Ann a letter that said, ``I'm banged up pretty bad, but I'm still me.''   He recalled in later years that he was grateful to have only suffered  physical injuries. ``I had to get on with it. Plain and simple.'' And,  he did get on with it. Although he had to leave his lifelong dream of  serving in the military, he did not let this dramatic change of plans  slow him down.   Within 2 years of his injury, the Colleys had settled in Barling, AR,  where he began selling real estate in 1970. That same year, he was  honored nationally as the Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year,  obtained his pilot's license, and took up skiing.   Throughout the 1980s, Colley provided leadership to help disabled  veterans and was part of efforts to make public facilities more  accessible to all disabled Americans. He served as a member and leader  with the Disabled American Veterans, DAV, National Amputee Chapter 76  in New York, and with the DAV in Arkansas. Colley was elected national  commander for the DAV from 1983 to 1984 and lived in Washington, DC, to  advocate for veterans on a national and international level.   Colley also devoted time to helping candidates he believed in,  including working on the Arkansas State GOP Executive Committee, the  Sebastian County GOP Committee, and on the Presidential campaigns for  both George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole. His efforts led to him speak at the  1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego, CA.   His life was not all policy and politics, and his involvement in the  DAV led him to further develop his passion for snow skiing. Colley was  a natural athlete and was eventually selected for the U.S. Paralympic  Team. During the 1992 Paralympic games in Albertville, France, he won  gold medals in both downhill and super-G events. He was 48 years old.   By 2002, Colley had retired. He and Betty Ann shared time between  their homes in Barling and New Smyrna Beach, FL. He remained active in  veterans organizations and gave his voice and influence to countless  projects, including plans for future expansion of the Fort Smith  National Cemetery.   In 2017, Colley shared memories of his favorite childhood Christmas  with Do South Magazine. When he was 11 years old, his parents hosted  holiday gatherings in their small home for all 120 men in the four  platoons his father commanded. The expense of providing food for all of  those people meant a much smaller Christmas for their family, but they  gave all they had to make it a memorable holiday for those homesick  soldiers.   Colley wrote:         Of all of the Christmases I've celebrated and all the gifts       I've ever received, which one is, without equal, the most       loving, meaningful, instructional and lasting gift? Why it's       the one I celebrated with more than one hundred big brothers!       These are the six aspects of my best Christmas gift ever: the       gift of empathy, the gift of joy, the gift of brotherhood,       the gift of sharing, the gift of the possible and the gift of       self. This gift has shaped the character of my brother Ken       and me for our whole lifetimes.    I am grateful for the incredible example Chad Colley gave us  throughout his life. His values ran deep, influencing every facet of  his character and informing his remarkable experiences. My staff  recently had the honor of interviewing him for the Library of Congress  Veterans History Project. He was a man of great kindness and humility  who gave credit for all of his accomplishments to his faith and family.   I join Chad Colley's family, friends, and all Arkansans in mourning  his passing. Although he accomplished tremendous things personally,  like the example set by his parents, I know his legacy will be what he  taught us all about kindness, humility, and service.                            ____________________
