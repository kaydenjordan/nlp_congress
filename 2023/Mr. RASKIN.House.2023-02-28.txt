 Madam Chair, I thank the distinguished ranking member of  the subcommittee for her leadership on refuting this legislation.   After 2 years of rooting for economic failure and blaming President  Biden for everything; for post-COVID global inflation, for the  instability caused by supply chain breakdowns, and the phenomenal  failure of Donald Trump's mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic,  after all that, after all the whining and crying about inflation,  Republicans finally have the chance to take center stage, right now,  with their proposed solution to the problem of inflation.   The world has been waiting with bated breath. Would it be what  Richard Nixon did, wage and price controls? Would it be what Herbert  Hoover, that Republican did, total laissez-faire, whatever happens,  happens?   Well, the long wait is over. The GOP has now debuted their big plan  for dealing with inflation in America with H.R. 347, something called  the REIN IN Act, which stands for the Reduce Exacerbated Inflation  Negatively Impacting the Nation Act.   It is a bill for a mandatory reporting requirement related to  executive orders that might apply to two or three executive orders a  year.   You got that right: A reporting requirement related to a handful of  executive orders every year is the GOP's response to inflation after  barnstorming the entire country, claiming that they had some kind of  solution.   Now, you might think it is the most brilliant thing since the  invention of Social Security, which they opposed, or Medicare, which  they opposed, or you might think it is the dumbest thing since Donald  Trump's last trillion-dollar corporate tax giveaway.   But either away, it will have zero effect on inflation or deflation  in the United States of America. Nothing. It is not going to have any  effect at all.   Now, our friends in the GOP are interested in this session of  Congress in tortured, inscrutable, incomprehensible acronyms.   So they can have the REIN IN Act, which they seem very connected to,  but I want to suggest a better title that will still conform to their  acronym. Let's call it the running on empty initiative based on no  ideas none act. How about that?   The legislation was hatched without any hearing, and it shows. It has  no legislative meaning and no potential economic consequences.   Even as reporting bills go, it is pathetically weak, as it doesn't  even require publication of the report. They came up with a reporting  requirement that didn't even require the report to be published.   Look, executive orders are not the cause of inflation, and there is  no economic research suggesting they are.   The most conservative economists in the world will tell you that  inflation is a complex, global phenomenon connected to prices, supply  chains, supply and demand curves, and unemployment rate.   Since 2020, inflation has risen worldwide, exacerbated by supply  chain delays caused by the pandemic and then Vladimir Putin's filthy  war of aggression in Ukraine, which some of our friends over there  support.   President Biden has created something like an economic miracle out of  the chaos handed to him by Donald Trump.   After signing his massive tax giveaway, Trump's failed State  dysfunctional response to COVID plunged America into its most severe  economic contraction since 1946. Someone dispute that.   The unemployment rate rose to 14.8 percent under Donald Trump, the  highest on record since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting  data in 1948.   In 2021, Biden and the Democrats got to work. We passed the American  Rescue Plan, which fueled a strong, equitable, economic recovery with  historic reductions in unemployment, in poverty, in economic hardship.   Real GDP increased by 5.7 percent. The unemployment rate decreased to  4 percent, surpassing all forecasts. Wages increased by 5 percent with  the highest increases going to lower economic income earners.   So Democratic policies have allowed the U.S. to absorb the shock of  rising inflation engulfing the globe since 2020.   That is serious economic policy, what President Biden and the  Democrats are engaged in, and they have a silly little symbolic  messaging bill for a couple of notations they didn't even want to  publish originally within the process of offering executive orders.    Madam Chair, we have created 12 million new jobs in  America. How many million jobs do they want to erase over there in  their desperate, sudden pursuit of inflation?   They raised the debt limit three times under Donald Trump. Now they  talk about the debt limit all the time. They raised it three times, and  they contributed under Donald Trump 25 percent of all the debt in the  United States from George Washington to Joe Biden--25 percent of the  debt under one President, Donald Trump.   They did that, and now they dare come talk to us about inflation, and  the bill that they advance is one to have some people pass some more  paperwork around.   Come on. Give me a break. Give us something better than the running  on empty initiative with no new ideas at all.   We recommend a ``no'' vote. What real economic action requires is  precisely what President Biden is already doing.  [[Page H945]]         Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, actually, I have a question because it  strikes me  [[Page H946]]  as a very sincerely and decently motivated amendment to a flawed bill.   But is there a reason to think that any of the current economic  analyses of inflation and the current indicators that we use don't take  into account the various factors that the gentleman specifies?   I yield to the gentleman for the purposes of a colloquy.    Madam Chair, reclaiming my time.   That makes great sense to me, and I am tempted to support the  amendment. If the gentleman is correct, that points to a larger  problem.   Is the gentleman telling us that the inflation rate today that is  published by our government does not incorporate spending patterns in  rural areas, for example?                                time  1800     Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois for  the purpose of a colloquy.    I am sorry. By which definition?    Reclaiming my time, I don't know what the reason for that  is, and thank you for educating me. I wasn't aware of it.   I assume they are saying the inflation rate is higher in urban areas  than it is in rural areas, which is, presumably, why they peg it to  that. That might bring the inflation rate down.   Would the gentleman just give me a sense of how taking it into  account might affect what is today the general inflation rate? Let's  assume it is inflated because it is focused on the urban areas where  the cost of living is higher. Would it reduce the overall inflation  rate?    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois for  the purpose of a colloquy.    Reclaiming my time, this very constructive colloquy, I  think, underscores the importance of actually having hearings in  Congress. This is legislation that sprung out of someone's head  somewhere and then appeared on the House floor without actually having  a hearing where we could examine it.   The gentleman raises a profound point that might lead us to question  inflation statistics generally. I just don't know. At this point, we  are all guessing because we haven't had a hearing, and we don't know  the facts of it.   Unfortunately, we are going to be sending people, including me, to  the floor to vote on this amendment without really having any  information about the background.   Obviously, we want to make sure that military personnel, farm  households, and residents of rural areas are included, forcefully, if  they are excluded now, even if that means bringing the inflation rate  down, something I imagine President Biden would quite enjoy.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, the first thing I want to note about this  amendment is that it now expands the definition of a major executive  order to include those projected to cause an annual gross budgetary or  economic effect of at least $1 billion, which includes those orders  that would have a positive economic effect of $1 billion or more,  thereby just adding a lot more paperwork, a lot more unnecessary  bureaucratic entanglement.   The distinguished chair of the Oversight and Accountability  Committee, I think, mentioned in passing the Biden administration's  attempt to roll back some of the radical deregulatory program of the  Trump administration, which undermined regulations favoring automobile  safety, train safety, water safety, land safety.   Again, we have what appears to be another clever talking point by the  GOP, and the whole country is now up in arms over what took place in  East Palestine, Ohio. We see precisely what the human effects and  consequences are of their radical, pro-corporate deregulatory agenda,  dismantling the rules and regulations that protect public safety and  public welfare.   That is really what is going on over there. It is not about having a  couple of little analyses stuck onto an executive order every 4, 5, or  6 months. We know exactly what the real economic program is.   This bill is a camouflage, just like this amendment is, and I urge  the body to oppose it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I want to just clear up a couple of things.   First, I heard the very distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado  mention job creators. I assume she was responding to President Biden  since 12 million new jobs have been created under President Biden,  whereas millions of jobs were lost under the prior President, who may  be a favorite of the gentlewoman's.   I also wanted to make just a brief semantic point because the  gentlewoman was making a grammatical error that I heard some of her  colleagues make before. I believe she referred to a ``Democrat  solution.'' I heard another Member talk about a ``Democrat Member'' and  a ``Democrat plan.''   I just wanted to educate our distinguished colleagues that  ``Democrat'' is the noun. When you use it as an adjective, you say the  ``Democratic Member,'' or the ``Democratic solution,'' or the  ``Democratic plan.''   I assume it is a good faith grammatical error the first few times,  but after people are corrected several times and they continue to say  it, it seems like it is an act of incivility, as if every time we  mentioned the other party it just came out with a kind of political  speech impediment like, ``Oh, the banana Republican Party,'' as if we  were to say that every time we mentioned the ``banana Republican  Member,'' or the ``banana Republican plan,'' or the ``banana Republican  Conference,'' but we wouldn't do that.                                time  1815    So out of pure political courtesy, when it is an adjective, refer to  the ``Democratic Congresswoman'' or the ``Democratic Member.''   Having said that, I would like to say that I favor the Boebert  amendment. I think it is really the Raskin amendment because none of  them apparently caught the fact that their reporting requirement wasn't  to be published until I told them. I actually read the bill, and I said  there is no publication of it. So this amendment follows through on the  fact that I pointed out to them that their bill didn't even call for  publication of the inflation information which they thought was so  essential.   Madam Chair, I am afraid I am going to have to support the Boebert  amendment, because I think I am the genesis of it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I would ask if the gentleman would be  willing to yield for a couple of questions?   Again, there was no hearing in committee, so I don't understand this.  This might be a great idea, but I would like to figure it out.   It requires that any inflationary estimates prepared incorporate the  inflationary impact of debt servicing costs, which seems perfectly  logical to me.   But is there a reason to think that the current inflation rate, as  defined by the U.S. Government, does not incorporate the inflationary  impact of debt servicing costs?   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman for the purposes of a colloquy.    So that is true across the board in terms of all of the  economic indicators that we read about, whether it is the OMB or the-- --    Madam Chair, I reclaim my time and thank the gentleman  for his kind answers.   This really is why we have hearings in Congress, because it feels  like we are just posting a lot of graffiti on a wall here.   I don't know how the inflation rate is calculated. I don't know  whether the import of this amendment would be to double count debt  servicing costs because I don't know which government agencies actually  incorporate debt servicing costs and which don't.   One thing I do know is that if the gentleman has the greatest  amendment of the year, it is still basically irrelevant because it does  nothing. In other words, it is not going to do anything to bring down  anybody's debt servicing costs, which I agree are huge, unlike, for  example, what the Biden administration has done in terms of student  debt by acting dramatically to bring it down--even though there are  people from across the aisle who are in court today, I believe, trying  to get that thrown out and trying to bring everybody's student loan  debt back up--that is real economic action.   In any event, what this is about is pure symbolism. In other words,  they are asking for a reporting bill that will only apply if there is a  $1 billion plus impact, and the good gentleman comes forward to say:  Make sure, Mr. President, when you are doing your calculations, that  you include debt servicing costs.   I don't know. You could take it or leave it. It doesn't do anything  for people who are staggering under debt. The way that the Biden  administration is trying to act, for example, is to deal with the  problem of student debt or the way that we have acted to try to help  people who are suffering under mortgage debt, that is real economic  action.   I am just going to have to consider it carefully, given the  information we have. But I will end with a plea for the good chairman  of the Oversight Committee, the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky:  We have to have hearings on these bills, so we know what we are talking  about, because I feel like we are dancing in the dark here.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just repeat my puzzlement from before.   Perhaps if Mr. Cloud would yield for another question.   What is the inflationary impact of debt servicing costs? Have there  been any economic studies on that?   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman for a colloquy.    Madam Chair, I reclaim my time.   I think the gentleman raises a very interesting point. I would love  to know the answer as to whether or not it is actually incorporated  today in what the inflationary or deflationary effects are of debt  servicing costs. Obviously, this bill and this amendment would not have  any impact on what those debt servicing costs are, but I don't see much  of a problem of adding this language to the hortatory nature of the  legislation.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I will just end on this one with this  thought.   The majority comes forward with a plan to say we want to know an  estimated inflationary impact of an executive order, and then we have a  series of Christmas tree amendments saying, make sure you include the  cost to rural areas; make sure you include the cost of debt servicing.  I would like to know the overall costs.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I want to speak in strong support of the  gentlewoman's amendment. I thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her leadership in  terms of real economic policy, which is about making the government an  instrument of well-being and public good.   We know we have serious philosophical differences with our friends  across the aisle. Many of them wanted to dismantle Social Security and  Medicare. When President Biden arrived the other day, a lot of them  retreated very quickly from it.   I would be delighted if someone wants to challenge me on that because  we have all the quotations from all the Republican Senators and  Representatives that said it was time to get rid of Social Security and  phase it out, adopt means testing, increase the age, so on and so  forth.   That is a real policy difference. What they have done here really  falls under the category of symbolic politics. The good gentlewoman  from Texas has done her best to make this meaningful, and I thank her  for giving me the opportunity to say that.    Madam Chair, I rise in favor of Mrs. Lee's excellent  amendment here which makes both powerful economic points and powerful  constitutional points.   The economic point is that Congress must act in order to bring down  inflation, Congress must act in order to promote employment, and we  have acted in partnership with President Biden to do just that in the  Inflation Reduction Act, in the infrastructure act, and in a whole  series of bills that we have used to bring inflation down and to  dramatically lower unemployment in the country.   But she is making also, I believe, a very powerful constitutional  point because part of what gets lost in the symbolism of this  legislation--a mere messaging bill about having executive orders over  $1 billion, which describes a handful in a year attached in an  inflation description--what gets lost is that the Constitution in  Article I sets it up so that Congress is the major definer of economic  policy in the country.   It is Congress that is supposed to be laying and collecting taxes and  impost and dealing with the debt of the country. It is Congress that  regulates commerce among the States and with foreign countries.   So the failure to come forward with real productive legislation on  inflation is also a surrender to the executive branch, and we don't  need to do that.   So we should be working with the executive branch as we have done in  the Inflation Reduction Act, with the infrastructure bill, in lowering  prescription drug costs, and in lowering the costs for diabetics to get  their insulin shots to $35 a month. That is the real pathway, not just  a bunch of reporting bills.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    As far as I understand, the amendment just adds one more  unnecessary detail to the report, creating greater administrative  burden and taxpayer costs that are still undefined. It is unclear why  it is necessary. If it is necessary, it should be adopted across the  board. But, of course, we had no hearing so we can't really understand  what the merits of the proposal are, but right now, it just seems like  a lot more bureaucratic paperwork.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
