 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a moment I am going to put forward a  unanimous consent request to pass a trade bill cosponsored by all the  Democrats and Republicans on the relevant committee in the other body-- the Ways and Means Committee--and was ultimately passed by the other  body--the House--by voice vote. So there was no opposition in the other  body. In fact, it was put forward by the Republican Chair Jason Smith  and the Democratic Ranking Member Richard Neal, as well as Senator  Crapo and myself over here.   I think it would be fair to say that this kind of unanimity over in  the House, where sometimes they can't agree to order a 7-Up, is pretty  amazing--that they passed a trade bill unanimously.   Before I make the UC request on this bipartisan, bicameral bill  called the United States-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First  Agreement Implementation, I am just going to talk briefly about why the  bill is so important.   The basic proposition is this: First and foremost, the U.S. Congress  fully supports deepening our trading relationship with Taiwan and wants  to ensure the recent agreement covering trade facilitation, anti- corruption, and small business is durable and legally sound. Not only  is Taiwan a critical market for U.S. exporters, it is also a democracy  that shares our values and has strong ties with Oregonians and  Americans across the land.   Next, this body wants to be clear that trade and trade agreements are  within the constitutional authority of the Congress. One of the ways  the Senate demonstrates this is by approving trade agreements just like  this one.   Finally, this bill requires greater transparency and consultation, as  well as public review, for future Taiwan trade agreements. These ideas  can sound a little abstract, so I will put it in real-world terms.   In a few hours, I am heading to rural Oregon to meet with my  constituents and hold town hall meetings. Farmers and ranchers in  Grant, Harney, and Malheur counties care a lot about trade. They want  new markets to sell wheat and potatoes and the like.   I am never going to tell a farmer in Ontario or La Grande that they  don't deserve the right to read a trade agreement and understand how it  affects them before it is signed and wrapped up.   Trade agreements that affect millions of Americans can't be done in  the dark. Congress and the American people need to know what is in  these deals and how they benefit American interests.   I look forward to working with the USTR as it negotiates the bigger  ticket items with Taiwan--issues like digital trade, labor,  environment, and agriculture, as outlined in the negotiating mandate.  Future agreements need to bulldoze barriers to trade for Oregon  exporters, including red tape like labeling rules and technical  standards that make it hard for exporters to sell their goods.  Involving Congress and the public is going to help the administration  break down these barriers.   This is a proposal that brings both sides together. As I said, every  Member of the Ways and Means Committee--every Democrat, every  Republican--is on board. So the glide path to passage here was no  accident. My colleagues, Ranking Member Crapo, as well as Chair Smith  and Ranking Member Neal worked with me to hammer out a bill that could  receive that kind of attention.   My colleagues are eager to get back home, so here's the bottom line:  Passing the Taiwan trade agreement bill is a can't-miss opportunity for  the Senate to support Taiwan, clarify Congress's role in trade, and  call for more transparency and consultation.   In a moment, I am going to make a unanimous consent request.   In fact, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my  good friend from Idaho Senator Crapo's statement.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          I am going to yield now to Chairman Menendez, the chair of  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because he and I work very  closely together on all of these kinds of issues, on the Foreign  Relations Committee and the Finance Committee, and I have the good  fortune of having Senator Menendez, essentially, sit next to me in the  Finance Committee.   So we are going to be working together. I am going to make the  unanimous consent request in a minute. But I want to yield to Chairman  Menendez.   Thank you for the fact that we are working together today. We have  got lots to do in the future and we are going to work together.   I yield to my colleague.    Mr. President, before I make my unanimous consent request,  I just want to reiterate that Senator Menendez and I are going to be  working together on these issues. He made this point with respect to  taxes, and we are going to be able to find common ground, I believe,  with Senator Crapo, who can't be here today but who is very, very  strongly in support of this effort.   Let me repeat that, colleagues. Senator Crapo, the ranking member on  the Finance Committee, is very strong for this effort.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 4004, which was received from the House  and is at the desk. I further ask that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I will be brief because I know my  colleagues want to go to the other body.   I think this is very unfortunate. This is an extraordinary  opportunity for our country, and this is a great opportunity for the  world.   The fact is that there has been an extensive review of this  particular agreement. The administration talked to a number of Members  of Congress on both sides of the aisle. This legislation went through  the House of Representatives unanimously, and that was after every  member of the relevant committee--the House Ways and Means Committee-- cosponsored the legislation. They didn't just vote for it; they  cosponsored it.   I think it is very unfortunate for my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to object. The chair of the Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Smith, the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee,  Congressman Neal, and the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee,  Senator Crapo--all of us--have been working for months now on this  particular proposal, and I think it is very unfortunate that our  colleague from Arkansas has decided to object. It is his right, but I  think it is very unfortunate for our country because this could have  been a very, very special day with the passage of this.   We are going to be back here, working together, as you have heard-- Chairman Menendez from the Foreign Relations Committee and I and  Senator Crapo. We are going to work together with every Member of this  body to get this very important trade initiative enacted into law.                            ____________________     With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:49 p.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 5:17 p.m. when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Kaine).                            ____________________     Madam President, one topic there is much agreement on is  the benefits of work, and our laws should support those who want to  work. The bill I am introducing today will change Social Security so  that parents and their children will know that working will never  disadvantage them in the future.   Let me explain the problem. Under current law, a child with a  disability that began before age 22 may receive a Social Security  benefit based on the work of a disabled, retired, or deceased parent.  Often the child receives this benefit for the rest of their life.  Social Security provides the benefit because the child is usually  dependent on their parents for financial support. The problem is that  the law regards earnings by the child above $1,470 a month as ending  that dependency--even if the child is no longer able to maintain that  level of work in the future. When that dependency ends, the child  ceases to be eligible for the benefit from the parent. Instead, the  child would receive a benefit based on their work. The benefit from the  parent's work is often significantly larger than the child's own  benefit. Because of this policy, parents of children with disabilities  may prevent their child from working at their full potential, fearing  that the work will cause the child to lose out on the larger benefit.  We need to change Social Security to ensure parents and their children  that working will not cause them to be worse off in the future.   To provide that assurance, I am introducing the Work Without Worry  Act. The bill ensures that any individual with a disability that began  before age 22 will receive the larger of the benefit from either their  parent's work or the benefit from their own work. Any earnings from  work--no matter how much--will not prevent the child from receiving a  Social Security benefit from their parent's work as long as the child  is eligible for disability insurance by the same impairment from before  age 22. This legislation would give parents the assurance that their  child with a disability can work without having to worry that the child  will lose out on the full protections that Social Security provides.   I want to thank Kathy Holmquist, president of Pathways to  Independence, Inc., in Portland, OR, who has been a leader in my State  helping people with disabilities live and work with dignity. Kathy  contacted me about the need for this legislation, and I appreciate her  advocacy and support. Additional thanks to The Arc for the technical  assistance and endorsement of the bill. The bill is also endorsed by  the American Network of Community Options and Resources, ANCOR,  National Down Syndrome Congress, the Association of University Centers  on Disabilities, Justice in Aging, American Association on Health and  Disability, Lakeshore Foundation, Autistic Women and Nonbinary Network,  National Organization of Social Security Claimant Representatives,  Special Needs Alliance, National Association of Disability  Representatives, Autism Society of America, Disability Rights Education  Fund, and the Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities, CCD,  Social Security Task Force. I am grateful that Social Security  Subcommittee Ranking Member John Larson is introducing the companion  bill in the House of Representatives. The Senate bill is cosponsored by  Senators Cassidy, Budd, Sanders, Klobuchar, Markey, Warren, Whitehouse,  Merkley, Murray, and Brown.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in  the Record following this statement, along with two support letters.   There being no objection, the text of the bill and letters of support  were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2196         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

National Down Syndrome Congress.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Cassidy: The       National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC) writes to thank you       for introducing the Work Without Worry Act of 2023. NDSC is       the country's oldest national organization for people with       Down syndrome, their families, and the professionals who work       with them. We provide information, advocacy, and support       concerning all aspects of life for individuals with Down       syndrome and work to create a national climate in which all       people will recognize and embrace the value and dignity of       people with Down syndrome. This bill would undoubtedly       positively impact the lives of people with Down syndrome.        Under the current law, young adults who qualify for Social       Security Disabled Adult Child (DAC) benefits often hesitate       to explore employment opportunities due to the fear of losing       their vital benefits. The Work Without Worry Act offers a       much-needed solution by ensuring that any past earnings from       work, irrespective of the amount, will not impede the       eligibility of otherwise qualified individuals for Social       Security DAC benefits based on their parent's work history,       provided their medical impairment originated before the age       of 22.        We believe that this bill will have a transformative impact       on the lives of individuals with disabilities, allowing them       to pursue their professional aspirations while maintaining       financial security. By promoting fairness and treating all       individuals with severe medical conditions that began before       age 22 equally, regardless of their parents' Social Security       benefit status, the Work Without Worry Act better ensures       inclusivity and equity within our society.        NDSC fully supports the Work Without Worry Act's objectives       and applauds the bill's commitment to financial security and       fairness for young adults with disabilities. It is estimated       that this legislation will positively impact the lives of       nearly 6,000 individuals with disabilities over the next       decade, creating opportunities for growth and independence.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue, and we look       forward to working with you to pass this bill into law. If       you have any questions, please contact Chapman Bryant, Policy       and Advocacy Associate.            Sincerely,                                                   Jordan Kough,                                                 Executive Director,      National Down Syndrome Congress.                                   ____                                         Consortium for Constituents                                               with Disabilities,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2023.      Senator Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Senator Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Wyden and Cassidy: The cochairs of the       Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities (CCD) Social       Security Task Force write in support of the Work Without       Worry Act and thank you for introducing this crucial       legislation. The Consortium for Constituents with       Disabilities (CCD) is the largest coalition of national       organizations working together to advocate for Federal public       policy that ensures the self-determination, independence,       empowerment, integration, and inclusion of children and       adults with disabilities in all aspects of society free from       racism, ableism, sexism, and xenophobia, as well as LGBTQ+       based discrimination and religious intolerance.        Many people with disabilities rely on Social Security       ``Disabled Adult Child'' (DAC) benefits. These crucial       benefits allow people whose disabilities onset before age 22       to claim benefits on a parent's record, allowing parents to       continue to support their children with disabilities even       after retirement, disability, or death. Unfortunately,       navigating the different programs and their rules are       extremely complex for people with disabilities and their       families. Most important, if a young person with disability       has countable earnings of even a dollar over the substantial       gainful activity (SGA) level ($1470 a month in 2023) before       receiving DAC benefits, they lose their eligibility for DAC       benefits forever. This creates a disincentive to work for       young adults with disabilities, who may want to try and work,       but who are unsure of their capacity and need to try working       different numbers of hours. There are many circumstances in       which a young person with a disability may be able to earn       over SGA for a short period of time or a few times, but are       unable to sustain that level of work or income in the long-      run. Families often worry that the wrong amount of work will       cause their family member to lose eligibility for DAC       benefits and this fear may discourage young adults with       disabilities from working.        The Work Without Worry Act would eliminate this work       disincentive by allowing young adults with disabilities to       try and work and see if they can support themselves without       losing eligibility for DAC benefits. Earnings from work over       SGA will not prevent the individual from receiving DAC       benefits from their parent's work history as long as the       individual remains disabled by the same impairment from       before age 22 and meets other eligibility conditions for       benefits. The benefit amount will be either the benefit from       the individual's parents or the benefit from the individual's       own work history, whichever is higher.        We strongly support this important change to allow young       adults with disabilities to work to the best of their       abilities and look forward to working with your offices to       advance this legislation.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of  2009 to authorize the modification of transferred works to increase  public benefits and other project benefits as part of extraordinary  operation and maintenance work, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

National Down Syndrome Congress.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Cassidy: The       National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC) writes to thank you       for introducing the Work Without Worry Act of 2023. NDSC is       the country's oldest national organization for people with       Down syndrome, their families, and the professionals who work       with them. We provide information, advocacy, and support       concerning all aspects of life for individuals with Down       syndrome and work to create a national climate in which all       people will recognize and embrace the value and dignity of       people with Down syndrome. This bill would undoubtedly       positively impact the lives of people with Down syndrome.        Under the current law, young adults who qualify for Social       Security Disabled Adult Child (DAC) benefits often hesitate       to explore employment opportunities due to the fear of losing       their vital benefits. The Work Without Worry Act offers a       much-needed solution by ensuring that any past earnings from       work, irrespective of the amount, will not impede the       eligibility of otherwise qualified individuals for Social       Security DAC benefits based on their parent's work history,       provided their medical impairment originated before the age       of 22.        We believe that this bill will have a transformative impact       on the lives of individuals with disabilities, allowing them       to pursue their professional aspirations while maintaining       financial security. By promoting fairness and treating all       individuals with severe medical conditions that began before       age 22 equally, regardless of their parents' Social Security       benefit status, the Work Without Worry Act better ensures       inclusivity and equity within our society.        NDSC fully supports the Work Without Worry Act's objectives       and applauds the bill's commitment to financial security and       fairness for young adults with disabilities. It is estimated       that this legislation will positively impact the lives of       nearly 6,000 individuals with disabilities over the next       decade, creating opportunities for growth and independence.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue, and we look       forward to working with you to pass this bill into law. If       you have any questions, please contact Chapman Bryant, Policy       and Advocacy Associate.            Sincerely,                                                   Jordan Kough,                                                 Executive Director,      National Down Syndrome Congress.                                   ____                                         Consortium for Constituents                                               with Disabilities,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2023.      Senator Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.      Senator Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Wyden and Cassidy: The cochairs of the       Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities (CCD) Social       Security Task Force write in support of the Work Without       Worry Act and thank you for introducing this crucial       legislation. The Consortium for Constituents with       Disabilities (CCD) is the largest coalition of national       organizations working together to advocate for Federal public       policy that ensures the self-determination, independence,       empowerment, integration, and inclusion of children and       adults with disabilities in all aspects of society free from       racism, ableism, sexism, and xenophobia, as well as LGBTQ+       based discrimination and religious intolerance.        Many people with disabilities rely on Social Security       ``Disabled Adult Child'' (DAC) benefits. These crucial       benefits allow people whose disabilities onset before age 22       to claim benefits on a parent's record, allowing parents to       continue to support their children with disabilities even       after retirement, disability, or death. Unfortunately,       navigating the different programs and their rules are       extremely complex for people with disabilities and their       families. Most important, if a young person with disability       has countable earnings of even a dollar over the substantial       gainful activity (SGA) level ($1470 a month in 2023) before       receiving DAC benefits, they lose their eligibility for DAC       benefits forever. This creates a disincentive to work for       young adults with disabilities, who may want to try and work,       but who are unsure of their capacity and need to try working       different numbers of hours. There are many circumstances in       which a young person with a disability may be able to earn       over SGA for a short period of time or a few times, but are       unable to sustain that level of work or income in the long-      run. Families often worry that the wrong amount of work will       cause their family member to lose eligibility for DAC       benefits and this fear may discourage young adults with       disabilities from working.        The Work Without Worry Act would eliminate this work       disincentive by allowing young adults with disabilities to       try and work and see if they can support themselves without       losing eligibility for DAC benefits. Earnings from work over       SGA will not prevent the individual from receiving DAC       benefits from their parent's work history as long as the       individual remains disabled by the same impairment from       before age 22 and meets other eligibility conditions for       benefits. The benefit amount will be either the benefit from       the individual's parents or the benefit from the individual's       own work history, whichever is higher.        We strongly support this important change to allow young       adults with disabilities to work to the best of their       abilities and look forward to working with your offices to       advance this legislation.
