 Madam President, today I am introducing the Crypto Asset  National Security Enhancement and Enforcement, CANSEE, Act along with  Senators Rounds, Warner, and Romney. This bipartisan bill will close  concerning gaps in the anti-money laundering, AML, and sanctions  frameworks for cryptocurrency, most importantly decentralized finance,  DeFi, and virtual currency kiosks.   Decentralized finance or ``DeFi'' refers to cryptocurrency protocols  and applications that purport to allow automated peer-to-peer  transactions using blockchain technology. DeFi enables users to  transact and trade cryptocurrency without requiring a traditional  financial institution to broker trades, clear and settle transactions,  or custody assets.   Criminal syndicates, fraudsters, ransomware hackers, and rogue states  have been quick to recognize how DeFi can be exploited to advance their  nefarious activities. By design, DeFi provides anonymity allowing  malicious and criminal actors to evade traditional tools that the  government uses to enforce the AML and sanctions laws.   According to the U.S. National Money Laundering Risk Assessment  published in February 2022, ``DeFi services often involve no AML/CFT or  other processes to identify customers, allowing layering of proceeds to  take place instantaneously and pseudonymously.'' A risk assessment  published by the Treasury Department in April 2023 specifically found  that ``ransomware cybercriminals, thieves, scammers, and Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) cyber actors are using DeFi services  [and] exploiting vulnerabilities in the U.S. and foreign AML/CFT  regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement regimes.''   In addition, DeFi is used in cross-border drug trafficking.  Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has estimated that China-based  chemical manufacturers have received enough payments in cryptocurrency  to sell $54 billion worth of fentanyl--enough to manufacture 8.6  billion deadly doses.   A series of Federal indictments unsealed in April 2023 revealed how  these Chinese companies sell precursor chemicals to the Sinaloa drug  cartel to manufacture fentanyl in Mexico, which is then smuggled for  distribution in the United States. The manufacturers and cartels  transact in cryptocurrency and no longer need to rely exclusively on  bulk cash shipments. According to the indictments, once ``fentanyl  proceeds are deposited into cryptocurrency wallets, that cryptocurrency  can also be used directly to purchase additional fentanyl, without the  need to convert the cryptocurrency back into cash.'' Wallets associated  with a large sanctioned Chinese chemicals manufacturer have used DeFi  to launder funds.   DeFi is so attractive to criminals and other bad actors because the  industry takes the position that it does not need to comply with the  AML requirements in the Bank Secrecy Act nor the economic sanctions  programs administered by the Treasury Department. That places DeFi on a  different footing than traditional financial intermediaries like banks  and securities brokers, which must monitor all transactions and report  suspected money laundering and financial crimes to the government.  Other participants in the cryptocurrency markets, such as U.S.- headquartered centralized trading venues, are also expected to maintain  AML programs and ensure that sanctioned persons do not use their  services. Even casinos have these obligations. It is past time to end  special treatment for DeFi and prevent this dark corner of our  financial system from being used to fund crime and launder criminal  proceeds.   The bipartisan bill we are introducing closes these alarming gaps  facilitating narco-trafficking, WMD proliferation, ransomware attacks,  and other threats to national and economic security. Our bill simply  requires anyone who controls a DeFi service to meet critical--yet  basic--regulatory obligations to maintain AML policies and procedures,  conduct due diligence on customers, and report suspicious transactions  to the government. These requirements will curtail a tool that is used  to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds.   Our legislation also makes clear that if a sanctioned person, such as  a Russian oligarch, uses a DeFi service to evade U.S. sanctions, then  anyone who controls that platform will be liable for facilitating that  violation. If nobody controls a DeFi service, then--as a backstop--the  largest investors in that project will be responsible for meeting these  obligations.   Our bipartisan legislation also dramatically enhances the customer  due diligence requirements for operators of virtual currency kiosks or  ``bitcoin ATMs.'' Bitcoin ATMs are typically found in convenience  stores, gas stations, and grocery stores, and are used to buy, sell,  and exchange cryptocurrency. According to a report by the Government  Accountability Office published in December 2021, ``FBI officials said  they expect to see an increase in the use of virtual currency kiosks  for illicit purposes, including for human and drug trafficking.'' To  crack down on this abuse of our financial system, our legislation  requires kiosk operators to verify the identities of both  counterparties to every transaction. That will help prevent criminals  from using cryptocurrency to profit from illegal activity and avoid  detection by law enforcement.  [[Page S2991]]    Finally, this legislation makes important updates to the Treasury  Department's authority to require participants in the U.S. financial  system to take special precautions against money laundering threats.  Currently, these authorities are limited to transactions conducted in  the traditional banking system. But as new technologies like  cryptocurrency increasingly enable new ways to conduct financial  transactions, it is critical to extend Treasury's authority to crack  down on illicit financial activity that may occur without customary  intermediaries.   All of our constituents deserve a financial system that is protected  from geopolitical adversaries and criminals. The CANSEE Act will  deliver those protections by preventing DeFi services from using  purported decentralization as a shield to avoid meeting obligations to  prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. That will protect the  integrity of the U.S. financial system and help curtail the activities  of the worst criminal organizations and malicious state actors. I urge  my colleagues to support this important bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I am introducing the Crypto Asset  National Security Enhancement and Enforcement, CANSEE, Act along with  Senators Rounds, Warner, and Romney.
