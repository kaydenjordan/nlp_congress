 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 8.    Mr. Chairman, this bill requires the Secretary of Energy  to consult with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the  Interior, and the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to increase  the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas production when  drawdowns are made on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Should this bill become law, I believe this interagency coordination  will be paramount to ensuring the Federal lands leasing strategy is  carried out in a thoughtful and scrupulous way.   To that end, my amendment will require that the Director of the  Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency are also formally included in the Energy Secretary's  consultation process as the leasing plan is formulated.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote  with me in favor of this amendment to ensure greater interagency  collaboration and due diligence on such important matters before us.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 9.    Mr. Chairman, as we all know, the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve was established decades ago by our 38th President, Gerald Ford,  in the aftermath of the oil crisis of the early 1970s.   Ever since, the reserve has proven to be an incredibly effective tool  at the President's disposal in instances where the Nation has found  itself confronted with a crisis. Whether we find ourselves facing a  catastrophic natural disaster, a substantial spike in global oil  prices, or an outbreak of international conflict, Presidents have used  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in each of these situations and others  to ensure the Nation is able to respond swiftly, avoid disruptions to  vital operations, and minimize the financial pain facing American  families.   Tragically, it is not a matter of if but, rather, when the next  national emergency will occur. I think we can all agree that the last  thing any of us want is for the President's ability to quickly mobilize  the Nation's response to be encumbered or hindered by unintentional red  tape.   This amendment would straightforwardly, but importantly, avoid that  potential pitfall by including an exception for national emergencies as  declared under the National Emergencies Act. We all know how government  bureaucracies work, and it is always slowly.   This bill requires the Department of Energy to consult with the  Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and the  Pentagon to develop a  [[Page H368]]  plan to increase the percentage of Federal lands leased for oil and gas  production when drawdowns on the SPR are made.   While thorough due diligence and interagency coordination are  absolutely a good and necessary component in any attempt to lease  Federal lands for oil and gas production, do any of us really believe  that such consultation and planning between four massive government  departments can be done expeditiously in a time of war or crisis? This  amendment would insert an exception clause to ensure this bill does not  compromise or restrict the President's ability.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1445
