 Madam President, in the floor speech that I gave last  week on the ``Common Sense for Common Defense,'' I highlighted the fact  that our competitors have increased their own military spending and  focused on modernization and how we are going to have to do the same.   When I talk about competitors, I am talking about China and Russia. I  think this President did a good job of outlining our national defense  system and putting it into different categories, because when you talk  about China and Russia--not many people are aware of this--China and  Russia have increased all during the years that we have decreased. They  have actually caught up, and, in some cases, have actually passed us.   Our men and women in uniform are outstanding representations of what  is right in America. Their drive and determination is the reason the  United States of America has the honor of being the leader of the free  world. That honor, however, is the product of hard work, not  birthright. We earned it.   But over the last 10 years, our military supremacy has slowly  degraded. General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  has acknowledged that our qualitative and quantitative advantage has  eroded. Toward the end of the Obama administration, with many of our  systems, like our brigade combat teams, only 35 percent of them could  be deployed because of what happened to the defense budget and our  maintenance capabilities.   The same thing happened to our Army aviation brigades. The same thing  happened to our F18s. It is the Marines that fly the F18s, and we only  had 30 percent of those that could be deployed toward the end of the  Obama administration.   This is something that people are not aware of. This is very  significant. We need to pay attention to this, if there is ever any  question. Constant dollar defense spending dropped $200 billion from  2010 to 2015. That was in the last 5 years of the Obama administration.   In 2010, the budget was $794 billion, and then 5 years later, it  dropped down to $586 billion. That is unprecedented. Even after the  Korean war, it didn't drop that much, but, nonetheless, it did. It has  never happened before, and we have to make up for it.   That is exactly what we are doing. Our fiscal year 2018 budget  brought it back up to $700 billion. Our 2019 budget brought it back up  to $716 billion, and we anticipate--and it has been mentioned several  times--that in our 2020 budget it is going to be around $750 billion.  [[Page S197]]    We have a slide here that puts it in a little different perspective.  As you can see from the slide, at the end of the Cold War, we had about  the same number of fighter aircraft as our adversaries at that time-- that was Russia and China. It is very clear on this. The orange is the  third generation fighters, and the blue is the fourth generation  fighters. It shows that now we are getting into the fifth generation.  Actually, at that time, we were way ahead of them. This is a thing of  the past now.   While we had the same amount, we were still superior because our  aircraft were the newest and the most capable in the world. Our fighter  aircraft--in fact, most of our military equipment--was better, more  modern, and more effective than the Russians or the Chinese had. Now  that has changed. During this most recent period of time, we went  through about 10 years of not increasing the quality, and the numbers  stayed the same. So we got to the point where many of the things the  Chinese and Russians had were better than what we had.   As demonstrated on the chart, our fighter force was reduced nearly 50  percent in total numbers over the last 25 years, and we failed to  modernize. Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson, said our Air  Force is too small to do what the Nation asks. Not only is it too  small, but the average age of our aircraft is now 28 years old. How  many of us in here drive a car that is 28 years old?   In 1990, we brought over 500 aircraft a year--1990, 500 aircraft a  year--but recently, that number has been reduced to 50 a year.   When I go out and talk to people who are in my State of Oklahoma and  anywhere around the country, there is the assumption that somehow we  have the very best of everything. That used to be the case. That became  the case after World War II, but then during the last 10 years is when  things dropped down. We are going to have to do better because, at this  rate, it would take us over 40 years to modernize a fleet that is  already too old and too small. Meanwhile, our adversaries have  transformed their aircraft fleets with modernization programs and have  increased their overall size and capabilities. In fact, the Chinese and  Russian air forces have recapitalized and are now, or soon will be,  fielding aircraft with capability matching our own but at a much faster  rate. If they get to the point where we are in terms of modernization,  they are already way ahead of us in terms of numbers. According to the  Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Goldfein, if we take no  action, both the Russian and Chinese forces will be bigger and more  technologically advanced than us. We know this is true.   Artillery is measured in terms of rapid fire and range, and that is  where we are falling behind them.   The problem is not just the Air Force. The Army, likewise, has gotten  smaller and less capable in the same decade. Specifically, in terms of  long-range fires--defined as tubed artillery and tactical missiles--you  can see the same trend. This is our artillery system. There are three  different types of artillery, but you can see now that as time has gone  by, we have actually fallen behind. If you look at us over here, in  2018, our total is 2,886, as opposed to 22,000 for the Russians and  10,000 for the Chinese. The numbers are there, and we know that is  happening, and we know it is taking place as we speak.   In the last 25 years, we have kind of rested on that advantage that  things were better than they had. While our adversaries have also  reduced the amount of long-range fires over the same period of time,  they have significantly modernized their force. We are now in a  situation where both of these countries--that is, Russia and China--not  only have more artillery than us, but theirs is better than ours.   GEN Mark Milley, the Army Chief of Staff said: ``In terms of  artillery, the Army is outgunned and outranged by our adversaries.''  Unfortunately, people don't know this, and people are going to have to  know this to know what happened to us in the last decade.   One can look at the devastating results from Russia's action against  the Ukrainian army. We all remember that in 2014 they made it possible  through the modernization of their artillery systems. The results were  there. They were. They inflicted damage.    Recognizing the problem is normally the first step in developing an  acceptable solution. The fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 budgets  got us back in the right direction, but in fiscal year 2018 we have  gone up to $700 billion for a defense budget and in fiscal year 2019 to  $716 billion. So we are on the road to recovery. We recognize, the  people in this body know, what has happened to our abilities and our  superiority in these areas that is no longer there.   This is kind of interesting. We had a hearing on this the other day.  Of all the presentations I have heard, the assessment and  recommendations of the National Defense Strategy Commission--that is  what this book is right here--was put together a few years ago. They  have actually made these assessments and come to the conclusion that if  we want to do something--what they have come up with in this is a  formula as to what it is going to take right now and for the  foreseeable future. They say all of our defense budgets coming up are  going to have to be an increase of somewhere between 3 percent and 5  percent above inflation. Of course, that is exactly what these 3 years  will do, so we are making headway in that respect.   This growth projection is also one our Secretary of Defense as well  as our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff say is going to be  necessary for us to get back up even with and competitive with both  Russia and China.   I can remember not long ago being in the South China Sea and watching  China actually building islands. It is not legal, but they do it  anyway. If you look at what is on these seven islands out there, it is  as if they are preparing for World War III. Our allies in the South  China Sea are very much concerned about this as to whose side they are  going to be on if this happens.   We don't want to shortchange our national security. We fully  implement the national defense strategy, as found in this book, in a  timely manner by avoiding continuing resolutions and eliminating the  threat of sequestration.   A continuing resolution is something where, if we don't get along in  this body, we don't pass our appropriations bills as we are supposed to  pass, then we end up passing a continuing resolution that continues  what we have done in the previous year. We can't continue to do that.   The already widening gap with Russia and China will only grow faster  if we don't change our behavior. That is exactly what we plan to do. We  need to fix this if we are going to do it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I would like to offer my  congratulations to Susan McVey, a fellow Oklahoman, on her exemplary  service to the State of Oklahoma as a dedicated librarian for the past  32 years.   Ms. McVey's distinguished and honorable record of leadership within  the Oklahoma Department of Libraries is a model for future generations.  Her effort to bring access to online reference and information  resources for all Oklahoma libraries and schools continues to impress.  Additionally, thousands of Oklahomans have been granted access to  library services through her work to reform the administration of State  aid grants to public libraries. I am confident these efforts will reap  benefits for generations.   Ms. McVey's legacy will be an inspiration for many in the years  ahead, and I am proud to call her a fellow Oklahoman. Again,  congratulations to her on her well-deserved retirement, and I thank her  for her commitment to the people of Oklahoma.  [[Page S216]]                                ____________________
