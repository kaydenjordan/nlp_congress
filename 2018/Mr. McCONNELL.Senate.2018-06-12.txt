 Madam President, just a few hours ago, President  Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor Bolton, and  the rest of the American delegation concluded their summit meeting with  North Korean officials.   This was a historic first step in an important negotiation. In the  words of the joint statement agreed to by the United States and North  Korea, both sides have committed to pursuing a lasting and robust peace  regime and complete--complete--denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula.   The next steps in the negotiation will test whether we can get to a  verifiable deal that enhances the security of Northeast Asia, our  allies, and, of course, the United States.   Resolving this 61-year-old international challenge will take a great  deal of hard work. As President Trump explained a few hours ago,  ``Today is the beginning of the arduous process. Our eyes are wide  open.''   I support the goals contained in the joint statement, and I remain  supportive of the administration's stated position as Secretary Pompeo  has reiterated: The goal of the United States is the ``complete,  verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula.'' If North Korea does not prove willing to follow through,  we and our allies must be prepared to restore the policy of maximum  pressure.   Today, I congratulate the President on this major step and share his  hope that it will begin a process that leads to a historic peace.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a related matter, history clearly  shows us that skillful diplomacy, global peace, and a stronger American  military are in no way opposed to one another--quite the opposite.  These components of America's strength are complementary.   As President Reagan explained, ``Peace does not exist of its own  will. It depends on us, on our courage to build it and guard it and  pass it on to future generations.'' Yesterday afternoon, the Senate  took a step toward doing just that by turning to the John S. McCain  2019 National Defense Authorization Act.   This legislation builds on the landmark bipartisan budget agreement  Congress and the President reached earlier this year. That deal  established the outlines for the largest year-on-year increase in  funding for American Armed Forces in 15 years. Now this NDAA will  authorize the use of those resources for the priorities that matter  most to the men and women who serve our country and to their commanders  who plan for the future.   The legislation will equip our All-Volunteer Force to meet a variety  of challenges abroad, but its impact will also be felt right here at  home, where servicemembers will receive more top-notch training and  expanded support services for themselves and for their families.   The 2019 NDAA includes a pay raise for all Active-Duty personnel--the  largest such increase in nearly a decade. It directs billions in new  funding to the construction of new family housing and on-base support  infrastructure. It expands resources for child and health services as  well.  [[Page S3730]]    I know each of my colleagues can testify to the important roles  military installations play in communities all across our country. My  fellow Kentuckians and I take great pride in Fort Campbell, Fort Knox,  and the Blue Grass Army Depot. We are proud that Kentucky is home base  to many outstanding units, such as the 101st Airborne Division and  those of Kentucky's Air and Army National Guard units.   In our State, as in every State, the military's presence anchors  entire communities and offers a constant reminder of the sacrifices  that keep us safe. It is our responsibility to support them. I look  forward to delivering that support when the Senate votes on the NDAA  later this week.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on another matter, I want to  share the Senate's warmest wishes for a speedy recovery for Larry  Kudlow, the Director of the National Economic Council and Assistant to  the President, who is currently recovering at Walter Reed from what we  are told was a small heart attack. Larry is not just a famously happy  warrior for pro-growth, pro-opportunity economics; he is also widely  regarded as really one of the best guys in Washington. We hope he gets  well soon.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, speaking of the economy, by now  it is no secret that under the last administration, our Nation's  economic recovery was slow, stunted, and almost exclusively focused on  the largest urban centers. Between 2010 and 2016, that is where more  than 90 percent of the population growth happened; it is where nearly  three-quarters of new jobs went. Most everywhere else--in our smaller  cities, small towns, and rural areas--families heard a lot of talk  about what my Democratic colleagues called an ``economic recovery,''  but they saw few or none of the effects in these small towns and small  communities. So it is no surprise that after seeing their communities  suffer under 8 years of Democrats' policies, millions of Americans are  ready to take a different route. That is why they elected a Republican  President and Republican majorities here in Congress. And we set about  implementing our agenda to take money and power out of Washington and  put it back in the hands of middle-class families and small businesses  all across our country.   But even as the positive effects of these policies have become more  and more obvious, they continue to encounter near-complete party-line  opposition at every turn. I recall that just 2 or 3 days after  President Trump signed our historic tax reform into law, several of my  colleagues across the aisle were offering some dramatic predictions.   On Christmas Eve last year, the senior Senator from Montana took to  the Bozeman Daily Chronicle with a piece titled ``Tax bill a disastrous  plan, fails Montana and our future.'' Quite a pronouncement. It  reminded me of the Democratic leader of the House. She said our plan to  give tax cuts to middle-class families and businesses would bring about  ``Armageddon.'' Armageddon.   How are these prognostications holding up? The new Tax Code is  causing Northwestern Energy to pass along millions of dollars in  savings to Montana utility customers. My friend Senator Daines recently  shared what tax reform already means to Montana small business owners.  In Chester, at Stricks Ag, it means bonuses of nearly $1,000 for each  employee. In Missoula, at Big Sky Brewing, it means worker bonuses and  money to purchase new equipment. The same goes for Cabinet Mountain  Brewing in Libby. Over in Thompson Falls, tax reform gave Thompson  River Lumber the breathing room to buy their first new forklift in 19  years.   These are the workers and job creators whom Senator Daines bet on  when he voted for tax reform and helped make all of this possible. He  voted for Montanans to send less to the IRS and keep more of their own  hard-earned money to save or invest as they see fit. It is too bad  their senior Senator took the opposite approach and tried to block  these tax cuts from happening, let alone that Democratic leaders in  both Chambers now say they will repeal tax reform if they get the  chance. But Republicans will keep picking up the slack and will keep  standing up for the American people.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
