 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Human  Trafficking Awareness Month.   In my home State of California, human trafficking is a notoriously  large and dangerous industry, with over 300 reported cases of  trafficking that involved children, teens, and young adults last year,  including the very mysterious case that happened in November, that of  Sherri Papini from Shasta County, who may or may not have been drawn  into this. Fortunately, she was released on Thanksgiving Day. Indeed,  the whole State is thankful for her release and that she didn't get  caught in that horrible system.   We must do more to stop this human trafficking. That is why I am a  proud supporter of H.R. 440, the SHAME Act, which was introduced by my  colleague, Mr. Poe of Texas. The bill makes public the names and  pictures of criminals who have been convicted of buying sex from a  minor or from a sex trafficking victim--stripping their anonymity and  sentencing them to the public humiliation they deserve for their  despicable acts.   I believe the SHAME Act will help to discourage participation in  further human trafficking and will lead to a safer environment for our  children in America. We must combat this now--indeed, a very dangerous  and immoral problem.                            ____________________
