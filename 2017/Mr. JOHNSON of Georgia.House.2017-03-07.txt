 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 375, which names the  Federal building and U.S. courthouse in Nashville, Tennessee, after the  late Senator Fred Thompson.   Senator Thompson had a long and extraordinary career in many roles  that included actor, lobbyist, private attorney, and radio show host.  But he is best known and respected not for his hawking of reverse  mortgages but for being an assistant U.S. attorney, a congressional  staffer, and, lastly, a U.S. Senator representing the State of  Tennessee. Senator Thompson was a graduate of Memphis State University  and Vanderbilt Law School. Senator Thompson got his start in public  life in 1967, when he served as an assistant U.S. attorney in  Nashville, Tennessee.   During his time in that office, he met U.S. Senator Howard Baker from  Tennessee who became a lifelong mentor to Senator Thompson. After  managing Senator Baker's successful U.S. Senate campaign in 1972,  Senator Thompson moved to Washington, D.C., where he was appointed  counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee investigating the Watergate break- in and famously helped shape the direction and tone of those hearings.   I think that he will be known as one who helped Senator Baker in  formulating that age-old, timeless question: ``What did President Nixon  know, and when did he know it?'' It is ironic that today, Mr. Speaker,  people are asking about our current President, President Trump: What  did he know, and when did he know it?   I will tell you, President Trump stood right there at the rostrum of  the House last week and said that the Republican health insurance plan  would have insurance for everybody, the insurance would be far less  expensive and far better than what we have today. But we see now that  that was incorrect, as the Republicans have, on a Monday, I guess at  some point before the day ended, introduced their repeal bill of the  Affordable Care Act.   We are here talking about Senator Thompson today, but I just can't  help asking: When did President Trump know that the Republican plan was  going to throw 20 million people off of the Affordable Care Act  depriving them of insurance? When did he know that? What did he know  about this plan? Because not a whole lot of people around here knew of  the plan until it was released because it was shrouded in secrecy, and  it was released and a hearing scheduled to mark it up, to mark up the  legislation with no hearings taking place on the underlying  legislation.   So no CBO score, no congressional hearings about it, introducing it  in a cloud shrouded in secrecy, and, boom, it is dropped on the  American people at a time when you are trying to distract attention  from other questions about what President Trump knew about Russia,  Russian hacking, and those kinds of questions. What did he know about  the GSA hotel that the taxpayers own that he is leasing and now he is  the lessor and the lessee of that hotel that belongs to the American  people? What did he know and when did he know it? Those are questions  that the American people have. We intend to get down to the bottom of  it on this side. I hope that we will have some help on the other side.    I do want to say that I support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I think the American people would be horrified to learn  that of the 30 million people who were able to attain health insurance  coverage and access to the healthcare system as a result of passage of  the Affordable Care Act, many of those, a substantial number of those,  will be thrown off of the rolls and deprived of the ability to have  access to the healthcare system because of this new replacement bill  that has been filed, which, as I said before, has not been scored.   We don't know how much the Medicare solvency issue is going to cost.  We don't know how much it is going to cost. We don't know how much it  is going to cost the taxpayers. We don't know how many people will lose  their jobs because, after all, it stands to reason if you are serving  30 million more people, that means you have brought a whole lot of  people into the healthcare delivery business, people who are working,  people who have jobs, people who have husbands, wives, parents, and  children who are depending on them for support, and you are going to  tell them that their jobs are at risk.   Yes, they are, with this new law that has been half-baked introduced  and fast-tracked to become law without people really knowing about it.  This is something that people need to know about, people need to get  out and exclaim their opposition to because it is going to hurt a lot  of people.   The way that this bill changes the Affordable Care Act is it makes it  unaffordable for most Americans to be able to afford the insurance that  they have gained as a result of passage of the Affordable Care Act. The  premium subsidies are recalculated. Instead of based on a sliding scale  which is an indication of need, this Republican plan is going to  replace that and calculate the amount of the premium subsidy based on  age.   Now, what does that do, especially when you consider that some  elderly people are more well-heeled than others? They can afford  insurance, and they can afford to front the policy cost in return for  the tax subsidy that they get. But what does that do to the younger  people? So it is good news for some older people who are well-heeled.  They will be helped by this Republican plan. But the average wage  earner is going to be hurt--the younger people--because it is going to  be more expensive for them.   But then I have some bad news for the elderly people, also. Insurance  companies under this new plan will be able to charge the elderly five  times more than they will charge a younger person. That differential  had been abolished in the Affordable Care Act, but the Republicans are  bringing it back. Who is going to pay? It is going to be those same  elderly people. You put it in one hand, and you take it out of the  other. All of the elderly people in America, regardless of how much  money you earn, should be concerned about that.   Prioritizing health savings accounts over these premium subsidies is  going to provide a great big tax cut to the wealthy. You can't get away  from that. It is going to hurt the working people of this country. It  is going to be a tax giveaway to the wealthy. I am sad to hear and to  see this plan, and all of you should be, also.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 11 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), my friend.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, with exactly zero hearings on the topic, our Republican  friends have now revealed their TrumpCare plan.   Just to remind everyone what President Trump said during the campaign  and promised, he said that his Republican plan would ``have insurance  for everybody,'' and that it would be ``far less expensive and far  better'' than what we have today.   Well, now we actually have the plan out. What does it do?   It kicks 20 million Americans off their health insurance. It sharply  increases out-of-pocket costs for millions of American families. It  rations care for millions of Americans on Medicaid. It includes massive  cuts to Medicaid. It would make maternity care much more expensive.   But don't worry, there is good news. If you are a CEO of a healthcare  company and you make, on average, as they do, somewhere between $13  million and $14 million, the tax increases that were leveled on you 6  years ago will now be repealed. So, congratulations. Those folks  benefit, but 20 million Americans lose their health insurance.   Please join me in saying ``no'' to TrumpCare.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I just can't get out of my mind, Mr. Speaker, those words of  President Trump that everybody would have insurance and that it would  be far less expensive and far better than what we have today.   The Republicans have campaigned incessantly for the last 7 years on  repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, which they derisively  referred to as ObamaCare. We are going to repeal it and we are going to  replace it on day one is what they all said.   And here we are at day 45, something like that, and we have had  nothing but one scandal after another; but we have finally now gotten  to the House Republicans revealing what they have shrouded in secrecy  for so long over the last 7 years. It sputters out without much ado,  trying to sneak it in, trying to keep it undercover so that the  American people won't realize what is being done to them.   I can tell you that what is being done under those covers is not  worthy of my comment descriptively at this time, but I will say that it  is an illicit, illegitimate situation that is taking place because you  are taking from a group of people who are in need and you are giving  more to individuals who have and who don't need.   In this country we are all in the same boat together. That is what  the Affordable Care Act did. It was an aspiration for health care for  everyone. It wasn't perfect. It is not a perfect bill. It needs some  repairs done, if you will, some enhancements. We have never had the  cooperation from the other side of the aisle to do anything to enhance  that foundation that was already laid.   Nobody can argue with the fact that 30 million people who did not  have health care access and now having it is a bad thing. Nobody can  argue that. They could argue that: Well, the way that it was done was  bad. They say that we rushed it through without any input from them,  but there were literally dozens of public hearings and markups. The  bill, all 1,000 pages, was available for everyone to be able to read.   They talk about reading the bill. Well, there are so many bills  coming through right now that they don't want people to take the time  to read them. That is why they introduce them late in the day and then  they schedule markups for them without even putting them in front of  the committee for a hearing. No airing out of the bill and what it  does.   Why are they holding this and hiding it from the American people?   It is because they are trying to get away with something that is  going to be bad for the people. That is why.   They knew that their changes, their repeal and replacement bill, if  properly vetted, if the American people had an opportunity to learn  what is in it, they knew it would not be popular. That is why they hid  it from the public. That is why they are not having any hearings on it.  They just want to proceed straight to a markup; pass it out of the  committee; put it on the floor of the House; pass it out of the House  with little debate; send it over to the Senate for a rubber stamp, they  hope; and then on to President Trump, who, as I said, when did he know  that this bill that he was going to be presented with perhaps did not  provide coverage for everybody and was not far better in coverage than  the Affordable Care Act? When was it that he learned that?   The American people want to know a whole lot. There is a whole lot to  investigate about President Trump and his campaign. There is a whole  lot to investigate about this repeal and replacement of the Affordable  Care Act with an inferior product, one that is slanted to the rich and  hurts the working people of this country.    Then it guts the Medicaid program, which millions and millions of  people depend on to keep grandma and granddaddy and momma and daddy at  the nursing home. Medicaid helps to make nursing home care affordable.   But under this healthcare repeal legislation that the Republicans  have filed, they are going to cut Medicaid. They are going to use the  expansion of the Medicaid program which enabled 10 million people to  gain coverage that they could not afford, and they are going to cut  that. At the same time, they are going to cut the other part of the  Medicaid program which provides for people to be able to have their  loved ones properly cared for at the nursing home, instead of down in  the basement or upstairs in the spare bedroom.   So, get ready, ladies and gentlemen, for that inevitability if this  legislation passes. Get ready for your loved ones to have no place to  go, no nursing home facility to take care of them, because they will  not be able to afford it and you will not be able to afford it.   Who will suffer most?   Momma and daddy and granddaddy and grandma. They are the ones that  get the care that is so needed for the elderly.   So in this bill, where they are going to cut 20 million people off  the healthcare rolls, they are going to cut momma and daddy from the  nursing home by cutting the Medicaid program and turning it into a  block grant program and turning it over to the States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H1550]]         Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1174,  the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017, introduced by my  good friend, Eleanor Holmes Norton. I am pleased to be an original  cosponsor of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   What happened 43, 44 years ago during the Watergate hearings with  that seminal question that everyone keeps asking, ``What did the  President know, and when did he know it?'' and in the words of Yogi  Berra: ``It's deja vu all over again.''   People are asking that question today, and it rings more loudly today  than it did back then in 1973, 1974, ``What did the President know, and  when did he know it?'' about a lot of issues.   But this issue of the Affordable Care Act and whether or not you are  going to repeal it and replace it with something better or you are  going to repeal and replace it with something worse, what did the  President know, and when did he know it?   Because it is clear now to everybody who has had the opportunity to  look at this offering that the Republicans have put forward, you are  going to be worse off today than you were when the Affordable Care Act  was implemented because 20 million of the 30 million people who are on  coverage now will be off coverage if this thing passes.   This Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017, which was  introduced by my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Norton, which I am  so pleased to be a cosponsor of, is a bill from a mother herself who  knows the needs of other mothers. This is bipartisan. I am so happy  that this bill is passing today, but I will tell you, I can't help but  think of the 20 million people who are going to lose their coverage. A  lot of those people are women and children, even some babies. They are  going to lose coverage because the Republicans are kicking them off  under their plan. They will be a healthy part of that 20 million people  who lose their coverage. It is unfair. It is not right. It is un- American.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on my side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 8\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Sanford), my friend, opposes the bill because the CBO  scoring process, which came up with a no-cost estimate for this bill,  the contention is that that CBO study was insufficient. Well, I am sure  that my colleague and friend from South Carolina will agree with me  that with no CBO scoring for this congressional Republican healthcare  repeal bill that they have put forward, then we are certainly not in a  position to proceed further with a fast-track legislating process, as  this bill seems to be on. They are going to mark it up with no  hearings.   When we were dealing with the Affordable Care Act, we held 79  hearings over 2 years, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the  aisle, and posted the bill online for 30 days. The CBO scoring actually  showed that this bill was going to save money, as opposed to cost.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague from South Carolina to be in  opposition to his own party's healthcare repeal bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the kind gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I was looking at my  congressional calendar, and I noticed that this year we are working in  Washington, D.C., more than we have under the past 5 years of the rein  of the Republicans. We have been the most do-nothingest Congresses on  record for many years, and so this year we will be working. But I am  baffled as to whether or not it is because the Republicans don't want  to go home and face their constituents in a townhall meeting about the  Affordable Care Act repeal bill that they have filed. We will be here  in session now for another 4 weeks before the public has a chance to  hear from their Representative when they return home for an extended  time. But on the flip side, that gives everybody time to prepare for  those upcoming townhall meetings which need to be held to explain what  they are trying to do to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I have one more point that I  needed to make about this abolition, this abolishment of the Affordable  Care Act plan that has been submitted. A foundation of their plan is  the demise of the individual mandate that requires people to purchase  insurance, so they are claiming that that is a matter of freedom.   Well, the fact is that when everyone is required to have insurance,  it reduces the cost for everyone else. So it was a cost-saving measure  that has worked with the rise in premiums being at the lowest level in  decades. The affordable care has worked to cut the cost of health care.   But what they are doing when they abolish that individual mandate is  they are also going to penalize people who decide to drop their  coverage and pick  [[Page H1553]]  it up later. Or if you miss one payment because you missed work, missed  a paycheck or something like that, you missed 1 month and have to  reinstate, then you are going to pay a 30 percent penalty on your  insurance. That is highway robbery.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
