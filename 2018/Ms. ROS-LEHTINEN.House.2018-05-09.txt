 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Lupus  Awareness Month because nearly two-thirds of the public know little to  nothing about the disease beyond the name.   Lupus is a drastically unpredictable disease. It has no known cause,  no known cure, and it can be fatal. An estimated 1.5 million Americans  are currently living with lupus, including my lovely stepdaughter,  Katharine; and millions more have sadly lost their brave battle with  this disease.   I have been proud to work with the Lupus Foundation for many years to  raise awareness about lupus and support efforts that bring us one step  closer to solving the mystery of this dreadful illness.   I encourage my colleagues to join us in the Congressional Lupus  Caucus to help advance lupus research and treatment. Through new  scientific breakthroughs, we will better understand this disease and  help patients living with lupus.   Mr. Speaker, let us ``Pump Up the Purple'' this May during Lupus  Awareness Month and fight for a day when no one will be diagnosed with  lupus.                            ____________________
