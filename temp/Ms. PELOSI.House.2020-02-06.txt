 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his leadership in bringing this important amendment to  the floor, and I rise in support of it. It clarifies that nothing in  this act shall be construed to affect the jurisdictional standards of  the National Labor Relations Board with respect to small businesses. I  thank the gentleman, Mr. Rouda, for his leadership in that regard. I  urge passage of the amendment.   Madam Chair, I proudly rise on this historic day as the Democratic  House takes bold action to restore fundamental fairness to America's  workers by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, the PRO  Act.   Madam Chair, I salute our distinguished chairman,  Bobby Scott, for  his lifetime of leadership to tilt back the playing field to the side  of the American worker. I thank the members of the Education and Labor  Committee and all who have worked to make this legislation go over the  finish line.   Some people always say to us: Your Caucus is so very diverse. What  unifies them?   I say it is diverse in every way. Sixty percent of our Caucus are  women, people of color, LGBTQ. We have generational differences,  geographical, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, opinion--the  beautiful diversity of opinion.   But what does unify us is our commitment to America's working  families, and that is what brings us to the floor today. It is a  commitment to salute working families, to raise paychecks, and to do so  by enabling workers to bargain collectively.   I always say that the middle class is the backbone of America's  democracy. The middle class has a union label on it.   So many things that have come into the workforce, whether it is the  40-hour workweek, safer working conditions, fair pay for family leave,  collective bargaining for secure retirement--the list goes on and on-- the labor unions have been responsible for that.   Yesterday, several Members and I were honored to meet with Jennifer  Womack, a worker who had been prevented from joining a union, and I  want to share her story with my colleagues.   She told us about the unfair working conditions that she has faced:  how she  [[Page H919]]  was illegally denied pay after missing work to undergo serious surgery,  even after spending her entire recovery period on the phone with the  benefits department to help her pay her bills; how one of her managers  engaged in offensive and bigoted behavior but was never disciplined, in  fact, was given a company award.   When Jennifer and her coworkers tried to form a union to improve  working conditions, she was subjected to humiliating retaliation and  forced to attend antiunion trainings designed to scare her off.   She told us: ``I believe that the decision of whether to join a union  should be up to me and other workers without having to face threats and  retaliation.   And Democrats agree.   Sadly, her story is shared every day by millions of Americans who  face a grim reality of reprisal, of retaliation, of denial of their  rights to join or trying to join a union.   Democrats offered our Better Deal for Workers, pledging to tilt the  playing field, with Mr. Chairman so much in the lead, to tilt the  playing field back to the side of workers.   Since day one, our majority has worked to build an economy that works  for workers' interests, not the special interests: passing the $15  minimum wage, securing paycheck fairness for women.   Madam Chair, I thank the unions for their leadership in our country  for equal pay for equal work. No institution has done more in that  regard. We are trying to make that the case for all workers that you  would have equal pay for equal work.   We are also protecting the pensions of millions and lowering  healthcare costs and increasing paychecks, to name a few.   Today, we are building on that progress by passing the cornerstone of  our pro-worker agenda, the PRO Act.   With this legislation, Democrats are holding companies that violate  workers' rights accountable. We are strengthening workers' sacred  collective bargaining rights, and we are protecting workers' access to  fair union elections.   The PRO Act secures justice for workers and advances progress for  all.   As Richard Trumka, the President of the AFL-CIO, which represents  12.5 million Americans and 55 unions, testified last year: ``A happier,  healthier, more upwardly mobile workforce is good for our economy  as consumers have additional money to spend. Local tax revenues  increase, and education funding is bolstered. Inequality shrinks. It is  a virtuous cycle.    ``The union movement and all working people are hungry for pro-worker  reforms to our existing labor laws. . . . It is time for our laws to  catch up. It is time to make the PRO Act the law of the land.''   I quite agree.   Democrats call on Republicans to join us to pass the PRO Act and to  rebalance the scales toward workers.   I always say, whether it is an election or a debate or a negotiation:  Who has the leverage?   Well, right now there is too much leverage used against America's  workers, and that is harmful to America's working families.   We want to again tilt that playing field back into the direction of  workers so their leverage is increased, so their opportunities are  improved, and then we can move closer to ending the inequality, the  disparity in income in our country.   Madam Chair, I urge our colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this important  PRO Act.   Madam Chair, I commend the chairman, the distinguished chairman, for  his leadership again, Mr. Scott, and members of his committee.   And I again thank Mr. Rouda for his amendment that clarifies that  nothing in this act shall be construed to affect the jurisdictional  standards of the NLRB with respect to small businesses. I thank the  gentleman, Mr. Rouda, for his leadership.   Madam Chair, I urge an ``aye'' vote on both the underlying bill and  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, we rise to honor the legacy of  Representative Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, who passed away on January 24.   With his passing, the country, California, and the East Bay community  lost a champion of the people and a leader of great courage and  compassion who served in the House of Representatives for 40 years.   Those of us who had the honor of serving with Pete in our California  congressional delegation have all lost a dear friend.   Pete was a relentless champion for universal healthcare. He had an  unrivaled understanding of the challenges of America's health system.   Whether it was fighting for COBRA to help working families maintain  their coverage during times of financial insecurity or taking a leading  role in writing the Affordable Care Act, Pete always seized  opportunities to expand access to quality, affordable healthcare for  all.   Pete will rightly be remembered and celebrated for his commitment to  fighting for those in need, particularly America's children.   He fought relentlessly to improve our children's access to quality  education, to protect clean air for them to breathe and clean water for  them to drink, and to leave them a more peaceful world.   Pete leaves behind a legacy that will inspire generations of future  lawmakers, and he leaves behind a wonderful family, whom he adored, who  are with us tonight.   May it give comfort to his wife, Deborah; his children, Jeffrey,  Beatrice, Thekla, Sarah, Fish, also known  [[Page H929]]  as Fortney, Hannah, and Andrew; his eight grandchildren; two great- grandchildren; and the entire Stark family that so many mourn their  loss and are praying for them at this sad time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members and guests in the gallery to rise for  a moment of silence.                            ____________________
