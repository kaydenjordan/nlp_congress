 Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration that I rise to  recognize Ukraine's recent historic Presidential elections. On April  21, 2019, the Ukrainian people made their democratic values known in an  election international observers lauded as free and fair.   Such an achievement is a rare and true testament to the Ukrainian  people's resilience and love of liberty, especially while fending off  Russia's ongoing aggression which has already killed over 13,000  Ukrainian citizens.   I am grateful to President Poroshenko for his leadership over the  past 5 years and his dedication to moving Ukraine forward. The United  States Congress congratulates President-elect Zelenskiy and extends a  hand of friendship on behalf of the American people.   The President-elect faces many challenges, including delivering on  the Ukrainian people's expectations to counter corruption.   The free world must now step up our efforts to provide moral and  material aid to support Ukraine's continued democratic trajectory.  Onward Ukraine. Onward free Ukraine.                            ____________________
