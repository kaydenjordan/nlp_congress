 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend votes on June 8,  2017, on account of attending my son's graduation. Had I been present,  I would have voted as follows: ``Yea'' for rollcall vote 295, ``yea''  for rollcall vote 296, ``yea'' for rollcall vote 297, ``yea'' for  rollcall vote 298, and ``yea'' for rollcall vote 299.                            ____________________
