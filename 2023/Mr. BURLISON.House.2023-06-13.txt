 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 44, which will  nullify the ATF's overreaching and unconstitutional rule to regulate  firearms that happen to have stabilizing braces such as short-barreled  rifles.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the ATF's rule is nothing short of an  assault on our Second Amendment rights. Our Constitution does not grant  the ATF the authority to unilaterally redefine what laws constitute a  firearm because lawmaking power rests with the elected Representatives  of the American people.   If pistol brace owners fail to register their firearms with the ATF,  then they will be deemed felons, face up to 10 years of prison, and be  fined thousands. This reclassification is arbitrary, it bucks a decade  of the ATF's own precedent, it is an assault on our Second Amendment,  and it threatens to turn millions--tens of millions--of law-abiding  Americans into criminals overnight.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote in favor of H.J. Res. 44 to reassert the  power of the American people, protect the rights of law-abiding gun  owners, and stop this retroactive gun grab.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of two  great Missourians who burned brightly, but sadly, their lives were cut  short.   The first public servant from Missouri is William Duston. William  Thomas Duston--his nickname was ``Dub''--was a father, a public  servant, and a Taney County community leader.   Dub was a well-educated man. He earned degrees from Middle Tennessee  State and James Madison and a law degree from American University.   Upon finishing his education, Dub started a life of public service  here as a legislative assistant to then-Senator John Ashcroft, a  legend, until Dub returned home to Branson.   He subsequently became Branson's city prosecutor in 2006 before  becoming city attorney, a role that he held until being elected the  Taney County prosecuting attorney in 2018.   Dub had many jobs in his life, but his favorite was being a dad. He  loved spending time with his wife and daughters. He loved cooking, and  he loved restoring Ford cars.   Dub is survived by his wife, Charlie; his daughters, Shiloh and  Raleigh; his aunts, his cousins, and extended family; and the Young  family.   On behalf of southwest Missouri, I join Taney County and our  community in honoring his life and lasting impact.   The second great Missourian is Ron Richard. Ron Richard was a father,  grandfather, local businessman, and dedicated public servant to the  city of Joplin and all of Missouri.   Ron started out his life owning and operating bowling alleys before  entering a life of public service. During his three decades of public  service, he served as a councilmember and then as the mayor of Joplin.   He then served as a State representative and was elected by his  colleagues to be speaker of the Missouri House. Eventually, he served  in the State senate, where he was then elected by his colleagues to be  the president pro tem of the Missouri Senate.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, Ron Richard is the only person in Missouri  history to serve as the leader of both chambers, the house and the  senate, and only the fifth person in our Nation's history to have done  so.   His career of service did not end with his retirement from the  legislature. He was appointed by Missouri Governor Mike Parson to the  Missouri Southern State University board of governors, a  [[Page H2877]]  position that he held at the time of his death. He also served on the  board of the Missouri Higher Education Savings Program and continued to  be active in local and State politics.   Beyond the titles and the accolades, he was a mentor and a friend to  all who knew him, including me.   Ron is survived by his wife, Patty; his children, Kara and Chad; his  grandchildren; and siblings and numerous family members who loved him.   It is an honor and privilege to have known him and to have had him as  a constituent, as well. He exhibited a life of service, and we mourn  his untimely death. Our prayers are with his wife, Patty, and the rest  of his family and friends.   I will say that my life in public service began as a freshman, green,  wet behind the ears, and Ron was my speaker. He was my leader. While  being speaker wasn't the last role that he had--he was able to be the  president of the senate--to me, he was always my speaker.   Missouri lost a good one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
