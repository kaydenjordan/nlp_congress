 Mr. President, our Nation's continued progress and the  socioeconomic mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education  and skills of the American workforce and its ability to adjust to and  fulfill the needs of the 21st-century economy. Career and technical  education, CTE, programs are essential to every student's education,  providing them access to the important knowledge, skills, and  credentials needed to obtain careers in rapidly growing, high-demand  industries. Today, approximately 11.8 million students across the  Nation are enrolled in CTE programs offered by thousands of career  academies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high schools, community  colleges, and CTE centers. Through applied learning, these students  obtain workplace skills and technical training that mirror in-demand  positions in the workforce.   In the next decade, nearly 3 million skilled workers will be needed  to fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including jobs  related to designing, building, and operating transportation, housing,  telecommunication, and utilities facilities. CTE programs intentionally  match skills with workforce demands, lowering the probability of high  school dropout and increasing the likelihood of graduating on time.  These skills-based training programs will help fill the estimated 30  million U.S. jobs available with an average income annual income of  $55,000 that do not require a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some  level of postsecondary education.   Across Virginia, I hear from manufacturers frustrated by the shortage  of qualified skilled production employees--roles that require the  training and instruction provided by CTE. It is essential that we  highlight the important role of CTE in the country's ability to meet  the challenges we face in economic development, student achievement,  and global competitiveness. In 2018, Congress affirmed the importance  of CTE by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for  the 21st Century Act which supports CTE programs in secondary and  postsecondary education.   Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus cochairs Senator Portman, Senator  Baldwin, and Senator Young and more than half of my colleagues in the  Senate, I am pleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate  February as Career and Technical Education, CTE, Month. CTE Month  encourages students, parents, counselors, educators, and school leaders  to learn more about the diverse educational opportunities offered in  their communities and recognize the valuable role of CTE in developing  a well-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United States.   By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our  aim to raise greater awareness of the importance of improving access to  high-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our Nation's  ongoing economic competitiveness.                            ____________________
