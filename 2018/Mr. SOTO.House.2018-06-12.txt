 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings. I thank her for  her service in law enforcement. I know she can view this at a level  that some of us who have never witnessed this type of tragedy, never  felt this type of tragedy--she has an understanding of it that I am  grateful for her imparting to me.   As someone who was a State legislator and a lawyer, I have never seen  this kind of tragedy up close. And even still to this day, as we  remember these 49 souls, these 49 angels whom we lost and the 68  injured 2 years ago at the Pulse nightclub tragedy in Orlando, we  still, as a community, are trying to understand this carnage, this  loss, this tragedy. Our hearts still ache, Mr. Speaker.   This was the single deadliest known violent attack on the LGBTQ  community, an attack on our Latino community, an attack on our African  American community, and an attack on the whole Orlando community. Until  last September, it was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Mr.  Speaker, they have gotten even deadlier, with Las Vegas just recently.   Yet our community showed its resiliency and strength in the face of  diversity. Orlando Strong is more than just a hashtag; it is our  commitment to pledge to stand up to hate and to gun violence. Since  then, Floridians stand stronger than ever.   Over the past 2 days, I have had the honor of attending events with  Congresswoman Murphy, Congresswoman Demings, and Congressman Mark  Takano, co-chair of the LGBT Congressional Caucus. We had an LGBTQ  roundtable with local groups. We visited the Pulse Memorial. We helped  hand out scholarships under the 49 Fund Scholarship Ceremony. We toured  The LGBT Center. We went to a rally on action for gun violence. We went  to the Orange County History Museum to see the history of those days,  and I joined with Congresswoman Val Demings, my colleague here today,  to hear the 49 church bells ring for the 49 victims at the First United  Methodist Church in downtown Orlando.   Today, we honor the 49 lives taken by displaying love, acceptance,  and kindness. But, most importantly, we honor them with action. That  has been the theme over the last couple of days: we honor them with  action.   I would like to recognize and focus my comments, in large part  tonight, on following local groups and survivors in central Florida  who, 2 years later, continue to transform their grief and mourning into  positive change for all.    We cannot change the tragedy that happened. We cannot change the  past. We cannot bring back those 49 angels whom we lost, but we can  give meaning to this great tragedy through action to make sure these  types of shootings no longer are commonplace in our society. We honor  them with action.   First, I would like to talk about Brandon Wolf. Brandon, a native of  Oregon, was one of the survivors during the Pulse nightclub shooting on  June 12, 2 years ago today.   Brandon moved to Orlando in 2008, after attending the University of  Oregon Political Science School. He now lives in Tallahassee, where he  has become a leading activist in LGBTQ issues in minority youth.   After the shooting, Brandon and his friends launched The Dru Project,  named after Drew Leinonen, an LGBTQ nonprofit organization on a mission  to spread love across the Nation. I got to meet with Drew's mother this  past week at our LGBT roundtable, and I will talk a little bit more  about that in a little while.   The advocacy group sponsors gay-straight alliances in public schools  and offers scholarships to help send future leaders to college. In  August of last year, Brandon joined the board of advisers for a  political action committee dedicated to ending gun violence.   Following the Pulse tragedy, Brandon was inspired by Drew's words:  ``We never say I love you enough.'' He travels the Nation speaking on  behalf of LGBTQ youth--education, commonsense gun legislation, and the  future of intersectionality are some of the topics he discusses-- spreading the message of unconditional love and inclusion.   I attended the Pulse rally to honor them with action yesterday,  organized by Brandon at Orlando City Hall, an amazing event that I will  talk a little bit more about tonight.   Another call for action, to honor them with action was the onePULSE  Foundation. The onePULSE Foundation was established by the owners of  Pulse nightclub, including Barbara Poma, to create a sanctuary of hope  following the shooting.   The foundation supports the design, construction, maintenance, and  operation of a memorial and museum to remember the Pulse nightclub  shooting. They also work towards giving out community grants to care  for the victims' families and the survivors.   The foundation has currently established an interim memorial, which  serves as a sanctuary of quiet reflection and love, dedicated to  honoring the senseless loss of innocent life. There is hope to create  an official permanent museum in the future, something that I look  forward to working on with my colleagues, Congresswoman Demings and  Congresswoman Murphy.   The onePULSE Foundation is also creating annual 49 individual college  scholarships named in honor of each victim and designed for their  specific vocations, hobbies, or life aspirations. Through their work,  the onePULSE Foundation makes sure that the names and legacies of each  of the victims, the 49 victims, these angels whom we lost that night,  live on and are never forgotten.   I would also like to talk about our Q-LatinX community. LatinX is a  term referring to our younger, next generation of our Latin community.  In fact, many of our more senior Hispanics think: What the heck are  these crazy kids talking about with LatinX? It is a self-styling of  folks who are Millennials and who are Generation X who are Latin.   It is amazing that this name has come into the common nomenclature  now, really amazing, and a testament to this kind of intersectionality  that we saw that night, that we lost so much of, that is now being  highlighted as a result.   Q-LatinX was founded in response to the mass shooting and active hate  that occurred on June 12, 2 years ago today, at the Pulse nightclub.  Its mission is to bring together and empower the most marginalized  members of our community, establish affirming and supportive healing  relationships and spaces, build a strong and united community, and work  towards a society free of fear, violence, and hate.   Through their program of social justice education, they built a  supportive infrastructure, addressing inequity and promoting  inclusionary practices for local leadership and partnership agencies.   Q-LatinX strives to give a voice to the community. Through their  immigration committee and HIV prevention education committee, Q-LatinX  makes sure to prioritize issues that affect both the LGBTQ and Latino  communities.                                time  1945    But it gets at this bigger issue of intersectionality.   I know when you look at our 49 victims, just like the rainbow flag  that honors our LGBTQ community, it is a rainbow of individuals, a  rainbow of backgrounds, and it is symbolic of the intersectionality of  Orlando, an area that Congresswomen Demings and Murphy have the honor  of representing with me. I am proud of that diversity, and I know  Congresswoman Demings and Congresswoman Murphy are proud of that  diversity.   Mr. Speaker, I want to now give Congresswoman Demings the opportunity  to continue her impressions on both intersectionality, gun violence,  and so many other issues that I know that we will be addressing  tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for yielding. Of  course, at the end of this, I am going to give the gentlewoman the last  word, if that is okay with her.   So it has been a busy last couple of days as we pay tribute to the  second annual remembrance of the Pulse nightclub shooting. This  weekend, I got to go to PrideFest Kissimmee, and there is much to be  proud about in Kissimmee. We actually have a human rights ordinance in  Kissimmee County and Osceola County.   People in Orange and Osceola can't be fired if they are gay or  lesbian, bisexual or transgender. But in a third county I represent,  Polk County, they still can be. In fact, there is a community called  Poinciana that is in both counties. If you live on the east side of  Poinciana, you have rights. If you live on the west side, you still do  not.   We also have now the Zebra Coalition that works with LGBT youth who  are subject to bullying and can be intimidated. We are about to get the  center  [[Page H5083]]  in Kissimmee as well to be a beacon of services and of hope, a safe  place in a county that welcomes inclusiveness.   I also got to go to the 49 Fund scholarship ceremony where we saw  LGBT youth be awarded scholarships. These are the future leaders who  talk about how they are going to lead in LGBT rights, lead in gun  safety reform. But I believe education is the seed of hope to stop this  hate from happening in the future, and the future is bright.   We also had Congressman Mark Takano come down to visit with us, the  co-chair of the LGBT caucus, for an LGBTQ roundtable. We heard about  how HIV funds are being cut in Florida because Federal funds are being  cut, even though our State trades off with being the number one State  for new HIV contraction. So this is an issue that is affecting us.   We heard there about how these transgender school guidelines were one  of the first things that the Trump administration took out, which is  now leading schools to uncertainty in how they have to protect these  vulnerable kids.   Also, we heard even about some of the things that we take for  granted, like that we are going to be having, through Zebra Coalition,  an LGBTQ prom, because a lot of these kids, they get outcast in high  school, and we want it to be an inclusive community. We are an  inclusive community.   We also visited the Pulse nightclub memorial with Barbara Poma, and  we watched the photos of grief. We looked at the names. We signed in  and took our pilgrimage.    We went to the GLBT Center and heard about them coordinating services  on that day and afterward, about the outpouring of love and supplies,  and folks coming in to ask what they could do to help.   Then last night, we had the rally against gun violence. It rained the  whole time, but people's spirits were up. This was the neatest point:  It ended with an actual rainbow. Because the sun came out, a rainbow  came down. It was right after our prayer, so I believe God was watching  and gave us a sign with a rainbow at the end of that.   Then the Orange County Historical Museum this morning, as we saw in  the photographs, we saw the memorabilia and more quilts than I have  ever seen in my life, beautiful, colored tapestries, pictures of so  many of our friends who fought side by side, and memorialized this  great tragedy.   Lastly, we were at First United Methodist Church. The gentlewoman and  I got to participate in that this morning, where we heard the 49 bells  with each of the victim's names being discussed, being memorialized.   So I am going to leave it back to the gentlewoman and say it was an  honor to be able to be there this morning, to hear the ringing of the  49 bells for our 49 victims, and we will never forget. I thank  Congresswoman Demings for spending this time with me.
