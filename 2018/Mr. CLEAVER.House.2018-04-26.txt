 Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying that there are a  lot of things in this farm bill that I actually agree with, and I would  like to be supportive of such components of this bill. I agree with and  would like to be a partner in getting this bill passed. However, there  are some things I need to mention.   For the last 50 years, Democrats and Republicans have worked together  to combine food and farming programs in a bipartisan effort. However,  when discussing the 2018 farm bill, which will come up for a vote very  soon, I want to shed some light on some things that don't quite add up,  some things that aren't what I would call common sense.   In essence, this bill aims to restrict eligibility and reduce  benefits of the Nation's most effective antihunger program, SNAP,  formerly known as food stamps. Moreover, this proposed bill dumps a  massive burden on State governments. Therefore, although I intend to be  an active partner in the final passage of this legislation, I cannot  and will not support the 2018 farm bill until the necessary changes are  made.   If enacted, this bill, as it is currently designed, will deal  damaging blows to the very heart of America by cutting nearly $20  billion from SNAP, resulting in higher levels of hunger, poverty, and  critical health problems.   I want to take just a minute to remind my colleagues and those who  are watching at home who the SNAP recipients are.   In my home State of Missouri, SNAP reached 759,000 residents, more  than 10 percent of the population. That is 1 in every 10 Missourians.  SNAP kept 221,000 people out of poverty in Missouri, including 109,000  children, which reminds me--and this is the painful part of being in a  body that has now become tribal in the way we conduct business, and it  is so sad that we have come into this situation.   Over and over and over there is this theory that is floated out in  America that people are stealing food stamps and living in luxury homes  and all of this; and it is just so sad because, when you hear something  like this for decades, people actually believe it. There is no proof to  what they say when they make these allegations.   It may be important to know that 82 percent of the places where food  stamps or SNAP are redeemed, there is 0.5 percent fraud.   But if you listen to people, they are not going to say it on the  floor. They could go and say it out in the world, but they won't say it  on the floor, because they know that it is inaccurate, but you would  come to believe that, boy, these people are ripping these hardworking  Americans off.   Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.  That is from Macbeth, and it is exactly what is happening. We are  deceiving the American public.   I read somewhere that says the generous will themselves be blessed  for the food they share with the poor. That is something that we should  remember, particularly those of us who are inclined to read the book  from which that quote came.   As Representatives of the United States of America, it is our  responsibility to pass legislation that is proactive, not reactive. It  is our responsibility to understand the very real and human  consequences that could take place if this legislation is passed as it  currently stands.   Once again, let me remind you of the fact that the SNAP program is  the most effective way to combat food insecurity. I know. I grew up  poor. I grew up in public housing. I saw my father working three jobs  to get us out of public housing. We lived there 5 years. He would not  even take food stamps because he didn't want anybody to think that he  was not working hard enough. So I get a little frustrated when I hear  people lying about people who receive SNAP.   The fact that, in the year 2018, there are children and adults in  America who go hungry is absolutely appalling. It is important to note  that over 70 percent of the people who receive SNAP are the children,  the disabled, and the poor.                            ____________________
