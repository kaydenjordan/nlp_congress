 Mr. President, if you watched ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday,  you would not have been surprised that there was a segment relating to  prescription drug pricing. Everywhere we turn, somebody is raising the  question about why we are paying so much for prescription drugs and why  the cost of these drugs has gone through the roof.   We want to encourage research. We want to encourage innovation. We  understand that these are profit-making companies, so we understand we  will pay for that. But what we are seeing in terms of the pricing of  drugs across America now is inconsistent with any of the history that  we have had. It seems as if pharma believes that if they own a drug,  they can charge whatever they can charge, and no one will question  them.   It makes a difference. Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health  insurer in my State of Illinois, analyzed the cost of care in our State  and nearby and asked: What is driving the increase in health insurance  premiums? The cost of prescription drugs, even more than the cost of  inpatient hospital care.   Look at all of those big hospitals and all of the important work they  are doing and expensive procedures they are involved in. All of that  cost does not equal the rising cost of prescription drugs. That is why  our health insurance premiums are going up, so it is understandable  that more and more of us are talking about this and trying to find  practical ways to approach it that might make things better.   Can you consider one policy that might have the support of Democrats  and Republicans, the American Association of Retired Persons, the  American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, 88  percent of Americans, and the Trump administration? What in the world  could that be? Here it is: a measure I introduced in 2017 to require  pharmaceutical companies to disclose the prices with new prescription  drug advertising.   Last year, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and I teamed  up to pass a measure in the Senate to require pricetags on the  television ads. We were stopped in conference by a single House  Republican.   Think about those television ads. What do they tell us in those ads?  For 60 seconds, as fast as they can talk, they tell us everything under  the sun. If you are allergic to XARELTO, do not take XARELTO. Certain  negative things may happen if you take this drug or the other drug. On  they go for 60 seconds without stopping. Yet they never disclose the  price of the drug.   After Senator Grassley and I put our bill in last year, I got a call  from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. He decided  he wanted to pick up on our effort and join us. Think about that for a  minute--a Republican Senator, a Democratic Senator, and the Trump  administration agreeing on something. It turns out, he thinks it is a  good idea, and I do too.   If we had price disclosure on these ads on television, it might open  the eyes of a lot of people as to what it costs. What is the most  heavily advertised drug on television today? HUMIRA. Why was HUMIRA  invented or discovered? To treat arthritis, particularly psoriatic  arthritis. Guess what they discovered. It also had a side benefit they  didn't anticipate. You know the little red patch on your elbow-- psoriasis? If you take HUMIRA, all of a sudden, that little red patch  goes away. So if you are watching the ads on television, some of them  are about arthritis, but some of them show ladies sitting by swimming  pools with flawless skin because they are taking HUMIRA. It is very  interesting.   There is one thing they leave out. Do you know what HUMIRA costs? It  costs $5,500 a month. This red patch on my elbow may trouble me when it  comes to the swimsuit competition, but I am not going to spend $5,500  to deal with it. I think they ought to have to disclose the price of  the drug. We take their prices; we do not make up the price. The price  they declare as pharmaceutical manufacturers--we believe that is the  one that should be advertised.   On Monday, Senator Grassley and I introduced the bill to codify this  rule that the Trump administration is pushing for price disclosure and  to ensure its long-term implementation. We are happy to have on board  with us Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Senator  King, Independent Democrat from Maine. Disclosing prices in drug ads is  a simple step to give patients a break at the pharmacy. We have to do a  lot more. I think this is a good starting point, though.   American patients and taxpayers pay the highest prices in the world  for most medications. Eli Lilly, out of Indianapolis, IN--they make a  drug called Humalog. It is for diabetes. It is an insulin drug that can  cost up to $329 per dose here in the United States. Humalog, insulin,  diabetes--the cost is $329.   What does the same vial of the same drug made by the same company  cost  [[Page S2855]]  in Canada? It costs $38. It is $329 here and $38 there.   In 2017, Canadians could purchase AbbVie's HUMIRA, which I mentioned  earlier, for $20,000; for Americans, $40,000. The worst part of this  price disparity is that American taxpayers are the ones paying to  develop these drugs in the first place. Our tax dollars at the National  Institutes of Health provide the clues and the direction for these  companies to take our federally funded research and turn it into a  valuable drug, a valuable medical device, and then charge us more than  any other place in the world.   All 210 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration between  the years 2010 and 2016 received funding from the National Institutes  of Health, supported by nearly $40 billion by U.S. taxpayers each year.  I am all for that, incidentally--funding the NIH and leading to this  research. But make no mistake, these breakthrough drugs start at the  National Institutes of Health at taxpayers' expense. So American  taxpayers get hit twice. We pay for the initial research, which leads  to the drug, and then we, of course, pay for the drugs at the highest  levels.    The heart of the problem is that our system does not function as a  free market. There are too many forces at work when it comes to  prescription drugs that limit competition. Often Big Pharma charges as  much as they can get away with because they manipulate the patent  system to avoid competition.   The theory used to be that if you discovered the drug, you could sell  it exclusively for, say, 20 years, and then everybody could take your  formula, make generic drugs, and there would be open competition so  that the price would go down. That is not how it works.   The core issue is that roughly 10 percent of brand name, patent- protected drugs account for 80 percent of spending in America. The  overwhelming prescriptions are for generic drugs, which are affordable  drugs, but it turns out that even though 90 percent of the  prescriptions are for generic drugs, they account for only 20 percent  of all the spending. It is that 10 percent of brand name drugs that  account for 80 percent of all prescription drug spending because they  are so expensive.   In what other industry does the price of the consumer product  increase year after year after being introduced on the market? Maybe a  collector of artwork or baseball cards but certainly not when it comes  to something that is a life-and-death commodity like a drug.   The point is, I don't believe our Founding Fathers envisioned a  scheme where Sanofi's Lantus, insulin that was approved in the year  2000, would receive 45 additional patents after it was approved by the  FDA, providing a massive 37-year monopoly by Sanofi on this insulin  product. During that time, the price of insulin has increased from $35  to more than $270 because Sanofi has successfully bought lower cost  generic competitors, and it is not just Lantus or insulin.   Celgene's cancer drug, REVLIMID, has been awarded 96 patents, many of  which were awarded after the initial FDA approval. As a result,  REVLIMID, effectively, has gone 40 years without competition.   The same goes for Pfizer's nerve pain drug, Lyrica. You have seen  that one advertised on TV. I have. That entered the market in 2004.  Lyrica has received 68 patents, including filing more than 2 dozen  after initial FDA approval. They are gaming the system to avoid  competition to keep their prices high.   In fact, the top 12 best-selling drugs in America each have an  average of 71 patents. Why do they get a new patent? Because they have  decided that instead of a 150-mg tablet, there will be a 75-mg tablet,  and they get a new patent. Or they put a new coating on the outside of  the pill or they have a new manufacturing technique. They get the  patent. They have exclusivity in the market for another extended period  of time.   The top 12 best-selling drugs in America each have an average of 71  patents, and 74 percent of all new drug patents are for drugs that are  already on the market. They are gaming the system.   We can and we should reward innovative research so that companies can  earn a profit for good work and big ideas. But an abusive manufacturer  should not be allowed to game the government patent system while being  shielded from competition.   This month I am going to give what I call my Pharma Fleece Award. I  made a special sign here so that pharma would know what we are talking  about. This month we are going to give this Pharma Fleece Award to  Celgene, Pfizer, and Sanofi for stacking excessive secondary patents to  block generic competition. The net result, of course, is that American  consumers pay more for their products.   To address this, I introduced legislation last month with Senator  Cassidy, Republican from Louisiana and a medical doctor, called the  REMEDY Act. Our bipartisan bill reduces incentives for Big Pharma to  ``evergreen,'' which is a technical term in this application. It is an  effort to amass endless quantities of follow-on patents that shield  blockbuster drugs from competition from generics. You see, under an  act, a law known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, when a generic drug  manufacturer seeks approval from the FDA, they are routinely blocked by  a maze of patents held by the brand name company.   The generic company has the option to say whether they think the  patents covering the brand name drug are not valid or relevant. If so,  that can trigger a patent infringement lawsuit. When this happens, the  FDA issues a 30-month freeze on the generic company's application to  hash out the issue. The problem with this 30-month freeze is it extends  the monopoly period for the drug again, and it incentivizes the filing  of secondary follow-on patents that may not add to the safety or  efficacy of the drug.   This automatic 30-month freeze on competition encourages pharma to  amass large numbers of secondary patents and block generic companies  from putting on the market a drug that would be in competition with  their brand name drug. No matter how weak the patent is, how peripheral  it may be--like the coating on a pill that I mentioned earlier--it  works. For 30 months, there is another delay before there is  competition.   The REMEDY Act, which Senator Cassidy and I introduced, would  restrict this 30-month freeze of FDA approval so that it applies only  to primary substance patents. This removes an incentive for brand name  manufacturers to continue to game the system by filing excessive  follow-on patents, and it makes it easier for low-cost generic  competitors to come to market.   Big Pharma is gaming the system at the expense of American patients,  at the expense of the American health system, and at our expense when  it comes to health insurance premiums. What are we going to do about  it? Well, it turns out, we happen to be working in a place which makes  laws, the U.S. Senate. We are supposed to take a challenge like this  and do something about it--not just lament the fact that prescription  drug pricing is out of control, but actually do something.   Lucky me, I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has  authority over many of these issues, particularly when it comes to  patent law. There are things we can do as members of the committee to  bring down prescription drug pricing.   Honestly, if you follow the U.S. Senate, we can do something other  than a nomination, which is all we have done around here for a long,  long time. I am sure the American voters are happy to see us work on  nominations, but they would be much happier if we worked on the high  cost of prescription drugs. We have done little or nothing on this  subject, other than talk about it for the last few months.   Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, has decided not to bring  legislation to the floor of the Senate anymore. That is just from the  days of yesteryear when we actually debated a bill, offered amendments,  had votes. People showed up on the floor because we were doing  something.   Look at it now.   American patients need help from the high drug prices, not more  unqualified, divisive nominees but actual legislation to help American  families. What a break it would be if the U.S. Senate became the U.S.  Senate again.   I hope Senator McConnell will allow us to put a bill on the floor of  the Senate. It would be a great celebration here in the Senate. I think  Republicans and Democrats would enjoy the opportunity to actually come  to the floor,  [[Page S2856]]  have a debate, and pass a bill that may become a law that ends up  helping Americans. For many of us, that is the reason we ran for  office, and I hope we can return to that very soon.                                 nominations    Once again, this week the Republican Leader has scheduled no  legislation for votes on the Senate floor.   Instead, our Republican colleagues are spending another week rubber  stamping President Trump's nominees.   This week, the Republican majority scheduled votes on three Trump  judicial nominees. Each of these nominees has expressed views that are  ideological and extreme.   First there was Michael Truncale, nominated to the District Court for  the Northern District of Texas. Mr. Truncale gave a speech in 2011  where he outrageously called President Obama ``an un-American  imposter.''   He described the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County that  gutted the Voting Rights Act as ``a victory.'' He has called for  defunding Planned Parenthood and said that he opposes the bipartisan  DREAM Act.   He has called the Environmental Protection Agency a ``job killer''  and called for eliminating the Departments of Education and Energy.   Mr. Truncale also gave a radio interview in 2012 thanking the Tea  Party movement ``for what it has meant to our country and to our  Republican party.''   Despite all this, only one Republican Senator, Senator Romney, voted  against Mr. Truncale.   Then there's Ninth Circuit nominee Kenneth Lee of California, who has  been advanced by Republicans over the objection of both home State  Senators. That never happened before until this year, but this is now  the fifth time we have seen a nominee advance with no blue slip.   Mr. Lee initially failed to provide dozens of his controversial  writings to the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I remember when President Obama's Ninth Circuit nominee Goodwin Liu  initially failed to fully disclose articles he had written to the  Judiciary Committee. Republican members of the Committee said it was  ``potentially disqualifying'' and said it showed either incompetence or  an attempt to hide his writings.   Senate Republicans ended up filibustering Goodwin Liu's nomination.  Yet every Republican member of the Judiciary Committee voted for Mr.  Lee's nomination. The double standard is obvious.   When we were finally able to review Mr. Lee's writings, we saw he  routinely expressed extreme views. Here are just a few examples:   He wrote: ``Charges of sexism often amount to nothing but irrelevant  pouting.''   He said: ``homosexuals generally are more promiscuous than  heterosexuals, and thus their risk factor [for AIDS] increases  exponentially.''   He called affirmative action ``liberals' most sacred shibboleth.''   And he called multiculturalism a ``malodorous sickness.''   Then there is Wendy Vitter, nominated to the District Court for the  Eastern District of Louisiana.   Like Mr. Lee, Ms. Vitter also initially failed to disclose more than  100 speeches and documents to the Judiciary Committee.   The matters she failed to disclose included a panel she moderated in  2013 at a Louisiana Right to Life conference. At this panel, she told  the audience to urge their doctors to put in their waiting rooms a  brochure entitled ``The Pill Kills.'' This is a brochure about how  birth control pills supposedly kill women.   Ms. Vitter also claimed in a 2009 speech that we are ``throwing out  our Constitution'' by counting the full population in the national  census.   All three of these judicial nominees have expressed extreme  ideological views that raise serious questions about their judgment.  Yet Republicans are rubber stamping all three of them to lifetime  appointments on the federal bench.   Then there is President Trump's nominee for Deputy Attorney General,  Jeffrey Rosen. Mr. Rosen simply does not have the right qualifications  for this important job.   The Deputy Attorney General runs the day-to-day operations of the  Justice Department and oversees its law enforcement components.   At this critical moment, we need a Deputy Attorney General who is  familiar with the Justice Department, who has experience in overseeing  criminal investigations and prosecutions, and who is committed to the  Department's role of enforcing the law independently without fear or  favor.   Mr. Rosen has no experience working in the Justice Department or  handling criminal cases. When I questioned him about core DOJ functions  and agencies he will oversee if confirmed, he wasn't familiar with them  and said he would have to get up to speed.   For example, when I met with him and asked him about the landmark  First Step Act, he said he had ``begun getting informed about it.''   When I asked him about the Deputy Attorney General's role in  overseeing the Federal Bureau of Prisons and addressing their critical  staffing shortages, he said he wasn't familiar and couldn't comment.   When I asked him about voting rights and voter suppression, he said  he hadn't had occasion to study the issue.   When I asked him about the DEA's role in setting opioid production  quotas, which he will oversee, he didn't know about it.   When I asked him about DOJ's role in immigration matters, including  his priorities for the immigration courts he will oversee, he said he  looked forward to learning more about it.   Mr. Rosen was a longtime colleague of Attorney General Barr at a law  firm, and he has held positions in other government agencies like the  Department of Transportation. But that does not make him qualified to  be the Deputy Attorney General.   Because my Republican colleagues used the nuclear option to change  the Senate rules, there is now less time for the Senate to debate  controversial nominees like Mr. Truncale, Ms. Vitter, and Mr. Rosen.   But the American people see what is going on. They see the rush by  President Trump and Senate Republicans to confirm nominees who are  ideological or who lack the right qualifications for the job.   I oppose these nominees. And I regret that the Senate's advice and  consent process has become an exercise in Republican rubber stamping.  This institution can, and should, do better.   I see that my colleague from Texas is here on the floor, and I don't  want to take any more time.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I annnounce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Booker), the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the Senator from  Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms.  Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
