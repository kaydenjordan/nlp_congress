 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, America's attention is rightfully drawn to  supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia's illegal and unjustified  war. At the same time, we are contending with China, which is  undergoing the largest peacetime expansion of military power in  history.   This morning, Congress and the American people heard from Israeli  President Isaac Herzog, and I rise today to remind my colleagues of the  ongoing threat posed by Iran to peace in the Middle East and beyond.   Iran is exporting more oil today than it has since 2019 despite the  sanctions that were overwhelmingly passed by this Congress and that  remain as current law.   Recently, the Navy's Fifth Fleet intervened to prevent two commercial  oil tankers from being seized by Iran in the Gulf of Oman. Iran was  recently granted membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,  which fosters deeper political and economic cooperation with Russia,  China, India, and other members.   All of this has taken place while Iran continues to enhance its  nuclear program, provides Russia with weaponry to use in Ukraine, funds  proxy fighters throughout the Middle East, holds U.S. citizens hostage,  and vows to kill former American officials in revenge for the death of  Soleimani.   Despite Tehran's reestablishment of diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia  and holding indirect talks with the United States, it appears that we  are far from the ``deescalation'' that the Biden administration says it  seeks. Instead, all evidence points to an Iranian regime intent on  aggressively pursuing its aggressive objectives.   I agree that we should avoid a crisis that would be triggered by Iran  enriching uranium weapons beyond a 90-percent grade or by Iran-backed  militias killing U.S. servicemembers in an attack, but my concern is  what behavior the President is willing to accept short of these  redlines.   While I can only speculate on the content of the Biden  administration's reported talks with Iran, press reports suggest a  possible agreement would permit Iran to maintain nuclear enrichment at  60 percent. This level cannot be justified for peaceable purposes, and  agreeing to it can have serious consequences.   In addition, the Biden administration's persistent outreach to Iran  undermines its stated goal to degrade the Russian military.   Henry Rome and Eric Brewer, two scholars who follow Iran's nuclear  program closely, recently wrote:         Instead of laying the groundwork for a deal that reverses       Tehran's nuclear program, this strategy risks cementing       Iran's status as a nuclear threshold state [all] while       shaking off its economic and political isolation.    In other words, it gets a lot of what it wants without any price to  pay.   Normalizing the 60 percent enrichment level may threaten more nuclear  proliferation, particularly in the Middle East. Other countries  contemplating nuclear programs will take note and demand the same  treatment.   Another element of a reported deal is Iran's pledging not to harm  American servicemembers in the region. Ensuring the protection of  Americans abroad is the President's first responsibility, and it is to  be commended; however, turning a blind eye to havoc wrought against our  partners in the region only sows greater instability.   At the same time Iran's oil exports were revealed earlier this month,  Israel was waging a military operation against Iranian-backed  Palestinian militia groups--Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   In Iraq, in addition to Tehran-backed militias that remain beyond  government control, Iran is gaining ground in the Iraqi Government.   Scholar Michael Knights observed last month:         Iran's allies have achieved unprecedented control of Iraq's       parliament, judiciary, and executive branch. . . .       Washington's complacent attitude toward these events is only       setting it up for costly involvement later.    The regime's ability, through the IRGC, to fund such efforts comes  directly from the failure to enforce sanctions. The Wall Street Journal  reports that oil exports are double what they were a year ago--the  highest, as I said, since 2018. Oil revenue is the regime's lifeblood,  and reducing its cash stream is a critical component to getting Iran to  negotiate.   I call on this administration to strictly enforce sanctions on Iran's  oil exports and pressure countries that help to facilitate the sale of  Iranian oil.   In a bipartisan letter I joined with 25 of my colleagues just  recently, we wrote the President last month:         It is crucial for your administration to remain aligned       with Congressional efforts related to Iran's nuclear program       and not agree to a pact that fails to achieve our nation's       critical interests.    In the face of a regime in which hardliners have solidified power,  President Biden's narrowly focused approach merely kicks the can down  the road. But this may be to Iran's advantage. In fact, it most likely  is. Current trends indicate that Iran will use the time to refill its  coffers and deepen its diplomatic ties, better positioning itself to  withstand pressure to make any significant concessions.   The administration must pursue more than the bare minimum in its  diplomacy. Keeping a problem from developing into a crisis is good, but  solving the problem is much better. I recognize the obstacles that must  be overcome and that we will have to provide some concessions. To  believe otherwise would ignore the history of diplomacy. But in accord  with the will of Congress, an acceptable agreement can be reached.  President Biden has the tools we have provided through that  legislation, and he must use them.   I yield the floor.
