 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, later today, the Senate will vote on  finally getting the appropriations process moving. We will vote on  considering a package of domestic funding bills, and if we take up the  legislation, I intend to stay on it until we complete it.   On both sides of the Capitol, our Democratic colleagues have spent  recent weeks insisting over and over that their 3-year-old quest to  impeach the President will not prevent them from the substantive work  American families need us to tackle. So far, the early returns haven't  been too encouraging.   A few weeks ago, we saw the unusual spectacle of Senate Democrats  voting to filibuster defense funding due to political fights with the  White House. Democrats blocked a pay raise for our servicemembers  because they would rather fight with the President.   We know that across the Capitol, for months now, Speaker Pelosi has  been blocking the USMCA and blocking the 176,000 new American jobs it  would create.   This week offers another test. Soon we will be voting on  appropriations, and we will see whether our Democratic friends really  can put aside their impeachment obsession long enough to get some real  work done on the side. Actions speak louder than words.   First, I hope we will tackle a package of domestic funding bills.  After that, we will turn to a defense vehicle. I urge our Democratic  colleagues to drop the stall tactics that have left funding for our  Armed Forces in limbo and join with Republicans to deliver the funding  our military commanders need to keep us safe.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, I opposed  President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria so I am  encouraged by press reports that his administration is considering  retaining a military presence in that country to keep the pressure on  ISIS.   Since September 11, our Nation has learned several key lessons about  the fight against radical Islamic terrorism.   The terrorist threat cannot be wished away. The terrorists mean us  harm, and we cannot allow them to establish safe havens and solidify  their networks. When they do, the bloodshed ends up right here on our  shores.   American leadership is essential. We have seen our partners and  allies step up and take on important roles. In fact, as we speak,  France is playing a leading role in the African Sahel, but just about  every place President Obama tried to ``lead from behind'' provides  tragic reminders that there are  [[Page S5932]]  certain kinds of leadership only America can contribute.   Fortunately, we are not in this alone. The huge progress we have won  in recent years against ISIS and the Taliban has come by partnering  with local forces, with support from a broad international coalition.  America has only provided limited specialized capabilities to reinforce  the local partners that do the heaviest lifting. This approach is  sustainable.   Unfortunately, we know exactly what happens when America forgets  these lessons and simply decides we are tired of sustaining the fight.  Abandoning Afghanistan in the 1990s helped create the conditions for  al-Qaida's ability to grow and plan the September 11 attacks from a  safe haven far from our shores. President Obama's retreat from Iraq  allowed ISIS to rise from the still-warm ashes of al-Qaida in Iraq.   If not arrested, withdrawing from Syria will invite more of the chaos  that breeds terrorism and creates a vacuum our adversaries will  certainly fill.   It will invite the brutal Assad regime to reassert its oppressive  control over northeastern Syria, repressing Sunni Arab communities and  creating the same conditions that led to ISIS's growth in the first  place.   Russia will gain more leverage to amass power and influence  throughout the Middle East, project power into the Mediterranean, and  even promote its interests in Africa.   Iran-backed forces could have access to a strategic corridor that  runs all the way from Tehran to the very doorstep of Israel.   So where do we go from here? Many of us in the Senate were ahead of  the game on the need to reaffirm American global leadership in the  ongoing fight against radical terror. At the beginning of this year, a  bipartisan supermajority of Senators warned about exactly this course  of events. The McConnell amendment to S. 1 earned 70 votes back in  February. We specifically warned against a precipitous withdrawal from  either Afghanistan or Syria and noted the need for an American  presence. Congress should affirm--actually, reaffirm--the same truths  today, and we should do so strongly.   Unfortunately, the resolution crafted by House Democrats is simply  not sufficient. It is not so much wrong as it is badly insufficient. It  focuses solely on the Kurds, ignoring the critical Sunni-Arab community  that suffered under both Assad's regime and ISIS and vulnerable  minority communities like the Christian Arabs of Syria. The House was  silent on the key matter of maintaining an actual physical U.S.  military presence in Syria.   Perhaps the goal was to paper over disagreements within the  Democratic Party. After all, our colleague, the senior Senator from  Massachusetts, recently told a national television audience--this is  the senior Senator from Massachusetts--``I think that we ought to get  out of the Middle East.'' ``I think we ought to get out of the Middle  East,'' said the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and almost all of  our Democratic colleagues currently running for President refused to  sign on to the McConnell amendment that earned 70 votes earlier this  year.   We can't afford to dance around the critical question of a U.S.  presence in Syria and the Middle East for the sake of Democratic  Presidential primary politics. The Senate needs to speak up. We cannot  effectively support our partners on the ground without a military  presence. Senators who thought we should withdraw from Syria and  Afghanistan in February do not get to criticize President Trump for  withdrawing from Syria today unless they go on the record, admit they  changed their minds, and say it is too dangerous to quit.   So, today, along with Chairman Inhofe, Chairman Risch, Chairman Burr,  and Senator Graham, I am introducing a stronger resolution that  acknowledges hard truths and focuses on our strategic interests in the  Middle East.   Our resolution acknowledges the vital role our Kurdish and Arab  Syrian partners have played in rooting out and destroying the ISIS  caliphate. It condemns Turkey's decision to escalate hostilities in  Syria, warns against the abandonment of our allies and partners in  Syria, and urges President Trump to rethink his invitation for  President Erdogan to visit the White House.   It also acknowledges Turkey's legitimate national security concerns  emanating from the conflict in Syria and the significant risks to the  United States if such a strategically consequential ally were to fall  further into Moscow's orbit. It recognizes the grave consequences of  U.S. withdrawal: the rising influence of Russia, Iran, and the Assad  regime and the escape of more than 100 ISIS-affiliated fighters  detained in the region.   We specifically urge the President to end--end the drawdown,  something that, fortunately, appears to be underway. We urge a  reengagement with our partners in this region. We highlight the need  for international diplomatic efforts to end the underlying civil wars  in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that address the conditions that have  allowed al-Qaida and ISIS to thrive. We cannot repeat this mistake in  Afghanistan.   I am aware there is some appetite on both sides of the aisle to  quickly reach for the toolbox of sanctions. I myself played a critical  role in creating sanction regimes in the past, but I caution us against  developing a reflex to use sanctions as our tool of first, last, and  only resort in implementing our foreign policy. Sanctions may play an  important role in this process, and I am open to the Senate considering  them, but we need to think extremely carefully before we employ the  same tools against a democratic NATO ally that we would against the  worst rogue state.   Do we know what political impacts such sanctions will have inside  Turkey? Will they weaken President Erdogan or rally the country to his  cause? Do we know the impact sanctions will have on U.S. companies or  on the economies of our closest allies that have deeply integrated  their economies with Turkey?   If we are going to use sanctions against a democratic ally, we are  going to have to be careful. We are going to have to be smart. We are  going to have to be thoughtful and deliberate. We don't want to further  drive a NATO ally into the arms of the Russians.   Serious conversations about the use of sanctions must involve our  colleagues on the Foreign Relations, Banking, and Finance Committees to  ensure that this tool is used correctly.   The most important thing the Senate can do right now is speak clearly  and reaffirm the core principles that unite most of us, Republicans and  Democrats, about the proper role for American leadership in Syria, in  the Middle East, and, for that matter, in the world.   We hope the damage in Syria can be undone, but perhaps, even more  importantly, we absolutely must take steps so the same mistakes--the  same mistakes are not repeated in Iraq or Afghanistan.   I feel confident that my resolution is a strong and sorely needed  step. I feel confident my colleagues will agree, and I urge them to  join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 2740 ripen  at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in concurrence with  the Democratic leader.    I know of no further debate on the motion to proceed.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 950.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 457.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                S.J. Res. 59         Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham, better known       by its acronym ISIS, flourished in the chaos unleashed by the       civil war in Syria and at one point controlled extensive       territory in Iraq and Syria;        Whereas ISIS murdered thousands of innocent civilians,       including Americans, and sought to ethnically cleanse the       territory it controlled of religious minorities;        Whereas the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which is       composed of Kurdish and Arab fighters, remains an essential       United States partner in the successful campaign to destroy       ISIS' so-called ``caliphate'';        Whereas, backed by the United States and United States       allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces liberated millions of       Syrians from ISIS' terrorist regime, and sustained       approximately 11,000 casualties in the fight;        Whereas ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates have proven       resilient and have regrouped when the United States and its       partners have withdrawn from the fight against them;        Whereas Turkey's unprovoked incursion into northeastern       Syria, which began on October 9, 2019, has displaced more       than 166,000 civilians, according to the United Nations High       Commissioner on Refugees, and dozens of civilians have been       killed on both sides;        Whereas, as a result of Turkey's incursion into       northeastern Syria and the withdrawal of United States Armed       Forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces have turned to Russia       and the brutal Assad regime for support, while more than a       hundred ISIS-affiliated detainees have escaped from detention       facilities; and        Whereas the Assad regime is responsible for murdering at       least 500,000 civilians and displacing at least 12,000,000       Syrians, or roughly half the country's population at the time       that the civil war began in 2011, and the regime's return to       northeastern Syria through its new partnership with the       Syrian Democratic Forces will allow the regime to extend its       murderous campaign and again subjugate the Kurdish, Sunni       Arab, and religious minorities of northeastern Syria: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That       Congress--        (1) condemns in the strongest terms the Government of       Turkey's escalating hostilities against Kurdish partners of       the United States in Syria, while recognizing the Government       of Turkey's legitimate humanitarian, economic, and security       concerns emanating from the conflict in Syria;        (2) calls upon the United States Government to pressure the       Government of Turkey, including through sanctions, to act       with restraint, provide accountability for human rights       abuses conducted by militias acting in support of Turkish       military operations, and curtail its hostilities against       United States partner forces in Syria;        (3) reiterates United States opposition to the forced       repatriation of refugees from third countries into Syria, and       calls upon all refugee returns to be safe, dignified, and       voluntary;        (4) urges the President to rescind his invitation to the       White House to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan until a       more enduring cease-fire has been established between Turkish       and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria;        (5) calls upon the United States Government to continue       supporting liberated Syrian Kurdish and Arab communities in       northeast Syria through humanitarian support, including those       displaced or otherwise affected by ongoing violence in Syria,       and calls upon other nations to increase support to       stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria;        (6) strongly opposes any abandonment of our Kurdish and       Arab partners in Syria;        (7) calls for a halt to the withdrawal of United States       Armed Forces from Syria where practical, and calls for the       continued use of air power to target ISIS and provide       protection of ethnic and religious minorities in northeastern       Syria;        (8) expresses support for a continued United States       military presence in Iraq, along with efforts to help Iraqi       forces control their border, protect their sovereignty, and       counter ISIS;        (9) recognizes the continuing threat to United States and       United States allies posed by al Qaeda and ISIS, which       maintain an ability to operate in Syria and Afghanistan;        (10) warns that a precipitous withdrawal of United States       forces from the ongoing fight against these groups, without       effective, countervailing efforts to secure gains in Syria       and Afghanistan, could allow terrorists to regroup,       destabilize critical regions, and create vacuums that could       be filled by Iran or Russia, to the detriment of United       States interests and those of our allies;        (11) recognizes that an unbroken chain of Iranian-      controlled territory across Syria poses a significant threat       to Israel;        (12) reiterates support for international diplomatic       efforts to facilitate peaceful, negotiated resolutions to the       ongoing conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan on terms that       respect the rights of innocent civilians and deny safe havens       to terrorists;        (13) encourages close collaboration between the executive       branch and the legislative branch to ensure continuing       strong, bipartisan support for United States military       operations in Syria and Afghanistan; and        (14) calls upon the President to certify whether conditions       have been met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS       before initiating any further significant withdrawal of       United States forces from the region.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.
