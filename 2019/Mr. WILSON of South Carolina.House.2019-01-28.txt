 Mr. Speaker, this month, Qatar and the  United States completed the second annual Strategic Dialogue. The State  Department cited the many successes of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   The Strategic Dialogue highlighted the strength of the relationship  to deepen the cooperation to benefit both countries.   The United States welcomed Qatar's generous offer to expand critical  facilities at bases used by U.S. forces in the country, enabling  expansion at Al Udeid Air Base.   Both sides intend to strengthen their security and counterterrorism  partnership to eradicate terrorism and violent extremism.   There was continued support for a strong and united Gulf Cooperation  Council promoting a peaceful and prosperous future for the region. Our  GCC allies should work together to resolve their differences for the  sake of the success and security of the region.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Robert Adams, VI.                            ____________________
