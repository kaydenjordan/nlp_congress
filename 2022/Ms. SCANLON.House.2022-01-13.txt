 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to help bring this bill to the  floor and to push for its consideration in the Senate.   Pennsylvania--and Philadelphia, which I represent--is the birthplace  of our democratic Republic, but it is now ground zero in the battle for  the soul of our Nation.   A decade ago, when the last redistricting occurred, the Pennsylvania  legislature launched an attack on election rights, which has only  escalated over the years. Voters have had to battle in court to get  fair districts and to overturn discriminatory voter ID laws that  threaten to disenfranchise more than half a million eligible  Pennsylvania voters. And in the last 2 years we have seen these threats  multiply as the former President and his far-right allies have tried  over and over again to make it harder to vote and to throw out the  legal votes of Pennsylvania's eligible voters.   This bill is not a takeover of State elections, it is a response to  attempts by State legislatures, like Pennsylvania's, to make it harder  for Americans to express their most essential freedom--voting--by  exercising our duty under Article I Section 4 of the Constitution to  protect that right.   I urge all of my colleagues, no matter what party, to support this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, January 14 marks the first time in 6  months that families will not receive an expanded child tax credit  payment, a program to support children and families that Congress  passed last spring with the American Rescue Plan.   For the last 6 months, working and low-income families have had the  relief of knowing that every month they would receive $250 per child,  and $300 for kids under six.   These payments have been a lifeline for families, helping them put  food on the table and provide for children as the pandemic rages. As a  result, child poverty and hunger then dropped in this country by almost  half.   More than 76,000 families in my district received these monthly  payments, and they are worried about what will happen now that the  payments have ended. Just last weekend, two constituents, a dad and a  grandmother, approached me to say how important the CTC program had  been.   We cannot go backwards. The Senate must move quickly to pass the  Build Back Better Act and extend the child tax credit. America's  children are counting on us.
