 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for two  bills that the House will consider this week: H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.  These bills are the first comprehensive gun violence prevention bills  to be considered in the House since the Violent Crime Control and Law  Enforcement Act was signed into law in 1994.   Far too often innocent lives are claimed due to gun violence. Nearly  40,000 people die of gun-related injuries per year.   While mass shootings often dominate the headlines, we cannot continue  to turn a blind eye to the gun violence happening on a daily basis in  cities all over the country and even my own hometown of Waterbury,  Connecticut. I have lived in a neighborhood where the sound of gunshots  in the distance was as normal as hearing church bells, and, as a  teacher and a mother, I have seen firsthand how the fear of violence  affects our children.   For far too long, Congress has failed our communities by remaining  silent on this issue. America is ready for commonsense background check  legislation. I owe it to my community, I owe it to my State, and I owe  it to the people of Newtown, Connecticut. That is why I look forward to  casting my vote in support of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.                            ____________________
