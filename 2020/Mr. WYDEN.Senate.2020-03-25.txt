 Mr. President, several Senators on the other side have  been arguing against the provision in this bill to supercharge  unemployment insurance right now, which is something on which Senate  Democrats have negotiated with the Trump administration, Secretary  Mnuchin, and Chairman Grassley. Based on what I am hearing from the  Senators on the other side, you would think that this provision was  pretty much going to end Western civilization.   Now, supercharging unemployment benefits has long been a priority for  Senate Democrats, and we have been fighting for those improvements in  unemployment since the process began. In our view, it is the key to  getting help to where it is needed the most.   Believe me, colleagues, when you see the unemployment claim numbers  tomorrow, if the numbers are accurate, this Chamber is going to see  that the unemployment crisis will be exploding in America   I don't believe anybody in our great country should fall into  destitution as a result of this pandemic, so I, obviously, disagree  with my colleagues who oppose so strongly our amendment to improve  unemployment benefits. I just want to make a few key points in response  to their argument.   First, I start with an argument that just about knocked the wind out  of me when I heard it earlier. It is the idea that nurses are going to  quit their jobs as a result of this legislation.   Nurses are not going to be quitting their jobs to get unemployment  benefits because that is not how nurses think when they get up in the  morning. By now, everyone has seen the Herculean efforts of our nurses  who have been fighting the pandemic. Nurses in America are brave, and  they care. They are true professionals. From Portland, OR, to Portland,  ME, they are on the frontlines of this fight and are putting themselves  in harm's way to save the lives of our neighbors whether they be in  South Carolina, Oregon, or anywhere else. They don't cut and run. Also,  contrary to the suggestion of my colleague from Nebraska, retired  [[Page S2054]]  nurses have been coming out of retirement in droves to help treat  patients who are suffering because of the coronavirus.   Second, it is a head-scratcher to me that my colleague from Nebraska  is raising this objection now. I am the ranking Democrat on the  Committee on Finance. I learned about his objection when I watched his  press conference, and then I called him about it. The proposal has been  out there for days, and Senators have known about it the whole time. It  is not a drafting error, and it is not a last-minute surprise. What the  Senator from Nebraska wants to drop now, in effect, was part of the  bill.   The Presiding Officer is a member of our committee, and I enjoy  working with him. What the Senator from Nebraska wants to drop now was,  in fact, part of the bill that Republican Leader McConnell introduced  on Saturday. He introduced it on Saturday because the Senate Democrats  insisted on its being part of the package, and as Secretary Mnuchin  said this afternoon on national television--we all heard it--the  Republicans agreed. I will have a little more to say about Secretary  Mnuchin's remarks in a minute.   Third, I want to talk about why this is so needed--why my Democratic  colleagues and I have worked so hard to help the millions get through  these horrendous times who have been hit by this economic wrecking  ball.   For most Americans, the old unemployment rules would cover only a  third to a half of their lost wages. That was it. It is pretty hard to  pay the rent and put food on the table with that. Even before this  crisis, the Federal Reserve found that nearly half of Americans  wouldn't have been able to have come up with $400 cash to cover costs  in an emergency. Let's face it. Millions of Americans were walking on  an economic tightrope of balancing their rent against the food and the  food against the fuel, and that was before the pandemic.   That is why we on our side feel so strongly and are so appreciative  of the work of Senator Peters and Senator Menendez, who helped in the  negotiations, and, of course, of the leader's work. We all said we need  an improved, supercharged unemployment benefit to replace people's lost  wages. These are people who shouldn't face a choice between  homelessness and hunger or bankruptcy because a virus has shut down our  economy and cost them their jobs. This isn't the fault of any workers  in South Carolina or in Oregon or anywhere else.   While the consumer economy is shuttered, Congress has a  responsibility to make sure that Americans can bounce back in a matter  of weeks or months. Otherwise, millions will struggle and be slow to  recover from the economic crisis, and many might not make it if the  Senate doesn't move to help them now, now, now. The panic people feel  over the virus is already too much, and the least we can do as  lawmakers is to have their backs when it comes to their surviving this  economic crisis.   All of my colleagues know we are on the third bill in the fight  against the virus. Mitch McConnell's first version of this bill did  virtually nothing for those who lost their jobs. I read it carefully.  Out of 247 pages in the Republican leader's first bill, only 8 lines of  text--not 8 pages but 8 lines--dealt with filing for unemployment  online. That bill had an awful lot of corporate goodies and lots of  slush funds for big corporations but just a few measly lines for people  who were hurting--for workers who were hurting, for workers who were  losing their jobs.   The Senate Democrats fought for and won the changes that make up this  robust, expanding, supercharged program of unemployment insurance. It  is based on a bill that I and our colleague Senator Peters introduced  not long ago.   First, in these punishing economic times, Americans are going to need  more weeks of coverage than they would otherwise get from unemployment  insurance. The existing length of unemployment benefits will not cover  the time this crisis will last.   Second, the Senate needs to modernize the unemployment insurance  program because it really hasn't changed much since it was developed in  Wisconsin in 1932, and, in 1932, nobody was talking about gig workers.  The unemployment program that was invented then has not changed all  that much. It certainly wasn't built to take on the kind of challenge  our country faces right now.   The Democratic Senators and I looked at that system and said this old  system wouldn't be good enough for independent contractors, the self- employed, gig workers, part-time workers, and freelancers who are a big  part of the face of the modern economy. They are not the kind of  workers anybody was thinking about in 1932, when the program was  invented. The Senate Democrats led the effort to get those people  coverage. I am glad that, at one point in the negotiations, we could  get bipartisan support for it.   For the people who still have their jobs but who have had their hours  slashed, we are going to bat for them. For the people in the service  economy, who are those in the restaurants, salons, gyms--you name it-- all of those people who are suffering because their jobs and their  businesses have been put on pause--we are going to bat for them. We are  talking about millions and millions of Americans--people who are  looking at hard times ahead and who need our help now.   The old unemployment insurance system wasn't working, so the Senate  Democrats said: We are going to come together, and we are going to go  to bat for all of those independent contractors, those who are self- employed, the freelancers, and the gig workers.   Now I think that not only are we going to help them over the next 4  months, but I think we have developed some ideas that can be part of  reforming the unemployment compensation system after those 4 months.   Now I want to turn to why this agreement raises benefits specifically  by $600 per week. I have heard my colleagues and their strenuous  objections to that amount. The reason it is $600 is because Labor  Secretary Scalia, after meeting with the Senate negotiators--myself,  Senator Grassley, Secretary Mnuchin, Senator Menendez, Senator Portman;  a big group of us--Secretary Scalia, after meeting with Senate  negotiators, left us with no other way to get benefits to workers  quickly. Secretary Scalia said that the States had no other way to get  the benefits to workers in time.   We needed a simple solution. And I know my colleague, the  distinguished President of the Senate, and others who are sponsoring  this proposal to unravel what Senate Democrats did with Secretary  Mnuchin, the Trump administration, and Chairman Grassley may not  believe me, but I want to share the words of Secretary Mnuchin himself,  and specifically on this question of why we were focused on making sure  that workers could get that extra $600 a week.   Just today, Secretary Mnuchin said:         Most of these state systems have technology that is 30       years old or older. If we had the ability to customize this       with much more specifics, we would have. This was the only       way we could ensure states could get the money out quickly       and in a fair way so we used 600 dollars across the board. I       don't think it will create incentives, most Americans want       what they want: they want to keep their jobs.    That is what Secretary Mnuchin said today in defending the language  that is in the bill as, in effect, the fastest, simplest way for  workers to get their benefits and why we disagree so strongly with the  amendment from the Senator from Nebraska to unravel that approach.   The math shows that standard payment of $600 is the simplest way to  get to full wage replacement without causing, as of now, an  administrative train wreck.   So I am going to close on this. I am sure that everybody here read  that unemployment claims are expected to go up by 2.5 million in 1 week  when the statistics are released tomorrow. Let me say that again--2.5  million. That is almost as many jobs that were lost in the entire year  of 2008 when the great recession hit our country so hard. It is the  single largest rise in unemployment since that figure began to be  tracked. Twelve entire months' worth of great recession job losses-- that is how many unemployment claims economists expect to see in a  single week.   This country has never faced anything like it. It is not a normal  recession. This isn't a normal bill to try to stimulate the economy in  which the government tries to give the economy a shot of fiscal  adrenaline. This is a  [[Page S2055]]  time when we face a shutdown of entire sectors of our economy. What the  Congress needs to do is keep our economy alive and act now. We are not  going to do that by shortchanging workers who are losing jobs, losing  hours, or losing gigs.   I feel so strongly that Americans want to work. Businesses want to  keep their employees on the job. Americans want the economy to spring  back to life once the pandemic is under control, and that is what  supercharging unemployment benefits is all about.   So here is the bottom line on the provision that Senate Democrats  agreed with the Trump administration, Secretary Mnuchin, and Chairman  Grassley on--our proposal was not a drafting error. It didn't pop out  at the last minute. It is not going to bring about the end of Western  civilization.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will review what  Secretary Mnuchin had to say this afternoon on national television,  supporting what Senate Democrats negotiated with him and the  administration, and join us in making sure millions and millions of  Americans don't fall into destitution.   I yield the floor.
