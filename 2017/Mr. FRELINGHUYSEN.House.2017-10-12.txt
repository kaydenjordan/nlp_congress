The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in consideration of H. Res.  569.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in consideration of H. Res.  569.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H. Res. 569, making additional  supplemental appropriations for disaster relief requirements for the  current fiscal year to help respond to recent devastating natural  disasters.   Over the past 2 months, millions of Americans have had their lives  forever altered by destructive hurricanes in Texas, Florida, Puerto  Rico, and the Virgin Islands, and by raging and deadly wildfires in the  West.   We all support those who are victimized, particularly those who lost  their lives or lost loved ones, and we will continue to be with them  every step of the way with the Federal support they need as they  recover and rebuild.   Our thanks go to the first responders, volunteers, and States who  saved countless lives, protected communities, and demonstrated the best  of humanity; that includes FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the  Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and many other Federal agencies  for getting the first installment of relief to those in need.   However, with such massive, unprecedented damage, more help is  clearly needed to continue to respond to these recovery efforts, to  rebuild communities with dollars, with resources, with manpower, and  with our support.   This emergency funding legislation, the second installment, addresses  urgent short-term immediate priorities: replenishing FEMA's Disaster  Relief Fund, supporting ongoing Federal wildfire suppression efforts,  providing debt relief for the Federal Flood Insurance Program, and  other assistance that will help our fellow Americans in their time of  greatest need.   To summarize the $36.5 billion in emergency funding provided in this  bill, in total, $18.7 billion is provided for the Disaster Relief Fund.  This includes $13.77 billion for the most immediate response needs:  lifesaving missions, emergency protection, the repair and restoration  of public infrastructure like communications, power, transportation,  and, yes, shelter, and financial assistance to individuals and families  affected as they rebuild their lives.   This package also includes $4.9 billion for community disaster loans,  which will ensure local governments are able to provide basic municipal  services such as police and fire protection and public education  throughout this trying time.  [[Page H7993]]    In addition to the Disaster Relief Fund, this bill provides a one- time payment of $1.27 billion to allow Puerto Rico and our fellow  citizens to receive the same access to emergency disaster and nutrition  program benefits that other States receive.   The bill also ensures that the National Flood Insurance Program is  able to meet its existing claim obligations as Americans cope with the  tremendous flood damage to their homes and communities.   For wildlife suppression, the bill contains $576.5 million. As we  have seen, the situation out West has grown even more desperate and  deadly. We must ensure that those heroic firefighters can continue to  save lives and protect property.   As we know, the needs of each disaster area are ever changing.  Consequently, our Appropriations Committee and all of our Members  continue to monitor the progress of recovery efforts as well as  anticipate emerging needs.   This will be a long process, Mr. Speaker, and the second package or  installment of the Federal support will certainly not be all that is  needed over the long term.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. It is important for the  Nation, for the communities affected, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on Appropriations.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7994]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7994]]         Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), whose  leadership in this time of crisis we all salute.    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the  Speaker of the House and the whole leadership, Chairman Frelinghuysen,  and all of the members from the Appropriations Committee for allowing  the Federal Government to help Puerto Rico in this dire situation.   On behalf of the 3.4 million American citizens that live in Puerto  Rico and the nearly 5.5 million Puerto Ricans that live on the  mainland, I rise today in strong support of this disaster supplemental  appropriations bill. They have been focused on Puerto Rico since before  the arrival of Hurricane Irma, and then during Hurricane Maria.   I also thank all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who  have reached out during these past 3 weeks to express their  encouragement and offer their assistance during this process. For that,  my constituents and I will always be grateful to all of the Members of  this House.   As you may know by now, Puerto Rico was hit by two major hurricanes.  First, Hurricane Irma, which caused significant damage on the eastern  part of the island. That was on September 6. Then, on September 20, a  few days later, we got hit by Hurricane Maria, which caused  unprecedented destruction throughout the whole island and which many  people consider that hurricane to be the most catastrophic natural  disaster ever on U.S. soil.   Today, 22 days after the storm hit, nearly 85 percent of our  population remains without power, 44 percent without running water, and  almost 58 percent without access to telecommunications. To this date,  we still have towns like Las Marias, Maricao, Utuado, and many others  in the central part of the island, that remain uncommunicated and can  only be accessed by air since most of the roads and bridges were washed  away. We are talking about more than 18 major roads and bridges that  were just washed away. The death toll has reached 48 fatalities, and,  unfortunately, certainly that number is going to increase in the coming  days and weeks.   This unprecedented humanitarian crisis in our own Nation has begun  what is likely to evolve into a mass exodus of Puerto Ricans to the  U.S. mainland, further jeopardizing the island's long-term recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today telling you that the American  citizens that live in Puerto Rico still are suffering in different  ways. This is not the time to focus on how and when resources will be  withdrawn from Puerto Rico, or how slowly we are going to rebuild the  island. Today, 85 percent of our island is without electricity, yet 3.4  million American citizens living there just got less than 15,000 people  working to recover the power grid. I just want to remind you that  Florida got more than 61,000 people helping to recover their power grid  in just 4 days. That is not acceptable in our case, and we are still  American citizens.   I know a lot of problems persist. It is too difficult to address the  issue when you are not part of the mainland, you are not part of the  power grid. It is different when you get access and resources to Texas,  Louisiana, or Florida, because you can drive or you can have  helicopters. In our case, everything is by ship or air. That means it  is more difficult for the Federal Government to assist directly. That  is the reason we got more than 15,000 personnel from the Coast Guard,  National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, Navy, and the assistance  of all national guards--Virginia, Florida, and New York, just to name a  few.   The Puerto Rican communities in the States and on the island are  showing the way, along with private companies, NGOs, and countless  volunteers throughout the whole Nation. But there is still a lot that  needs to be done as we begin the reconstruction. That is the reason  this supplemental is so important for us.   Allowing the people of Puerto Rico to access problems that we never  have before, like SNAP, which will provide $1.3 billion to receive the  same emergency disaster and nutrition assistance benefits as the  States, this is the first time this Congress has allowed this to happen  to Puerto Rico.   I thank the Members and leadership of the House for allowing this  money.   This is the bill that provides for $18.7 billion to FEMA to have the  disaster relief fund to help in lifesaving missions across the island  for emergency protection and removal of debris--we continue to have a  lot of debris on the island--and the repair and restoration of our  infrastructure. That is going to be a matter of discussion on another  day because we can't rebuild or redo the infrastructure we did before  from the fifties or the sixties. We need to redo a lot of things on our  power grid.   It will provide also--and this is a very important area--$7.4 billion  to have liquidity to the local government of Puerto Rico just to match  Federal funds that are needed to these recovery actions. This is the  second step this House has taken in terms of helping the people of  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, people that are American  citizens. This is the second step. The first one was the first  supplemental that was approved.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. So this is the second step. This  is not going to be the last one. We are going to need a lot more help  in the coming months, and I know we can count on this House and on this  Congress to make that happen.   The people of Puerto Rico are grateful, they are resilient, and they  are going to continue to show us the way to recover. It is going to  take a lot of time, a lot of resources, a lot of money, and a lot of  commitment as U.S. citizens, like we are.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), chairman of the Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee on  Appropriations.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by first recognizing  one of our own, who has been a superb representative for Puerto Rico in  these very difficult times. You rarely see somebody with the talent,  the energy of the representative of Puerto Rico here in Congress. Miss  Gonzalez-Colon has been, frankly, a hero, and I just wanted to mention  that, because she has really made all of us understand the situation,  and she has done so with great dignity and great passion and great  brilliance. I just had to say that.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the chairman for being incredibly  accessible and engaged. Florida has gotten hit rather hard, as you  know. This bill totals $36.5 billion. $18.67 billion of that goes  directly to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, and it also ensures that our  National Flood Insurance Program has the resources that it needs to pay  the claims, also an important grant food and aid loan eligibility to  Puerto Rico, which is crucial.   So far, Mr. Speaker, Florida has received $740 million for assistance  for individuals through FEMA, and is working through over 608,000  applicants. Think about that.   As we continue to recover, again, I look forward to continue working  with the chairman, who has been phenomenal.   Specifically, we are going to have to deal with the agricultural  impact of this storm, and again, particularly on the citrus industry,  that has been devastated by this storm.   This is an important bill. It is an important bill. I want to thank  the chairman for bringing it up so quickly. We must pass it. I look  forward to working with Chairman Frelinghuysen and with all our  colleagues through this process, because we are going to need more  assistance as the days and the months go.   So this is an important bill. I urge your support.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate my remarks  with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker) as well as with my  colleague from New York (Mrs. Lowey).   On our committee, we try to get the work of the Nation done, and at  this point in history we have had some incredible tragedies and natural  disasters. As a group, as this House, we must act quickly to ensure  that the Federal Government fulfills its duty to millions of Americans  in need. Whether they are from Texas or whether they are from Florida  or whether they are from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, they are  all citizens. Whether they are from the West, who have been fighting  these deadly fires, they deserve our support.   This will be the second installment of emergency funding. There will  be others. I know people are concerned that not every State's needs are  met, but this is a good step in the right direction, and I urge all my  colleagues to support this legislation so we can get this money out the  door as quickly as possible.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stand with the  hundreds of thousands of Texas families victimized by Hurricane Harvey,  and urge our state and federal officials to use available resources to  help our fellow Americans in their time of need.   With nearly four-and-a-half feet of rain and 130 mile per hour winds,  Hurricane Harvey is the largest and most expensive natural disaster to  hit Texas in living memory. At least 270,000 homes and residences were  damaged in our state. Most tragically, over 75 innocent people lost  their lives as a result of Harvey, most of them in Harris County.   Later today the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on a  $36.5 billion disaster supplemental bill to sustain relief and recovery  efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   This is not a perfect bill. I would have strongly preferred Congress  provide dedicated funds to rebuild Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast,  especially dedicated funding towards our region's flood control  infrastructure and immediate housing needs for hurricane victims.   However, this supplemental will sustain the current recovery efforts  till the damages caused by these devastating hurricanes can be fully  assessed. Today's supplemental is on top of $15 billion in emergency  funding Congress passed last month in the immediate aftermath of  Harvey.   The bipartisan Texas Congressional Delegation is committed to  securing the substantial federal funds Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast  need to rebuild and be prepared for the next big storm before the  holiday season.   Our local officials, in particular the Governor of Texas and the  state legislature, have the opportunity right now to act and ramp-up  rebuilding efforts through our state's Economic Stabilization Fund.   Popularly known as Texas's ``rainy day fund,'' the ESF currently has  over $10 billion available for emergencies. There can be no question  that the destruction caused by Harvey and the immediate needs of tens  of thousands of Texans are an emergency and are the reason why our  state has been investing in a rainy day fund in the first place.   Harris County Judge Ed Emmett and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner have  already called on Governor Greg Abbott to use his authority to tap the  rainy day fund and help Texans in need and rebuild our infrastructure.   I join Judge Emmett and Mayor Turner in calling on the governor to  immediately authorize emergency funding through our rainy day fund and  help rebuild Houston and Harris County.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rogers of Kentucky). The question is on  the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen)  that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res.  569.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.  [[Page H7998]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent  resolution and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in  the House.
