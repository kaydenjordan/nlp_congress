 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the Third  Congressional District of Ohio. Unfortunately, my district, the State,  and the Nation are no stranger to senseless gun violence, lack of  affordable housing, and quality healthcare.   I rise today, again, to say enough is enough.   I rise to mourn the 13,200 men, women, and children who have been  victims of gun violence this year.   The time for only thoughts and prayers is over. It is time for  serious, hard-hitting policy and change. I call on my colleagues to  support my legislation, H.R. 287, the SAFER Now Act.   Safer America for Everyone Right Now is comprehensive and pulls  together the most forward-thinking policies in one package. It would,  Mr. Speaker, require background checks, prohibit the sale of  semiautomatic assault weapons, make trafficking in firearms a stand- alone criminal offense, prohibit the possession of firearms by a person  who has been convicted of stalking, and bans bump stocks.   Let's pass this bill and the two gun reform bills already waiting on  Senate action.   My first-ever floor speech, when elected to Congress, was on gun  violence. Since then, I sponsored and helped sponsor and pass  commonsense gun laws, proudly received an F rating from the NRA,  participated in the 24-hour gun reform sit-in, marched with Moms Demand  Action and stood with Students Demand Action for gun reform, and more.   I am calling on the Governor of Ohio, city mayors, State  representatives, city council, community leaders, and others to demand  action to make our communities safer, get guns off the street, train  and put neighborhood police back in our communities, call upon the  soon-to-be new police chief of Columbus to first patrol our inner-city  neighborhoods, know our community, hold police officers accountable,  and support reducing gun violence--because enough is enough.                          Lack of Affordable Housing     Mr. Speaker, lack of affordable housing is an issue.   The Columbus area is the most expensive region for housing in Ohio. A  person would have to work a minimum wage of over $18 per hour to afford  a two-bedroom apartment. We are fighting to only get a $15-per- hour minimum wage.    I recently convened an Affordable Housing Summit to discuss this  critical issue with 36 stakeholders, toured the district, and, in that  evening, was joined by some 400 constituents to have a community  conversation, hearing firsthand from them about affordable housing  issues.   We know that young people and African Americans are  disproportionately affected by this housing shortage. Too many young  people, too many seniors, too many veterans, and too many families are  facing homelessness.   Columbus and our suburban areas are continuing to grow. We need to  ensure that all of our residents can grow and prosper.   Call to action: I recently passed a bill for FHA first-time home  buyers to get a reduction on their mortgage insurance for taking a  financial literacy course. It passed the House. Now let's call on the  Senate to pass it.   We must increase the supply of equitable opportunities to access  affordable housing, call on the banks to design CRA projects with their  bank-owned houses, raise bond financing, expand abatement housing  buyouts, increase Federal funding, hire a housing czar in my district,  and support State housing tax credits.   I will continue to work with stakeholders to address this affordable  housing crisis.                        Affordable Quality Healthcare     Mr. Speaker, lastly today, I rise for access to  affordable and quality healthcare for my constituents and all  Americans: Too many  [[Page H8964]]  constituents do not get the care they need due to skyrocketing costs.  Too many seniors can't afford their prescriptions, and they are cutting  their pills in half to stretch their medicine. Too many young people  cannot afford the insurance premiums to even get access to a doctor.   At the beginning of this Congress, I met with stakeholders in my  district to solicit their help. I will continue to support the  Affordable Care Act and oppose Republicans' attempts to dismantle this  critical legislation, because if Republicans had their way, nearly 30  million Americans would lose their healthcare--an unconscionable and  sobering statistic.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am fighting for the people of the Third Congressional  District of Ohio.                            ____________________
