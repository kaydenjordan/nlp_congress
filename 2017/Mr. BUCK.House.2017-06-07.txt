 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 375 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 375         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 10) to create hope and opportunity for       investors, consumers, and entrepreneurs by ending bailouts       and Too Big to Fail, holding Washington and Wall Street       accountable, eliminating red tape to increase access to       capital and credit, and repealing the provisions of the Dodd-      Frank Act that make America less prosperous, less stable, and       less free, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed 90 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Financial Services       now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as       an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute       printed in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. That amendment in the nature of       a substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against that amendment in the nature of a substitute are       waived. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B       of the report of the Committee on Rules. Each such amendment       may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may       be offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall       be considered as read, shall be debatable for the time       specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the       proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment,       and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the       question in the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All       points of order against such amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may       demand a separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted       in the Committee of the Whole to the bill or to the amendment       in the nature of a substitute made in order as original text.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule provides a  [[Page H4665]]  structured process for debate and makes in order six amendments to the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to return hope and opportunity to Main  Street America through the Financial CHOICE Act. This legislation  touches at the very heart of our economy, ensuring that our financial  system facilitates job creation, economic growth, and fairness.   Nearly 10 years ago, the American economy cratered. The Great  Recession of the late 2000s revealed that our financial system was  fragile, and many Americans got the short end of the stick.   In 2010, Democrats passed H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act. They promised the bill would lift  the American economy. They promised an end to Wall Street bailouts.  They promised to protect consumers. Seven years later, we know that  these promises never came true.   Due to Dodd-Frank's excessive regulatory burden, big banks are  getting bigger while small banks and credit unions are disappearing.  There have only been six new bank charters since Dodd-Frank--a drastic  decline from the 170 on average per year before the bill. In fact, 43  percent of banks with assets under $100 million have disappeared.   Large banks survive because they can afford armies of lawyers to  understand Dodd-Frank regulations. In 2010, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd  Blankfein even suggested his bank would be among the biggest  beneficiaries of Dodd-Frank. But for community banks with community  budgets, the effects of the law have been devastating.   Dodd-Frank also failed to address the too-big-to-fail problem. Under  the Dodd-Frank law, big banks are growing larger, and taxpayers are  still responsible for bailing them out. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank has  made access to banking and credit more difficult for average Americans.  Since the passage of the bill, bank fees have increased and millions  more Americans are now considered unbanked or underbanked.   Declining liquidity has limited access to credit for small businesses  and the regulatory restrictions on mortgages have pushed homeownership  out of reach for the middle class. Seventy-two percent of community  banks say that the Dodd-Frank regulations restrict their ability to  offer mortgage loans.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the price we must pay to be a hopeful and  prosperous nation. That is why I am here supporting the Financial  CHOICE Act. It repeals Dodd-Frank, replacing the harmful law with  reasonable regulations that ensure consumer protection, job growth,  economic growth, and strong community banks.   The Financial CHOICE Act ends the coddling of big banks. It  implements historically tough penalties on financial fraud and insider  trading. It ends taxpayer-funded bailouts and creates new bankruptcy  laws designed for failing banks. It is time that Congress put Main  Street ahead of Wall Street.   The Financial CHOICE Act also reins in the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, a government agency that has incredible power to  regulate the financial industry but that has nearly no accountability.  The judicial branch has actually declared its structure  unconstitutional.   The CFPB is causing problems for consumers. They have a database for  complaints from consumers, but it publishes consumer complaints before  even checking if they are true. The CFPB also weighs in on financial  regulations where Congress should instead be making these decisions,  and the CFPB wasted over $200 million on lavish renovations of their  office space in downtown Washington, D.C.   This legislation we are considering today will restructure the CFPB,  restoring congressional oversight duties and moving the agency back  under the regular legislative appropriations process. We will also be  refocusing the CFPB on enforcing consumer protection laws, rather than  making up their own laws that only hurt the average American consumer.   Perhaps most important to Coloradans, the Financial CHOICE Act  creates economic growth and jobs by making credit easier to access for  Main Street America. Thanks to the TAILOR Act, introduced by my friend  and colleague from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), regulators will be able to  craft custom regulations to reflect the specific business model of  local banks.   This bill also creates jobs and economic growth by requiring more  transparent policymaking at the Federal Reserve. We rein in stifling  regulations on small, community banks, allowing them to compete against  their larger counterparts. We increase consumer choice by ensuring  Americans can access a bank and a credit card.   Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity today to transform our Nation's  financial system. We have the opportunity to level the playing field  between big and small banks. We have the opportunity to turn up the  heat on financial fraud. We have the opportunity to return regulatory  power from the hands of unelected bureaucrats to the people. We have  the opportunity to roll back hurtful regulations.   We are here to restore hope and opportunity through the Financial  CHOICE Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Williams), the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy  and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Pearce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chair of the Subcommittee on Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I note for the record that the best way for a  student to repay student loans is to have a strong economy and not the  anemic recovery that we had from the last recession.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the  chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman.    I do.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chair of the Subcommittee on Monetary Policy  and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the chief deputy whip of the Republican  Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chair of the Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. The  points have been made. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is not for the  big banks. It is not for the bureaucrats and their swanky downtown  office at CFPB. This legislation was crafted for the American people,  the men and women who work hard every day to earn a living. These  individuals want choice in the financial products they can buy. They  want healthy community banks. They want lower taxes instead of Wall  Street bailouts.   The Financial CHOICE Act was written over the past several years with  these people in mind. We will restore hope and opportunity for them.   I thank Chairman Hensarling and the Financial Services Committee for  their hard work on this bill. I thank Chairman Sessions for bringing  this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on the resolution, and  then to vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
