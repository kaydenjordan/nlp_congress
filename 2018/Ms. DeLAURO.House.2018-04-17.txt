 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the recently  released farm bill for 2018.   Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration want to  unravel the social safety net, and according to the Center on Budget  and Policy Priorities, this farm bill cuts total Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program benefits--that is the Food Stamp program--by more  than $23 billion.   Its stricter work requirements could affect 5 million Americans who  receive food stamps in this country--children, seniors, the disabled,  and, yes, veterans--even though most recipients who can work already  do.   All told, 2 million would lose some or all of their benefits. To my  colleagues I say, these are not just numbers on a page; these are  people who are in need.   At the same time, Republicans want to expand the ill-targeted  commodity programs. They will maintain crop insurance subsidies that  have no eligibility requirements or limits.   This farm bill is not reform; it is hypocrisy. No one in this Chamber  goes hungry. They have three squares or more. I urge my colleagues to  defend the Food Stamp program and oppose this farm bill.                            ____________________
