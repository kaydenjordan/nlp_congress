 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my very good friend  from California, with whom I have traveled abroad and had some amazing  meetings with representatives of countries around the world.   As I listened to our friends on the other side talk about this issue,  it appears very clear what they are saying is that every Member of the  House who has ever met with someone from a foreign country and asked  questions, whether they believe what they were given or not, is guilty  of a crime and should be damned to hell for all eternity.   Basically, is that my friend's impression?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman  from California and I have met with the then-leader of Iraq. Neither  the gentleman from California nor I cared for the man. He was the Prime  Minister of Iraq. He did a great deal of damage to Iraq. He, along with  President Obama, dramatically weakened Iraq.   I know my friend recalls our conversation with Prime Minister Maliki.  We were asking for answers to questions that we considered very  serious.   For example, I was asking about his commitment to protect the  refugees from Iran that he had pledged to protect. My friend from  California was asking about the Iraqi pledge to help pay us back for  some of our costs in making Iraq free.   Those two issues so infuriated Prime Minister Maliki that we got word  later when we were on the C-130 that we were being banned from Iraq by  the Prime Minister.   But to hear our friends across the aisle talk, every time one of them  and every time one of us on this side of the aisle have asked even  people we consider to be despicable and have done terrible things and  we wanted answers, we were committing a crime in demanding those  answers.   I also know my friend from California got similar treatment from a  man we believed was corrupt as the leader of Afghanistan at the time.   I don't find any crime or any harm in asking questions and getting  answers, even from people for whom we have no respect. So I think it is  a good thing. If anybody has got information, even if you don't care  for them, try to get the answers to those questions.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend from  California, Dana Rohrabacher, making the point that he did.   There is nothing either sinister, wrong, criminal, improper when  someone is engaged in an election or when someone is not engaged in an  election, if offered information that may be helpful, whatever the  source. Unless it is a known criminal that is going to advise someone  about some potential crime, there is normally nothing wrong with  seeking or even getting that information.   I doubt there is anybody on this House floor, when offered  information from a source about an opponent in a campaign, didn't at  least take some action to see if there was anything legitimate to it.   So it is just amazing, when we know that there is certainly probable  cause to believe crimes have been committed during the Obama  administration, yet we got nothing in the way of support in  investigating the probable cause of real legitimate crimes; not those  for which there is no known criminal statute that would be applicable  or that may have been violated, but simply, you know, there may be  times when it is bad taste.   But the villainization of Donald Trump, Jr., for inquiring of someone  that Loretta Lynch, as Attorney General for President Obama,  specifically and personally stepped in to ensure could be in this  country, it is just incredible how much is being made of Donald Trump,  Jr., meeting with somebody that Attorney General Lynch pulled all kinds  of strings to get her in and keep her in the country.   And then when you see that picture of this same person sitting right  behind the Obama Ambassador to Russia, Ambassador McFaul, and you know  at these hearings, especially an appointed and confirmed official like  an ambassador, they don't want somebody directly behind them who is not  supportive and not capable of reaching up and handing them a note with  information that may be helpful and them answering a question.   We have had countless hearings, and I have seen it done countless  times. You want somebody behind you that can help provide answers to  questions that you may not can answer without their help.   So there she is, this person that these same friends who pulled all  kinds of strings to get her in this country. They are all upset that  she ever talked to Donald Trump, Jr., and he has--I admire the fact  that he immediately saw that this was a worthless meeting and walked  away from it. So pretty amazing. It was good judgment to walk away from  it, once he found out what she was about.   I wish that President Obama, Loretta Lynch, and Hillary Clinton had  as good a judgment in their meetings with people instead of telling our  enemy--and I do consider the man with whom President Obama was meeting  an enemy. He was not a friend of the United States.   And what does President Obama do when he doesn't think the microphone  can pick him up?   He says: Tell Vladimir Putin--President Obama's close buddy--tell  Vladimir, my buddy, that I have a lot more flexibility once I am past  this election.   ``Okay. Yeah. I will pass that on. Dah, dah, I will pass that on.''   Clear intent; there is no mistaking. The intent is: I will be able to  give away more of America's defenses the way I canceled our missile  defense system in Poland once I am reelected because then I don't care.  I won't be running. I can't be defeated in another election. So I will  be able to give away a lot more of America's defenses.   And what did our friends--who are now so upset about Donald Trump  meeting with a Russian lawyer, finding out she was not worth meeting  with and leaving--do back then?   Nothing. They defended President Trump's actions either vocally or by  their silence while we were raising questions.   I can't end this week without expressing my grave disappointment with  Congress over a specific detail of the National Defense Authorization  Act. There are a number of things in there that bother me that I think  are big mistakes and that I don't think we should be doing. I think we  are wasting money, but compromises have to be made. We are making a  form of sausage called ``laws,'' so we have got to compromise on some  things.   But there are some things that are so important that there cannot be  a compromise. It is too important. It will result in lives being saved  or lives being lost, depending on what we do here in Congress.   So our friend, Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, realized before I did  that the law, as would be in the National Defense Authorization Act,  with all the compromises that had to be made under the great  leadership--and I am not being sarcastic--of Congressman Mac  Thornberry--did a masterful job handling all the problems that arose-- but the law of the NDAA was and will be, under this new law, such that  President Obama and his administration would say, the way it is worded,  the way it is, authorizes us to decide that an appropriate use of this  very limited more and more precious money for our military to defend us  can and should be used whenever someone requests a sex change  operation.    The reports are that, with the hormonal treatment, it can be around  $130,000 or so per person. Military commanders advise that they have  been told: If you have a military member under your command that asks  for a sex change operation and you say something like ``have you really  thought this through?'' or they say something like ``why don't you talk  to a counselor?'' or ``let's talk about this'' or ``you give it some  more thought,'' those are career-ending statements that that commander  would have made; that if someone requests a sex change operation, you  don't ask questions, you don't refer them to counseling, you don't  suggest that they give it more thought. You just sign them up.   Now, the problem there, too, is that apparently they are advised that  they have about 2 years minimum that this servicemember will be out of  commission, cannot be deployed, you can't be sending them anywhere  because you have months of hormonal treatment leading up to the sex  change surgery. And then even if there are no complications, the  followup and the rehab is quite significant. So you better count on at  least a couple of years minimum where that servicemember, that military  member cannot be sent anywhere, cannot be ordered deployed. They are  useless in defense of our country as far as filling the immediate needs  of the military, and that is astounding.   Now, potentially, some might submit that we have come to find out  about maybe the greatest political lobbying by any group of our medical  practitioners. And those who compile the diagnostic statistic manual,  referred to as DSM--we have had I, II, III, IV, V--each time, they have  been subjected to political lobbying because they didn't  [[Page H5881]]  want people who were thinking about a sex change operation--and even  though their chromosomes would not change--still indicating they are  male or female, they wanted to have surgery to change. That was  considered to be a very serious illness, psychiatric illness.   But with a lot of lobbying, it eventually got downgraded, and the  most recent downgrading in the DSM is to something called a  ``dysphoria.'' It went from ``disorder'' to ``dysphoria.''   But dysphoria, if you look it up, it still is--well, one psychiatrist  just said it means confusion, basically. If you have got transgender  dysphoria, you are confused. It is the opposite of euphoria. You are  not well, you are not happy, you have got behavioral problems because  you are not happy with your gender.   Well, for most of our country's history, we understood that, in our  military, it is not to be a societal experiment. We want people who can  fight, hopefully not to their death, but to the enemy's death to stop  those who would kill us or take our freedom.   And it is heartbreaking that--when the amendment came to the floor  last night for a vote to prevent any of that precious money that is  going to save the lives of our military members, the amendment lost by  five votes, 214-209. In other words, if three people had changed their  vote, that amendment passes, and no money could be used out of that  precious money they need for bulletproof vests, they need for up- armored vehicles to save their lives when an IED hits them, all of  these things that are so important to our military.                                time  1345    We are told to account for $3.5 to $3.9 billion over 10 years they  are projecting to be spent, but that, of course, means that is before  word gets out that if you want a sex change operation, if you can get  through basic training--I am not sure about that, you may not have to  get through basic--but if you can join the military and demand a sex  change operation, then you are not deployable. They can't send you to  combat for at least 2 years.   We will pay you as a military member. We will provide you, free, the  hormonal treatments. We will take that money that could save another  member's life and we will spend that on this expensive surgery to  change your organs, maybe cut them off or add some, and then we will  spend more of that money that could save other military members' lives  and spend it on your follow-up and your rehab, all while you can't help  them because you are going through this transition.   This is a difficult time, and it breaks my heart. And it is not a  civilization-ending thing that happened last night, but when the book  one day is written about the rise and fall of what so far has been the  most free and greatest nation in the history of mankind, this would be  something listed as a symptom of why this country lost the next great  war, because they were more concerned about playing societal  experiments than they were with defending their lives and their  freedom.   I see my friend, as good a friend as I have here in Washington. I  yield to my friend, Steve King.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his comments.   In fact, some people sometimes think that we exaggerate, but my very  good friend from Iowa and I have stood there on the mountaintop outside  of Vienna where Western civilization stood there in the gap, and it was  all at risk. The odds were that Western civilization was going to end  with the fall of Vienna. If the radical Islamic group that had taken so  much of the territory already, if Vienna fell, then the rest of Europe  would fall. There would be no stopping this radical Islamic movement  through Europe, and there is a good chance we are not even here in this  fashion today.   I thought about that and my friend and I standing up there getting a  briefing from an individual that knew the history so well, that this is  where one group was, this is where the siege was, that is where the  Polish group brought cannons, and no one in the Islamic group thought  it was possible to get cannons up there.   I thought about that and reflected on that as President Trump was  speaking in Warsaw, Poland, and it was clear how desirous the Polish  people have always been for freedom: Yes, you can practice what  religion you want to, but don't come try to take over our country and  tell us we can't pursue Christianity.   I did not realize until President Trump gave that speech that there  in Warsaw, when Pope John Paul II, came, that they were screaming ``We  want God'' as a group--amazing.   So as I recall, though, it was a Polish prince or king that came  down, King Jan Sobieski who came to the aid of the Viennese people.  They were under siege. They were going to be defeated. It meant the  fall of Western civilization; perhaps we headed into a new Dark Ages.  And this Polish king comes down, determined, gets cannon up on this  mountaintop that no one who was in the 2 years of seeking a sex change  operation and sex reassignment, as they call it, could possibly help do  during that 2-year period. They got cannons up the mountain in position  to help stop the obliteration there of the Western-civilized Vienna, to  stop the fall of that radical Islamic empire from taking over and  destroying Western civilization, making slaves of all of those whom  they overtook.   And some, of course, in their party believed that if an individual  refused to become a Muslim, they should be killed. Others believed in  the more humane treatment that, no, you make them slaves, and as long  as they keep paying their tax, which is really an admittance that there  is no God greater than the Islamic God, as long as they are willing to  subjugate themselves and worship at the altar by paying that fee to  show that they were subservient to the Islamic God, then they could be  allowed to live.   Those were two problems back in that day: Do we let the people live  if they won't become Muslim, or do we just go ahead and kill them? And  many humane thinkers thought: Well, no. As long as they will submit to  our god, pay the tax to show they are submitting to our god; and  Christianity's God, they have got to forget talking about that or they  do need to be killed. Just pay the tax and they can go about still  living.   If Vienna doesn't stand, if it falls, as was anticipated, we are  done.   And I can assure my friends here in the House that there was no one  who was out there defeating the radical Islamic desire to wipe out  Western civilization who had undergone a sex change operation in the  prior 2 years.   This is a risky time in our history. As others have pointed out, no  matter what societal experimentations people want to undertake, what  type of lifestyles people want to undertake, the military is intended  to protect our freedom so that we can pursue these things.   And I know President Obama was fond of saying: Gee, Guantanamo is a  greater recruiting tool. But as I have talked to Muslim friends--yes, I  do have them around the world. As I have talked to Muslim friends in  other parts of the world, whether Afghanistan, Egypt, other parts of  the Middle East, North Africa, they say: You have got to understand,  some of the things you do in the United States make for incredible  recruiting posters for radicals in our Muslim faith.   When it is advertised that the United States Congress is in favor of  taking men and surgically making them into women with the money that  they would use to protect the Nation otherwise, or taking women and  doing surgery to make them men, the United States Congress would rather  spend that money on that surgery than defeating radical Islam, then it  is an advertising, just a bonanza for the radical Islamists.   My Muslim friends tell me, they then agree, the recruits: You are  right. If that is how stupid they are, their society has no right to  remain on the Earth. We need to take them out. They are too stupid.   A disappointing night last night and a disappointing week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July  17, 2017, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
