 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House  appropriations package that will provide $1.6 billion for the  construction of President Trump's border wall.   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from  many military leaders who all agree, a wall won't make our borders more  secure or our Nation safer.   There are more effective ways and technology that would be a better  investment of our limited resources. Moreover, the President has failed  to provide a cost for this wall, and it would be irresponsible for  Congress to write him a blank check, especially after he promised over  and over that the American taxpayers would not foot the bill.   This wall only serves as a symbol of xenophobia and hate, while doing  nothing to address our broken immigration system. Immigrants strengthen  the fabric of our Nation, they serve in our military, they teach in our  schools, and some, like myself, are fortunate enough to serve as  Members of Congress.                            ____________________
