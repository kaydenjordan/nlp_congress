 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4949. S. 4949 would  improve VA's burial benefits for veterans and their families. First,  the bill would ensure that VA can reimburse a Tribal organization for  the cost of burying a veteran in a VA grant-funded Tribal cemetery.  This would close a gap that existed before the enactment of the  Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2022.   Previously, a State could receive a plot allowance from VA, but some  Tribal organizations did not have the same eligibility.   Furthermore, S. 4949 would permit the Secretary of the Army and the  Secretary of the Interior to transfer lands under their possession to  VA for establishing or expanding national cemeteries. I believe this  will help VA further its goal of providing veterans with reasonable  access to a national cemetery.   Lastly, the bill would help preserve the reputation of our national  cemeteries as a hallowed final resting place.   Under present law, VA cannot bury an individual who has fled to avoid  prosecution of a capital crime. Currently, in these cases, VA must  provide the family due process before denying the benefit.   Additionally, someone who commits a Federal tier 3 sex offense but  flees to avoid prosecution is barred from burial in a national  cemetery. However, there is a loophole that prevents VA from denying  this benefit if the State charges the individual with the same crime.   A tier 3 sex offense is the most serious classification. These  offenses include sex crimes against children and aggravated sexual  abuse. No veteran or their family should have to worry about seeing  their attacker being honored in a VA cemetery. We must close this  loophole.   I thank Senator Tester and Senator Rounds for leading this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to support S. 4949. I have no  further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
