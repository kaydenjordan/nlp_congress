 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, even with all the dysfunction in Congress,  somehow the American people continue to expect that Washington will  enact policies that bear at least some relationship to the challenges  they face. Unfortunately, the administration's new Executive order on  energy fails even that low bar.   This order will not expand energy production, it will not make us  more energy independent, it will not create more American jobs, and it  will also not protect us from the ravages of climate change. That last  point is somewhat less surprising than the first because, unlike  millions of Americans and 99 percent of scientists, this administration  does not believe that climate change is real or that humankind is  contributing to it.  [[Page S2102]]    To understand where this Executive order comes from, I think it is  important to see where we were before this administration took office.  Put simply, the United States was already on track to achieve energy  independence. Our country is producing a tremendous amount of low-cost  energy. Since 2008, solar energy production has grown more than 50- fold, wind power is up 3-fold, and oil production in the United States  of America is up 75 percent. In fact, 5 years ago, we began producing  more oil than we import.   You can see on this slide that over the period of time that the Obama  administration was in office, oil production rose like this, and net  imports have gone like this--an important fact considering our  geopolitical situation in the world. We are also now producing so much  natural gas that facilities that were built originally to import gas  are now being reengineered to export gas from the United States. I,  along with other people in this Chamber, have worked hard to try to  make sure those facilities are expedited so we can get the benefit of  that exported natural gas.   Even before President Trump rode to the rescue with his Executive  order, the Wall Street Journal told us that exports of natural gas  could more than double over the next 5 years, just based on what we are  doing already. We are also using energy far more efficiently in our  homes, our appliances, and our automobiles, which is why the  administration's action to reverse higher fuel standards last week-- well, I just would say, talk about a solution in search of a problem.  That is one.   There is not a person in Colorado who said to me: Michael, do you  know what we ought to do? We ought to reduce the fuel efficiency  standards on automobiles. We ought to create a regulatory environment  where the United States can't sell competitive automobiles in the  world. Nobody has said that because not only are they concerned about  climate, they are concerned that we lead the world when it comes to  innovation. And that order, just like a budget that cuts the EPA by 30  percent, that targets the climate scientists at the EPA, that targets  the satellites that are above our heads so that we can't see what is  happening on our planet--this is all so we can perpetuate a willful  view that climate change doesn't exist, and it is the same thing with  this Executive order.   All of the trends that are in place right now--right before this  administration took office--have combined to reduce our reliance on  foreign energy in recent years, even as our economy has grown and  average prices at the pump, because of the abundant supply, remain  under $2.30. We are just a few years away from exporting as much oil  and gas as we import. That is important for our country.   Colorado has been a huge part of America's growing energy  independence and, by extension, our national security. That is because  in many ways Colorado led the way in developing a commonsense approach  to expanding energy production while ensuring clean air and a healthy  planet. We brought environmentalists together with the oil and gas  industry to develop one of the first State limits on methane pollution.  It became a model for the country. We passed the first voter-led  renewable energy standard in the Nation, which became a model for the  country. We established our own limits on carbon pollution at the State  level, and in this process we have created 13,000 renewable energy  jobs, with wind jobs alone expected to triple by 2020. On average,  these jobs pay over $50,000. This is not some Bolshevik experiment or  some socialist experiment. These are manufacturing jobs in the United  States of America, in Colorado, that would not be there if it hadn't  been for the policy decisions that were made in this body and in other  parts of Washington, DC, and the supply chain that goes along with  those manufactured turbines is critically important to our economy. At  the same time we were doing all that, we preserved over 56,000 oil and  gas jobs, even as drilling has slowed because of, again, abundant  supply, to say nothing of the jobs Colorado has created just because it  is a place where other people would like to live. They want to come to  Colorado, as they want to go to Nevada, because there is a high quality  of life. There is a lot of sunshine in both places.   I am pleased to have the chance to work with the Senator from Nevada  to make sure we not only extended the investment tax credit with  respect to solar, but we put language in there together--Republicans  and Democrats together--to create an idea that those credits would kick  in at the beginning of construction, not having to wait until the end.  That has made a big difference to our solar industry.   Long ago, the State of Colorado and, I would say, many other States  have broken past the false choice between our economy and the  environment. That is the course we have charted in Colorado, and if the  President were serious about energy independence, he would support that  approach. Instead, he is trying to undermine it with this new order. By  undoing national standards for carbon pollution, the order threatens to  undercut our thriving clean energy industry. There are 465 solar and  wind businesses across our State supporting over $8 billion in  investments. By retreating from the fight against climate change, the  order recklessly endangers Colorado's $646 billion outdoor recreation  industry, not to mention the health of our national forests that line  the banks of some of the most vital watersheds in America.   As the President targets our environment and clean energy economy  with this Executive order, he has dressed it up as something good for  jobs, as he did during the campaign. Yesterday, the President stood  before a group of coal miners and promised to ``cancel job-killing  regulations'' and ``put our miners back to work.''   Just 2 weeks ago, I was on the Western Slope of Colorado, a region  with a number of mining communities. These communities, some of whom  have helped invent hydraulic fracture and directional drilling, know  that their challenges have far more to do with low prices and  competition from natural gas than from the EPA. They know that their  way of life and the way of life of communities like theirs all across  the United States require real solutions to help them grow and  diversify their economies. These communities get it. They understand  it, but the President clearly does not.   Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal ran this article entitled  ``Despite Trump Move on Climate Change, Utilities' Shift from Coal Is  Set to Continue.'' According to the article, last year, power from coal  plants fell while power from natural gas rose 35 percent. Nationwide  major utilities are shedding coal and increasing natural gas and  renewables. That is the reality of our energy market and of the global  economy, but this administration, when it comes to energy and when it  comes to climate, is not operating in reality. It is operating amongst  political slogans. It is operating in the theater of the absurd, where  policies have no relationship to problems, facts don't matter, and  false promises to struggling Americans are just another political  tactic to win a cable news cycle.   The American people deserve so much better. Colorado deserves so much  better than that. That is why today I am introducing a bill alongside  more than 30 Senators to rescind this disastrous order, protect  American jobs, and preserve our path toward energy independence. The  stakes could not be higher for our kids, our planet, and our economy.  We cannot let this stand.                            ____________________     Mr. President, even with all the dysfunction in Congress,  somehow the American people continue to expect that Washington will  enact policies that bear at least some relationship to the challenges  they face.
