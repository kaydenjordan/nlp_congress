 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized to speak for as long as I may require.    Madam President, here is my view of serving in the  U.S. Senate: It is hard to get here, it is hard to stay here, and while  you are here, you might as well try to accomplish something good for  the country. Accomplishing something good in the U.S. Senate means  working with a superior staff.   Today, I want to pay tribute to the 270 men and women who have served  on my staff since I came to the Senate in 2003, in my personal office,  both here in Washington, DC, and in the six Tennessee offices; in the  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; the Senate  Rules Committee; the Senate Appropriations Committee; and at the Senate  Republican conference.   Some who started with me in 2003 are still working for me after 18  years, and some have moved on to other opportunities, but each has  played a major role in the Senate, whether they were helping to pass  laws, serve our constituents, or answering the front-office phone.   We have some important traditions here in the Senate, including the  maiden speech, which I delivered 17 years ago, in my case, and the  farewell speech, which I delivered yesterday, but for me, something is  missing. Usually staff is acknowledged in the farewell address, which  either makes the address way too long or at least too little time to  properly acknowledge their contributions. I am here today to make a  ``Salute to the Staff'' speech. I know my colleagues agree that their  own accomplishments are the result of working with superior staff, so  perhaps, if I may not be presumptuous, a ``Salute to the Staff'' speech  might become an additional Senate tradition.   When I say ``superior staff,'' here is what I mean: superior in being  what Senator Howard Baker used to call an eloquent listener--that the  constituent on the phone might be right or even the staffer in the  other office might be right; superior in courtesy to the Tennesseans  for whom we work; superior in insight; superior in resolving complex  issues and wrapping up the result in a nice package with a ribbon tied  around it, ready to be passed and signed into law whenever the moment  came that it could be passed, which would usually be a surprise and at  an inconvenient time; and superior in writing and speaking plain  English in order to persuade at least half the people we are right; and  superior in working well together--something you are supposed to learn  in kindergarten--so we have a good time while we are working.   Unlike almost every other Senate office, at the suggestion of my  chief of staff, David Cleary, we created a single team composed of  personal office staff here and in Washington, DC, and the committee  staff, with David in charge of all of that. I originally thought that  was a big mistake. I didn't see how anyone could be in charge of all of  that, but I was wrong about it because what it did was break down  barriers and eliminate jealousy, improve communication, and create a  much happier and effective working condition.   The results have been exceptional. For 18 years, I have gotten up  every morning thinking I might be able to do something good to help our  country, and I have gone to bed most nights thinking that I have. That  couldn't have happened without the privilege of working with an  exceptional staff.   The truth is--we all know this--that there is just no physical way  for any U.S. Senator to see every single one of our constituents every  time we want to  [[Page S7200]]  see them or talk to them on the phone, although we all make our best  efforts to do that. And you learn pretty quickly that constituents  expect and deserve to be treated not just with courtesy but promptly.  For example, Senator Estes Kefauver held this seat that I now hold when  I was a high school student.   One day, Maude from Madisonville, his hometown, called Senator  Kefauver's office and said: ``I want to speak to Estes.''   The staffer said: ``I'm sorry but Senator Kefauver is tied up on the  floor.''   There was a long silence. Maude said: ``Well, you go down and untie  the son of a gun and get him up off the floor and tell him Maude's on  the phone and wants to speak to him.''   So our constituents expect to talk with us when they want to.   My first visit to the Senate was when I was a junior in high school.  It was part of the American Legion Boys Nation Program. I was invited  to visit Senator Kefauver. I was 17 years old. I was reluctant to do  that because I was sure he had many more important people to see than a  17-year-old boy from Maryville, TN. I was even more sure of that when I  arrived at his office because his office was just filled with people  who looked important and looked like they had come from all over the  world to see him. But his assistant came out and swished me in through  all the important people, doing her best to make me feel comfortable.  Kefauver had a reputation for being accessible, and it was because his  staff made it appear that he always was.   I remind my staff that there are many people who want to see us who  suspect that we feel we are too important to see them, and we should do  everything we can to help them understand that we know that they are  the important ones.   The staff and I have done our best to try to do that. With all of the  Senators with whom I have served from Tennessee, we have what we call  Tennessee Tuesday, which are breakfasts where any Tennessean can come  and visit with both Senators, have a little breakfast, and have their  photograph taken.   In 18 years, 270 people have worked on my Senate staff--as I  mentioned, in Jackson, Nashville, Tri-Cities, Knoxville, Memphis,  Chattanooga, or in Washington, DC, on my personal staff or the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions staff or the Rules Committee or  Appropriations Committee or at the Senate Republican conference. There  are a lot of places to have a lot of staff--153 women, 117 men.   Our staff has also benefited from the work of 433 interns. These  interns usually stay with us 1 to 3 months, and they have some real  work experiences while they are here, and they are pretty good. In  fact, 30 staff members--that is 11 percent of our staff--began their  work in our office as interns.   Our staff has experienced some great personal joys. We celebrated the  birth or adoption of 30 babies over those 18 years. Just as I met my  wife Honey while we were both working in the Senate, some of our  staffers met their spouses while working on my staff, including:  Mackensie Burt and Paul McKernana, Will Patterson and Katherine Knight,  Virginia Heppner and Bobby McMillin, Laura Lefler and John Herzog, Will  Campbell and Victoria Souza, and Patrick Jaynes and Jill Salyers. They  are all married now.   We also have experienced some profound sorrows. Some have lost  parents, nursed seriously injured children, or been through their own  health emergencies.   In November 2007, Trey Lefler, a very special staffer and friend, was  involved in a serious car accident and died as a result of his  injuries.   Many staff members have stayed. We have worked together for a long  time. Some have been a part of our team--meaning we worked together-- since I became a Senator: Patrick Jaynes, State director; Lindsey  Seidman, deputy staff director on the HELP Committee; Jane Chedester,  field representative in Knoxville; Kay Durham, constituent services  representative in Nashville; Charlotte Jackson, who knows more about  how to help people with a visa problem than anybody in the world; Matt  Varino, field representative in Jackson; Gina Parkerson in Tri-Cities;  Stephanie Chivers, a senior adviser in Nashville.   It is pretty remarkable. It is not so easy to be on the staff of a  U.S. Senator in the State they represent. Everybody knows who you are.  Everywhere you go, you are likely to be sought out by people who need  help, people who are hurting. It is easy to get burned out. It is hard  to stay in a job like that for that long.   Patrick Jaynes says that while these might be jobs in politics, the  politics end when you start the job. You have to work with everyone and  help everyone.   Our Tennessee field representatives have traveled thousands of miles,  meeting with mayors, businesses, schools, hospitals, and other  organizations across our 95 counties.   Caseworkers have handled about 20,000 cases over the years, like  getting disability benefits, helping a World War II veteran get a  medal, helping a family stranded overseas get home.   For example, Laura Ray Goodrich is a staffer in Jackson. She heard of  a single mother having desperate issues getting her tax refund. The  mother needed the money to help pay rent and the rest of her bills.  Laura got to work and reached out to the IRS. She discovered the  mother's returns had been wrong for several years and helped the  thrilled single mother recover far more money than she was expecting.   Keith Abraham, who works in the Knoxville office, heard from a  Tennessee company about an employee with a grim cancer diagnosis. The  employee's parents lived in China. They were unable to see the employee  because of COVID-19 restrictions. Long and short, Keith worked it out  so they could receive the appropriate paperwork and fly here to be with  their daughter.   One story that I got to see in person was about Wilbur ``Bill''  Hoffman from World War II. Mary Wooldridge, in our Memphis office, was  asked if there was some way he could be recognized for his World War II  service. She worked with the service and discovered that he was not  only eligible for a Purple Heart after he had been wounded at Pointe du  Hoc on D-Day in 1944, he had also earned the Bronze Star and the Ranger  Tab awards. In 2012, he was presented with these awards by our State's  highest ranking military officer, General Haston at a ceremony I  attended. He died a year later.   Each fall, Kay Durham in our office works through about 150  Tennesseans' applications to attend our Nation's service academies. She  has worked with over 2,500 candidates applying for those academies.   There is no better State director than Patrick Jaynes. He also served  as deputy chief of staff. He worked to create a smooth relationship  between what happens in Tennessee and what happens here. I have  traveled thousands of miles with Patrick. He has not run into anybody,  but we have been through a lot of flat tires and some speeding tickets.  Patrick and I have seen it all. He is full of insights. He always has  energy for the next event and can always solve a problem.   During my time in the Senate, the conference elected me three times  as chairman of the Senate Republican conference. That is a little bit  of a political job. What you are supposed to do is come up with  something that Republicans can say to counter what Democrats are  saying. It is especially a challenge to do that for Republicans to get  them to talk on a single message.    All of the Senators--every one of us--are experts in politics or we  wouldn't have gotten here. And Republican Senators are especially  independent-minded. Republicans and Democrats will often all do things  together as a caucus, but we do it differently than they do. Democrats  will all hold hands and jump off the cliff together. Republicans will  also all jump off the cliff at the same time, but one will do a  somersault, one will do a back flip, one will do a dive, and so forth.   The goal was to come up in the caucus with a catchy phrase. For  example, on energy, ``Find more, use less,'' or about ObamaCare, ``step  by step,'' instead of ``comprehensive.''   To persuade Senators to say the same thing, staff would record clips  of them saying what I thought they should say, and then we would show  that back to them at lunch. I found that Senators paid a lot more  attention to watching themselves say things  [[Page S7201]]  than they did to watching me suggest to them what to say.   It wasn't me doing all that; it was staff doing it. They came up with  catchy phrases, many of them. They made sure we communicated them at  the conference.   While I was on the Rules Committee, I had a chance--I worked with  Senator Schumer on that. We were ranking--really, like this year, we  didn't know who would be the new President. I had an opportunity to  speak at President Obama's inauguration. We talked about the peaceful  transfer or the reaffirmation of power as a conspicuous symbol of our  democracy. There is no possible way to organize a Presidential  inauguration without a superior staff. Mary Jones and Lindsey Seidman  were the ones who were in charge of all that for us.   Then, in 2012, on the Senate HELP Committee--as the senior Republican  for 2 years, then 6 years as chairman--the staff grew a lot. Senator  Ted Kennedy used to say that the HELP Committee had about one-third of  the jurisdiction of the Senate. It certainly does a lot of work, and it  needs a lot of talented staff members. During my 8 years as the senior  Republican, the staff helped organize 209 hearings, 752 witnesses,  mostly bipartisan--meaning that I agreed with Senator Harkin first,  then Senator Murray for the last 6 years, on whom the witnesses would  be. We produced 90 bills that have become law.   That is a lot of work--weeks of work by the staff. Securing each  witness often takes a host of conversations with Democratic committee  staff, numerous phone calls with experts.   Every bill that becomes law takes efforts that are hard to comprehend  outside the walls of Congress, from the consultations with constituents  and experts to the drafting of the legislation, to the work with other  members and outside groups, to consulting, to trying to soothe bruised  feelings, to working with other committee members, bring it to the  attention of the majority leader, try to find an opportunity for it to  be on the Senate calendar, then bill support, then remove holes. There  is a lot of work to do in passing a bill and making a law, and staff  does most of the work. Senators do a lot, but they can't do it all.   Here are some of the achievements worth highlighting. I mentioned  many of them yesterday in my farewell address, so I won't go into great  detail about them today; for example, the Every Student Succeeds Act.  This was the bill to fix No Child Left Behind. It affects 50 million  children in 100,000 schools. President Obama called it ``a Christmas  miracle.'' The Wall Street Journal said it was the largest devolution  of power from Washington to the States in 25 years. I will never forget  what, to me, was a truly emotional moment, when every Senator on our  committee--this is from Rand Paul to Elizabeth Warren--voted to  recommend the bill to the Senate. This law was the result of  complicated and nimble work by Peter Oppenheim, Lindsay Fryer, Matt  Stern, and David Cleary.   FAFSA Simplification. Twenty million Americans fill out this  ridiculously complex form for Federal aid for Pell grants and student  loans. You have seen me hold it up on the Senate floor. Everyone agrees  it can be 33 instead of 108 questions. Almost everyone agrees it is the  major obstacle to low-income students getting Federal aid to go to  college because they are intimidated by it. Bob Moran, Lauren Davies,  and Andrew LaCasse have worked hard with Senator Murray's staff. We  have it about half done. We would like to get it across the finish line  before the end of the year.   Head Start. In 2007, we came up with the idea. Sarah Rittling was the  staffer. It was to establish 200 centers of excellence for the Head  Start Program.   Then, in 2005, Katrina came and Rita came, two big hurricanes.  Kristin Bannerman was critical to legislation, where we worked with  Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and Senator Landrieu for voucher funding  to assist with the cost of educating 150,000 public and nonpublic  school students in grades K-12 displaced by the hurricane.   Then, reauthorizing the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.  Education Week said it was ``a watershed moment.'' Staffer Jake Baker  worked on that. Senator Enzi did a lot of the heavy work.   I have been fortunate to have two extraordinary women whom I work  with on the team of staff on the HELP Committee who handle family  health policy: Mary-Sumpter Lapinski and Grace Graham.   Before they started, Melissa Pfaff, Page Kranbuhl, and Marguerite  Salee Kondracke were instrumental in passing the PREEMIE Act in 2003,  getting the bill well written and signed into law, working with the  March of Dimes to help give more babies a chance to live long and  healthy lives.   Once I became senior on the HELP Committee, we began to work on the  21st Century Cures Act. Senator McConnell said it was the most  important law of that Congress. It helps speed medical innovations to  patients in doctors' offices. Margaret Coulter, Andy Vogt, Melissa  Pfaff, Brett Meeks, and others spent countless hours getting ready for  that.   FDA user fees. This showed Grace Graham's ability to be a traffic cop  working with Senator Murray's staff and with House committees. We had a  really fairly seamless effort to take these complicated pieces of law  to collect user fees from drug and device makers and include  significant new provisions to speed those drugs and devices into  doctors' offices.   The most popular bill that never became a law was called Alexander- Murray. I even bought a case of Scotch called Alexander-Murray to give  out to everybody when it passed, but it never was passed. The result of  the immense efforts--the whole goal--was to reduce the cost of  healthcare premiums in the individual insurance market. President Trump  worked well with us on that. Virginia McMillin and Liz Wroe did  countless hours of work, but we couldn't quite get it across the finish  line.   Then, this year, there was the shark tank. With the support of  Senators Blunt and Shelby, we worked together with Francis Collins, of  the National Institutes of Health, to create an initiative of $2.5  billion to produce 50 million more COVID diagnostic tests a month than  current technologies would do. Grace Graham, Melissa Pfaff, and Laura  Friedel on Senator Blunt's staff worked on that.   During all of this, Grace Graham was in her third trimester--not  during all of it. During the latter part of this, she was in her third  trimester. She was working on design policies and being a traffic cop  between here and the House. To date, she and Stash, her husband, have  had their first child, Penn. She is back at work, and the country is  better off for everything that she has contributed.   Our committee leadership positions are often considered the plum  positions, but you can do a whole lot with a talented personal staff.  Ours has put in long hours and has met expectations. For example, on  the Great American Outdoors Act, Anna Newton and Lindsay Garcia did  yeoman's work. This is a bill that good people have literally been  trying to pass since the Eisenhower years. It was the most important  piece of outdoor legislation in that period of time.   With the Music Modernization Act, we worked with Senator Hatch and  his staff. We eventually got 85 cosponsors, but this one nearly ran off  the road several times. Lindsay Garcia and Paul McKernan made sure it  became law.   The America COMPETES Act was back in my early years as a Senator,  when I was very junior, so I got the Republican leader and the  Democratic leader to cosponsor it. It passed with, I think, more than  60 cosponsors to improve our competitive position in the world.   Matt Sonnesyn and David Cleary were the key staffers on that. They  were not just working with staff people around here. For example, with  the America COMPETES Act, the bill wouldn't have passed if it had not  been for 800 outdoor recreation environmental groups outside of  Congress who supported the bill and encouraged Senators to get off  planes and come back here to cast crucial votes. We are grateful for  that. Matt Sonnesyn worked with the Iraq Study Group recommendations  that we made during the George W. Bush years, and Erin Reif and Lucas  DaPieve have been experts on foreign affairs and appropriations.   While I have been chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations, we  [[Page S7202]]  have had 5 straight years in a row--hopefully, we will have 6--of  funding the Office of Science, which supports our 17 National  Laboratories. We have also stepped up funding for all of the inland  waterways, like Chickamauga Lock, and for supercomputing in order to  keep us first in the world. Tom Craig, Tyler Owens, Meyer Seligman, Jen  Armstrong, and Adam DeMella all played key roles in that.   I met every week with what I called my Energy Working Group. I found  the intersection of energy and environment to be, really, the most  fascinating new subject for me during my time as a Senator, and we did  a lot of work on that both on the Committee on Appropriations and with  other Senators. Meeting with that energy policy staff helped to get the  America COMPETES Act passed. It stopped the Road to Nowhere in the  Smokies. It pushed back on the efforts to promote Big Wind on our  mountain ridges, and it resulted in record funding for energy and water  development. Sharon Segner, Jessica Holliday, Conrad Schatte, and  Lindsay Garcia all led those teams.   We spend a lot of time working with staff to get the policy right and  trying to get the message right. You have to be able to persuade at  least half the people that you are right in this business. Words  matter. We spend a lot of time on headlines so that we convey what we  are trying to do. The individuals who have led our communications unit  include Alexia Poe, Harvey Valentine, Lee Pitts, Jim Jeffries, Brian  Reisinger, Margaret Atkinson, Liz Wolgemuth, Ashton Davies, and Taylor  Haulsee.   You can't run an effective office without a good office manager. We  have had the best--Trina Tyrer and Debbie Paul. Misty Marshall came to  us from the White House, where she was the director of correspondence  for Laura Bush.   One of the toughest, most important jobs in the Senate office that  people outside the Senate don't really appreciate as much is the job of  scheduling. It requires constant changes, great discretion, enormous  promptness, and attention to detail. Every day is a mismatch of  meetings and calls. There is no schedule, really, in the U.S. Senate.  You just kind of keep up with what is going on, and you put it down on  a piece of paper. Suddenly, everything can get wiped out by an  emergency call. Bonnie Sansonetti, Sarah Fairchild, and Alicyn York  have been the very best.   The legislative director conducts the office orchestra. I have been  very fortunate that Allison Martin has been our conductor. She used to  work for Bill Frist and Fred Thompson. She is a West Tennessean, but  the whole State is what she cares about as well as the country. If you  were to look for somebody with her skill and talent, you would be  looking for a very long time. David Cleary, Richard Hertling, Matt  Sonnesyn, and David Morgenstern were also legislative directors.   One thing I know is I wouldn't be very good as a chief of staff, so I  needed a very good chief of staff to do some things that I don't do as  well. My first one was Tommy Ingram, whom I have known since 1966 when  he was a Tennessean reporter, and I was working for Howard Baker in his  second campaign. We have been friends ever since. He was my campaign  manager and chief of staff as Governor. He did the same thing. He is  really responsible for much of my success in politics.   David Morgenstern joined my staff in 2005 as legislative director,  and he became chief of staff in 2009.   Matt Sonnesyn came to me from the Harvard Kennedy School of  Government. He was initially a senior policy adviser. He was one of the  few Republican students in the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, so  he was well trained in defending his views.   Ryan Loskarn served as chief of staff starting in 2007.   Then, in my personal office, David Cleary has been the chief for the  past 7 years. You can see him somewhere in an outrageous red and black  suit on the Senate floor. David and I have worked together for almost  15 years. First, he served as staff director for the HELP Subcommittee  on Children and Families. He used to work for John Boehner in the House   In 2014, after becoming the ranking member of the HELP Committee,  David suggested, as I said earlier, that he be both chief of staff and  staff director of the committee. I recounted how, at first, I thought  that was a bad idea, but it was one of the best ideas suggested to me  because it made our staff so much more effective and work so much  better. It was the key to our success, really, and I do not know of a  more effective chief of staff of the Senate than David Cleary. He led  our efforts to fix No Child Left Behind, the 21st Century Cures, the  reauthorizing of Perkins, and the FDA user fees legislation. I  appreciate how much time Marci, his wife, and Maria, their daughter,  have given to our team.   To close, I would like to thank all 270 staff members who have given  time and energy to our office. One of those, Reynard Graham, has been  my administrative right hand for many years. His bigger job is that he  is a minister on the weekends. There isn't time to recognize the  accomplishments of each one by name, but there are many, and I am  grateful to every single individual.   It has been a tremendous gift to work with a skilled and dedicated  staff. Each person who has served in this office should be proud of  what we have accomplished. I have been so fortunate to have been on the  same team with each of you for the last 18 years.   In a farewell address yesterday, I said that I wake up every day  thinking I might be able to do something good for our country and that  I go to bed most nights thinking that I have. It has been a great  privilege to be a U.S. Senator. It has been a great privilege over  these 18 years to work with such an exceptional staff.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the  names of my staff   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          Keith Abraham, Halee Ackerman, Hayley Alexander, Abbey       Allen, Stacy (Cline) Amin, Carrie Apostolou, Sarah Arbes,       Katie Argo, Jen Armstrong, Abby Atkins, Margaret Atkinson,       Jill Bader-Thompson, Jake Baker, Brandon Ball, Aaron       Baluczynski, Andy Banducci, Kristin Bannerman-Herrmann,       Kathryn Bell, Bailee Beshires, Anthony Birch.
