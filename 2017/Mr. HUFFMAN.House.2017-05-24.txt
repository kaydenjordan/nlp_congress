 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this  amendment and to speak against the underlying bill.   Unfortunately, I wasn't serving the House in 2011 when this bill was  first brought to the floor. I was here in 2014, when the bill was  brought up again, twice. I was here, also, in 2016, when it was brought  up twice.   This bill has gone through a number of name changes, but its intent  remains the same, and that is, to allow the irresponsible application  of pesticides into our Nation's waterways. Undermining the Clean Water  Act, as this bill does, means taking the EPA out of the picture,  blocking them from weighing in on pesticides that are  [[Page H4547]]  dumped into rivers, lakes, and streams, without regard to the impacts  of human health, or to those who rely on recreational, commercial, and  Tribal fisheries.   We know, unfortunately, that despite efforts to regulate pesticides  for public health and safety, these dangerous chemicals continue to be  detected in surface and groundwater bodies at dangerous levels. Impacts  to fish and wildlife have been significant, and have already been  devastating in some instances. Oysters, shrimp, sea trout, and  redfish--four of the most important species to food webs, fishermen,  and the economy along the Southeast and Gulf Coasts--have shown effects  ranging from impaired survival skills, to damaged DNA, to death as a  result of exposure to pesticides that have been approved for  agricultural use.   In 2006, USGS released its review on pesticide occurrence and  concentrations in streams and groundwater. According to this report, at  least one pesticide was detected in water from all streams tested  throughout the Nation. In addition, chemicals such as DDT, which has  been banned in the U.S. for decades, were still showing up, found in  fish tissues sampled across watersheds nationwide.   We see a similar situation at the State level. In my State of  California, pesticides are among the top sources of water quality  impairments in the State. 437 waterbodies are impaired by 40 different  categories of pesticides. That is why commercial fishing groups oppose  the underlying bill.   My amendment will ensure that we don't deny either the EPA or a State  their ability to require permits for pesticide use that could have  negative effects on fisheries. Let's make sure that streams and rivers  that support fish are clean. Let's make sure that the fish we catch,  eat, and sell are free from toxic chemicals. America's fisheries are a  backbone of both sport fishing and commercial fishing industries.   The recreational sector alone accounts for more than $115 billion of  our country's economy, and it employs more than 828,000 people. My  amendment would protect these recreational activities, not only for  current generations but for future generations of anglers to come.   By accidentally contaminating our waterways, pesticides also  exacerbate the precarious status of endangered and threatened species.  In 1996, the death of over 90,000 steelhead fish, 100 coho salmon, and  thousands of nongame fish resulted from an herbicide called acrolein  that entered the waterways in Bear Creek, Oregon. Many wild salmon  stocks are now on the brink of extinction on the West Coast, and losses  in such sensitive populations make recovery efforts increasingly  difficult.   Pesticides can pose a dangerous threat to commercial fisheries. In  1999, a massive lobster die-off devastated the lives and livelihoods of  Connecticut and New York lobstermen along the Long Island Sound,  producing a multimillion-dollar settlement with pesticide manufacturers  mishandling the chemical malathion.   Similar concern has brought forth proposals to regulate methoprene  and resmethrin in Maine in order to protect their commercial fishery,  which is worth over $700 million.   Mr. Chair, I have letters of support here for my amendment from the  American Sportfishing Association, Trout Unlimited, the Columbia River  Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, the Karuk Tribe, the Winnemem Wintu  Tribe, the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations,  Seafood Harvesters of America, and other organizations who are very  interested in this amendment, and support it.                                                       May 24, 2017.        Dear Representative: As the House considers H.R. 953, the       Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017, we the undersigned       groups representing millions of hunters and anglers across       the nation, urge you to ensure that H.R. 953 does not       negatively impact water quality, fish health and the       recreational fishing industry by supporting Amendment #3,       sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman.        The Huffman Amendment protects fisheries and water quality       by ensuring any pesticide spraying into or over waterways       that would negatively impact our nation's fisheries is       properly monitored and permitted. The 47 million sportsmen       and women that hunt and fish each year depend on strong Clean       Water Act protections to ensure thriving fish populations       that are safe to eat and the Huffman amendment would ensure       it continues to do so.        America's hunters and anglers contribute more than $200       billion to America's economy each year and this robust       outdoor economy depends on healthy rivers, lakes, and       streams. Nearly 2,000 waterways in the United States are       known to be impaired because of pesticides, and, even at low       levels, pesticides pose a particularly concerning threat to       fish and wildlife populations. Without protective federal       safeguards in place to regulate pesticides applied to our       waterways, sportsmen and women will have access to fewer       quality hunting and fishing opportunities.        On behalf of our millions of members and conservation-      minded hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts, we urge       you to support this common-sense measure to safeguard our       water resources and outdoor heritage and support the Huffman       amendment.            Sincerely,      Benjamin Bulis,        AFFTA President, American Fly Fishing Trade Association.      John W. Gale,        Conservation Director, Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.      Adam Kolton,        Vice President, National Advocacy, National Wildlife       Federation.      Steve Moyer,        Vice President, Government Affairs, Trout Unlimited.                                   ____       House of Representatives, May 23, 2017.      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of thousands of tribal,       commercial, and recreational fishermen who depend on healthy       fisheries for their subsistence, traditional cultural       practices, businesses, and recreational enjoyment, we write       to urge you to vote YES on the Huffman amendment to H.R. 953.       The amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water       Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) permitting requirements for       point source polluters remain in place when science clearly       indicates they are needed to protect fisheries.        Under Sec. 402 of the FWPCA, the Administrator of the EPA       may issue permits for point source discharges of approved       pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into navigable waters,       which are also inhabited by many important and valuable fish       species that are worth billions of dollars to fishermen and       anglers each year. H.R. 953 would eliminate the EPA's       permitting authority for approved pesticides, herbicides, and       fungicides discharged into navigable waters. Many of these       chemicals, despite their approval for agricultural use, are       known to be seriously harmful to iconic fish species       including salmon and trout, jeopardizing their survival and       posing a risk to the food supply.        Congressman Huffman's amendment to H.R. 953 would simply       leave EPA permitting requirements in place for the dumping of       pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and       rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to       fisheries. We ask that you support this amendment in order to       keep America's fisheries and strong fishing traditions alive,       safe, and prosperous. If you have any questions, please call       Noah Oppenheim, Executive Director of the Pacific Coast       Federation of Fishermen's Associations.            Sincerely,          Noah Oppenheim, Executive Director, Pacific Coast             Federation of Fishermen's Associations; Leaf Hillman,             Director, Department of Natural Resources, Karuk Tribe;             Caleen Sisk, Chief, Winnemem Wintu Tribe; Robert             Vandermark, Executive Director, Marine Fish             Conservation Network; Kevin Wheeler, Executive             Director, Seafood Harvesters of America; Roger Thomas,             President, Golden Gate Salmon Association; Bob Rees,             Executive Director, Association of Northwest             Steelheaders; Linda Behnken, Executive Director, Alaska             Longline Fishermen's Association; Grant Putnam,             President, Northwest Guides and Anglers Association;             Benjamin Bulis, President, American Fly Fishing Trade             Association; Lyf Gildersleeve, Owner, Flying Fish             Company; Kevin Scribner, Chief Executive Officer,             Forever Wild Seafood; Cynthia Sarthou, Executive             Director, Gulf Restoration Network.                                   ____                                         Columbia River Inter-Tribal                                                 Fish Commission,                                         Portland, OR, May 23, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader of the House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: On behalf       of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC)       and our member tribes--the Confederated Tribes of the       Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the       Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, the Confederated Tribes       and Bands of the Yakama Nation, and the Nez Perce Tribe, I  [[Page H4548]]       would like to share our support for the amendment offered by       Mr. Huffman to H.R. 953--Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of       2017. The amendment specifically preserves the ability of the       EPA Administrator or a State to require permits necessary to       protect fisheries including Tribal treaty fisheries from       harmful discharges of FIFRA approved pesticides.        Tribal members are justifiably concerned about the impact       of water quality on the natural resources of the Columbia       River system. Our member tribes' right to abundant, healthful       fish is guaranteed by the 1855 treaties with the United       States. A century's worth of federal court decisions has       established beyond dispute that these treaty fishing rights       are permanent in nature, and that they secure for the tribes       the right to take all species of fish found throughout their       reserved fishing areas for subsistence, ceremonial and       commercial purposes. Tribal treaties are the supreme law of       the land, and federal agencies and States must interpret       designated uses to include subsistence fishing and must       protect fishable waters. Pesticides can wreak havoc on the       health of the habitat and associated food webs that support       our fisheries. They can disrupt water quality conditions and       the availability of natural riparian and aquatic vegetation       cover as well as the abundance of aquatic invertebrates and       fishes that support the growth and maturation of salmonid       species. Our tribes recognize that the health and future of       our tribal fisheries require clean, cold water that is free       of contaminants.        Regulations should be efficient, just, and effective, and       necessarily must provide the EPA and States with the       authority to protect the unique habitat and food web system       that is essential to the health of our tribal fisheries.       Thank you for your consideration of these comments. If you       have any further questions please contact me or Dianne       Barton, PhD.            Sincerely,                                                  Jaime A. Pinkham,      CRITFC Executive Director.                                   ____                                               American Sportfishing                                                     Association,                                       Alexandria, VA, May 23, 2017.      Hon. Jared Huffman,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Huffman: On behalf of the nation's       recreational fishing industry, the American Sportfishing       Association (ASA) would like to be on record as supporting       your amendment to H.R. 953. This amendment leaves EPA       permitting requirements in place for the dumping of       pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides into our streams and       rivers when they are known to pose a significant risk to       fisheries.        America's fisheries are an economic powerhouse and the       backbone of the sportfishing and commercial fishing       industries. America's recreational anglers generate more than       $48 billion in retail sales with a $115 billion impact on the       nation's economy; creating employment for more than 828,000       people.        Our industry depends on clean water for continued healthy       and abundant fisheries. There are certain chemicals used for       various on-land industry operations that are known to be       incredibly harmful to fish development and survival when       released into waterways. The Administrator of the EPA       currently enforces permitting requirements for the disposal       of these chemicals into our streams and rivers. Your       amendment would ensure that existing Federal Water Pollution       Control Act permitting requirements for point-source       polluters (Sec. 402) remain in place when science indicates       they are needed to conserve fisheries.        ``The Huffman amendment'' is needed because the original       legislation, H.R. 953, would eliminate this permitting       authority for all approved pesticides, herbicides, and       fungicides discharged into streams and rivers; even when they       are known to pose a significant risk to fisheries.        We appreciate your leadership and understanding of the       importance of clean water to fishing and the outdoor       recreational economy.            Sincerely,                                                       Scott Gudes,                              Vice President of Government Affairs.     Mr. Chairman, I prefer butter on my lobster rolls, not  toxic pesticides. Let's make sure that States maintain their authority  to prudently protect their economies and public health from pesticide  impacts.   I urge an ``aye'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just want to point out that some States may  want to put their efforts into protecting water quality and the health  of their fisheries and their ecosystems, rather than just carpet- bombing waterways with pesticides.   This amendment says, those States have the authority to do that if  they choose to.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Napolitano), the ranking member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
