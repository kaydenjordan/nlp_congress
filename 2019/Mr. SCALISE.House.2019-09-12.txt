 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the  schedule for the week to come.    Mr. Speaker, as it relates to the funding of government,  I know that it is important that as we finally got an agreement a few  months ago to come up with a 2-year budget process where we agreed on  numbers of funding, especially for the Defense Department which needs  that certainty, they don't want these short-term CRs. They need the  long-term certainty so they can go out and acquire the kind of  equipment we need to keep our men and women in uniform safe to  effectively do their jobs in a safe manner.   One of the things I would point out, as the gentleman talked about  the Senate process, let's be clear that the House bills that were  passed out moved on a very partisan basis. There were no bipartisan  agreements as you passed the bills out of the House.   The Senate does work differently. The Senate has to have a 60-vote  margin to get any bills moved, so they have been in negotiations to try  to get, not a partisan agreement but a bipartisan agreement, and,  unfortunately, so far, they have had a lot of problems with some of the  Senate Democrats who try to put poison pills in those budget talks that  would ultimately not yield something that can get signed into law and  would not comply with the 2-year budget agreement that we reached.   So I would encourage both on our side, there should have been a  bipartisan agreement on the bills that are moved through, and at least  there are some talks going on, but they haven't resulted in bipartisan  legislation that can get signed by the President.   The Senate needs to do the same thing. And so we are beyond the time  for partisan differences. Now is the time where we need to come  together and agree on those things that we can put in a bill that can  get signed into law. Drop this idea of these poison pills that  everybody knows will gum up the works. Let's get the certainty that we  deserve for a full budget process for the year.   We are not there yet. If we have to do a short-term budget agreement  or short-term CR, then that is one thing that we may consider next  week. We haven't seen the final details, of course. It would have to be  clean with no poison pills attached to it. But, hopefully, that yields  talks that are truly bipartisan, which we haven't, unfortunately, seen  to this point.   So I would hope that we can get beyond that next week. It gives us  more time to have real negotiations that can result in something that  can get signed into law and give certainty to our men and women in  uniform and all of the other agencies that rely on us doing that work  on a bipartisan basis.   I would like to shift gears and ask the gentleman about the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA. I yield to the gentleman if he  has something to add to that.    Mr. Speaker, there were a number of items that my friend  brought up. I will start with the government shutdown that the  gentleman referred to last year. When we were in the majority last  year, we passed bipartisan bills to fund over 70 percent of the  government prior to October 1--no shutdown--more than 70 percent of the  government that we worked with Democrats and President Trump to get an  agreement on, including defense, so our men and women in uniform did  not have that uncertainty and had that full year of funding. All of  that was worked out.   Clearly, we had a difference of agreement over the Homeland Security  Department because of funding for border security. The government  shutdown was clearly over whether or not we were going to have a secure  border and all the things that were involved, including physical  barriers. We resolved it, and the President was able to get over $4.5  billion of new money to continue putting that physical security in  place to secure our Nation's border. That took a few more months, but  we resolved it.    Keep in mind, over 70 percent of the government was fully funded  prior to the end of the fiscal year, working with Republicans and  Democrats in the House and Senate.   As the gentleman brags about passing over 96 percent of the bills out  of the House, it has to be noted that the majority didn't work with  Republicans to do it. The easy thing is just to say that we will just  talk amongst ourselves, knowing it will never get signed into law. Of  course, a partisan bill is not going to get signed into law when you  have a President of the different party or when you have a Senate  controlled by a different party.   The Senate works differently than us. We can have that debate for  another day. We would probably both agree on a lot of the differences  we have with how the Senate operates. But because of their 60-vote  requirement, they know nothing is going to pass unless they have  Republican and Democratic agreement in those negotiations.   Let's be clear about what is bottling up those negotiations. There  are Senate Democrats in Democratic leadership on the Democratic side  who are offering up things that everybody knows are poison pills that  would not get signed into law.   They are at an impasse. They need to break that impasse. That is  their issue. But, Mr. Speaker, you can talk to some of the Senate  Democrats who are trying to offer up things that everybody knows will  not happen or become law or pass over there, but both sides need to  come together.   Mr. Speaker, when you pass an NDAA bill--and the gentleman from  Maryland knows this. The National Defense Authorization Act is a bill  that a Republican-controlled House or a Democratic-controlled House, no  matter who has been in charge, we have come together always. Every  single year that we have moved an NDAA, it has been bipartisan. This is  the first year that the majority broke from that.   The majority passed a partisan bill on defense knowing it was never  going to become law but not working with Democrats and breaking the  tradition that every year we have followed, that Republicans and  Democrats would come together and say that we have all of these other  differences--and there are a lot of differences that we have that we  need to work through. We might get some; we might not get others. But  we put defense on the side and said that this is one where we will come  together, Republicans and Democrats in every year we did it, including  last year when we were in the majority.   This year, the majority did not. They broke that tradition. It is  unfortunate because, again, that will never become law.   My friend can brag they got it done, but they got something done that  will never get signed into law and broke a tradition that we have  always had that that bill was bipartisan, making sure that we work  together to take care of our men and women in uniform in a way that  they deserve and in a timely way.   I would hope that we would get those things done before October 1.  But we all know what came out of this House is not what is going to be  a final product.   Let's work better to get these addressed, working with Members of  both parties and the President, who, by the way, did agree with us on  the numbers. We are in agreement. The House, the Senate, and the White  House have finally agreed on the numbers.   Now it is up to us in the Congress to come to an agreement. It is not  just, hey, we passed our bill with just members of our party. It is  going to have to mean people work together through those differences as  we have done in the past.   Sometimes we disagreed. Seventy percent of government was funded last  year prior to October 1. Ultimately, we got agreement on the rest.   Does the gentleman have anything else to say on that before I move  on?    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, let's be clear on the funding of  government. From last year, we did fund over 70 percent of the  government, and we didn't play a partisan game with our Nation's  defense.   This bill, the NDAA, you can talk about what both sides should do.    Let me make this point, because you have made some  points that aren't completely accurate.   The number we agreed upon--but if you say, Okay, we agree on a  certain spending level, that is one part of the debate. But you then go  put policies in the bill at that level that undermine, not only our  beliefs of what is best for national defense, but what the President  needs to do to be able to do his job to secure our border. You did that  in the bill knowing that that would make it partisan. It was a  bipartisan bill, and then you added provisions, like things that would  undermine the ability to secure America's border in that bill knowing  it was partisan.   If you took that out, you knew it would have been a bipartisan bill,  but you left it in. And that is a pattern we have seen from Speaker  Pelosi's majority this year.   We had a bill in the Committee on Energy and Commerce to lower drug  prices--a major problem in this country. Republicans and Democrats  worked for months and came up with a bill in the committee of  jurisdiction to solve the problem and lower drug prices.   And you know what happened? It was a unanimous vote--unanimous vote.   People looking at Congress going, Wow, here in the year 2019, on a  major issue like lowering drug prices, Republicans and Democrats came  together and figured out a way to lower drug prices, and the vote was  unanimous.   You would figure we would put that on suspension the next day to pass  it out, so we could get it signed by the President as soon as possible  and lower drug prices as soon as possible.   And you know what happened? It just happened a few months ago. As  that bill came out of committee unanimously to lower drug prices, the  Speaker made a decision that she was going to put a poison pill in it-- after it came out of committee, before it was voted on on the House  floor--knowing what that would do.   And it immediately became a partisan bill because you put something  in that you knew was not going to get Republican support. And so the  bill passed out of the House. And you can brag you passed it, but it is  not going to go anywhere.   It will not become law, but we had a bill that was unanimous out of  committee to lower drug prices. It would be signed into law today if  you wouldn't have done that. But you wanted to play political games,  and it has happened over and over.   And so you can talk about what you passed, but when there was a bill  that was unanimous out of the committee of jurisdiction, where doctors,  people in the healthcare professions, people in business, people on  both sides of the aisle that know this issue figured out a way to put  all of their differences aside and pass a bill to lower drug prices,  you had to make that partisan after it came out of committee  unanimously.   That is what has been done over and over that undermines the ability  for us to get our job done. We could have gotten that done. It could be  signed by the President today, and we could all hail that as a major  accomplishment.   That is just one example, and it is happened over and over again, and  it shouldn't happen that way.   So, yes, we need to move this process along, but we move it along by  working together. Defense could have been done in a bipartisan way. The  things that were added in that you knew would make it partisan  shouldn't have been put in that bill. It had never happened that way  before, ever.   We had always passed a bipartisan NDAA bill through the House, and  this is the first year that didn't happen. Drug pricing could be  solved, but it hasn't happened yet. It should happen. I hope we get it  done, but it should have been done in a partisan way when the committee  figured out a way to do it unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I would hope those Senators on both sides  of the aisle, as they are having negotiations--and, yeah, they don't  have a bill, but they are negotiating. And there are Senators that know  that some of the provisions they are insisting upon are things that  will not become law because they undermine our Nation's security. And  yet, they keep insisting. And so they are not at an agreement, but they  need to keep working just like we need to work in a bipartisan way on  those issues. And they will get resolved if we do that.   And, again, I think if you go look at the example of what the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce did on lowering drug prices, it is a  great model to follow.   That bill should have been brought to the floor. That bill should not  have been changed by the Speaker at the last minute to become partisan,  and now it is not law.   I would like to move on to something that has been troubling that we  have been seeing out of the Committee on the Judiciary, and that is  this drumbeat towards impeachment. It seems like there is an  infatuation by this majority to impeach the President of the United  States, whether or not the facts are there. And so there was the  Mueller report that went on for years.   And all of these members--chairs of your own committees--saying there  was evidence that they had, and it was going to show the President  colluded here and there. And then it turned out to be false; there was  no collusion.   We know that. The report showed that. Russia tried to interfere with  our elections when Barack Obama was President. Maybe they should be  investigating why he didn't do more to stop the Russians from trying to  interfere with our elections, but there was no collusion.   So instead of saying, Okay, that is it, move on--as the American  people would like to see us do--maybe that committee that has  jurisdiction over the border, over immigration law, that has serious  problems that should be worked out in a bipartisan way, and could be  worked out in a bipartisan way, but it is not, because the committee of  jurisdiction is infatuated with impeaching the President.   In fact, the chairman of the committee just said today: This is  formal  [[Page H7694]]  impeachment proceedings. The chairman of the committee said that today,  as they are having a hearing on impeaching the President without even  evidence to impeach him. There is nothing to impeach him on. They have  Articles of Impeachment drawn up with blanks that they are just looking  around to fill in on this witch hunt, and they are just going to look  and look and look.   Imagine if somebody said, We are going to target a person and we are  going to try to indict him. We don't have anything to indict him on,  but we are going to write up an indictment and then look around and  look around and hope to find something.   And that is what is going on in the Committee on the Judiciary. So  they had this hearing today. They changed the rules. They had this big  drama. The media is all covering it. The chairman says: This is formal  impeachment proceedings.   And then you look at the rules that they brought forward. The rules  that they brought forward allow the chairman to do things he can  already do. It was a farce. It was a farce to try to appease the  radical left base that wants to impeach the President, even though  there is nothing to impeach him on. And instead of just giving it up  and focusing on their job, the things they should be focused on, they  are just going to keep meandering around on this witch hunt.   And I know some in your majority--maybe even the majority leader  himself--are trying to distance themselves from it because they know  the American people think that it is lunacy to be wasting time trying  to impeach the President, even though there is nothing to impeach him  on and just driving around on a witch hunt.   And so I guess the real question is, if the chairman of the  committee--your chairman--today, said: This is formal impeachment  proceedings. He talked about, hopefully, by the end of the year they  will vote on Articles of Impeachment--``hopefully,'' by the end of the  year.   There is nothing to impeach him on, and yet they are going to  actually go out on a witch hunt and say, We are going to look for  something, and by the end of the year, we hope to impeach the  President.   So I would ask the gentleman: Are you all bringing Articles of  Impeachment to the floor? Is the chairman rightly going down an  impeachment road? And what exactly are those articles?   What are the Articles of Impeachment, if the committee today--your  chairman of your committee--said: This is formal impeachment  proceedings? What exactly is the gentleman planning on impeaching the  President of the United States on? And are you, if he brings those  Articles of Impeachment out of committee--blanks that haven't even been  filled in--if they bring them to the floor, or if they move them out of  committee by the end of the year, as the chairman hopes, is the  gentleman prepared to bring that to the floor of the United States  House of Representatives?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, but I don't think  the question has been answered. Because the gentleman says the  committee has a responsibility, and I agree. But the committee has a  responsibility to be responsible, and it is highly irresponsible. It is  reckless and dangerous for the committee to start impeachment  proceedings when there is nothing to impeach the President on.   We were in the majority when the President of the United States was  somebody we had a lot of disagreements with. We never filed Articles of  Impeachment or talked about impeaching the President because there was  nothing to impeach the President on. We never did that.   We might have disagreed with them on a lot of things, but there were  no committee hearings where the chairman said: This is formal  impeachment proceedings, with nothing to impeach the President on.   If he does something years down the road when he gets reelected, you  know, this is not the time to go and try to harass the President when  there is nothing that you have found--and you have looked. There has  been this witch hunt going on for years.   It didn't yield what you were hoping for it to yield. We all should  have applauded when the Mueller report said that there was no  collusion. But instead of closing it out, there is still--I guess he  says, by the end of the year he wants to move Articles of Impeachment.  So I guess that means they have drafted it up and are hoping to find  something to fill in the blanks.   But that is irresponsible of that committee to be moving down a  course of impeachment when there is nothing to impeach the President  on, and especially, when there is so much other work that needs to be  done by that committee.   We have a border that is out of control right now; thousands of  people coming across every day. Good thing the President of the United  States has actually worked in agreement with Mexico. The President was  able to achieve that recently, where the Mexican President said that he  is going to start putting thousands of troops at the Mexican southern  border.   And you know what? It is starting to yield results. But we still have  human trafficking coming across our border. We still have drugs coming  across our border. And there has been requests made to get more funding  to secure that border, to put technology in place, to put other tools  in place so that our border patrol agents can do their job securing  America's border. And that is the committee of jurisdiction, and they  are not bringing bills out of committee to solve that.   They are filing Articles of Impeachment or hoping to move Articles of  Impeachment in the next 3 months. And there is not even anything filled  in, because there is nothing the President has done to be impeached  upon.   This is a serious responsibility the committee has, and, yet, they  are acting in such a reckless fashion such to appease the radical left  base, who wants to impeach the President, even though there is nothing  to impeach him on.   But everybody else in America says, Do your job and focus on the  things that are in front of you and drop this daily harassment and  drumbeat of impeachment and witch hunts.                                time  1245    It is time to move on and do the work of the committee instead of  focusing on impeaching a President, even though there is nothing to  impeach him on.   If there is something, show us what it is. But to recklessly say in  an open hearing that they are going to impeach the President and move  Articles of Impeachment to this House floor by the end of this year, on  what?   This has to end. We have to focus on the things that need to be fixed  by that committee and this Congress and drop this witch hunt.   Look, at some point, the other side is going to have to figure out  which way they want to go because some people in the gentleman's  radical base might want to impeach no matter what, but everybody else  knows it is the wrong thing to do. Everybody else knows it is  irresponsible for that committee to act that way.   I would hope that y'all would make the right decision and say that  you are  [[Page H7695]]  going to move forward on the things that need to be addressed by the  committee. If there is something that comes up, sure, they go look at  it, but there is not anything. If there was, they would have filed it  already. But to say they are going to file it even if there is nothing,  that is dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, if you talk about Benghazi, there are a lot  of serious questions that have not been answered yet.    Eight hearings, and maybe more should have been had, to  investigate why those deaths happened that should not have happened.    It shouldn't have happened. It should have been stopped.    It was unwarranted, what happened there. Fast and  Furious, a lot of questions raised.   There were multiple times when the President took action where,  ultimately, he was found to be out of compliance with the law, where  courts reversed what the President did. We never moved Articles of  Impeachment for that. That doesn't warrant high crimes and  misdemeanors.   Surely, we investigated those things, and in most cases, it turned  out we were right.   With Benghazi, those questions still haven't been answered, about why  they died and shouldn't have, because everybody knew the dangers.    Found nothing there?    Found out that Americans died when it was known that it  was dangerous where they were. Why weren't planes circled? You could  have flown jets over there in 15 minutes to scare away the people who  were attacking that Embassy and killing Americans.   We looked into it, and it raised a lot of questions.    Maybe it should have been more to look into why those  Americans died so that it doesn't happen again. Things like that, which  shouldn't have happened, we should find out what went wrong. Why did  people miss telltale signs and let those people die who shouldn't have  died?   Yes, those hearings were warranted, but we never filed Articles of  Impeachment. We never said we were going to move to impeach so now  let's go figure something out, see if we can find something, and even  if we don't find something, we are still going to do it.    That is reckless. They took an oath, absolutely, like all of us, to  uphold this Constitution and protect this country.   We have a border that is not secure. We have thousands of people  coming over every single day, including people who are bringing drugs,  trafficking humans, young kids who are being abused. We all know what  is happening.   That is the committee of jurisdiction, and they are ignoring it. They  haven't produced a single bill to go and solve that problem.   Are they okay with what is going on at the border? They don't think  that legislation is warranted to address it, to close the asylum  loopholes that everybody knows are a magnet that is bringing people  over here illegally, coming through other countries that are offering  them asylum to come here illegally? But we don't want to fix that  problem because the committee is focused on impeachment.   We will see what they do. But the American people are watching, too,  and the American people are tired of those kinds of games--every single  day, focusing their energies and taxpayer dollars on attacking the  President, on attacking his family, on attacking his Cabinet members  and people who did business deals with him 20 years ago who are getting  subpoenaed and who have nothing to do with his Presidency just because  they want to harass the President because they don't like the fact that  he was duly elected in 2016.   The American people did duly elect him President, and he is doing his  job. He is carrying out his mission despite all that.   Shame on that committee for continuing to abuse their power by going  after something whether it is there or not. Every prosecutor knows you  don't try to go find something on somebody. You should follow the  facts. If the facts lead you to a dead end, then you end. You don't  keep looking. It is not there.   They want to keep doing it and abusing their power. But there is  accountability that happens, too. That is why we have elections.   If that is what the committee wants to do, and if that is what the  leadership of this House Democratic Caucus wants to do, people are  watching.   I want to talk about one final thing, and that is USMCA, an  opportunity for us to get something big done for this country.   I had a meeting yesterday with Ambassador Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade  Representative, who I know has been meeting with Speaker Pelosi and her  team. In fact, a few weeks ago, the Speaker, through her trade working  group on USMCA, sent a letter to Ambassador Lighthizer, identifying  some areas that they would like addressed in the USMCA trade agreement.   I understand that, last night, Ambassador Lighthizer sent a reply,  including things that he has worked with the Democratic majority on, to  try to address some of those issues and ultimately get this done.   I say this in the most sincere way: I really do think USMCA is  something that we can do together, that we can get an agreement with  our friends from the north and south. Canada and Mexico have both come  to the table and agreed to make NAFTA work better for American workers,  for American industries, for our dairy farmers that can't sell their  products into Canada right now that will be able to have better open  markets, better working conditions.  [[Page H7696]]    Clearly, we want to make sure there is enforcement, and I know that  is being worked through, to put belt and suspenders.   At the end of the day, every day we wait means more jobs we are  missing out on creating for our economy. I know that there is still the  opportunity to get this done, maybe in the next few weeks.   We have a whip team that has been put in place specifically for  USMCA. I know there are a lot of Democrats that have been working with  Ambassador Lighthizer as well, to try to get this done.   I would ask the gentleman if he has any idea of where that process is  on his side, if there is any idea of a timeline to finally bring this  to the floor, pass this important agreement that would send a message  not only to our friends from the north and south, Canada and Mexico,  but to our friends all around the world, to Japan and other countries  that want to get trade agreements with America but this is holding back  because they want to see if this can get done.   Then, ultimately, let's shift our focus to China and all the  countries around the world that want China to have to comply with the  rules that everybody else has to comply with, to finally get these  tariff fights over so we can have an even stronger economy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I share the gentleman from Maryland's  optimism about the ability to get there, to get this done, to get to  ``yes.'' And with the provisions that are already in place on  enforcement, if there is a way to make them stronger, I know that that  is something that Ambassador Lighthizer has been working with the  gentleman's team on.   That is why, while the letter was sent 6 weeks ago, Ambassador  Lighthizer started going to work right away, sitting down with folks on  both sides, including Democratic leadership in the House, to address  those as best as both sides could get agreement; and that is where the  letter, I think, finally lays out the remedies to those issues that  were brought up.   It is my hope that, as that is reviewed, we get to a place where we  can find agreement and then get it passed. Mexico has already passed  it. Canada is waiting on us. And I think we would send a strong signal  to the world that, not only is America the best place to do business,  with the strongest economy in the world, but we are also able to reach  better trade deals, both for Americans and for our friends. Then there  are a lot more folks in line waiting for us to be a part of those kind  of deals, too.   So I look forward to the ability to keep working on that. I would  love the ability to work with the gentleman as the Republican whip, the  leader, laying out a floor schedule for when that comes, and we can  celebrate something big for this country and the workers of America.   I thank the gentleman for his work and for this discourse, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
