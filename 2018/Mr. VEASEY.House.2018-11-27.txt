 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4254, the Women in Aerospace  Education Act. I want to thank Mr. Knight and Ms. Esty for introducing  this very important piece of legislation.   Women continue to be underrepresented in the aerospace sector. For  example, a 2016 analysis revealed that over the past 15 years, women  have made up, on average, just 15 percent of NASA's planetary mission  science teams.                                time  1615    While there has been increasing interest in supporting women's  advancement in all STEM fields, particularly on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, the low representation of women on NASA's  planetary science mission teams has remained largely unchanged. I am  heartened by recent efforts at NASA to tackle the issue of diversity on  its planetary science mission teams.   The 2016 New Frontiers 4 call for proposals included new language  highlighting the benefits of diverse and inclusive mission teams. I was  pleased to see that one of the finalists for this competition, the  Dragonfly mission to Saturn's moon Titan, is led by a woman.   Additionally, one of the two missions selected in 2017 for NASA's  Discovery Program, the Psyche mission to a metallic asteroid, is also  led by a woman. The principal investigator of the Psyche mission, Dr.  Lindy Elkins-Tanton, is now the second woman to lead a competitive  planetary science mission for NASA.   Yesterday's successful landing of NASA's InSight spacecraft on the  surface of Mars offers another reason to feel optimistic. The team of  scientists and engineers that made the groundbreaking landing possible  included 135 women, or about 25 percent of the team. To build on this  progress, H.R. 4254 addresses the challenges in recruiting and  retaining talented women in aerospace by directing NASA to promote  internship and fellowship opportunities to women. The bill also directs  NSF to include research experiences at National Laboratories and NASA  centers in the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.   Research has shown that the best teams are those in which good ideas  are heard. Gender diversity on NASA's planetary science missions and in  the aerospace sector more broadly will lead to more diverse questions  and approaches to solutions. To get the best science, we need more  women in aerospace, and H.R. 4254 will help to get us there.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members to support H.R. 4254, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 1768 to reauthorize the  National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.   I want to thank Senators Feinstein and Murkowski for developing this  good legislation. I also would like to thank my colleagues,  Representatives Rohrabacher and Jayapal, for introducing a House  companion, and the chairs and ranking members of the authorizing  committees for working to arrive at the consensus legislation we are  considering today.   The years 1964 and 1994 mark two of the worst earthquakes in U.S.  history. Hundreds of people lost their lives, and thousands sustained  injuries in these earthquakes that hit Alaska and the Northridge  neighborhood of Los Angeles.   Economic losses were in the billions of dollars resulting from  earthquakes and tsunamis. While our Nation has been in the path of many  disastrous natural events lately, we have been spared from a big  earthquake for many years. But we should not become complacent, because  another big earthquake will happen, and the human and economic toll  will be felt far beyond the immediate disaster zone.   S. 1768 makes Federal investments in research and preparedness  activities that will help mitigate earthquake risks for Americans from  coast to coast. Specifically, S. 1768 reauthorizes funding for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science  Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to continue to carry out research and other  activities under the NEHRP program.   Under NEHRP, NSF and USGS carry out fundamental research in the earth  sciences. Both agencies have extensive networks of instrumentation that  record seismic activity and advance our understanding of the onset,  propagation, and intensity of earthquakes. Such research helps advance  our early-warning capability and helps communities make informed  decisions for earthquake preparation.   NIST is the lead agency for NEHRP and also carries out applied  research that provides the scientific basis for earthquake resilient  building codes and design guidelines. This bill aims to help  communities survive a catastrophic event and continue with critical  operations, such as emergency services, utilities, and communication  networks.   FEMA provides earthquake training and awareness to States and  territories and assists communities in creating seismic mitigation  plans in the event of a high-impact earthquake. These activities are  invaluable in preparing communities for an earthquake and its  aftermath.   The last NEHRP reauthorization was nearly 15 years ago, and the  authorizing law needs several updates to ensure it is keeping pace with  the state of the science on earthquakes and translating that science  into saving lives and property.   The bill before us today includes those much-needed updates and,  importantly, provides NEHRP agencies with the needed authority to  continue these investments with greater budgetary certainty for the  next 5 years.   I appreciate my colleagues working on this bill in a bipartisan  fashion in the House and Senate, and I urge support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
