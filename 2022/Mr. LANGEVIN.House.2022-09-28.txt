 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans are  divided. Our public discourse is broken. Instead of fostering open and  honest political debate, our flawed information environment creates  echo chambers and partisan silos.   At times, it feels like the very fabric of our Nation is being torn  at the seams. This toxic polarization has infected the Capitol, too,  where it is becoming increasingly difficult to get things done in a  bipartisan manner.   The nonstop outrage and anger must end.   To begin solving some of these issues, I propose an idea, which I  developed in partnership with my former science and technology policy  adviser, Eric Saund, a phenomenal cognitive science and artificial  intelligence researcher. Together, we call for redesigning what is  popularly described as the ``marketplace of ideas.''   As economists point out, markets are information systems. The  invisible hand of supply and demand discovers the value of goods and  services, and the equal access to information in a market yields  collective efficiency.   Now, imagine a market where suppliers or, in this case, speakers of  ideas hawk their wares in a public square, while consumers, or  listeners, sample and choose the news, stories, and opinions they  prefer. The best ideas would win by virtue of the audience's  discernment and collective wisdom, right?   But what if the market's information architecture, the modes and  pathways of information exchange and processing, is fundamentally  broken? Just like a market wouldn't function properly if the vendors'  loudspeakers and telephones were damaged, the algorithms, programmatic  methods, and platform designs that govern our marketplace of ideas are  clearly not working. When a market is broken, it is the responsibility  of government to act.   How do we fix it? We start by leveling the playing field and  modifying the shape, not the content, of our ideas marketplace to  facilitate healthy exposure and competition among all ideas within our  political discourse.   As it currently stands, our marketplace has been distorted to  resemble a dome-like shape in which discourse is driven to the extremes  of each side. Instead, we propose bending the dome shape of  our marketplace into a bowl shape, encouraging people to seek common  ground and creating space for productive conversation among ideological  foes and compatriots alike.    By leveling the playing field through tweaks to both the supply and  demand side, we can create a marketplace of ideas where fairness and  civility are rewarded and extremism is discouraged.   On the demand side, we can invest in civics education initiatives  that teach children critical reading, listening, and thinking skills,  like how to spot disinformation on social media. Adults, too, can lose  awareness of how their buttons are being pushed by sophisticated  propagandists.   As our Founders recognized, our democracy requires an educated  citizenry. However, the demands of our modern media environment require  our education system to grow and adapt accordingly.   We could borrow from the playbooks of other countries, like Finland  and the Baltic states, which have developed robust civil defenses  against insidious disinformation campaigns emanating from neighboring  Russia. We can even motivate public awareness and engagement through  playful, competitive, and financial incentives to reward people for  knowing basic civics and following factual, unbiased news and  information sources. We should encourage participation in nonpolitical  areas of life, such as sports, hobbies, recreation, civics projects,  and family activities, to reinforce the common bonds between us.   Solutions arise on the supply side, as well. In a traditional public  square, each speaker's identity is known and thereby can be held  accountable for their speech. But on social media, phony accounts and  troll farms can spread lies, disinformation, and distorted narratives  without consequence. A solution may be found in modern technologies for  digital identity tools, which can ensure that every social media  account is held by a unique, real human being.   Congressman Bill Foster's Improving Digital Identity Act of 2021, of  which I am a proud cosponsor, advances associated frameworks and  standards and promotes the adoption of privacy-preserving digital  identity technologies.   This is a complicated issue, but I think it is worth giving thought  to.                            ____________________
