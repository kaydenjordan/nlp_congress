 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the  gentleman  [[Page H2567]]  from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee for yielding to me, and I would also like to thank  him for his leadership on H.R. 1431, the Environmental Protection  Agency Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017.   This bill gives much needed transparency, fairness, and balance to  the EPA's Science Advisory Board. These reforms will strengthen the  public's trust of the science the EPA uses to support its regulations.   It also allows more public participation in the EPA science review  process, and it requires the SAB to be more responsive to the public  and to congressional questions, inquiries, and oversight.   Last Congress, similar legislation passed the House with bipartisan  support. I appreciate Mr. Lucas and the ranking member of the  Agriculture Committee, Representative Peterson, for introducing this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and recommend it to my  colleagues.
