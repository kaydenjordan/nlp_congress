 Mr. President, Brandon del Pozo proudly serves as the  chief of police in Burlington, VT--Vermont's largest city. He arrived  in Vermont 2 years ago, after serving for nearly two decades with the  New York Police Department, where he rose through the ranks and learned  hard lessons on the streets of such a large urban center. One needs  only to sit with Chief del Pozo for a short while to understand his  commitment to community service and to community.   So it comes as no surprise that Chief del Pozo grew alarmed when he  heard President Trump recently tell a law enforcement gathering that  police should not be ``too nice'' to those who are placed under arrest,  seeming to suggest that police should go against the very policies that  exist to protect against police misconduct. We cannot tolerate this  kind of public comment and certainly not from the President of the  United States. There is nothing the least bit humorous in any of this.  In fact, President Trump's comments have undermined the efforts of  police departments across our Nation to build trust within their  communities at a time when that trust is most needed.   As a doctoral candidate holding three master's degrees, Chief del  Pozo is well studied in the rules of engagement. He is also a talented  writer. In an essay he submitted to CNN, Chief del Pozo responded  directly to the President's comments, writing: ``Policing requires  dealing with the emotions cops are bound to feel when they witness the  worst things one person can do to another. It is criminals who act on  these emotions and attack other people. Restraint is what separates  policing from vigilantism.''   It is a viewpoint that is real, told through the eyes of an  experienced street cop who works in reality, not reality TV. I ask  unanimous consent that Chief del Pozo's full CNN essay be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From CNN, July 31, 2017]                   Trump on Police Brutality: Har Har Har                           (By Brandon del Pozo)         When I was a New York Police Department cop in East       Flatbush in 2000, I once rushed into an apartment building       with fellow officers on a call of an assault. We found a boy       in the hallway under attack. He was crying, and bleeding from       stab wounds inflicted by his mother's boyfriend. The boy ran       into my arms. Our sergeant confronted his attacker. He could       have shot the man. Instead, he fought him into submission.        The boy had been stabbed because he had called the police       while the man was attacking his mother. She was lying on the       hallway stairs in a pool of blood. That her son had served as       a distraction was probably the only reason she survived.       ``You saved our lives,'' the boy sobbed. He hugged me. His       blood and tears wet my shirt.        As the suspect sat there in handcuffs waiting to be led       away, I asked him why he had stabbed a child. ``Boy gotta       learn not to get in a man's business,'' he said. ``So now he       learned.'' A fury rose within me that nearly caused me to       shake. ``We should have shot you,'' I said.        But we didn't shoot him, nor did we lay a hand on him once       he'd surrendered. Policing requires dealing with the emotions       cops are bound to feel when they witness the worst things one       person can do to another. It is criminals who act on these       emotions and attack other people. Restraint is what separates       policing from vigilantism.        Now we have a President who appears to want police to       satisfy their primal urges. Either as a joke--as White House       press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders has now suggested--or       as one of many true things that have been said in jest,       President Donald Trump addressed a roomful of officers on       Long Island on Friday and invited them to be ``rough'' with       their suspects. He advised them to be free with their hands       as they shoved arrestees into squad cars, to ``not be too       nice.'' His grin and his pause for an ovation erased any       uncertainty about his message.        An elected official could only say what Trump said if he       didn't understand policing. People who've gained this type of       experience know the real possibility of a cop losing his       temper, how hard we have to guard against it, and how much it       would erode the trust we strive for between police and the       people they serve.        It also seems like the President doesn't understand certain       things about America. There has been enough confirmed police       brutality here to send chills down the spine of a reasonable       person watching the President and a crowd of cops joke and       laugh about it. It's like laughing about the dire       consequences of inadequate health care, or the opioid crisis.        It's also clear that President Trump has never had to fire       or arrest a police officer: The cop sits there in front of       you, replaying a moment in his mind, wishing he could take it       back. He put on the uniform to be one of the good guys, and       now he's on the opposite side of the table. He worries about       supporting his family.        The way to get our officers to retirement safely, after a       satisfying career, is to lead them through policing's       cauldron. Excessive force could get them fired or arrested.       Making light of it is a failure of leadership.        It was hard to watch a roomful of officers laugh and       applaud in response to Trump's remarks. The only charitable       explanation was that it indicated a sense of relief that the       President understood how vicious some criminals are and how       frustrating the work of bringing them to justice can be. The       more  [[Page S4721]]       likely explanation is that the President has a talent for       bringing out the darker side of people, and this was another       example of it.        What we witnessed will drive a deeper wedge between the       police and the citizens whose mistrust of them has grown. It       will cast doubt on legitimate uses of force.        What troubles me the most about the President's remarks,       however, is the way they patronized police officers. He has       never held a wounded child in his arms or had to decide       whether to punch or shoot a man with a knife. He has never       had to race to the scene of a police shooting and choke on       his feelings as he hunts for a suspect with precision and       restraint. His remarks failed to take police work and its       hazards seriously.        When I later served as a precinct commander in the Bronx, a       sergeant of mine was suspended because he stood there and did       nothing as he watched an officer slam a handcuffed suspect's       head into the street. A narcotics detective had been shot       during a scuffle with a drug crew, the responding officers       were blind with rage, and one exacted revenge. When a video       surfaced, the emotions didn't convey. It just looked       thuggish, like the cop was a criminal, too. By his own       account, it seems the President would also have been inclined       to stand there and do nothing. There are thousands of       American police chiefs who know what these situations       require. They want to protect their officers by leading them       in the right direction. We don't need the President joking       with them about giving in to their baser instincts.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is a privilege for each of us to  represent our constituents, and it is a great honor to be able to  recognize the contributions many of them make to our communities at  home. On this occasion, I would like to take this opportunity to  recognize Mary Alice McKenzie, a fixture in the Burlington, VT,  community. Ms. McKenzie has served as the executive director of the  Boys & Girls Club of Burlington since 2007, and during her tenure at  the club, she has had a lasting impact on the lives of thousands of  Vermont children. The community is grateful for her service.   Ms. McKenzie comes from a business and legal background--a  nontraditional path to her current position that provided her with a  unique set of skills. Mary Alice began her work at the Boys & Girls  Club after serving as the chief executive officer of McKenzie Meats  from 1985 to 2000. She then spent several years in the Vermont State  college system as general counsel and served with the law firm Paul  Frank & Collins before taking over at the Boys & Girls Club of  Burlington in 2007.   At the Boys & Girls Club, Mary Alice has focused her efforts on  education. When she realized how few club kids were going on to higher  education, she enacted the Early Promise program, which targets  children at a young age who may need additional academic services and  then provides college scholarships to older youth. As of today, the  scholarship fund has investments totaling $2.3 million from which to  draw. In a short time, the club hopes to be able to help 60 Burlington  children achieve their academic goals in high school and beyond.   The Boys & Girls Club plays an important role in the lives of more  than 1,000 Burlington children. Aside from the academic services, the  club also works to ensure a safe and stable community for its young  members. When Ms. McKenzie began hearing reports of suspected drug use  occurring in a park across the street from the club, she assembled a  task force of local law enforcement officials, social workers, and  policymakers to work towards a solution that would ensure the safety of  club kids. The Boys & Girls Club expanded activities in the park and  eventually took over use of an old storage building which is now an  academic center.   Ms. McKenzie has also focused her efforts on children who have  experienced trauma. Under her leadership, the club has started a  program to help children deal with the issues that stem from trauma at  a young age. Their goal is to create stability for children whose home  lives may be turbulent due to issues such as homelessness and  addiction. These are profoundly difficult situations for youth to  handle, and the efforts of the staff at the Boys & Girls Club are  surely appreciated.   These efforts have not gone unnoticed. Not only is Ms. McKenzie  beloved by members of the club who tell stories of her kindness and  generosity, but in 2014, Ms. McKenzie was granted Champlain College's  Distinguished Citizen Award for her years of service to the community.  This award was well deserved; there are few people who dedicate  themselves to service in the way that Mary Alice McKenzie has.   During her tenure at the Boys & Girls Club of Burlington, Mary Alice  McKenzie has repeatedly identified significant issues within the  community and worked to find creative and lasting solutions. As she  concludes her years of service with the club, it is clear that her  efforts have paid off. The Boys & Girls Club has more teens moving on  to college than ever before, and the club continues to expand,  providing an invaluable space for Burlington's youth to spend their  free time. I am very grateful for Mary Alice's tireless dedication, and  I look forward to seeing what the future of her career brings. Marcelle  and I think of her as a dear friend.                            ____________________
