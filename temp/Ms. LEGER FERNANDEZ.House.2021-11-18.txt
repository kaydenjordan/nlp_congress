 Madam Speaker, our communities should not have  to choose between paying their medical bills or paying for groceries.  Parents want to go to work knowing that their kids are being taken care  of, that their kids are learning, because when kids are learning,  parents are earning.   Families want to know that their kids and grandkids will inherit this  beautiful place we call home, this planet, still beautiful. They want  the Build Back Better Act because it delivers those opportunities.   So many Americans, especially our Latino and Native-American  communities, suffer from diabetes. With Build Back Better, no one will  have to pay more than $35 a month for insulin. This is lifesaving. Big  Pharma shouldn't make excessive profits off the pain of Americans.   We are delivering for Americans, and it is fully paid for by taxing  the rich and big corporations. I urge my colleagues to deliver Build  Back Better ``for the people,'' para la gente, for our hardworking  immigrants, for all of our communities.
