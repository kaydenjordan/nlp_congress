 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 242, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1219) to amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 to  expand the investor limitation for qualifying venture capital funds  under an exemption from the definition of an investment company, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). Pursuant to House Resolution  242, the bill is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1219         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting America's       Innovators Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INVESTOR LIMITATION FOR QUALIFYING VENTURE CAPITAL                     FUNDS.         Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15       U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1)) is amended--        (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by inserting       ``(or, in the case of a qualifying venture capital fund, 250       persons)'' after ``one hundred persons''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C)(i) The term `qualifying venture capital fund' means a       venture capital fund that has not more than $10,000,000 in       aggregate capital contributions and uncalled committed       capital, with such dollar amount to be indexed for inflation       once every 5 years by the Commission, beginning from a       measurement made by the Commission on a date selected by the       Commission, rounded to the nearest $1,000,000.        ``(ii) The term `venture capital fund' has the meaning       given the term in section 275.203(l)-1 of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga)  and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will  control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are  the heartbeat of the American economy. Access to financial capital is  vital for entrepreneurs seeking to start up, operate, or expand their  businesses. However, gaining access to capital has remained an enduring  challenge for many small businesses.   The financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation  worse, frankly, as capital became increasingly hard to access from  institutional banks and various capital market players. While  conditions have improved somewhat in recent years, many entrepreneurs  continue to struggle with accessing the capital they need to compete  and to grow.   In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit, the  lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government  continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential  financing, as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red  tape created by Washington bureaucrats.   We know that 60 percent of all net new jobs that have come into this  country, that have been created here in the United States, come from  these small businesses. They are oftentimes S corporations, LLCs, sole  proprietorships. Small companies often have such owners also be  operators. They are working alongside their fellow employees.   That 60 percent of those jobs that have been created here in the  United States isn't just a one-time blip. That is over the last 20  years, the last two decades, that we have seen that trend.   Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for  smaller companies, no doubt, most notably when we passed, with strong  bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act  in 2012. This was a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by  President Obama. The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more  companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the  public and private markets.   The JOBS Act has raised the cap on investors in a privately held  company from 500 to 2,000 investors, but the limit on the number of  investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained  at 100, where it has been since 1940, some 77 years ago.   As noted by Kevin Laws of AngelList in his written testimony before  our Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``With online fundraising and general  solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act, companies  are bumping up against the limit more frequently. The current limit . .  . now acts as a brake on the amount of money the company wanted to  raise, leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go  into startups.''   While H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, a  bipartisan bill introduced by the vice chairman of our Financial  Services Committee, Representative Patrick McHenry, and Nydia Velazquez  of New York, would amend the cap currently contained in the Investment  Company Act to allow 250 investors for a ``qualified venture capital  fund,'' therefore enhancing angel investors' ability to provide  important funding to small businesses.   This bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption that has  been in place for nearly 77 years. Modernizing this cap is long overdue  and reflects today's capital markets and the reality of the  increasingly important role that angel investors and others play as  they commit the funds necessary to help small businesses grow.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, unfortunately, continues to  ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation, which is  recommended by entrepreneurs, small businesses, and market participants  from their annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Capital Formation.  This is a forum that is put together annually. They take and solicit  ideas. They want to hear from people that are in the marketplace to  figure out what ways they could go to improve that. Unfortunately, they  have not acted on  [[Page H2760]]  this, and in the SEC's absence, Congress must act to promote market  efficiency and capital formation.   I think we can all agree that we support smart regulation that  protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets. But  outdated, excessive, and unnecessary regulation whose costs outweigh  benefits is dumb regulation that overburdens smaller companies. Let's  provide some regulatory relief by enacting the bipartisan bill that  will ease the burdens on small businesses and job creators and help  foster capital formation and get Americans back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note, in a hearing that we had on  this bill last Congress, it passed our committee 52-2, including the  ranking member voting for it. There were no dissenting minority views  that were offered, and no amendments were offered at the Rules  Committee on this. We have got a lot of consensus. I believe this is  the right thing to do to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, is  legislation that certainly shows that sometimes we can get together and  we can support a good idea. This act is such a thing. It shows how well  we can work together to craft bipartisan solutions that support our  Nation's innovators and the jobs that they create.   Last Congress, Mr. McHenry came to me with a problem: Sophisticated  angel investors who fund promising startup businesses want to pool  their money together, but the law effectively caps them at 100  investors per fund. If more than 100 people want to invest, the fund is  forced to exclude some of them from the deal to avoid registration and  regulation as an ``investment company'' under the securities laws. That  means investors willing to commit capital are being turned away and  startups are losing out on important early-stage funding.   Because of Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Mr. Patrick McHenry  working together, working out any concerns that had been identified on  either side of the aisle, we now, today, have a piece of legislation, a  bill, that would narrowly increase the investor limitation from 100 to  250 persons for certain venture capital funds, provided that the fund  does not have more than $10 million in total investor capital.   This type of fund structure is used today by AngelList, an angel  investing platform that connects investors meeting certain income and  asset thresholds with one another so they can pool their money into  special-purpose funds which then invest them in a particular startup  company. Importantly, both the companies and the investors benefit from  this structure.   Compared with making hundreds of smaller direct investments, a  company, for example, only has as a single point of contact, the angel  fund advised by a fiduciary, rather than hundreds of investors who must  all individually approve corporate actions such as mergers and  acquisitions and expanding ownership.   Investors also like this structure because they can delegate  monitoring the startups they invest in to the investment adviser to the  fund. Such monitoring may be significant, considering that investors,  recognizing that most early-stage companies fail, typically diversify  their investments among 30 to 80 companies.   H.R. 1219 reasonably promotes this fund structure for startup  investments by providing a narrowly tailored exemption for certain  venture capital funds which must invest at least 80 percent of their  funds in small businesses. Under the bill, the venture capital funds  must have no more than 250 investors and no more than $10 million in  investor capital, ensuring that they are small enough that investors  are able to monitor and manage their investments.   The bill's limits also ensure that we aren't creating a loophole for  other investment companies, like mutual funds, to avoid regulation; nor  are we providing relief to other private funds, like hedge funds or  private equity funds, that have very little restriction and investor  protection.   Mr. Speaker, too often Congress seeks to help small businesses by  repealing sensible guardrails and rules of the road with little to no  thought of the impact on investors or market integrity. This is a  mistake since it is investors that provide the money necessary for  small businesses to grow. If investors don't trust the markets to  operate fairly, they will decline to invest or raise costs on the very  businesses we want to help. H.R. 1219 is different and reflects a  measured, bipartisan approach to promoting our Nation's startups and  the investors who take a chance on them.   I thank Mr. McHenry and Ms. Velazquez for their leadership on this  bill. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), our vice chairman and the sponsor of this  bill.   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here today, the day  after the fifth anniversary of the JOBS Act.   Five years ago, yesterday, in a bipartisan way, this divided House,  this divided government that got next to nothing done, in a bipartisan  way, was able to achieve a huge bipartisan victory to help small  businesses raise capital. In light of that and in that history, in that  spirit, we have reached across the aisle, and Representative Velazquez  and Ranking Member Waters worked with me to craft a very good bill here  today.   This bill is targeted at small businesses across the rest of the  country. We know that 78 percent of venture capital goes to just three  States. If you are in Austin, Boston, or the Silicon Valley, you have  capital flowing to you; you have funds for your idea. The rest of the  country, whether you are in an urban area or rural area, is starved for  capital.   In light of that problem, we are trying to work for a solution for  those small businesses, those innovators with good ideas that maybe  don't have the best access to capital. We raised the cap on angel  investing, thereby allowing more people to participate at a lower  threshold dollar amount while still including important investor  protection.   Today is a great victory for small-business folks that need access,  that need capital to take their idea to market. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to support this measure.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of the Committee on Small Business here  in the House of Representatives and a strong supporter of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time  each side has left?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx). The gentleman from Michigan has  14 minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 15 minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), a new member of our Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), chairman of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as I close on this very important bill that we have  been talking about, H.R. 1219, I just want to say congratulations to  our sponsors, Congressman McHenry and Congresswoman Velazquez, for  their leadership on this, as well as my Capital Markets, Securities,  and Investments Subcommittee ranking member, Representative Maloney,  for working together to advance this commonsense bill.   As was pointed out by both the chairman and the ranking member, there  is strong bipartisan consensus that this bill is a winner for the  American people. Some people today, as they tee off the Masters, we  might say it is a 6-inch putt for the American people knowing that this  is good for them and good for the economy.   I want to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this bill, H.R. 1219.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 242, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on passage of the bill will be followed by a 5-minute vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
