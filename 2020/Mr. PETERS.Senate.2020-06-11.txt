 Mr. President, I offer remarks to honor the men and women  of the American maritime workforce and to thank them for their service.  June 5, 2020, marks the 100th anniversary of the enactment of the U.S.  Merchant Marine Act of 1920. Commonly referred to as the Jones Act, the  act has served over the last century as the foundation of the Great  Lakes and domestic shipping industry. This vital maritime law ensures  that cargo moving between domestic ports is carried aboard vessels that  are American-built, American-owned, and American-flagged, which in turn  strengthens and supports U.S. homeland security while driving economic  benefits to local communities. Each and every day, 365 days a year, the  Jones Act functions to protect our Nation's 95,000 miles of coastline  and inland waterways, limiting inland access to foreign vessels and  crews while mariners serve as the eyes and ears to strengthen border  and homeland security.   America's dependence on the Great Lakes and the seas is integral to  our economic health and our sovereignty. Nowhere is this more evident  than in my own State of Michigan. According to The American Maritime  Partnership, Michigan's Great Lakes domestic maritime industry  contributes $2.8 billion annually to our State economy, including  12,140 jobs and $703.6 million in worker income. With 37 deep-draft  ports, Michigan has more than the 7 other Great Lakes States combined.   Over the last 100 years, the men and women of the U.S. maritime  workforce  [[Page S2930]]  have also unfailingly answered the call to duty, providing vital  services to support the Nation in times of crisis. Their service was  never clearer than during the activation of civilian merchant mariners  amidst the Second World War. These men and women moved critical  supplies to overseas troops and allies, while enduring the highest rate  of casualties of any service. More recently our domestic maritime  workforce has respond swiftly to a range of crises facing the Nation,  including facilitating the largest boatlift in world history following  9/11 and the current and ongoing delivery of essential medical supplies  and goods to communities in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.   On this week's centennial anniversary of the Jones Act, I thank the  men and women of the U.S. maritime industry for their service, and I  vow to continue to work here in the Senate to uphold the integrity of  the act's protections for our Michigan and Great Lakes workforce.                            ____________________
