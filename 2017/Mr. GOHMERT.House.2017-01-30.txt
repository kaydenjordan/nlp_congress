 Mr. Speaker, we are off to a fast start this year under  the Trump administration. It is difficult, apparently, for some of the  press to keep up with how quickly some of the things are going.   I did want to make clear something that has been completely muddled  by the mainstream media. They keep wondering why they continue to lose  out to news channels like FOX News and why some of the conservative  news sources online do so well compared to the leftwing sources. It is  because a majority of people really are seeking truth, really are  seeking answers.   I realize that is not true for everywhere. The areas that Hillary  Clinton won are basically relegated to the edges, the fringes of the  country: around the coasts and southern valley, Chicago, Detroit, and  some of those areas. It is really the fringe party.   After someone--anyone with the least amount of even a small modicum  of fairness--looks at the actual executive order that Donald Trump  issued, it seems eminently reasonable. When looking at it, for example,  compared to orders signed by a President named Obama, a President named  Carter--I couldn't find any CNN, MSNBC, or anything like CNBC, and I  could have missed that somebody did break through all the  misrepresentations of those networks and actually point out,  [[Page H730]]  because sometimes I am going by and I don't have the sound on and I  will be reading the subtext, but you would think that someone in one of  those networks would make a big deal out of the fact that Muslims were  not banned under the Trump executive order. Yet people all over the  world and all over this country are still under the mistaken impression  they can trust certain networks. They still haven't figured out that  they can't.   They see that, my gosh, the President has banned Muslims. I actually  have the executive order here because, just as I read ObamaCare before  I voted against it, I have read the President's executive order. I made  highlights in bold on some things. I saw that there is no reference-- not one--to Muslims, to Islam. It is just not there. So it is a total  misrepresentation.   Now, to try to cover for the way the executive order news is being  spun, some of them, to try to grasp back just a small portion of  something resembling fairness, would say the words ``Muslim-majority  country banned,'' try to bring it back so they can work in the word  ``Muslim'' when it wasn't about religion at all. It is about the safety  of the United States, the people we are sworn to protect, the  Constitution that we raise our right hand and we swear to protect. We  just took that oath earlier this month, and already it is forgotten.   The refugee program that President Trump has paused is the same one  that ISIS terrorists have repeatedly vowed that they are infiltrating,  and they are intending to use it to kill Americans. The President is  acting temporarily and prudently to give his administration and this  Congress the time it needs to properly evaluate the refugee program and  reform it to ensure that we help legitimate refugees and ensure the  safety, as much as is possible, of the American people.   When an FBI Director warns that they have no information from a  country with which to compare identity information that refugees have  or present or even orally convey, then I would think at some point we  would take that information seriously from the sworn testimony.   Now, I realize that the past administration has played fast and loose  when you keep telling the American people and the Members of Congress  that the attack in Benghazi was all about a video, and you even try to  cover that by encouraging the producer of the video to be arrested and  put in jail to help with this misrepresentation of the truth. Then I  guess, under those circumstances, you don't take testimony from the  prior administration Cabinet members all that seriously because you  know that they have been out there and misrepresented the truth before.   I don't know if Klein's book about, I think it was, the blood feud  between the Obamas and the Clintons was right, but there had to be a  reason that Hillary Clinton did not come out on the Sunday shows after  Benghazi and make this claim that was adverse to what she emailed her  daughter and what she emailed to the President of Libya, saying that it  was an attack. She didn't mention a video because it wasn't about a  video. She knew that. I realize that, between the concussion, the  problems, she may not remember that, but she knew it at the time.   According to that book, she called and talked to former President  Bill Clinton; and she was encouraged not to go public and say it was  about a video, that, in essence, that was indefensible. Nobody in their  right mind was going to believe that, so she couldn't be out there.   There were thoughts being entertained of maybe resigning rather than  going out and trying to defend that story, but, gee, they realized that  if she was going to run for President in 2016 and she resigned right  before the election in 2012, it would have likely cost President Obama  a second term, and then Democrats would not be very kind and forgiving  even though that would have been a stance based on truth and honor. If  it cost the Presidency in 2016, it was just not something that could be  done.                                time  2030    Apparently, according to the book and his sources that he says are  close friends of the people involved, they decided the best way was not  to resign and cost the President the reelection in 2012, but refuse  under all circumstances to go on the Sunday shows and try to tell  America six times that the attack at Benghazi was not planned; it was  just instantaneous that arose from a protest over the video, but just  don't go make that representation. Make that clear to the  administration you are not going to do that, and then let the chips  fall where they may. Because we haven't been able to figure out outside  that representation in the book, why in the world did Susan Rice come  out and say all that?   That should have been Hillary Clinton's role. So he provides the  excuse or the reasoning. So Susan Rice goes out and over and over on  Sunday shows, it was all about a video.   Well, I know from my days as a judge hearing of incidents where  someone perhaps in a company that was not being honestly run would keep  somebody in the dark so they could go out and make certain  representations. The person really didn't want to know what the real  truth was so they could come out and say with a clear conscience, here  is what happened, and that wasn't it. So it may well be Susan Rice just  did not know that her statements were lies. And if she didn't know,  then they are not lies; they are just falsehoods she didn't know were  false.   We don't know, but it is an interesting representation. And it still  brings us back to the fact that in certain countries in the world, we  don't have adequate information to check individuals coming in against.  No matter how much the credibility of the FBI Director may have been  harmed last summer when he came out and made a totally political move  of outlining that Hillary Clinton basically committed a crime, but no  reasonable prosecutor would pursue this, that is my interpretation of  what he said basically, and those who have prosecuted--I have  prosecuted. You know, there are a lot of prosecutors who would take  that. But he made the statement. So I figured that was pretty  political.   Despite that, when he says, you know, look, we had some information  from some of these countries we got from their governments so that when  we see their passport, we see some of this information, we could say,  all right, we can check it against their government's records: What do  you have on this person?   But we had heard from Syria, for example, that they had actually  taken over facilities that could print official passports. So they  could print a totally fictitious passport because they have the means  to do it. They have captured that. Not only do we not have a  cooperating government, but we have no information. We don't have  fingerprints off IEDs like we did from Iraq, and most of the time we  had cooperation so we could compare this information. But we had  nothing in some of these countries that could give us the assurance  that the leaders of radical Islamist groups were not doing exactly what  they said they were, and that is infiltrating the refugees with people  who were going to come in and kill Americans. They said they were doing  that in Europe. At some point we need to take these things seriously.   I am thrilled to death to have a President--fortunately it is nice  being thrilled to death instead of being beaten or knifed or hit with a  truck. But I am thrilled to have a President who is taking seriously  the things that the Obama administration found should be taken  seriously. Let's be clear, no one is being discriminated against in the  President's executive order based on religion. Christians, Jews,  Muslims, any religious group, agnostics, atheists from the countries  designated for a pause--it is not a ban; it is a pause so we can look  better at what we need to do.   I am thrilled to be joined by one of our sharpest new freshmen.    Mr. Speaker, as I told my friend from Florida, I am  honored anytime he comes to the floor to speak because he knows what he  is talking about. When I was a judge back in Texas, a young prosecutor  also shared his first name, and he is now the DA. He is as sincere and  intelligent. Anyway, it is just an honor to serve with Mr. Gaetz. I  wondered if he might yield for a question.   The Attorney General--I am sorry, this is the acting Attorney General  because the Senate is dragging its feet on one of its own, Jeff  Sessions, but this came out today in The Hill that ``Acting Attorney  General Sally Yates sent a letter Monday ordering the Justice  Department not to defend President Trump's executive order . . .'' even  though it is an order that basically has been done by the Obama  administration--except President Obama had done it one country that is  included in the seven for 6 months instead of 3--and also by President  Carter. I don't think he was a Republican. Anyway, these things have  been done before, and the letter says we are not going to defend it.   This story from Lydia Wheeler today says: ``Yates's''--the acting  Attorney General--``decision suggests she does not want to put the  credibility of the Justice Department behind the order. . . .''   I wanted to ask the gentleman from Florida, does he have concerns  that, if the Justice Department were to defend this executive order, it  would hurt the credibility of the Justice Department when acting under  its Democratic leadership?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Great points. And I  wish I were as articulate.   I have been critical of the majority leader in the Senate, Senator  McConnell, but this story is from CNS News. Majority Leader McConnell  says: ``Well, I think it's a good idea to tighten the vetting  process.''   And he went on to say: ``I don't want to criticize them''--the Trump  administration--``for improving vetting.''   And I applaud the majority leader for not running for the hills when  all of the media does their typical thing and just goes freaking out.  But, we found this story goes also, I think, to illustrate the point  Mr. Gaetz was making. This is from Daniel Horowitz's article today. It  turns out that 17 sitting Democrats in the House and Senate voted to  ban visas from some Muslim countries and that law still exists today.  Of course, this was back in 2002. And back at that time, you had some  quite conservative Democrats in the House and Senate, people like  Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Dianne Feinstein, you know, real  bulwarks of conservatism, who voted to ban visas from these type  countries, of the Muslim majority countries, as CNN would like to call  them. Gee, names like Cardin, Markey, Menendez, Murray, Nelson of  Florida, Reed of Rhode Island, Sanders of Vermont. Wow, there is  another conservative, Sanders of Vermont. Schumer, another strong  hearted conservative. Stabenow, Wyden, Durbin, Feinstein, Leahy, and  Udall.   So it kind of begs the question: If this is only a temporary ban from  countries until we can ascertain better vetting, how much worse is it  for these 73 sitting Democrats to have voted for a permanent ban? That  is rather shocking.   And it is notable that President Obama, not exactly consistent with  former President George W. Bush who went 8 years without coming out and  making formal criticisms--well, President Obama has said he is very  heartened by all of the anti-Trump protests. We even have Democrats  here in the House who said: `` . . . as we've heard before, the  President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating  against individuals because of their faith or religion.'' Because I  know my friend here in the House would not misrepresent the truth. So  it just shows, obviously, he hasn't read this executive order that  makes very clear it is not banning a religion or a faith, it is  countries where we don't have enough information.   And I just find it interesting that we are standing on the side of 73  Democrats--Markey, Bernie Sanders, Feinstein, people like that--who  thought it was a good idea when they were closer to 9/11.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, my friend makes such a great point. I think  the way this country has, in recent years, been so discriminatory as  has been the United Nations against Christian refugees, I am afraid  that this United States of America could be called to account for the  slaughter of so many Christians who we could have helped. And as we  know from the numbers, there are a lot of excuses by the U.N. as to why  they are not helping an equal percentage of Christians to the  percentage of makeup of those countries they are coming from. There  have been all kinds of excuses.    But even our Secretary of State, under the last administration, John  Kerry, admitted there was a genocide going on of Christians in the  Middle East. Now, there is not a genocide going on of Muslims in these  countries. There are Sunni versus Shia and vice versa, and there are  clashes within the Islamic religion, but there is not a genocide of all  Muslims in any of these countries. And yet there is clearly a genocide  clear enough for John Kerry to note.   So one of the most heinous and outrageous answers that I have heard a  U.N. general secretary make was--well, I didn't hear it, I read--that  the U.N. general secretary was asked about a year and a half or so ago,  when he was in charge of the United Nations' refugee program, and this  issue of the U.N. not helping the same percentage, in fact, just  helping a fraction of the percentage of Christians who exist in these  countries, his response was basically that it was important to leave  these Christians in the areas where they are being killed because they  have historical precedence in those areas.   So we are going to bring Muslims out, according to the U.N. general  secretary, because they didn't have as much historical significance,  whereas the Christians who are being wiped out--throats cut, heads cut  off, crucified, women raped, and just the most heinous of crimes  committed against individuals are taking place--our U.N. general  secretary and, apparently under our past President, the State  Department felt like it was important to leave Christians there in  larger percentages than existed among the refugees of Muslim because,  hey, they have been there a long while, so let's leave them there,  which ultimately means they will all be slaughtered. It is quite  distressing.   But here is a point made by George Rasley today in an article,  ``President Trump Stops Suicidal Immigration Policy . . . ,'' where he  points out that:   ``Had President Trump's policy been in place participants in many  Muslim terrorist incidents would have been prevented from entering our  country, for example the Ohio State University attack by Somali  `refugee' Abdul Razak Ali Artan, the September 2016 stabbing attack in  a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and two foiled bomb plots--one in  Portland, Oregon, in 2010 and one in Columbus, Ohio, in 2000.   ``Indeed, some 74 terrorist incidents have been attributed to Somali  Muslims alone. And while the Obama administration did its best to  cover-up the immigration status of the perpetrators we know that at  least 13 of them were admitted to the U.S. as `refugees.'   ``Fourteen were legal permanent residents at the time of their  radical activity, and 10 were naturalized citizens.''   So it is quite disturbing.   And by the way, as a result of the Kentucky case where we had two  refugees who had been brought in from Iraq, it was reported, in 2013,  that in 2009, two al Qaeda Iraq terrorists were living as refugees in  Bowling Green, Kentucky. Anyway, because of that discovery, the Obama  State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for 6 months in 2011.   So I do think it is important, as people keep screaming around here,  what I believe as a Christian, Jesus said: The greatest commandment is  to love God, and the second, he said, is to love each other. But he had  also stated: Love thy neighbor as thy self.   And what some have not realized, if you don't like America, if you  don't  [[Page H733]]  like Americans, if you don't like our own country, and you don't love  yourself, it is a bit hard to love your neighbor as yourself if you  don't love yourself.   I think it is time Americans stood up and thanked God for--and/or  thank whatever force they may be, some would say, or agnostic,  whatever--just thank your lucky stars, but be thankful we have had the  opportunities to live in the greatest country in the history of the  world. And the only one who has truly given lives and treasure, not for  imperialist sake but simply for freedom sake, for liberty sake, for  people we didn't know, but we wanted them to share in freedom and  liberty. That is a rare country. It has been a blessed and blessed  country.   And I think it is important that if we are going to continue or get  back to being that city on a hill, glowing that draws people to it,  that would draw people to the Statue of Liberty, you have to be a  nation of laws, you have to protect the people in the country,  otherwise we go back to the Dark Ages, and we become a country that no  one wants to come risk their lives to get to because there is nothing  special.                                time  2100    We squandered our opportunities and refused to take up our  responsibilities to protect this Nation against all enemies, foreign  and domestic.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for a friend like Mr. Matt Gaetz from  Florida, as articulate and intelligent as he is, and I look forward to  working with him and with the Speaker in the days ahead.   God has blessed America. Let's keep asking for God to bless America.  If we ask, we are told: you will be given.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 31, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
