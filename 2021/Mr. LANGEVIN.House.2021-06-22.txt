 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of our newest  Federal holiday. Juneteenth marks the critical point in our Nation's  history when the final enslaved Americans were freed from the evil  bondage of slavery 156 years ago.   Honestly, as a student growing up in Rhode Island, surrounded by  mostly White classmates, I was never taught about Juneteenth. As much  as I hate to admit it, Juneteenth was simply not a part of my  education.   Some of my colleagues have suggested that we should ignore our  history, as inconvenient or uncomfortable as it may be. Well, that is  wrong. As a nation, we must own up to our mistakes and celebrate our  ability to overcome them, not attempt to sweep them under the rug.   Juneteenth is every bit a part of American history. It is a time to  honor those who fought so hard to end slavery and to reflect on the  work that remains before true racial justice is achieved.   As we celebrate last week's vote, let us recommit ourselves to  rooting out the systemic racism that still plagues our Nation.                            ____________________
