 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding his time  and for supporting my bill.   Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago Congress created the Paycheck Protection  Program in the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   What was the goal of this program? To keep small businesses open and  to keep employees on payroll.   The intention of the PPP program was clear, and it was very good.  Unfortunately, bad actors took advantage of it and used it to steal  billions of dollars from all of us.   The Small Business Administration Inspector General has reported that  there are potentially $200 billion worth of fraudulent loans. That is  nearly 20 percent of all COVID pandemic loans. That is appalling and  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, a time of reckoning is now coming for those who stole  those billions of dollars from the taxpayers' funds.   My bipartisan bill, called the RECLAIM Taxpayer Funds Act, would  require the Small Business Administration, the SBA, to create detailed  rules and guidance for borrowers and lenders to return those stolen  funds back to the United States Treasury Department.   My district, the city of Miami, is home to thousands and thousands of  small businesses, including some of the best restaurants in this  country. Let's continue to support hardworking small businesses while  punishing those bad actors. We can definitely do both.   H.R. 4667 is the right step to regain government accountability in a  bipartisan effort.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my Democrat friend from Kentucky, Mr. McGarvey,  for introducing this bill with me, and I encourage my colleagues to  vote in support of H.R. 4667, which puts Americans first by ensuring  that criminals are not stealing our constituents' money.
