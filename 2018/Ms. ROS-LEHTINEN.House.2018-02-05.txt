 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight the 2018  Jewish Community Services of South Florida Matzah Mitzvah, which will  take place on Sunday, March 25, at Temple Israel of Greater Miami.   Every year, Madam Speaker, this wonderful event brings together  volunteers and staff from the Jewish Community Services to prepare and  deliver Passover holiday baskets to homebound seniors and other members  of the Jewish community in need.   Those who take part in the Matzah Mitzvah do far more than just  deliver meals: they help foster a sense of community amongst Jewish  residents of south Florida and help to ensure that everyone who  observes the Passover holiday does so with a full heart.   Volunteers will start assembling the food at 9 a.m., and the delivery  of the food baskets will follow at 10 a.m.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Jewish Community Services of South  Florida for its dedication to creating a better and more inclusive  community. I also encourage everyone in south Florida to come out this  March 25 to Temple Israel of Greater Miami at 9 a.m. and take part in  the 2018 Matzah Mitzvah.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow for  morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2646) to reauthorize the United States-Jordan Defense  Cooperation Act of 2015, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2646         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Jordan Defense       Cooperation Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In December 2011, Congress passed section 7041(b) of       the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-74;       125 Stat. 1223), which appropriated funds made available       under the heading ``Economic Support Fund'' to establish an       enterprise fund for Jordan.        (2) The intent of an enterprise fund is to attract private       investment to help entrepreneurs and small businesses create       jobs and to achieve sustainable economic development.        (3) Jordan is an instrumental partner in the fight against       terrorism, including as a member of the Global Coalition To       Counter ISIS and the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation       Inherent Resolve.        (4) In 2014, His Majesty King Abdullah stated that       ``Jordanians and Americans have been standing shoulder to       shoulder against extremism for many years, but to a new level       with this coalition against ISIL''.        (5) On February 3, 2015, the United States signed a three-      year memorandum of understanding with Jordan, pledging to       provide the kingdom with $1,000,000,000 annually in United       States foreign assistance, subject to the approval of       Congress.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Jordan plays a critical role in responding to the       overwhelming humanitarian needs created by the conflict in       Syria;        (2) Jordan, the United States, and other partners should       continue working together to address this humanitarian crisis       and promote regional stability, including through support for       refugees in Jordan and internally displaced people along the       Jordan-Syria border and the creation of conditions inside       Syria that will allow for the secure, dignified, and       voluntary return of people displaced by the crisis; and        (3) the Governments of the United States and Jordan should       negotiate a new Memorandum of Understanding, for fiscal years       2018 through 2022, to significantly enhance Jordan's military       capacity and local economy.       SEC. 4. REAUTHORIZATION OF UNITED STATES-JORDAN DEFENSE                     COOPERATION ACT OF 2015.         Section 5(a) of the United States-Jordan Defense       Cooperation Act of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 2753 note) is amended--        (1) by striking ``During the 3-year period'' and inserting       ``During the period''; and        (2) by inserting ``and ending on December 31, 2022'' after       ``enactment of this Act''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  for their support for this measure and for their leadership in helping  to bring H.R. 2646, the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation  Extension Act, to the floor today.   I also want to thank my friends and colleagues Nita Lowey, Ted  Deutch, Hal Rogers, and Adam Schiff for joining me in introducing this  bill.   This is a strong bipartisan bill that underscores the importance of  the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in helping both of our nations work  toward achieving shared goals of security and stability in the Middle  East.   It acknowledges what we have all known for many years, and that is  that His Majesty and the kingdom are indispensable allies in the fight  against radicalism and terror in the region.   Jordan and its military have played important roles in many of our  counter-ISIS operations, and in many ways our relationship with Jordan  has served as a force multiplier and has allowed the coalition to make  all the positive gains that we have made over the past year or so.   But that would have not been possible without a robust foreign  military financing--FMF--program that we have in place with our allies  in Jordan. That is why in 2015, Mr. Speaker, I introduced and the  President signed in 2016 the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation  Act.   This bill authorized the administration to enter into a memorandum of  understanding--MOU--with Jordan.   Why?   To increase our military cooperation with Jordan and to provide the  kingdom with increased FMF assistance.  [[Page H756]]    It also allowed Jordan to be included in a list of close and trusted  allies that are eligible for streamlined and expedited defense sales.   Why is that important?   Because Jordan is on the front lines in the fight against terror and  we rely heavily on Jordan's cooperation.   That bill also authorized the administration to increase our economic  support for the kingdom. We recognize the great contributions that  Jordan has made in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. Since the  Assad regime began its campaign of destruction, murdering over half a  million people in the process, millions of Syrians have fled their war- torn nation. Hundreds of thousands, if not over a million, Syrians have  crossed over the border into Jordan seeking refuge from the fighting.  For a country of just a few million in population, an influx of this  magnitude would strain the government's already limited resources.   Yet, Jordan recognized the need to provide refuge to those fleeing  the murderous Assad regime and its cronies; the Putin regime; and Iran  and its proxy, the terror group Hezbollah. We, in return, recognized  the strategic importance of Jordan's security and stability. That is  why we must ensure that the kingdom does indeed have the resources that  it needs, both in the fight against terror but also in support of the  larger refugee population.   That memorandum of understanding was signed 3 years ago this week,  and it ran through fiscal year 2017. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker,  Jordan's current and future security and stability are far from  guaranteed. Most of the refugees remain, and despite having made great  progress in defeating ISIS, the terror threat is far from being  eliminated.   That is why I authored this bill before us today, along with this  bipartisanship coalition of colleagues, to extend the provisions of the  original United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act for another 5- year period through 2022.   We need to enhance Jordan's military capacity and its local economy  significantly, and it is my hope that our two governments will soon  enter into a renewed memorandum of understanding--MOU--at an increased  level that meets the needs of the kingdom.   In addition to extending the provisions of the Defense Cooperation  Act, this bill provides for the establishment of a Jordanian Enterprise  Fund. An enterprise fund would attract private investment and help  entrepreneurs and small businesses create jobs in a way that would  foster sustainable economic development in Jordan for the long term and  in a self-sustaining fashion.    Mr. Speaker, Jordan's security and Jordan's stability, they are both  vital not just for our ally, but they are vital for the region and for  our own national security interests. It is vital that we send a strong  bipartisanship message of support. I urge my colleagues to support this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), our esteemed chairman, and I ask unanimous  consent that he be allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1997--the  Ukraine Cybersecurity Cooperation Act--offered by our Foreign Affairs  Committee colleague from Pennsylvania, Brenden Boyle.   This bill focuses on how the U.S. and Ukraine can work together to  address cyber threats and how the U.S. can help improve Ukraine's  domestic cybersecurity capabilities.   But it also serves as a reminder to this body, and especially to this  administration, that we need to work to improve our own cybersecurity  defenses and we need to hold those who target us accountable.   Mr. Speaker, the events in Ukraine that spurred the necessity for Mr.  Boyle's bill were a harbinger of things to come for the United States.   Ahead of the 2014 Presidential elections in Ukraine, Russian or pro- Russian elements hacked into Ukraine's Central Election Commission in a  series of attacks in an attempt to undermine the results and stir up  unrest throughout the country.   Then in December 2015, Putin-backed hackers attacked Ukraine's  infrastructure, compromising three energy distribution companies,  leaving nearly a quarter of a million people without electricity for  several hours.   Imagine being without electricity during this period, when the daily  average high temperature in Ukraine in December is below freezing.   Those were not the last of the attacks against Ukraine orchestrated  by Putin.   But they were, perhaps, practice runs for what Putin had planned for  the U.S. and others.   Because true to form, Putin then targeted the U.S. electoral system  in 2016 the same way he targeted Ukraine's in 2014.   This is not in dispute--yet for whatever reason, we were ill prepared  to prevent it, and the administration has been deficient in our  response to hold this meddling accountable.   So while I fully support this measure and I urge my colleagues to do  the same, I also urge my colleagues and the administration to take  action against the totality of Russia's illicit activity aimed at us  and our like-minded allies.
