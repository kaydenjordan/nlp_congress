 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Richmond  High School softball team, the Division 3 State champions.   As you know, softball, especially girls softball, has been very near  and dear to my heart.   The Richmond girls persevered through a hard-fought championship game  against Buchanan, including being down 1 to 0 going into the sixth  inning.   After losing two of their first three games, the Richmond girls  showed that they would not give up on their team and ended their season  on a 22-game win streak.   With everything that these students have had to fight through this  year, softball has been their rock. They continued to fight to prove  that no matter what adversity was in front of them, they would overcome  it.   We are all so proud of you. Congratulations Richmond girls softball  team.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Unionville-Sebewaing High  School's softball team, the back-to-back Division 4 State champs.   The girls of Unionville-Sebewaing, also known as U-S-A, proved to the  entire State of Michigan that they remain at the top of Division 4 with  their 14-1 victory over Rudyard.   Congratulations.                            ____________________
