 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce Brother Bill  Nash, a great friend who delivered the opening prayer this morning, and  what a prayer it was.   Brother Nash's wife founded Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church near my  home in Mangham, Louisiana.   In the 15 years since he founded his church, Brother Nash has been  active in the community. He is the deputy sheriff chaplain for Richland  Sheriff's Department. He was named an honorary chaplain of the  Louisiana Legislature in 2014.   Brother Nash is a true country evangelist and has been delivering  sermons since he was 15 years old. Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the  opportunity for him to offer the prayer this morning, and we thank him  for all he has done for Louisiana.                            ____________________
