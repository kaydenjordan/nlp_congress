 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2670.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2670, the fiscal year  2024 National Defense Authorization Act.   H.R. 2670 represents a truly bipartisan bill. I thank Ranking Member  Smith for his tremendous help in moving this bill through committee.  Congress has the constitutional duty to provide for our common defense.  Every year, we fulfill this duty by passing the National Defense  Authorization Act.   The fiscal year 2024 NDAA provides our warfighters the resources and  authorities they need to provide for the defense of our Nation and the  security of our allies around the world.   That is critical because the threats we face today are more complex  and serious than they have been at any point in the last 30 years.  Topping that list is an increasingly aggressive China.   Ranking Member Smith and I recently led a bipartisan delegation to  Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines. What was clear from our meetings  was that the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party is real and  represents the most pressing national security challenge we have faced  in decades.   The fiscal year 2024 NDAA was built with that underlying goal of  deterring the Chinese Communist Party in mind.   It provides new authorities and speeds the fielding of innovative new  technologies like artificial intelligence and hypersonics that will  give us the advantage in a conflict with China. It strengthens our  security partnerships with Taiwan and other Pacific allies.   It fully funds and expedites the modernization of the nuclear  deterrent and builds a stronger and more capable missile defense. It  protects the U.S. military bases, critical infrastructure, and academic  research from Chinese encroachment and espionage.   It builds the logistics networks that the Pacific military needs to  carry out the operations against China. It includes new authorities to  retool and revitalize the industrial base to ensure they can deliver  the systems we need to prevail in any conflict.   Reorienting our defense to deter the threat from China will be an  expensive endeavor. We knowledge there are limits on what we can afford  to spend, that is why this NDAA is hyperfocused on rooting out waste in  the DOD. If weapons systems are not responsive to the threats we face,  we cut them.   In fact, the NDAA includes nearly $40 billion in savings from cutting  systems that can't survive a conflict with China and by reining in  programs that have grown out of control.   We also require the DOD Inspector General to review major defense  programs for waste, and we create a new special inspector general to  oversee all  [[Page H3232]]  Ukraine aid. In the face of growing threats from China, it is critical  we restore the military's focus on lethality.   The fiscal year 2024 NDAA does so by bringing to an end divisive  policies implemented by this administration that have hurt recruiting,  unit cohesion, and military readiness.   While I believe this will go a long way toward resolving the  recruiting crisis we face, we also need to improve the quality of life  for our servicemembers and their families. The NDAA does that by  providing for the largest pay raise in 30 years and authorizes bonuses  for junior enlisted personnel.   It increases allowances for housing and basic needs to counteract the  growing costs for food and housing. It authorizes $200 million more  than the President requested to build new barracks and family housing.   The bill expands access and significantly reduces the cost of  childcare for military families. It makes it easier for military  spouses to find jobs when servicemembers transfer stations.   Finally, it improves the quality of military healthcare, especially  mental health services for our servicemembers and their families.   This bill passed out of committee 58-1. That is the definition of a  bipartisan bill. It will enhance congressional oversight of DOD and it  will improve the quality of life of our servicemembers. It will help  build the ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter  the Chinese Communist Party and our other adversaries.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.

To help expedite its consideration, I agree to forego a       sequential referral of the bill, subject to the understanding       that this does not in any way diminish or alter the       jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice       its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar       legislation in the future. I ask that you support the       appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this bill.        Please place our exchange of letters into your committee       report on H.R. 2670, and into the Congressional Record during       floor consideration. I appreciate your cooperation on this       bill, and look forward to continuing to work with you as H.R.       2670 moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 28, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2670, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2024. I agree that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has       valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this       important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your       decision not to request a referral in the interest of       expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by       foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Foreign       Affairs is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this       exchange of letters will be included in the committee report       on the bill.

I request that you urge the Speaker to name       members of this committee to any conference committee which       is named to consider such provisions.

I request that you urge the       Speaker to name members of this committee to any conference       committee which is named to consider such provisions.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the vice chairman of the full  committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who is the chairman of the  Strategic Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), who is the chairman of the  Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), who is the chairman of the  Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the chairman of the Intelligence and  Special Operations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), my friend and chairman of the  Readiness Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), my good friend, and the chairman of  the Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Alford), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. McCormick), my friend and colleague, and a  freshman member of the committee who is doing an outstanding job.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, the ranking member did a great job of outlining how  important this bill is and emphasizing the fact that we don't all agree  with what is in this bill. It is a compromise process.   We are in an institution where we have divided government. Neither  side is going to get everything they like.   I represent a rural, very conservative district. If all I had to  worry about was my perspective, this bill would look a lot different,  but I am not the only person that gets a say-so.   We have a history, and a very proud history in this body of finding a  way,  [[Page H3243]]  for 62 consecutive years, to come together, no matter which party is in  control of the White House, no matter which party is in control of the  House or Senate, to find a way to put our men and women in uniform  ahead of everything else and get a national defense authorization bill  passed.   Our committee demonstrated, once again this year, with a 58-1 vote,  that that priority is still the priority.   I am very proud of this bill. It is not everything I like. I hope  that, in fact, once we finish this amendment process, it looks a lot  like it does right now because the ranking member is correct. If this  bill were put on the floor for a vote today, it would get much more  than 350 votes in my opinion, so I am proud of it.   I do want to take a minute to thank our staff. I can't overstate how  much work has gone into this process. As the ranking member mentioned,  we had over 1,200, 12 or 1,300 amendments filed in committee. We had, I  believe, over 1,400 filed here for the floor.   The staff has done an incredible job over recent months to get us to  where we are. They continue to work in a great bipartisan fashion to  advance this product.   The Rules Committee has been very helpful to work with, and I  appreciate all of these individuals and what they do for our country.   This is a good bill. I urge Members to vote for it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 582, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I was just going to tell the gentleman that I have speakers that  aren't here, so I am ready to move on, as well. I appreciate the  ranking member. He has done a great job. He has been a great partner in  this process, and I can't overstate how highly I think of him.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the en bloc  package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 582, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 582, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers,  and I urge my colleagues to vote for the en bloc amendments.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On July 12, 2023, page H3454, in the first column, the following  appeared: [] 1530  Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 582, I  offer amendments en bloc.

Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I encourage support of the en bloc  package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Strong) having assumed the chair, Mr. Gooden of Texas, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2670) to  authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2024 for military activities  of the Department of Defense and for military construction, and for  defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military  personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
