 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as Women's History Month.   Throughout history, countless women have contributed to the character  and success of the United States of America. During Women's History  Month, we celebrate the scores of women who have worked to improve our  society and who have fought inequality and discrimination in every  form.   These women have created a legacy that lives on and continues to  inspire generations of Americans, from Harriet Tubman to Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony to Helen Keller. Women's History Month is  a time to honor the lives and legacy of all women, living and dead.  Through sharing their stories, we are able to acknowledge how their  contributions have enriched our lives.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, legendary journalist Ida Tarbell  was born at the onset of the oil boom. She is best known for her 1904  book, ``The History of the Standard Oil Company.'' Ida Tarbell was  known for her ability to take complex subjects and break them down into  articles that could be easily consumed by the general public.   She had a successful career as an investigative journalist, and the  Oil Region Alliance in northwestern Pennsylvania recently completed a  full restoration of Ms. Tarbell's childhood home in Titusville so that  it would be preserved for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, by honoring women and their achievements, we can honor  the past, inform the present, and inspire the future.   Many women have served as part of our Armed Forces throughout history  and proudly continue to today, women like Mary Ludwig Hays McCauley,  who fought in battles during the Revolutionary War and was among the  first women to receive a military pension, and modern-day women like  Lisa Jaster, a major in the United States Army Reserve who completed  Army Ranger School, which is one of the toughest courses in the  military.   Major Jaster was in the first Ranger class that allowed women, and  she is the first female Army Reserve officer to become a Ranger School  graduate.   Mr. Speaker, many women have left their imprint on the pages of  history, and there are numerous leaders who will continue to guide this  Nation into the future. May we celebrate and honor them, not only  during Women's History Month, but all year long, and thank them for  their incredible contributions.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize March as National Nutrition Month.   In 1973, the American Dietetic Association, now called the Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics, started National Nutrition Week as a way to  deliver nutrition education messages to the public.   Fast-forward 7 years, and the week became a month-long celebration  thanks to the growing public interest in nutrition.   Madam Speaker, during the last Congress, I had the honor of being  chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition. From women and  children who use the WIC program to adults and families who utilize the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or what we refer to as SNAP,  formerly called food stamps, I know that good nutrition is important at  every stage of life.   National Nutrition Month focuses on the importance of making informed  food choices and developing sound eating and physical activity habits.   Next Wednesday is Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Day, and this  occasion increases awareness of registered dietitian nutritionists as  the indispensable providers of food and nutrition services, while  recognizing their commitment to helping people enjoy healthy lives.   Happy National Nutrition Month.                            ____________________
