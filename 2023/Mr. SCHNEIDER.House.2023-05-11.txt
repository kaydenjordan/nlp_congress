 Mr. Speaker, we all share the goal of fighting fraud.  As my colleague just said, there are things that we can and do agree  on, but this bill isn't that.   Our focus should be on going after those who stole unemployment  insurance money and fixing the broken systems that enable them.   Instead, the Republicans' bill seeks to claw back funds included in  the American Rescue Plan that would allow the States to do what we are  asking today.   Mr. Smith's bill will make it easier for the bad guys to cheat the  system, not harder, and it will hurt the hardworking, law-abiding  citizens.    Countless honest taxpayers hit hard by the pandemic followed the  rules of their State, received their benefits, and used those funds to  pay for their children's healthcare, to pay their rent, and simply to  make ends meet. They had no way of knowing the State had mistakenly  overpaid them.   During the markup, I asked Chairman Smith what protections were  included in this bill to ensure that honest taxpayers didn't get  surprise bills or face prosecution from States.    During the markup, I asked what protections were in  place to protect those honest taxpayers. Neither the Chair nor any of  my Republican colleagues could point to any protections.   While both sides of the aisle care about fighting fraud--and I know  we do--this bill makes clear that only Democrats care about protecting  hardworking, honest Americans from receiving surprise bills and being  treated like criminals.
