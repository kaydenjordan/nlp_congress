 Mr. Speaker, this never needed to be an  ideological fist fight. Democrats were always willing to take into  account serious and constructive alternatives to the law that we have  today that make it better, to make it affordable, more affordable for  the American people.   But this bill is a blatant takeaway from the American people of money  and protection. If you are 50 to 64 years old, you get clobbered. If  you are 64 years old, you make $26,000 a year, according to the  Republican-led Congressional Budget Office, your premiums go from  $1,700 a year to $14,000 a year.   Fact: UnitedHealthcare is one of the largest private health insurers  in America.   Fact: UnitedHealthcare will have $200 billion in revenues this year,  and they paid their chief executive officer $66 million in compensation  in 2014.    Fact: UnitedHealthcare is under investigation today by the Department  of Justice for stealing billions of dollars from the Medicare program.  [[Page H2409]]    Fact: The Republican health bill, on page 67, in 7 words, gives  UnitedHealthcare, their high-paid executives, and all of their cronies,  a massive tax cut to continue to screw the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we can do much better. We are prepared to do much  better. But this is a financial assault on good, hardworking Americans  who want to do one thing at the end of the day, after paying too much  money for health care throughout the year, and that is, when they need  their health care, it is available to them and their family.
