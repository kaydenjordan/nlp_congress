 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my Republican  colleagues who have toiled honorable in defense of the Constitution and  the rule of law under difficult circumstances. Madam Speaker, it is a  [[Page H12162]]  darn shame that we have found ourselves in this position today.   Every time I step into this Chamber, I am humbled to be serving in  the greatest legislative body in the history of the world. However, it  is deeply disappointing that the hyperpartisanship that has gripped  this country has made its way into this Chamber.   I pride myself on being a consensus builder who works across the  aisle to get things done for the American people, but when it comes to  the matter of impeachment, I have no doubt that the entire process has  been politically motivated.   There is absolutely no evidence that President Trump committed an  impeachable offense, which is why I will vote ``no.''   This whole process has been a ploy to circumvent the will of the  people by removing a duly elected President of the United States. It is  a national disgrace, and it sets a dangerous precedent.   But we are a great nation, and we will survive this indignity. Let's  put this ugly chapter behind us, Madam Speaker, and get to work.
