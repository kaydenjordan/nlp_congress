 I thank the Senator from South Dakota. I do agree. Today,  we are one step closer to getting this  [[Page S7130]]  strong bipartisan compromise on vessel discharge legislation signed  into law. This bill protects waters across our country from the  environmental and economic risk of the spread of invasive species  contained in ballast water, while also providing regulatory certainty  for vessel owners and mariners. To reach this agreement, my colleagues  and I did not settle for what was easy or what was expedient. These  improvements in the VIDA title have taken a great deal of time and  energy, and they were the right thing to do. Specifically, they will  reduce the risks posed by ballast water discharges that enter our  waterways, minimize the likelihood of introducing invasive species  along our coasts and in the Great Lakes, while still ensuring these  discharges are regulated under the Clean Water Act. I know the Senator  from South Dakota shares my hope that the President signs this  legislation expeditiously. He and I will make sure that the legislative  history regarding this provision is clear.                            ____________________
