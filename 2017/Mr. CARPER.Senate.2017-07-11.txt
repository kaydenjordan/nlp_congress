 Mr. President, I want to welcome our new pages. They have  been here all of 24 hours or so. I talked to some of them earlier  today. They come from all over this country, and we welcome each of  them.   I understand they are with us for 3 weeks, and we wish it could be  longer. Who knows? Maybe it will be. We will see.
