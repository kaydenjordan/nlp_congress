 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr.  Andrew Rehfeld, who will be inaugurated as the 10th President of Hebrew  Union College Jewish Institute of Religion on Sunday, October 27, 2019.   Founded in Cincinnati, OH in 1875, Hebrew Union College--Jewish  Institute of Religion, or HUC-JIR, is today a premier institution of  higher Jewish learning and the center of academic, spiritual, and  professional leadership development for Reform Judaism. Over the past  144 years, HUC-JIR has grown into one of this Nation's most  distinguished Jewish seminaries, and literally thousands of its  rabbinical and cantorial alumni have been leading a Jewish renaissance  in North America, Israel, and around the globe. HUC-JIR is also  internationally recognized for teaching and mentoring students to serve  as Jewish educators and communal leaders in synagogues, schools,  Hillel's, hospitals, camps, the U.S. military, and Jewish organizations  worldwide. For more than 70 years, HUC-JIR's Pines School of Graduate  Studies has been conferring Ph.D. degrees on scholars of all religious  traditions who have gone on to teach in colleges, universities, and  seminaries around the world. Today, HUC-JIR has campuses in Cincinnati,  Jerusalem, Los Angeles, and New York, all of which are vital centers  for educational and cultural outreach to those of all faiths and  backgrounds.  [[Page S5838]]    Dr. Andrew Rehfeld, the new president of HUC-JIR, is a leading  political scientist and distinguished Jewish communal leader. Dr.  Rehfeld's career has bridged both the academic and professional worlds  as associate professor of political science at Washington University  and as president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis. Elected  on December 18, 2018 by the HUC-JIR Board of Governors after a national  search, he began his tenure on April 1, 2019, succeeding the late Rabbi  Aaron Panken.   Dr. Rehfeld is married to Dr. Miggie Greenberg, a board-certified  psychiatrist and director of outpatient psychiatry at St. Louis  University. They have two children: Emma, who is the music and T'filah  coordinator at Larchmont Temple in Larchmont, NY, and Hoben, who is an  artist currently working in St. Louis.   I salute HUC-JIR on this milestone occasion, and I congratulate Dr.  Rehfeld and wish him all the best.                            ____________________
