 Mr. Speaker, I rise today after a historic election in  New Mexico and across the United States in which voters voted to not  only uphold our democracy, our basic rights, but the continued fight to  serve our communities. That includes the passage of  [[Page H8579]]  Constitutional Amendment 1 to invest in New Mexico's children and  ensure that every single child across our State has access to early  childhood education and care.   Last week, New Mexicans showed up across the State in every city, in  every county, in every community. From Mescalero to Mountainair, from  Albuquerque to Anton Chico, from Sandia Pueblo to Santa Rosa, and from  Rio Rancho to Roswell and Ruidoso, over 70 percent of New Mexicans  voted to invest in early childhood education and care.   New Mexicans believe in our people, they believe in our communities,  and they believe that every single child should have what they need to  thrive. But we have one more hurdle to cross to make this a reality,  and that sits with our body here in Congress.   Because of antiquated laws that were put on the books over a century  ago, we must provide concurrence so that our communities are able to  tap these funds and make historic investments in our kids.   Today, I urge every single Member of this body to hear our voices, to  hear the voices of New Mexicans and our children. New Mexicans want our  kids to be able to access the resources they need. They are ready to  lead the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to pass this concurring language now  without delay and invest in New Mexico, our children, and our future.  time  1515                            ____________________
