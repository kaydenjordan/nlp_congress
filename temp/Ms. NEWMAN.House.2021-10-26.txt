 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of America's  survivors of domestic violence, millions of whom live in every corner  of this country and every single congressional district represented  here today.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote to pass the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act so that we can expand support,  protection, and prevention for these survivors.   But we must do more. In a recent survey of domestic violence service  providers, 90 percent reported increased demand for mental health  services; however, only 12 percent of respondents said that their  program is very prepared to meet the needs of adult survivors with more  severe or disabling mental health challenges.   We need help with mental healthcare in this country. I don't think  that is a secret to anybody. That is why my amendment would ensure  domestic violence coalitions can partner with mental health and  substance abuse providers for domestic violence programs.   By passing this amendment, we can provide survivors with the mental  health support they need and deserve, especially those from underserved  communities, including: racial and ethnic minorities, people with  disabilities, seniors, and youth.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, it is good to see everyone here tonight.  This is a very special evening, although I wish it wasn't happening. I  wish we weren't saying good-bye to Rich Trumka.   I remember the first time I saw him speak. I thought about, wow,  there is a lot of intensity there, a lot of intention, and, yeah, he  scared me a little bit.   I was very inspired to join a picket line that day. I had been on  many picket lines before that, but he delivered his comments and what  he intended to do for labor in such a way that made me feel like things  were actually possible, that it was possible to make change at an  employer, it was possible to make change at a plant.   And so specifically I joined a plant and their picket line. I didn't  know anybody. I just showed up because I thought, wow, this guy is  someone that I will follow, I will follow into fire. And I did, at  least long distance for a long time.                                time  1715    And I have to tell you one other thing about Rich. One of the things  that is immediately obvious--and I frequently see this in friends of  mine that are in the military--he is a servant leader true and true and  through and through. And I think that is the best kind of leader to be.   So I learned a lot from him and all of his work, but mostly I believe  he inspired the movement to be stronger and more vibrant in the last  decade.   So we say good-bye to Rich with heavy hearts but thank him for his  amazing work and his ability to inspire.
