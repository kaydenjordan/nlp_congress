 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  both the President's counsel and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Manchin reads as  follows:         The Framers took the words ``high crimes and misdemeanors''       straight out of English law, where it had been applied to       impeachments for 400 years before our Constitution was       written. The Framers were well aware when they chose those       words that Parliament had impeached officials for ``high       crimes and misdemeanors'' that were not indictable as crimes.       The House has repeatedly impeached, and the Senate has       convicted, officers for ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that       were not indictable crimes. Even Mr. Dershowitz said in 1998       that an impeachable offense ``certainly doesn't have to be a       crime.'' What has happened in the past 22 years to change the       original intent of the Framers and the historic meaning of       the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors?''    It is counsel for the President's turn.   Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, what happened  since 1998 is that I studied more, did more research, read more  documents, and like any academic, altered my views. That is what  happens. That is what professors ought to do, and I keep reading more,  and I keep writing more, and I keep refining my views.   In 1998 the issue before this Senate was not whether a crime was  required; it was whether the crime that Clinton was charged with was a  high crime. When this impeachment began, the issue was whether a crime  was required.   Actually, 2 years earlier, in a book and then an op-ed, I concluded-- not on partisan grounds--on completely academic grounds that you could  not impeach for abuse of power and that technical crime was not  required but criminal-like behavior was required. I stand by that view.   The Framers rejected maladministration. That was the prime criteria  for impeachment under British law. Remember, too, the British never  impeached Prime Ministers. They only impeached middle-level and low- level people.   So the Framers didn't want to adopt the British approach. They  rejected it by rejecting maladministration. And what is a metaphor or  what is a synonym for maladministration? Abuse of power. And when they  rejected maladministration, they rejected abuse of power.   Mr. Congressman Schiff asked a rhetorical question: Can a President  engage in abuse of power with impunity? In my tradition we answer  questions with questions, and so I would throw the question back: Can a  President engage in maladministration with impunity?   That is a question you might have asked James Madison had you been at  the Constitutional Convention. And he would say: No. A President can  engage in that with impunity, but it is not an impeachable crime.  Maladministration is not impeachable, and abuse of power is not  impeachable.   The issue is not whether a crime is required. The issue is whether  abuse of power is a permissible constitutional criteria, and the answer  from the history is clearly, unequivocally no. If that had ever been  put to the Framers, they would have rejected it with the same certainty  they rejected maladministration.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, it was  always understood that the prime purpose of impeachment was to deal  with abuse of power.   The first draft at the Constitutional Convention said ``treason or  bribery.'' That was rejected because it wasn't inclusive enough.   Somebody put--Mason proposed maladministration. Found too vague--so  they said ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That was a well-understood  term in English law. It was a well-understood term in the Warren  Hastings impeachment going on in England right then, and it meant,  primarily, abuse of power. That is the main meaning of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  [[Page S670]]    Charles Pinckney said those ``who behave amiss or betray their public  trust''; Edmund Randolph, ``misbehaves''; I quoted Justice Story the  other day. Every impeachment in American history has been for abuse of  power in one form or another.   The idea that you have to have a crime--bribery is right there in the  Constitution: ``Treason, Bribery or other . . . crimes.'' Bribery was  not made a statutory crime until 1837. So there couldn't have been  impeachment?   The fact of the matter is that crimes and impeachment are two  different things. Impeachments are not punishments for crimes.  Impeachments are protections of the Republic against a President who  would abuse his power, who would aggrandize power, who would threaten  liberty, who would threaten the separation of powers, who would  threaten the powers of the Congress, who would try to arrogate power to  himself.   That is why punishment upon conviction for impeachment only goes to  removal from office. You can't put him in jail, as you could for a  crime. You can't fine him, as you could for a crime.   They are two different things. An impeachable offense need not be a  crime, and a crime need not be an impeachable offense--two completely  different tests understood that way throughout American history and by  all scholars--all scholars--in our history except for Mr. Dershowitz.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from North Carolina.
