 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), my colleague and wonderful, dear friend.                   Farewell to the House of Representatives     Mr. Speaker, that was outstanding.   And to my dear friend and colleague, best to you in retirement and in  your next chapter of life. You have an amazing family; you have a  passion for our country. Thank you for reminding us all of the great  history of this country. And what an amazing country we are both proud  to be born in and lucky to be born in. So I wish you well.   Mr. Speaker, fellow Members of Congress, my dedicated staff past and  present, my family and friends, and most importantly to the Hoosiers of  the Fifth District of Indiana: I stand before you today at the end of  an incredibly challenging year, at the close of a tumultuous decade,  and in the final days of my tenure as a Member of this esteemed body.   When I decided to run for Congress in 2011, it was because I wanted  to make a difference in my community and my country. I believed that  despite the dysfunction that did and does dominate the headlines, I  could get things done for my home State of Indiana and my fellow  Hoosiers.   Above all, I wanted to restore confidence in Congress, to reassure  people that our government can and does do enormous good, that their  elected representatives are dedicated public servants who, while still  human, wake up each day committed to ensuring a brighter future for  every American, where the opportunity to thrive is not limited to some,  but afforded to all.                                time  2030    How do you go about rebuilding trust and faith with some 328 million  people? We still have a long way to go. Congressional approval ratings  continue to hover in the teens and twenties.   But over the course of my 8 years here, I have identified four steps  I believe can and will go a long way to restoring public trust and  faith in Congress.   The first sounds relatively simple. We just need to do the work. As  every Member of this esteemed body knows, in practice, making an idea  into an effective law takes careful planning, hours of learning,  listening to the experts, deep discussions, debates with constituents,  and colleagues across the political spectrum, not to mention actually  writing the legislation and earning the votes to get it signed into law  by the President.   These days, it seems like ideas we can all get behind are few and far  between. Wherever you look, it is hard not to see the deep divisions in  our country, along party lines to be sure, but also along racial,  socioeconomic, gender, geographic, and religious lines as well.   Following a very contentious election, those divisions are on full  display, for better or for worse. It is easy to point out the problems  we face, but it is the difficult, humbling work to set aside our  differences, to roll up our sleeves, and to focus on finding solutions.  My time in Congress has taught me that it is work worth doing.   Some of the most important work that I have been involved in here has  been in response to the number of Americans lost to opioid overdoses  each day that is still alarmingly high and being pushed higher by the  pandemic.   I am especially proud to have been a part of getting a comprehensive  piece of legislation passed to work against every facet of the heroin  opioid crisis.  [[Page H7034]]  From prevention and education, to treatment and recovery, to getting  overdose reversal drugs into the hands of first responders, and  supporting law enforcement in their fight against illicit drugs, I am  even prouder that the legislation that was ultimately signed into law  incorporated hundreds of smart solutions and proposals from individual  Members of Congress from across the country and the political spectrum.   The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act epitomizes the way our  government can and should work for us. I have worked hard to ensure  that I approach each day ready to collaborate, debate, and work  alongside my colleagues, regardless of party, and to really address the  challenges facing our country.   I believe government's first priority is security, keeping its  citizens safe, the people directly responsible for ensuring our  security, our brave servicemen and -women. It is impossible to  overstate my admiration and gratitude for the difficult work they do,  the sacrifices they and their families make for our safety, and their  willingness to pay the ultimate price for our freedom.   I was lucky enough to be a part of a delegation led by retiring  Members Representatives Martha Roby and Susan Davis to Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Jordan to thank moms for serving away from their families on  Mother's Day. These were among the most meaningful moments of my  congressional career. They reinforced my belief that Congress' top job  is to support our troops and our diplomats, to give them the tools they  need to perform their duty and to never forget the sacrifice they have  made and will continue to make for our country.   While contentious and difficult, my work on the Select Committee on  Benghazi was, at its core, to make sure we do a better job of  protecting our diplomats and Americans serving overseas. They deserve  to know that we are doing everything in our power to keep them safe  while they protect our interests and defend our Nation abroad.   At home, it is our first responders who are on the front lines of  ensuring our safety and upholding the rule of law. Because I worked  closely with our partners in law enforcement, first as a deputy mayor  in Indianapolis and later as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of  Indiana, I wanted to be a voice for law enforcement in Congress. I saw  their dedication and the sacrifices they and their families make.   There were and are areas where we can make both our citizens and our  first responders safer.   Following the Boston Marathon bombing, I worked to help first  responders use social media as an effective tool for disaster response.  Later, my fellow Hoosiers, Senators Young and Donnelly, and a  bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House led efforts to give  first responders critical access to mental health support to manage the  trauma inherent in their day-to-day work.   Today, law enforcement needs our support more than ever, even as we  look for ways to ensure our laws are enforced justly and fairly.   Time and time again during my congressional career, we found areas of  agreement, no matter how small, where positive change can be made for  our fellow citizens. And sometimes we go big. We came together to pass  the 21st Century Cures Act led by Representative Fred Upton and  Representative Diana DeGette from Colorado, which speeds up the  research, development, and deploying of lifesaving medicines,  treatments, and, yes, vaccines.   I joined breast cancer survivor Representative Wasserman Schultz to  ensure young women can access lifesaving mammograms and detect breast  cancer early.   Beyond the big headlines about gridlock and dysfunction, there is  good, meaningful work being done on Capitol Hill, but none of it is  done alone.   To my beloved friends and family, ``thank you'' doesn't begin to  cover it. You have kept me grounded in purpose, honest and strong. Your  unwavering support and love and laughter have made the hard days easier  and the happy days more joyful.   My husband, David, and my children, Jessica and Connor, having you by  my side every step of the way has made all the difference. I love you  very much and couldn't be prouder of all that you have accomplished in  the last 8 years.   To the rest of my family and friends at home and across the country,  thank you for being my champions, my cheerleaders, and, above all, for  walking alongside me even during the difficult parts of this journey.  You were the first volunteers for my campaign and you always have my  back. I look forward to more time spent with all of you in the months  and years to come.    To my dedicated team, past and present, some of whom have been with  me since the beginning of this wild ride, I share every accomplishment  and every accolade with you. It is hard to find people with whom you  can share a passion and a purpose, let alone a few laughs and tears  along the way.   From the day I announced my candidacy to the day we turn off the  lights, there are countless individuals who have contributed to my work  with integrity and grit and who served the Fifth District honorably. We  have become a family.   While working side by side, we have celebrated life's great joys-- weddings, babies, first grandchildren--and cheered one another on  during periods of transition--new jobs, pursuing graduate degrees,  first homes, and cross-country moves. And we have grieved together  during life's inevitable sorrows, mourning friends and family members  taken too soon, including Judy Christofolis, who died this past spring  after a long battle with breast cancer.   Through it all, I have been lucky to have been surrounded by smart  people who are willing to work late nights and early mornings to  crisscross the Fifth District to hear directly from our constituents,  to learn and grow alongside, and craft effective legislation that  really fixes problems for people.   I am proud of all the work we have done together, and I am looking  forward to cheering each of you on during all the exciting twists and  turns that are yet to come in your life's journey.   To my colleagues, most of whom I now call friends, particularly the  Indiana delegation, my brothers and sister Hoosiers, thank you for your  collaboration, your intelligence, your patriotism, and your service. It  is a privilege to work with each of you, and I am grateful for all the  opportunities we had to tackle big problems together.   I want to especially recognize my esteemed congressional mentors,  Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who believed in me and supported  me in my very first primary; former Speaker John Boehner, who gave me  many opportunities to lead and make a difference; Representative Fred  Upton and Representative   Greg Walden, who were amazing leaders on the  House Energy and Commerce Committee; and to our Republican leadership  team, who I have become very close to, Leader Kevin McCarthy, Whip    Steve Scalise, and Conference Chair Liz Cheney.   They approached their difficult jobs with enthusiasm, integrity, and  vision. Thank you for your encouragement, counsel, and wisdom, and for  all of our staffs.   Finally, to the people of the Fifth District, it has been the great  honor of my life to serve as your voice in Congress, your advocate, for  the last 8 years.   I would like to especially recognize the young people who  participated in my youth advisory groups, the thousands of constituents  who visited with me at Connect With Your Congresswoman events, the  educators and business leaders who made our Connecting Careers and  Classroom events such a success. You make me proud to be a Hoosier.   That brings me to my second step in rebuilding confidence in  Congress. We must remain closely connected, more closely than ever  before, to our home States, our communities, and the people we  represent. The laws we pass in Congress are focused on the national  level, but my first priority is and always has been serving the people  of the Fifth.   In 8 years, we worked with more than 4,500 constituents to help them  navigate government, resolve issues with Federal agencies like the  Veterans Administration, Medicare, assist with stalled international  adoptions, and even bring terrorists to justice for the murder of a  young Hoosier.   We worked with communities to support critical grants and initiatives  that are making the Fifth District of Indiana an even greater place to  live, work,  [[Page H7035]]  and grow. In Anderson, after years of effort, we secured support for  the 8th Street Bridge, a critical transportation link downtown.   We commemorated the 50th anniversary of Robert Kennedy's speech  following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I worked  with my fellow Hoosier Representative Andre Carson and Senators Young  and Donnelly to establish the Landmark for Peace Memorial in  Indianapolis as part of the African American Civil Rights Network.   It was the honor of a lifetime to be with the late civil rights icon  and my friend, Representative  John Lewis, in Indiana to celebrate that  50 years of struggle and progress.   And, yes, we grieved with the city of Noblesville following a tragic  school shooting, but we honored the heroes, the teachers, the nurses,  and the school police officers who saved lives that day.   Yes, the job is difficult. But sometimes, this job is just fun.  Whether it is calling a brilliant young Hoosier to tell them they  received an appointment to attend a military academy, or whether we  have traveled the district and learned how puzzles are made at a  factory in Tipton, or we joined Indiana Wesleyan University students in  Marion to celebrate three national sports titles and their 100th  anniversary.   At Launch Fishers and zWorks in Zionsville, we saw the latest and  cutting-edge technology and met entrepreneurs on the cusp of the next  great idea.   It wouldn't be a trip home without mentioning the food, whether it  was enjoying the waffles after ringing the bell to open the farmers  market in my hometown of Carmel or grabbing a bite at the Indiana State  Fair Midway.   I can't thank all the farmers enough across the Fifth District for  opening their farms to me and helping me understand all the work that  goes into providing the food on our tables, both at home and around the  world.   I even got to try my hand at a few jobs, like spending a day as a UPS  driver in suburban Indianapolis.   But it is the conversations with the young Hoosiers that gave me so  much hope. I will never forget visiting the JROTC program at Blackford  High School and celebrating Veterans Day with them. The adventures  across the district and the warm welcomes I received will stay with me  for the rest of my life.   Beyond the job and remaining rooted in our districts, the third way  we can restore confidence in Congress is to take a hard look at  ourselves in the mirror to ensure that Congress truly embodies the  diversity that makes our Nation strong and to commit to a culture of  continuous improvement.   When my close friend, Representative Jackie Walorski, who is one of  my best friends here--we were elected in 2012--we were the first  Republican women to represent the State of Indiana in Washington, D.C.,  in 50 years. Representative Cecil Harden had come before us.   We joined a small, but mighty, group of women in the House who,  despite our political differences, agreed that Congress needed more  women. And last year, I took the baton from my dear friends,  Representative Elise Stefanik and Ann Wagner before her, and we led  Republican efforts to recruit more women and more people of color to  run for Congress.   This fall, more Republican women ran and won than ever before. Our  work must continue on both sides of the aisle if Congress is to truly  reflect the diversity of our country. It is one of the reasons I agreed  to co-chair the Bipartisan Women's Caucus with Representative Lois  Frankel.   Together, we led efforts to improve access to school around the globe  for girls. We worked to recognize the female leaders who came before  us, from the 100th anniversary of the first woman to serve in Congress,  Jeannette Rankin, to the annual Memorial Day service where we honor our  female veterans.   Importantly, we acted on the findings of the Indianapolis Star  investigation into sexual abuse of young Olympic hopefuls, to protect  young athletes from harm and to ensure that victims have access to  justice, and we did so across party lines.   Nowhere was bipartisanship more at work, though, than during my  service, first as a Member and then as chairwoman of the House Ethics  Committee. Holding that gavel not only made me the first Hoosier woman  to chair a congressional committee, but it was an unprecedented  opportunity to ensure transparency, accountability, access, and justice  in Congress. Little did I know that I would preside over the committee  at the same time that the #MeToo movement shone a light on the  pervasive problem of sexual harassment in our society and in our  government.   Like many of you, my good friend and the ranking member Ted Deutch  and I were shocked to learn that millions of dollars in settlements had  been paid by Congress to victims of sexual assault. Over the next year,  a bipartisan group of Members worked to reform the Congressional  Accountability Act to make it easier for victims to report sexual  harassment and to make sure that financial settlements aren't paid by  Members of Congress and that they must be disclosed to the public.   There is still so much work to be done, but I have to tell you, at  the end of my service here in Congress, the Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress gives me much hope. I have been a proud  member of that committee. We recently published 97 bipartisan  recommendations focused on making Congress work more efficiently and  transparently and to be more responsive and accessible to the American  people.   A quarter of our recommendations have already been enacted, and I  hope the rest will soon follow, because if we are to debate 21st  century issues, we must bring our policies, technology, staff, and  communications into the modern age.   So, I strongly encourage and urge my colleagues and the new Members  of Congress to first read our report and then take up the select  committee's recommendations and continue the hard work. I want to thank  Representatives Kilmer and Graves for their leadership.   That brings me to my fourth and final step of rebuilding trust and  faith in Congress: ensuring we are looking ahead, beyond the most  pressing challenges of today, to those on the horizon.   Following the recession in 2009, many Americans were out of work.  Still more were underemployed. Our economy was and is moving quickly to  Industry 5.0 where careers in tech, connected devices, and AI become  the norm.                                time  2045    If we aren't careful, this future will leave many of our fellow  citizens behind.   To that end, we have passed legislation to improve training and  workforce programs to retrain and deploy Americans who are out of work,  to expand 5G networks and rural broadband so more people can  participate in this industrial revolution and provide clear guardrails  for the technology industry to continue its rapid growth, while  offering better protection for our personal information, preventing  cyber threats and attacks.   Our world is changing fast, and Congress must keep up. When former  Representative   Mike Rogers approached me about continuing his work to  strengthen our national biodefense, I knew it was important work.   Alongside my incredible partner who became a very dear friend,  Representative Anna Eshoo and I began engaging again in the biodefense  efforts that have been going on since the early 2000s, the  reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. It  was signed into law in 2019.   This legislation represents years of bipartisan collaboration and  thoughtful input from medical and public health preparedness and  response leaders. It helped bolster our response to natural disasters  and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.   When it was passed, I thought the greatest threats we faced were from  terrorist organizations like ISIS using chemical or biological weapons  in their attack, which are still a significant concern today. But  little did I realize that our Nation--our world--was on the verge of a  pandemic that would grind business, travel, and life as we knew it to a  halt.   I am glad we passed PAHPA when we did, and I know we must do better  in  [[Page H7036]]  the future. When the next novel virus or biological unforeseen event  occurs, Americans will expect more from this institution. We can learn  from our successes and failures over the last 9 months and in the  months to come as we look toward a COVID-19 vaccine and, ultimately, a  return to our normal pace of life. We know some things will never be  the same.   Change must happen in our country to make good on our founding  promise that all people are created equal and that our rights to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are protected. How we do that is  a matter great debate playing out in our streets in protests, on social  media, around dinner tables, and in headlines.   It seems like there is no good solution and no way forward. It is up  to us--to every American--to forge a path together and to mend the  fissures that are breaking apart our Nation and our democracy.   I have spent the last 8 years engaged in this work day in and day  out. It is work I will continue for the rest of my life because the  truth is we have far more in common than we don't.   We are up to this task. I believe in the American spirit, in the  power of our ingenuity, and in the strength of our resolve.   We will get through these difficult days. This pandemic will end. We  will get Americans and businesses back to work and school.   We will overcome the scourge of racism and prejudice.   We will restore trust and confidence in our government and in  Congress.   We will once again see this Chamber full of big ideas aimed at  ensuring the American Dream is within reach for everyone.   I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the very last time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
