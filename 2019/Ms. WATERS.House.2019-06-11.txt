 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 430, which authorizes  litigation to compel Attorney General Barr to provide key evidence  underlying the Mueller report and the unredacted report itself,  authorizes a civil suit to compel Don McGahn to provide the Committee  on the Judiciary with documents and testimony, and, prospectively,  allows committee chairs to bring civil actions on behalf of their  committees to enforce their subpoenas without a subsequent full House  vote when authorized by the bipartisan legal advisory group.   H. Res. 430 is key to ensuring that Congress is able to efficiently  exercise its constitutional responsibilities in light of the  unprecedented stonewalling by the Trump administration and a President  who has openly said such things as: ``We're fighting all the  subpoenas,'' and, ``I don't want people testifying.''   Who does he think he is? A dictator?   The committees have requested information that we are  constitutionally  [[Page H4413]]  entitled to, as a coequal branch of government, and that we need to  fulfill our legislative and oversight responsibilities. In the  Financial Services Committee, for example, we have subpoenaed documents  from financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank and Capital One,  as part of our investigation into the integrity of the United States  financial system, bank safety and loan practices, and anti-money  laundering policies, including as they apply to and involve the  accounts of President Trump and family members. So, ladies and  gentlemen, in another display of stonewalling, President Trump sued to  prevent the banks from complying with the committee's valid subpoenas.   I will continue to support efforts to ensure that our critical  oversight is not impeded.   Who does he think he is?
