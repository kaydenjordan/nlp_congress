 Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, during this Congress, the  House Committee on Agriculture has had one overarching goal: to empower  our farm families and invigorate our rural economies.   A central focus of our efforts has been to ensure that rural  economies gain access to affordable, high-speed internet.   Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Nunn for his tireless work on behalf of his  constituents to develop smart policy ideas to bring broadband internet  to every corner of America.   Over the past several years, the House Committee on Agriculture has  worked hard on a bipartisan basis to close the connectivity gap. The  gentleman from Iowa has been a welcome addition to those conversations.  [[Page H4535]]    Every Member of this House is committed to using taxpayer funds  wisely, and the House Agriculture Committee will report a farm bill  that does just that.   We will ensure that broadband networks financed through USDA's  broadband programs will offer fast, reliable service far into the  future.   Now, I firmly believe that the best policies emerge through  discussions and collaboration. That is what we are doing as we craft  the next farm bill.   With the leadership of Members like Mr. Nunn, we will ensure USDA's  broadband programs can meet both the current and the future  connectivity needs of rural America.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Mr. Nunn taking the time tonight to raise  these important issues. I am equally appreciative of his willingness to  withdraw his amendment and continue this conversation through the farm  bill process.   Mr. Chair, I look forward to working with the gentleman on our shared  priorities as we advance the 2023 farm bill through the House and  ultimately to the President's desk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  offered amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. I appreciate the gentleman taking a bite at fiscal  responsibility, but this bite actually will create fiscal  irresponsibility and create harm.   The CFTC is one of our two financial market regulators acting as a  cop on the beat for commodity derivatives markets. The Commission's  work is essential to ensure that commodity markets are fair for all  participants, from the largest financial institutions to the smallest  businesses.   Robust, fair, well-policed derivative markets allow for the accurate  risk control and price discovery for essential economic inputs, like  agricultural and energy products. Domestic derivatives markets enable  U.S. producers and consumers of commodities to effectively manage their  risk, making American businesses more competitive around the world.   The Commission's work is also essential to protecting the public from  financial frauds and scams, including those targeting the elderly,  immigrants, and Americans seeking to participate in the digital assets  market.   CFTC is already one of the most cost-effective financial regulators  we have, its markets as complex and important as securities markets  with a budget that is just a slice, a sixth, of the SEC's $2 billion  budget.   Now, this bill, the underlying bill, already reduces the CFTC's  funding $296 million, which is less than FY 2021. Enacting this  amendment on top of the current reductions in the bill would reduce the  CFTC's funding to $219 million, which is a cut $49 million greater than  the sponsor's intent.   Instead of bringing the CFTC back to 2019 funding levels, this  amendment would bring the CFTC back to its 2014 funding levels. If  enacted into law, this amendment would result in a 40 percent reduction  in funding for the Commission and would jeopardize the critical work  the agency does to support the economy and protect Americans from  financial fraud.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment    Mr. Chairman, it is a good thing I  represent Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, because it feels like Groundhog  Day all over again.   I don't see the point of defunding the police further than what the  underlying bill has done to police. It really provides safeguards for  those who are involved in the derivative market, those small  businesses, those farmers, those Americans.   As I have mentioned before, the CFTC is one of our two financial  market regulators. They are the police within this area, acting as a  cop on the beat for the commodity derivatives market.   The Commission's work is essential to ensure that commodity markets  are fair for all participants, from the largest financial institutions  to the smallest businesses. Robust, fair, well-policed derivative  markets allow for accurate risk control and price discovery for  essential economic inputs like agricultural and energy products.   Domestic derivative markets enable the United States producers and  consumers of commodities to effectively manage their risk, making  American businesses more competitive around the world.   Now, this Commission's work is also essential to protecting the  public from financial frauds and scams, including those targeting the  elderly, immigrants, and Americans seeking to participate in the  digital asset markets, which, quite frankly, is an increasing number  given the state of digital assets in the derivatives market.   The CFTC is already one of the most cost-effective financial  regulators we have. It polices markets as complex and important as  securities markets, with a budget that--once again I have to state--is  less than a fifth of the SEC's $2 billion budget.   The bill already reduces CFTC's funding to $296 million, which is  less than FY 2021.   Enacting this amendment on top of the current reductions in the bill  would reduce, quite frankly, this police force from protecting those  investing through the derivatives market, their funding to $200  million, which is a cut $49 million greater than the sponsor's intent.   Instead of bringing the CFTC back to 2018 funding levels, this  amendment would bring the CFTC back to 2011 funding levels.   If enacted into law, this amendment would result in a 45-percent  reduction in funding for the Commission and jeopardize the critical  work that the agency does to support the economy and protect Americans  from financial fraud.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise today in strong  opposition to this amendment. Research and promotion programs, commonly  referred to as checkoffs, are time-tested programs that expand markets,  increase consumer demand, develop new uses for those covered  commodities, and, quite frankly, helps to fund the research that is  needed to be able to deal with issues related to those crops or those  commodities.   These programs are voluntarily created by producers for producers,  and they receive no taxpayer dollars for any of their activities or for  USDA oversight of their activities.   I am a strong supporter of research and promotion programs and will  wholeheartedly advocate for their continued existence. I believe any  debate surrounding the integrity of these programs should be reserved  for farm bill deliberations due to the fact that no dollars from the  bill that is up for consideration that we are talking about funds these  programs.   I look forward to engaging with my colleagues to explain the merits  and the mechanics of checkoffs and encourage anyone who has questions  about these programs to engage with their producers to hear firsthand  about the  [[Page H4553]]  benefits of these programs. I specifically look forward to continuing  conversations about these programs with the gentlewoman from Indiana.   I urge my colleagues to stand with producers and join me in voting  against this amendment. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird), the Agriculture  Committee's Conservation, Research, and Biotechnology Subcommittee  chairman.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition  to the amendment.    Madam Chair, American agriculture  really can be defined very simply by three words: science, technology,  and innovation.   We should utilize that to our advantage, obviously, going forward. It  really has been a defining nature of American agriculture.   Quite frankly, traceability resources are paramount when dealing with  an animal disease outbreak. We have seen that this year with poultry.  We had threats on swine.   We obviously invested, as of the last farm bill, a significant amount  of money to have a vaccine for foot and mouth. Should that ever impact  our livestock industry here, it would be devastating.   APHIS' proposed rule on electronic identification would reduce the  overall quarantine times, limit the number of animals that get sick,  and allow farmers and ranchers to resume normal operations in a timely  manner.   Producers recognize that animal disease traceability is an essential  component of protecting livestock during an animal disease outbreak,  and that is whether they are the size of herds in Wyoming or, quite  frankly, in Kentucky or Pennsylvania, where they are much smaller.   Animal health is incredibly important, and the ability to recognize  animal disease traceability is, as well.   We should not allow ourselves to be in a position where efforts to  improve animal disease traceability are hampered, and for this reason,  I will oppose Ms. Hageman's amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, once again, traceability  resources really are incredibly important when dealing with an animal  disease outbreak.                                time  0210    We need to do our best to be prepared to deal with these. Otherwise,  it compromises our ability to export overseas. Our trade partners could  shut off markets in the United States, and it would have a decimating  impact on the livestock industry in the United States.   There are moneys in the underlying bill in order to do this. Quite  frankly, a more appropriate amendment might have been to make sure the  money lines up with the need. I would agree that what is in the bill is  not adequate for the full implementation of this, but that is another  issue.   Madam Chair, I remain in opposition to the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
