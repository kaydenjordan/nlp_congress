 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to offer this amendment to the Violence  Against Women Act along with my colleagues, Representatives Lauren  Underwood and also Representative Donna Shalala.   This amendment would help increase the number of healthcare  professionals who are able to assist children exposed to violence and  also ensures that trauma and behavioral healthcare specialists are  included in efforts to address domestic and dating violence, sexual  assault, stalking, and childhood exposure to violence.   The long-term effects of childhood exposure to adverse experiences,  which include domestic and sexual violence that go unaddressed, are  chilling. Children exposed to violence, when they become adults, are  more likely to have addictive behaviors, to drop out of school, and to  be violent themselves.   The effects of these adverse experiences can be mitigated through  counseling and other intervention services, which is why my amendment  would require funding authorized under this section to be used to  increase the number of social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists,  trauma specialists, and others who are trained in counseling children  exposed to violence.   As a pediatrician, I know firsthand that if we treat adverse  childhood experiences early, we can mitigate the costly long-term  effects that occur later in life.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
