 Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of the  House and offer the resolution I previously noticed.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Oklahoma says that my  colleagues and I who don't support Kevin McCarthy would plunge the  House and the country into chaos. Chaos is Speaker McCarthy. Chaos is  somebody who we cannot trust with their word.   The one thing that the White House, House Democrats, and many of us  on the conservative side of the Republican caucus would argue is that  the thing we have in common, Kevin McCarthy said something to all of us  at one point or another that he didn't really mean and never intended  to live up to.   I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos. I think $33  trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual  deficit is chaos. I think that not passing single-subject spending  bills is chaos. I think the fact that we have been governed in this  country since the mid-1990s by continuing resolution and omnibus is  chaos. The way to liberate ourselves from that is a series of reforms  to this body that I would hope would outlast Speaker McCarthy's time  here, would outlast my time here, and would outlast either of our  majorities.   Mr. Speaker, these are reforms that I have heard some of the most  conservative Members of this body fight for and some of the reforms  that we have been battling for that I have even heard those in the  Democratic Caucus say would be worthy and helpful to the House--like  open amendments and understanding what the budget is.   We have been out of compliance with budget laws for most of my life  and most of many of your lives. By the way, if we did those things, if  we had single-subject bills, if we had an understanding on the top  line, if we had open amendments, if we had trust and honesty and  understanding, there would be times when my conservative colleagues and  I would lose. There might be a few times when we would win. There would  be times when we would form partnerships that might otherwise not be  really predictable in the American body politic, but the American  people would see us legislating.   These last few days, we have suspended the momentum that we had  established the week earlier when we were bringing bills to the floor,  voting on them, and staying late at night working hard. That is what  the American people expect. It is something Speaker McCarthy hasn't  delivered. That is why I moved to vacate the Chair.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the opening line of my colleague's speech was  that Speaker McCarthy always overperforms expectations, but after  tweeting ``bring it'' and after engaging in profane-laced tirades at  House Conference, he just lost a motion to table. I wouldn't  necessarily consider that overperforming expectations.   Time and again, I have heard my colleagues say: Well, he deserves it  because he went through a tough Speaker contest. Let me let everyone  know, he prevailed in that Speaker contest because he made an agreement  to fulfill certain commitments to make this an open and honest process,  and he has failed to meet those commitments. That is why we are here.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the problem with my friend from Ohio's  argument is that many of the bills he referenced as having passed are  not law. We are on a fast track to an omnibus bill, and it is difficult  to champion oversight when House Republicans haven't even sent a  subpoena to Hunter Biden. It is hard to make the argument that  oversight is the reason to continue when it sort of looks like failure  theater.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing selfish about wanting a  Speaker of the House who tells the truth. I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing sober, wise, or cautious  about the path we are on. We are on a path to financial ruin if this  House does not take a different posture, a different procedure, and  yield toward different outcomes and a better future. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to my remaining time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think I have caught the signal, too. The signal is for $33 trillion  in debt, facing $2.2 trillion annual deficits. Our fellow Americans may  be watching and wondering, how does that happen? How does the greatest  country in the world have a process so broken that it would be laughed  out of the rooms in the halls of the State legislatures where many of  us come from?                                time  1530    Here is how it works. The law says we are supposed to have the very  single-subject spending bills that my colleague referenced in the  summer; that we are supposed to have that and move it. But there is a  dirty little secret in this town, and that is, if you delay, if you  hold the bills, if you make multiple contradictory promises--as Speaker  McCarthy has done--and you back everybody up against shutdown politics,  well, nobody wants to shut the government down. No one cheers for a  shutdown and, of course, when people are backed up against shutdown  politics, the decision calculus changes.   So year after year, decade after decade, we break the law, and we do  the same thing. We pass a continuing resolution, then we pass another  continuing resolution, and then it is either another continuing  resolution or an omnibus bill or a series of minibuses that lump these  disparate things together.   The American people want all of us to take votes on single-subject  matters. They don't want to see these things all mushed together and  logrolled. It was concerning to me to hear of a secret deal on Ukraine  funding that would have logrolled more money with Ukraine with our  southern border.   Now, how offensive is that to our Customs and Border Patrol, to our  ICE, to the people that are suffering as a consequence of our border  that some of my colleagues are only willing to stand up and fight for  our border if they can send billions to Ukraine to fund their border,  too?   Well, I have had enough of that, and that is why I brought this  motion to vacate.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything that the majority  leader said in those remarks, except one thing. It is astonishing to  hear any colleague give Speaker McCarthy credit for moving on to the  single-subject appropriations bills.   As you heard my colleague Mr. Biggs say, that was never the plan from  Speaker McCarthy. The week before we moved on to those single-subject  appropriations bills, the plan was another CR. He pitched a CR. They  tried to get us to vote for a CR, and a brave few said we are done  governing by continuing resolution. We are here to eulogize the era of  the continuing resolution. We will not do it. We will not pass it.    These bills can go. The spending may rise and fall as the years pass,  but the notion that we are going to lump in the Department of Education  and the Department of Labor with our military and our troops and our  Border Patrol is fundamentally unserious, and I would suggest chaotic.   We cannot do that. It was only because we forced that to happen. By  the way, if we continue with Speaker McCarthy, the appropriations  process will go right back to what he wanted it to go back to--just a  sideshow, just a puppet show, just something to keep the hamsters on  the hamster wheel as they continue to back people up against a  calendar, centralize power with the lobbyists and special interests  that move all kinds of money through the leadership. That is how they  get their way, and that is why the American people have been getting  screwed decade after decade. I am not going to tolerate it anymore  without a fight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am here to solve problems, too, but we have  decade after decade of history showing us that you don't solve any  problems with continuing resolutions and omnibus bills. That creates  more problems, more debt, more inflation, more pain for American  families.   So the way to solve problems is to break the fever dream of governing  by continuing resolution and omnibus bills and instead return to the  very single-subject spending bills that we will only get if my  resolution passes to vacate Speaker McCarthy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is lovely to hear from the principal  architect of Mr. McCarthy's debt limit deal, but here is the reality:  The only Republicans in America who believe that the debt limit deal  was conservative are in this Chamber right now because all over  America, Republicans think that when you negotiated that debt limit  deal, they took your lunch money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will just say that if this House of Representatives  has exceeded all expectations, then we definitely need higher  expectations.   While it is heartwarming and kind that the Speaker calls people on  their birthday and visits their district and congratulates them on  their children, please know this isn't a critique of the individual. It  is a critique of the job. The job hasn't been done. We have had  multiple contradictory promises.   It is quite something, for those of you keeping track at home, the  last three speakers you have heard opposing my resolution all voted for  the debt deal. So if you believe that the debt limit deal that Speaker  McCarthy brought into law was a good thing, maybe you agree with their  perspective.   I think the debt limit deal was a terrible deal, and it really was  the original sin of the McCarthy speakership, and it is one of the  reasons I seek to vacate the Chair now.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague says we have passed the strongest border  bills in history. Well, guess what? Look at the border right now.   We didn't use sufficient leverage in the debt limit or in any other  thing to actually get results on the border.   The border is a disaster; really something I don't think you are  going to be campaigning on that you fixed the border.   Second, the gentleman said he streamlined regulations. What the  gentleman from Louisiana doesn't tell you is that all of the regulatory  reform he was just bragging about is waivable by the stroke of a pen of  someone in the Biden White House.   Do you really think you have anything for that? It is a total joke.   Finally, the Welfare-to-Work that the gentleman from Louisiana said  we have, the welfare programs that they said they streamlined with  their Welfare-to-Work stuff, they are actually going to grow. While  they did work requirements, they blew out those programs of expanded  eligibility.   I am really glad my colleagues didn't put work requirements on  Medicaid. It probably would have resulted in Medicaid expansion.   When it comes to how those raise money, I take no lecture on asking  patriotic Americans to weigh in and contribute to this fight from those  who would grovel and bend knee for the lobbyists and special interests  who own our leadership, who have--oh, boo all you want--who have  hollowed out this town and have borrowed against the future of our  future generations.   I will be happy to fund my political operation through the work of  hardworking Americans, $10, $20, and $30 at a time. My colleagues can  keep showing up at the lobbyists' fundraisers and see how that goes for  you.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to be clear, I tried to get one of the three podiums on  the Republican side, and my colleagues wouldn't let me have them, so  they sent me over here.   Mr. Speaker, you know what, I will make this argument at any desk in  this building, from the well, from the Chair. I will make it on every  street corner in this country that Washington must change.   We have to break the cycle. We have to break the fever. I would hope,  truly, that the reforms that we are fighting for are reforms that would  last and be embraced and that would democratize power in this  institution beyond the privileged few who back us up against  shutdown politics and Christmases and deadlines in order to achieve  their objectives.    Mr. Speaker, high inflation is on the verge of bankrupting American  families. Our economy is breaking in half. A typical American family  can't afford to buy a House in 99 percent of U.S. counties. Inflation  is stealing more than $700 a month from working Americans; nearly  $9,000 a year.   Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and he  has failed to take a stand where it matters; so if he won't, I will. I  make no apologies for defending the right of every hardworking American  to afford a decent life for themselves and their families, and we have  a greater opportunity to do that and to build coalitions under new  leadership.   We have to rip off the Band-Aid. We have to get back on a better  course.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know how this vote is going to go. Usually when  a vote comes to this floor, it is pretty pre-determined. This one, I am  not so sure.   I am sure that we have made the right argument: that this place  deserves single-subject spending bills; that we should have 72 hours to  read a bill; that something that spends more than $100 million  shouldn't be put on the suspension agenda such that we can't amend it;  and there shouldn't be secret side deals made on a continuing  resolution to lump Ukraine in with border security.   That is not right for Ukraine or border security because it fails to  give either of those issues the dignity that they would require.   We can return that dignity to this House. We can get back on a better  path. We can have single-subject appropriation bills. We can set a  budget, a budget top line. We haven't had a budget in this place since  I was in high school.   Let's get a budget. Let's get our act together. Let's get on with it.  Let's vacate the Chair, and let's get a better Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
