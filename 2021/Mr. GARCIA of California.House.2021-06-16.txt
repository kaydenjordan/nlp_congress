 Madam Speaker, mankind has existed on this  beautiful blue marble that we call Earth for nearly 200,000 years. Yet,  just 118 years ago, we learned to fly in our own planet's atmosphere.   As a nation, we are thirsty for something to rally behind, something  that unifies us, something that we can all be invested in, be intrigued  by, be impassioned about, and something to be positive about.   There isn't a better movement to get behind than our Nation's modern  space program. Some question the value of spending precious taxpayer  dollars to overcome our planet's gravity to go to space, but those  people aren't seeing the big picture.   In the early 1900s, many questioned the value of spending so much  capital and risking so many lives in hopes of conquering flight, and  now we can't imagine a world in which we don't have the luxury of  modern aviation.   We had no idea that a little canvas glider flown on a beach in North  Carolina would evolve into the modern fighter jet.   We have no choice but to think outside the box, think outside of our  own solar system even, to make sure that we not only understand the  answers to our most profound questions but also discover new questions  for tomorrow that we can't even fathom asking today.   We have no choice but to better understand the extensions of God's  creations, to know if we are alone in the universe, to know if there is  a second home somewhere out there beyond our sights and imaginations.   Failing to press on is a disservice to previous generations who have  sacrificed so much and worked so hard to get us here today. Failing to  press on is a disservice to current and future generations who benefit  from our progress today.   You see, space is a domain where we, as a nation, can thrive, but it  is also a domain where we can be vulnerable and susceptible to the  malicious intent of foes such as China, Russia, and Iran. There are  existential threats right now in space.   Any decision on our part to divest from this adventure will not  dissuade our foes from advancing their own space programs. It would  only serve to highlight a massive strategic vulnerability and  potentially create capability gaps that will be impossible to fill in  the future.   A path of divestment is an unforgiving one and the damages  irreparable. While we as a nation currently hold an advantage in space,  our lead, like the nearly 118 years that separates today from the  Wright brothers' first flight in 1903, can vanish in the blink of an  eye.   In this new frontier, time is as precious as money. Now is not the  time to slow down.   As big as space is, we must, as a nation, be bigger, be bigger as a  united team. As a nation, we must recognize that this investment in our  future is more than science and curiosity; it is more than resolve and  perseverance; and it is more than just discovery and challenges. It is  about survival, excellence, and inspiration; it is about national  security; and it is about planetary security against threats that are  not slowing down. It is about a new golden era for the American space  program.   As a result of the construction of the International Space Station,  we have not had all humans together on this planet for over 20 years.  That is remarkable to think about.   In 2020, SpaceX, a critical commercial partner in our quest for low- cost and frequent space travel, averaged one rocket launch every 2  weeks. That is 26 launches in a year or almost three times the number  of flights that the space shuttle did in its best year.    Earlier this year, NASA successfully landed a JPL Mars rover on the  Martian surface for the fifth time. We were the first and only nation  to have done this until recently when the UAE and China just landed on  Mars.   In April, we flew a helicopter in the Martian atmosphere. No other  nation has done that, but the United States now has.   In 2024, we plan to once again land Americans on the Moon and further  make history with the first woman on the Moon. Still, to this day, no  other nation has done that.   During our lifetimes, we will land Americans on Mars. No other nation  has done that. The U.S. will be the first.   As Americans, we are, in fact, exceptional. Our successes in space  are testimonies to this. We should take pride in those successes, take  pride in our exceptionalism, especially in the space domain.   In 1962, JFK had to inspire us with his moonshot speech. Today, we  have no excuses not to be inspired. We in Congress have no excuses to  not support these exceptional programs in earnest and with pride. We  have no choice.                            ____________________
