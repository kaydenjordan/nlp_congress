 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of the  Firefighter Cancer Registry Act sponsored by my close friends,  Congressman Collins and Congressman Pascrell.   Congressman Collins has been involved in this issue for many years,  including as an Erie County executive in western New York. Congressman  Pascrell has spent his entire public career in defense of firefighters  as mayor of Paterson, as a member of the State legislature, and for  more than two decades as a Member of Congress.                                time  1345    This bill will direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  to collect data on cancer incidence among firefighters. We need this  data to help save the lives of the brave heroes who put their lives on  the line every day.   The CDC will compile critical information like risk factors and the  dangers to which firefighters are exposed. This information collected  on a voluntary basis will help develop better protective equipment and  prevention techniques that can be disseminated across the country.   It is fitting that we consider this legislation this week as our  Nation mourns the somber anniversary of the September 11 attacks. This  country can never forget the images of firefighters, police, EMS, and  other first responders initiating rescues and putting themselves in  grave danger, both during and after the attacks.   Many lives were lost that day and, in the years that have followed,  from the rescue and recovery work. Let's do all we can to make sure  this information and best practices are shared so that we can protect  as many lives as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of Mr. Pascrell's  amendment to increase COPS grant funding. The COPS program works. These  resources have saved the lives of police officers and the citizenry  they are tasked with protecting.   These funds often bridge the gap between the policing services a  community requires and the capabilities of its existing force. These  funds are merit based, prioritizing hiring and equipment where they are  most needed and for the best use of the taxpaying public. In these  challenging times for law enforcement, it is critical that we keep this  program operational for our Nation's crime challenges.   Earlier today, we discussed legislation critical to the health and  safety of our Nation's firefighters, and now we consider this important  priority for our Nation's police officers.   I commend Mr. Pascrell and Mr. Reichert for their leadership in the  Law Enforcement Caucus. I am proud to be a member of the caucus, and I  join in their efforts to provide continued support for COPS funding and  for expanding the capabilities of law enforcement to do their jobs and  protect the public and themselves, which is critical to every officer  in the Nation.
