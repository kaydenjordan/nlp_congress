 Mr. President, as we approach the vote on final passage of  the fiscal year 2019 national defense authorization bill, I would like  to make a few closing remarks.   At the completion of floor debate on the NDAA last year, I remarked  in my closing statement that I was disappointed in the lack of  cooperation in the Senate. Senator McCain and I both hoped that last  year we would be able to return to regular order, but in the end, we  were disappointed.   Unfortunately, this year, I and I know many of my colleagues are  frustrated in the inability to bring up, debate, and vote on worthy  amendments. For comparison, during consideration of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, there were 16 rollcall  votes on amendments. In 1995, during consideration of the fiscal year  1996 NDAA, there were 20 rollcall votes and amendments. In the  following year, the fiscal year 1997 NDAA, there were 19 rollcall votes  and amendments. On this bill, there was a single up-or-down vote on an  amendment.   I was one of the few Senators who was able to debate an amendment. It  was on the congressional oversight of nuclear weapons, which I believe  is one of the most important and seminal issues not only of this bill  but of our defense policy today, but the only vote I was able to have  on this critical issue was a motion to table.   Despite the deep differences among us, it is my hope that this  Chamber can return to the collegial ways of the past--and I think that  is a belief and a hope shared by my colleague Senator Inhofe from  Oklahoma--and that we can hold an open amendment process that  guarantees every Senator a right to a full and wholesome debate on  amendments and those issues that matter most to those Senators. There  are critical issues that pertain to our national security and the  welfare of our servicemembers, and they must be addressed through  bipartisan dialogue and compromise. It is my hope that moving forward  we can return this Chamber to regular order and hold an open amendment  process.   Despite my frustrations with this process, I am pleased with the  overall  [[Page S3971]]  result of this bill. We successfully incorporated 46 amendments from  both Republicans and Democrats into the bill. These amendments further  strengthen the bill and provide additional resources to the Department  of Defense which allows them to carry out their important mission.   Looking ahead, the budget agreement that covered the fiscal year 2018  and fiscal year 2019 NDAAs will expire next year, meaning a return to  sequestration and budget caps, unless a new agreement is reached. At  this time when our military is facing readiness shortfalls and numerous  global threats, we cannot afford a budgetary retrenchment. We must  continue to work together to address these issues, and I am confident  and hopeful we will find a way forward.   I would like to particularly thank Senator Inhofe for his leadership  throughout the committee markup and throughout this floor process. He  has ably shepherded this bill and provided invaluable leadership by  emphasizing a return to regular order, the same note I am sounding  today. The achievement of this bill would not have been possible  without him, and I thank him.   I would also like to thank my staff and the staff of the ranking  member for their terrific work. They worked tirelessly. They made a  commitment both of time and intellectual energy that was extraordinary.  The majority staff, and Senator Inhofe's staff in particular, was  diligent, bipartisan, thoughtful, and cooperative. They were everything  you could ask for collegial activity in the Senate.   Of course, I would like to thank my staff for their invaluable  expertise and dedication to creating the best bill possible. I would  like to specifically thank Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark,  Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge  Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan,  Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, and Elizabeth King--and also  wish her a happy birthday.   I would like to thank the floor staff. They have been exceptionally  helpful to us. I thank them all on both sides for their insights and  for their calmness in the face of difficulties and tensions. Without  them, nothing would be possible.   Finally, I would like to particularly recognize Chairman John McCain,  after whom this bill is so aptly named. Senator McCain has provided  this committee with leadership during difficult times and served as a  moral compass when considering challenging issues. He has been a  bulwark for the defense of our country and the men and women of the  military, and I know he is proud of the passage of this bill.   John McCain is probably the most demanding person I have ever met,  but the key to his greatness is, he demands more of himself than anyone  else, and he gives more of himself than anyone else. That has made him  not only one of our great Senators, not of this moment but of our  history, but one of our great American heroes. He is an extraordinary  gentleman, and today this legislation bearing his name represents, once  again, his extraordinary contributions to the Nation.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Career and  Technical Education for Adult Learners or the CTE for All Act with my  colleague, Senator Baldwin.   Our legislation addresses the critical need to expand educational  opportunities for working adults with low academic skills. The need for  strengthening the skills base for working adults continues to grow.  Increasingly, middle-skill and sustainable wage jobs require education  beyond high school. Yet, according to U.S. Census Bureau's American  Community Survey data, 12 percent (24 million) of working age adults  have less than a high school diploma. Recent Department of Education  data show that only 5 percent of adults with less than a high school  diploma have any type of postsecondary certificate, certification, or  license compared to 27 percent of adults overall. Moreover, an  estimated 36 million adults in the U.S. have low skills with nearly one  in six having low literacy skills and one in three having low numeracy  skills.   Our ability to grow the economy and decrease income inequality will  depend, in large part, on our commitment to providing education and  training programs to low-skilled adults. These workers are concentrated  in fields such as construction, health care, manufacturing, and  hospitality. Expanding career and technical education opportunities to  these workers could enhance their career trajectories and strengthen  their earning potential, fueling economic productivity and growth for  the future. Unfortunately, according to the U.S. Department of  Education, roughly half of low-skilled workers are not engaged in  formal or non-formal learning opportunities. The CTE for All Act aims  to change that by ensuring that there are pathways for adult learners  in career and technical education programs.   Specifically, our legislation will ensure that programs funded under  the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act align with adult  education programs and industry sector partnerships authorized under  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The CTE for All Act  requires consultation with the state director for adult education in  the development of the statewide plan for career and technical  education. The bill calls for career and technical education programs  to include low-skilled adults among the special populations targeted  for outreach and support and allows states to report separate  performance indicators for adult career and technical education  students. The legislation makes adult education providers that offer  integrated education and training programs eligible to receive career  and technical education funding. Additionally, the legislation  encourages career and technical education programs to include work  experiences for their students of all ages.   We have worked with the adult education community and other  stakeholders in developing this legislation. We are pleased to have the  support of the National Council of State Directors of Adult Education,  the Commission on Adult Basic Education, the National Skills Coalition,  and the National Coalition for Literacy.   As a Nation, we are at our best when every person--no matter their  starting point--has the opportunity to develop their skills and reach  their potential. The CTE for All Act will strengthen the ladder of  opportunity for adult learners who work hard every day to provide for  their families. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  work with us to include these provisions in the reauthorization of the  Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Career and  Technical Education for Adult Learners or the CTE for All Act with my  colleague, Senator Baldwin.
