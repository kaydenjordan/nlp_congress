 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  outstanding accomplishments of the Liberty University Football Team.   On November 25, my alma mater and hometown team earned their 12th  straight victory and secured the first undefeated regular season in the  program's 50-year history.   Led by new head coach Jamey Chadwell, the Flames set a new school  [[Page H6054]]  record and became the first FBS football team in Virginia history to  win 12 games.   As an alum, former student-athlete, parent of three graduates, and a  former employee in the Liberty University Athletic Department, I am  incredibly proud of this team.   The Flames' 12-0 record and current number 20 national ranking  reflects the discipline, commitment, and work ethic of these talented  young men.   Their individual sacrifice, unselfishness, and willingness to play  for one another and give everything for a cause bigger than themselves  has placed them in tonight's Conference USA Championship game, after  which they will have the opportunity to play in a prestigious bowl  game.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Liberty Flames on their historic  season, and I am honored to represent them in Virginia's Fifth  Congressional District.                            ____________________
