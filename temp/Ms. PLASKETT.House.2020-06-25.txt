 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, who has led us in this fight here on this  floor as we make a historic movement toward justice.   I am so upset that my colleague, my classmate, left before I could  help him understand. I wanted to give him books that he could read. He  could read ``Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People,'' ``White  Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism,''  ``The New Jim Crow.''   And if he didn't want to read a book, he could look at a documentary.  How about ``13th?''   But if he doesn't want to do that, if he wants to support this bill,  I will give him a good cop story about why to do it. I will ask my  colleagues to support this, if not for George Floyd and the countless  others killed at the hand of police, or for those of us Black Americans  who live in fear of police brutality, I ask you to support it for a  good cop.   I ask you to support it for my father, who called me up and told me  this is a good bill; a cop who, for 30 years, was on the New York City  police force and said the biggest threat to every good cop is a bad  cop; who says that the biggest threat to every good cop is a brutal  police officer and that this present system will put down a good  policeman trying to do the right thing, to speak up for what is right,  and will surely keep down a good Black cop.   Or for my four sons who received the talk from that veteran police  officer who warned what can happen to you on the street, in a squad  car, or in the basement of a police precinct, where often the system is  rigged so that good police can't always help you. Support it for those  sons who, despite the best education and decorum, fear a siren or a  police light, the police brutality that we all have.   As we advance this critical work, support this for all Americans.  Speak the truth that Black lives matter.
