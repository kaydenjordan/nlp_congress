 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona for yielding and for his tireless work fighting for improved  healthcare in rural communities.    Congressman O'Halleran's amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, is  vital in rural areas like those in New Mexico's Second Congressional  District. Hospitals often run on small margins and do not have the  necessary resources to establish new residency training programs.   This is especially problematic given the shortage of up to more than  100,000 physicians by 2030 in the United States. Rural communities, in  particular, already struggle to attract and keep medical professionals.  Therefore, it is only fitting that the Federal Government invests a  portion of the savings earned by H.R. 3 into rural areas to improve  healthcare accessibility, and this amendment would do just that.   As we continue debating healthcare legislation, I urge my colleagues  to support initiatives that provide rural residents greater access to  basic healthcare. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment and the underlying bill.
