 Mr. President, I would like to take this  opportunity to recognize the heroic life of Scranton firefighter  Captain James Robeson on the 10th anniversary of his death.   Captain Robeson was more than just a firefighter. He was a loving  husband to his wife, Linda, and a caring father to his son, Ryan. He  was a friend to many, a mentor to his colleagues, and a hero to us all.   Captain Robeson made a career out of service and protection. He  willingly served and courageously protected his colleagues, the city of  Scranton, and all of us who inhabit it. Each time duty called, Captain  Robeson heroically was one of the brave individuals running into the  flames and chaos, while everyone else was running out. Captain Robeson  was a man of high honor and integrity, two qualities demonstrated when  he laid down his own life in an attempt to save another.   Ten years after his death, it is still my honor to have been given  the opportunity to serve a man as brave, honorable, and respected as  Captain Robeson. His unquestioned willingness to serve others and  courageous ultimate sacrifice is a reminder to me about the true  meaning of public service.                            ____________________
