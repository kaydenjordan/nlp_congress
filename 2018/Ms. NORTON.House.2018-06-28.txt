 Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump's ``corrective'' order no  longer separating children from parents takes families out of the fire  of separation and throws them into the inferno of unlimited detention  on military bases. Thus Trump's zero tolerance policy stands, costing  the government untold millions required to be spent for meals, air  conditioning, libraries, private showers, medical, dental, and mental  health.   There are no good options when families enter the country seeking  asylum, but herding them together in internment camps is the worst of  those available.   That is why past administrations have released the detainees with  ankle bracelets and frequent contacts, with the overwhelming majority  of detainees reporting back. The courts are likely to order a similar  remedy.   It is time for the administration to look at practices that have  worked instead of inventing inhumane ones that don't.                            ____________________
