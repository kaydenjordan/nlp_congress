 Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose H.R. 1, which puts  corporations over people.   Instead of focusing on the needs of the American people and combating  the climate crisis, this bill is a shameful giveaway to polluters  through loopholes and industry handouts.   In Hawaii, we view the environment as more than just a resource. It  is a sacred responsibility, our kuleana, to ourselves and to future  generations.   From ancient times, Native Hawaiians have sought balance from mauka  to makai, the mountains to the sea, understanding the intimate  connections we have to our precious, life-giving resources. This is the  kind of future we should be striving for, one that promotes community  and fosters responsible use of natural resources.   Everyone deserves to have a seat at the table when it comes to  proposed projects that could pollute their water and air, especially  underserved communities and communities of color, which have  historically borne the brunt of industrialization, resulting in  disproportionate impacts to their health and safety.   This bill does the opposite. In addition to shortening public comment  periods, this bill would block lawsuits from anyone who did not  participate in the comment period. Communities likely do not even know  what projects are permitted, let alone the consequences of those  permits, until well after the new proposed comment periods.   The responsibility should be on developers and projects to win  support from communities based on their merits and through meaningful  public engagement. Instead, this bill puts the burden on ordinary,  hardworking Americans to fight for their basic right to clean air and  water.   I urge my colleagues to do what is pono, what is right, and put our  families, our keiki and our kupuna, above corporate profits and vote  ``no'' on the polluters over people act.
