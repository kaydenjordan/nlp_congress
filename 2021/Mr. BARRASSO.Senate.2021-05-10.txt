 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss  what I have seen happen now over the last 100 days of the Biden  administration, and that is President Biden seems to be doubling down  on some of the failures of the Obama administration.   Last week, as the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, I released a report, and it is called ``Solyndra  Syndrome and the Green Stimulus Delusion.'' Solyndra syndrome.   I tell you, I think it is an important thing to highlight because  this 20-page report really is an in-depth look at the failed green  energy policies under the Obama administration. Now what we are seeing  is President Biden is determined, in my opinion, to repeat them, on a  much larger scale.   In 2009, under the direction of President Obama, Democrats passed a  partisan stimulus spending bill. The legislation included $90 billion  for green job training, for green energy loans, and for high-speed  rail. It also included about $3 billion for a program more commonly  referred to now as ``Cash for Clunkers.''   The goal was to produce millions of green energy jobs. They wanted to  do it by investing taxpayer dollars in emerging green energy companies  and also subsidizing new vehicles.   So what did American taxpayers get for all of this money? What did  they get as a return on this hefty investment? Well, they didn't get  the promised jobs. They got boondoggles. Billions of taxpayer dollars  wound up wasted on green tech companies through loans or grants.  Several of the companies then failed.   The most famous of these was, of course, Solyndra. This was a solar  panel company with many personal ties to the administration. It was  located in California and received over $500 million in government- backed loans. Vice President Biden, at the time Vice President, was  actually the one who announced that Solyndra would receive hundreds of  millions of taxpayer dollars.   Well, not too long after that, headlines across the Nation told the  story of what happened next. In September of 2011, the company failed  miserably. More than 1,000 workers lost their jobs. Almost all of the  535 million taxpayer dollars were lost.   The leadership of Solyndra lied about the company's value and what  they could produce. It also turns out they were big political donors to  the Obama-Biden campaign and the Democrats.   While the Obama-Biden donors got millions of grant money, taxpayers  back then were left holding the bag. It was a terrible green gamble,  and it had gone terribly wrong.   It wasn't the only one of these projects. Other companies like A123  Systems, Beacon Power, Ener1, Fisker Automotive all received big  government-backed loans, and they all went bankrupt.   The waste didn't stop at loans for private companies. No, the Obama  administration gave a $3.5 billion grant to California for a high-speed  rail project. This was California's planned bullet train, and it was  supposed to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco.   Let's fast forward 10 years and see where we are with that bullet  train. After skyrocketing project costs, the Governor of California has  recently thrown in the towel. Only a fraction of the original project  is going to be completed, and delays continue to be announced.   So you might ask: Well, why are they completing a small fraction of  this railroad, this high-speed bullet train that was supposed to go  from Los Angeles to San Francisco? Well, by completing a small part of  the original project, California can avoid having to pay back the  taxpayers of the Nation--more wasted money.   Americans clearly remember Cash for Clunkers. What a program that  was. It gave subsidies to folks for the purchase of a new greener  vehicle as a way to stimulate auto sales and auto industry jobs. The  big problem was it didn't work. One analysis found that the Cash for  Clunkers Program created one job for every $1.4 million spent. That is  quite a lot of money for a single job. The program itself was a  clunker, and it spent way too much taxpayer cash.   The list goes on and on, as I have outlined in this report. The Obama  administration frittered away billions of taxpayer dollars. They chose  people close to the administration to receive the money. The economy  remained sluggish, and the taxpayers got fleeced.   There actually was one bright economic spot during the great  recession, and, of course, I will tell you that was the oil and gas  sector in this country.  [[Page S2409]]  By the end of 2013, nonfarm employment was an anemic 1.9 percent higher  than it had been at the end of the year in 2009. In contrast, the oil  and gas sector's employment was 16 percent higher. While the rest of  the economy was stuck in the mud, the oil and gas sector was growing  and creating American jobs. That robust job growth helped make America  energy independent and secure.   You would think that the lessons from the failed 2009 stimulus and  the U.S. energy boom would be obvious and would be repeated today, but  the Biden administration seems blinded by the Solyndra syndrome.  President Biden wants to use the exact same playbook now and this time  with a much heftier pricetag.   The President wants to spend trillions of dollars, not just billions.  Included in that spending would be hundreds of billions of dollars in  green job training programs, green energy financing, increased high- speed rail, new electric vehicles. It is the same plan that failed  under President Obama.   At the same time the Biden administration is recycling the farfetched  so-called jobs plan, the Biden administration is attacking oil and gas  jobs--good jobs that people have today.   On his first day in office, President Biden signed an Executive order  to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now, this eliminated the prospect of  11,000 American jobs. Making matters worse, President Biden implemented  a ban on new oil and gas production on public lands, a huge impact on  my home State of Wyoming. A permanent ban on oil and gas leasing on  Federal lands could destroy up to 1 million jobs across America.   My report finds the Biden administration is pushing expensive fantasy  jobs and killing real ones at a time that America cannot afford to lose  these jobs. It is a recipe for repeated disaster.   We all remember how President Obama promised shovel-ready jobs, and  he then later admitted that the jobs weren't coming, as he said,  because ``shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.''   We know we can expect the same thing this time. The expensive,  wasteful job-killing Solyndra syndrome is back. It was a terrible idea  in 2009. And here we are a dozen years later, once again, spending a  lot more, and doing that on the same bad ideas is now even worse than  before.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the distinguished  career of Wendy Curran. Wendy will soon retire as vice president of  care delivery and provider affairs at Blue Cross Blue Shield of  Wyoming. Her retirement marks the end of a remarkable career dedicated  to improving the lives of people in my State.   Wendy Curran has been at the center of Wyoming health policy for over  30 years. She earned the trust of folks across the State with her broad  knowledge of the challenges and opportunities for improving care in  Wyoming. She forged alliances and friendships on both sides of the  aisle, and both Republicans and Democrats respected Wendy's insights  and relied on her unique knowledge.   As the daughter of a third-generation rancher, Wendy grew up on the  Peryam Ranch in the Upper North Platte River Valley. During this time,  spent riding horses and playing in the Encampment River, she learned  lessons that would later contribute to her successful career. Daily  chores taught her the value of hard work. She developed the ability to  ``heal up and hair over,'' a cowboy's term for resiliency. In fact, her  grit, humility, and determination represent several of the key tenets  in our State ethics code, the Code of the West: be tough, but fair;  take pride in your work; do what has to be done.   Throughout her career, Wendy held many distinguished jobs at all  levels of government. She began by working for U.S. Senator Cliff  Hansen. Other members of Wyoming's congressional delegation also  benefited from her work. Wendy served U.S. Congressman Dick Cheney and  U.S. Senator Malcom Wallop as well.   In 1991, Wendy joined the Wyoming Medical Society. Wendy was the  passionate voice of Wyoming physicians and patients, serving as the  assistant director of public affairs and later leading the organization  as executive director. Wendy testified frequently before the Wyoming  Legislature, advocating on behalf of Wyoming physicians and patients.  She was known to introduce herself as a ``representative to the people  who save Wyoming residents' lives,'' a job she took very seriously. She  worked on many important provider issues. In particular, she was the  leading voice supporting medical liability reform.   Wendy was instrumental in Wyoming joining the organization now known  as WWAMI. This acronym stands for the States it represents: Washington,  Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. These States, working through the  University of Washington Medical School, are part of a medical  education consortium. This allows students in Wyoming to attend medical  school at the University of Washington while participating in  clerkships both in Wyoming and across the region. The program gives the  students wide exposure to practicing medicine in rural communities.  Wendy deserves credit for helping to bring this successful program to  Wyoming, and she continues to serve on the University of Wyoming WWAMI  curriculum review panel.   In 2005, Wendy left the Medical Society. Recognizing her skills,  Governor Dave Freudenthal asked Wendy to serve in his administration.  In this role, Wendy championed initiatives to improve childcare,  substance abuse services, and an innovative Medicaid pilot program  known as Healthy Frontiers. Her talents for creating health policy were  so respected that she also helped incoming Governor Matt Mead during  his administration's transition. That Freudenthal was a Democrat and  Mead a Republican made no difference. Wendy proved yet again that  partisan politics mattered far less than honoring her commitment to the  people of Wyoming.   Wendy spent the last 10 years of her career working for Blue Cross  Blue Shield of Wyoming. In the midst of widespread reform and changes,  Wendy remained committed to improving the State's health care system.  Her excellent communication skills and well-established knowledge of  the industry benefited her immensely. She embraced her role as a  liaison between the insurance agency and providers, often bridging gaps  and fostering connection. She ends her career as a trusted adviser to  all in the health care industry.   In 2001, I was honored to join Wendy in the inaugural class of  Leadership Wyoming, a program developed to inspire Wyoming's leaders  through exploration and connection. Already an established leader in  her own right, Wendy fully committed herself to the 8-month program and  later became one of its most fervent supporters.   Wendy also lent her talents and expertise to the boards of numerous  nonprofit organizations. These included Peak Wellness Center, the  Wyoming  [[Page S2411]]  Health Resources Network, the Wyoming Small Business Development  Center, and CLIMB Wyoming. Her work with CLIMB Wyoming is of special  significance. CLIMB is a unique nonprofit empowering single mothers to  develop life and career skills. This holistic program helps these women  start new careers and ultimately become self-sufficient.   Wendy's accomplishments speak for themselves. She views herself as a  humble public servant. Still, her impact on health care in Wyoming  cannot be understated and will be recognized for years to come.   Finally, I must conclude my remarks by recognizing the most important  people in Wendy's life, her family. Her late husband Denny was a good  friend and an outstanding journalist. His passing in 2012 was a  tremendous loss. I know he is looking down on Wendy, their three  children, Katie, Laura, and Tim, and granddaughter Lillian, with pride  today.   Wendy and I have been personal friends for nearly four decades. She  represents the best of Wyoming in every sense of the word. One could  not have a better friend than Wendy Curran.   The people of Wyoming are fortunate to have Wendy Curran serve our  State for so many years. She is a leader, mentor, and advocate to many,  especially women working in health care. Bobbi and I are proud to call  her our friend. Wendy will be missed in retirement, but I know she will  continue to find meaningful ways to serve and to make Wyoming a better  place for everyone. Thank you, Wendy, for your committed and dedicated  service.                            ____________________
