 Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank the gentleman  from Michigan, not only for yielding but, more importantly, for his  leadership in helping improve our capital markets and our economy here.   I want to thank all of the Republican and Democrat cosponsors of H.R.  1219, particularly our vice chairman of the full committee Mr. McHenry  of North Carolina, for his leadership and also Ms. Velazquez on the  other side of the aisle for her leadership on this issue as well. Both  of these colleagues are senior members of the committee which I have  the honor of chairing.   Madam Speaker, we know that while optimism and confidence in our  economy are up considerably over the last few months, our Nation still  has a way to go to experience the robust economic growth the American  people have experienced in the past of which they also deserve.   One obvious reason that the economy continues to limp along is  bureaucratic burdens imposed by Washington's top-down regulations on  America's small businesses on Main Street.   I got a message from a gentleman by the name of Larry, a small- business owner in Mabank, Texas, who I have the privilege of  representing here in Congress, and he summed it up fairly well. He  said: ``So many businesses have to deal with regulations and taxes that  didn't exist a few years ago. It is especially hard on smaller  businesses. While large companies have their own staff of attorneys and  the capital to comply with regulations, small businesses don't.''   So, Madam Speaker, as my colleagues on the Financial Services  Committee know all too well, because we have had countless witnesses  before our committee to attest to such, Washington has inflicted upon  Main Street America a complex set of burdensome and expensive and  confusing regulations.                                time  1000    Many were written, again, with the largest public companies in mind,  but they burden small companies and hurt their ability to access  capital. That is exactly what Larry of Mabank, Texas, has told me, and  I believe it.   So, clearly, Congress should work, preferably on a bipartisan basis,  to level the playing field while maintaining fair and efficient capital  markets, protecting investors, and allowing small companies the chance  to succeed.   We can make progress on these goals today by advancing this  bipartisan bill, the Supporting America's Innovators Act. This bill was  approved by the Financial Services Committee with the overwhelming  support of Republicans and Democrats. The vote in committee was 54-2.  In addition, a similar bill passed the House last year overwhelmingly  on a bipartisan basis.   Madam Speaker, these vote totals demonstrate that just about  everyone--Republican and Democrat--agrees that this commonsense  legislation will indeed help grow our economy.   H.R. 1219 specifically increases the limits on the number of  individuals from 100 to 250 who invest in certain venture capital funds  before those funds are forced to register with the SEC as ``investment  companies.'' This change would permit angel and venture funds to better  help accredited investors invest in small-business startups. These  early stage investors play a vital role in helping many small  businesses get their start. In 2015, angel investors deployed nearly  $25 billion to 71,000 different startups across our Nation. In the  first quarter of 2017, venture capital invested more than $16 billion  in almost 1,800 startups.   If anyone here, for some reason, doubts the impact these investors  can have on our Nation's economic growth, let me remind them that  companies such as Amazon, Costco, Google, Facebook, and Starbucks were  all first funded by angel investors. Let's also remember, Madam  Speaker, that almost half of the people who work in this country own or  work for small  [[Page H2766]]  businesses. They create nearly historically two-thirds of the new jobs  in America. So clearly our economy works better for working Americans  when small businesses thrive and have access to capital and credit they  need to innovate, expand, and create jobs.   The Supporting America's Innovators Act modernizes a regulation to  enhance the ability for startups and small businesses to receive  critical funding and capital from the private markets and, in  particular, angel investors and venture capital. Undoubtedly it will  help today's small-business startups become the next great American  entrepreneurial success story and, in doing so, help invigorate  economic growth and help create more American jobs.   I urge the adoption of H.R. 1219.
