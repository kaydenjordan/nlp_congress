 Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have an opportunity to  create substantive, innovative, and cost-effective legislation that  will bring jobs and economic growth to America through an  infrastructure bill.   As co-chair of the New Democratic Coalition's Infrastructure Task  Force, we are actively drafting policy priorities to be considered for  a House infrastructure bill. It is important to have Americans of all  sectors' voices as we do this, and last week the infrastructure  listening sessions were hosted by Representatives Colin Allred and Marc  Veasey in Dallas and   Joe Cunningham in Charleston.   New Democrats are intensely focused on receiving and implementing  forward-looking and practical ideas to help everyday Americans use  infrastructure that supports job creation and advancement, multiple  forms of transportation, policy proposals to mitigate climate change,  and streamline bureaucracy.   It is my hope that the President and Republicans will join us as we  focus on four pillars for an infrastructure deal: modernize America's  infrastructure and seek new revenue, create an infrastructure bank to  finance the project, create incentives for communities most in need to  finance those projects through grant programs, and encourage innovation  and reform through responsible regulatory streamlining and the  utilization of public-private partnerships that work.   Building and renovating roads, bridges, ports, greener schools and  hospitals, and broadbands all need the support of Congress to advance  the flow of America's goods and services. It is what we need to do to  keep our dominance in the economy.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I join my colleagues today to speak out on  the President's intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement by  supporting H.R. 9 and specifically in support of Congresswoman  Gonzalez-Colon's amendment that is before the floor right now.   The President's intent to withdraw from the climate agreement is  perilous, misguided, and ignores the increasingly stark reality of the  impacts of climate change in our Nation as well as in the world.   Rising sea levels are already having devastating impacts on hundreds  of vulnerable communities across the country and around the world.   Last week, I visited Charleston, South Carolina, and listened to the  mayor of Charleston discuss how they were urgently working to heighten  the seawall in Charleston directly as a consequence of drastically  increasing carbon emissions, and likely related to warming sea water  and the rise in sea level and volatility that has caused so much  damage.   The catastrophic effects of global warming were manifested in 2017  and 2018 natural disasters, where the Nation saw unprecedented natural  disasters, from the deadliest wildfires in California to the worst  hurricanes that hit the East Coast and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands.   The vulnerability of the island territories is particularly  important, as they are isolated and have specific energy issues and  concerns that other places do not due to their isolation and being  surrounded by and part of the ocean environment.   Madam Chair, I thank Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon for her work on  this amendment, which requires a report on the impact of climate change  in the U.S. territories that pays particular attention and  consideration to their unique energy needs and systems and the climate  change vulnerabilities faced by communities in this jurisdiction.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and  passage of H.R. 9.
