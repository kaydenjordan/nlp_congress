 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Graves), the ranking member, and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Meadows) for their work on the issue, and Chairman DeFazio for his  support.   The General Services Administration is required to submit to the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and to the Senate  Committee on Environment and Public Works prospectuses that contain  information on proposed public projects for committee consideration.   In recent years, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,  as has been mentioned, has posted this information about these projects  on its website to provide access to the public and private entities.  While the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has become a  resource for the public, and even for Federal agencies, this bill, the  Transparency in Federal Buildings Projects Act, would require the GSA  to make publicly available on its website all prospectuses and  associated information, pursuant to the Public Buildings Act.   This sensible reform will ensure that taxpayers have more information  about how their hard-earned dollars are being spent and managed. The  bill would strengthen transparency and accountability in Federal  construction, renovation, and leasing projects, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.
