 Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his  comments. It reminds me of the days when I was the majority leader and  he was minority whip and we used to be able to have colloquies. I yearn  for those days again.   But let me respond to much of what the majority leader has said. I  respect the gentleman greatly, but I just think he is wrong.   When I walked in the room, the gentleman said we did not want to  meet. He knows that is not true.   Simply look at the board today, how many Republicans are here and how  many Democrats. We will give the gentleman an easy answer to that  question of who wants to meet.   Or why not look to simply a month ago. Only one side put a plan out  of how to bring Congress back.   We don't have a schedule. We don't know when we are supposed to come.  One day they say ``yes,'' the next day they say ``no.''   I think it is very clear which side wants to meet. It is very clear,  and based upon 231 years of history.   For those Members not in the Chamber and sitting in their office  watching on television, they ought to pay attention to this very next  vote. They are going to do something that no Member has ever been  allowed to do before. They are going to change history, but not for the  better.   While millions of Americans are going to be tuned in to their  television to watch us put people in space, we are going to watch more  than 70 Members on the Democrat side stay home and say they could not  make it, but they still want a paycheck.   We just listened to the majority leader question the Republicans on  whether they want to meet.   I watch my home State of California. Now we get to go to church, now  we can get our hair cut today, but in Congress, what do we get? We get  no accountability.   You see, the one thing the majority leader said that is true is that  people vote for us. Yes, they do. They vote for us, expecting us to  vote for them. They do not expect us to give that vote to somebody from  another State.   Our Constitution, our country expects us to convene, just as history  has shown every time before in any crisis we have.   I heard the majority leader question, not going through the Speaker,  but one of our own Members on a speech that he gave just a few minutes  before, Congressman Chip Roy, about whether he wanted to meet. Well,  let's look at some facts.   We are called back here to vote on a bill authored by Chip Roy, the  Congressman, to help small businesses, but his name will no longer be  on it. The only reason we are going to get a vote on it is because the  Speaker had to pledge to somebody to vote for the $3 trillion bill that  we would vote on.    Once we found out everybody loved the bill, lo and behold, we can't  let a Republican have their name on the bill, so we have changed the  bill number. We didn't change the bill, but took his name off of it. He  is no longer the main author of the bill, even though it was his idea.  It is something the Members can be proud of on the other side. They  played politics well that day.   Chip Roy will tell me, though, he doesn't care who gets the credit;  he just wants to help small businesses.   I look forward to seeing the Member who took his name try to campaign  on that. That is a lot of character on the other side, by far. I hope  they are proud of that, because I don't think anybody in the country  is.   Now, let's just look at some facts.   I respect the chairman of the Rules Committee. I read his reports.  Even in April, he wrote a report about proxy voting, and he questioned  the constitutionality of it. I don't know if the Constitution changed  between then and now, but I don't believe it has.   Let's look at exactly the facts of what we have.   Now, I think many Members will say in their own States that things  are getting better. I know in my home State, we can go to church; yes,  we can get  [[Page H2309]]  our hair cut; restaurants are opening up. But 2 weeks ago, people would  probably argue it was a little worse.   At that time, only 12 Democrats couldn't make it here to vote for  their $3 trillion bill. Now there are more than 70 who are supposedly  signing something to say they physically can't make it here now. I  wonder if any of them are having a fundraiser today.   Let's go through the facts.   The Constitution requires in-person assembly.   If we hang our hat on the notion that the House can make their own  rules, then why don't we make a rule that Republicans can't vote? Why  don't we make a rule that women can't vote? We can make the rules, but  we can't make unconstitutional rules.   The Constitution deals with this and tells us we should assemble.  Yes, that is why, on August 14, after this building burned in 1812, the  War of 1812-1814, they still convened. It wasn't here, but it was in a  hotel.   Some might think, oh, modern history allows us to do this. Well, do  you know what modern history allows people to do? If the Member can't  vote on the proxy, this rule allows the staff to do it. That is  literally what the rule says.   If the other side doesn't have it, I will put it in the Record right  here. I will underline it, and I will provide it to the other side. If  they want to read it out loud, they are more than welcome.         If a Member cannot provide electronically, a staff is       allowed to put the vote across.    That is what is written. That is what was passed.   Even one proxy vote dilutes the voting power of every Member.   We have an unbelievable country. The people lend their power and  voice to Members of Congress, be it a Congresswoman or Congressman, and  they hold us accountable every 2 years.   We are going to have people on this floor voting for more than five  Members from five different States.   In California alone, the largest delegation, more than half of the  Democrats stayed home. I will guarantee they all cashed their check  this month. That means 19 million people in California will not have  their voice heard. Maybe somebody from Connecticut will vote for them.   More than 70 Members will vote by proxy. That is 49 million Americans  who did not count because we gave it to somebody else. The other side  should be proud of that.   Proxy votes have never been allowed to count towards a quorum, but  what are we going to do on this rule? There will be more bodies voting  ``no'' than voting ``yes,'' but the other side is going to win because  they have got a vote in the pocket.   The Democrat plan permits a staffer to vote by proxy on behalf of a  Member who is unavailable. That is totally true. It is in the rules  right here, and I will provide it to the other side. Let me read it  into the Record since they have a hard time reading:         If a Member is unavailable to email or send a text message,       a staff member may transmit the instructions at the direction       of the Member.    Is that a staff member? Does that say anywhere in there that only a  Member can vote?   I have not yielded my time, but I have read these words.   A Member can vote by proxy while attending a political fundraiser  under this plan. A Member could be at a fundraiser watching on  television and say: Well, let me pause for one moment. I didn't want to  go back to D.C., even though you asked me to, but I need to put my vote  in. It is okay. I will get somebody from another State to do it.   The McGovern regulations state that Members can only vote using proxy  voting if they are physically unable to make it to the Capitol.   I don't know what happened in the last 2 weeks when only 12 could not  make it, but now there are more than 70. I am concerned for them. It  must be something very serious.   All Members had nearly 2 weeks' notice ahead for this vote; 2 weeks  we had to plan.   For 231 years, Members found a way to get to D.C.   If this rule or bill passes, it will only be because of proxy votes  that will make up the difference.   So my friend over there thinks someone is going to vote differently.  Yeah, they are.   Even on the Senate side, they have told us: Whatever you are passing  here under these rules is not constitutional.   If we can make this type of rule, we could make anything: People with  glasses can't vote--unheard of.                                time  1615    Yes, we raised a lawsuit. Yes, we believe in a previous question,  that people should vote ``no'' on this.   It is a violation of the Constitution. It is a dereliction of the  duty of elected officials. It will silence the voice of people, the  same constituents that you took the oath to represent.   I think of all the things this country had challenges with. Never did  this body not find it was essential to meet. Never did they question to  change the rule to empower one over another. But they have done just  that. They have done just that.   If you are a Member of Congress, if you are home, sitting there  because you cannot make it, and you think you are going to send your  message to your staffer to send it in, you might want to change because  maybe McGovern will change the rules now.   When you were sworn in, you held up your hand to uphold the  Constitution. This is your moment. This is your time. Read Article I,  Section 4, Section 5, and Section 6. We even compel people to go gather  you to bring you to these Chambers.   What is interesting to me is that the other side is willing to  endanger our Constitution just to empower more power to the majority  itself.   It will be interesting to see those who go back to their constituents  and say, I will represent you because I can just phone it in. I deserve  to be reelected because I passed us off to another Member to vote for  you.   It is interesting to find that maybe when you raised your hand, maybe  when you thought the Constitution changed, it hasn't.   So, yes, just as the majority leader said, he wants you to look into  your heart to how you are going to vote. Do that.   I hope we all come back to this floor and we all look up. I am not  sure how the vote will go. Will you have a little P by the name that  says a proxy?   Will we be able to tell by proxy that somebody from another State  voted for you so the rest of the country can see?   How will you tell the country today that is opening up more, that is  sending astronauts to space, that you want to close Congress further,  and you want to deny their voice one last time?   This is not about opening a campus. This is about restoring the voice  to the American public that we have done for 231 years. And for you to  ever question who wants to meet, let the public just see the scoreboard  at the end of the day.   I think it is easy to answer that question, not by voice, but simply  by your feet, who is willing to show and who is willing to work for  them.
