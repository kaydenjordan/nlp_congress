 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Scott for yielding and also  his leadership on the bill we are considering this afternoon, the  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.   Maine is the oldest State in the union by median age, and older  Mainers are an important part of our workforce. As we experience a  tight labor market with low unemployment, it is natural to think that  this workforce would have more opportunities available to them, and yet  we often hear about constituents who struggle to find and keep work  that supports themselves and their families.   When age discrimination is a factor, these workers deserve fair  treatment under the law. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the underlying  bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  [[Page H267]]    I am also proud to offer this important amendment with my colleague,  Congressman Davis, that addresses the connection between age and gender  discrimination. Countless studies have shown that women are hired less  and paid less in many fields. Compounded by the real effects of age  discrimination, that means older women are disproportionately impacted  by bias in the workplace.   The National Bureau of Economic Research backs this up. In a 2015  field experiment, resumes from older women got substantially fewer call  backs from employers than those from older men, younger men, and  younger women. Our amendment would direct the Department of Labor and  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect data on the  disproportionate impact of age discrimination on older women and make  recommendations for how to address that impact.   Women are deeply, materially harmed by inequities in our economy. On  average, they take home lower salaries, are able to save less for  retirement, and receive less in Social Security benefits.   In tandem with age discrimination, all this means that we are leaving  older women vulnerable. Addressing this intersection is about economic  security, making sure that older women have the chance to work in fair  environments for equitable pay.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, on January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court  ruled, 7-2, that women have the right to make their own healthcare  decisions and to legally access abortion care. Forty-seven years later,  our country has seen significant social and economic progress since Roe  v. Wade.   Seventy-three percent of Americans support keeping Roe v. Wade the  law of the land. They agree we can't go back. And yet, nearly 50 years  after Roe became settled law, abortion is still under attack by extreme  politicians who believe the government should dictate whether and when  to have a child.   From 2011 to 2018, States across our country enacted 424 separate  restrictions on abortion. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned on a promise  of appointing Justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade, and he has  appointed more than one-quarter of all active judges to date.   His administration has pushed a domestic gag rule to prohibit doctors  from telling women about their legal right to access abortion and  slashed access to family planning funding in the process.   As we honor the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we must expand abortion  access for women across the country and stand up to the senseless  attacks on women's health.                            ____________________
