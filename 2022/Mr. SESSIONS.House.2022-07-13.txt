 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Pappas, or as  it might be, the Pallone 399 amendment.  [[Page H6456]]     Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Mr. Pallone, for  being here tonight.   This opportunity for us to speak deserves to be placed within the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has the jurisdiction on this  matter, the jurisdiction that is very important to the United States  and to our friends from Greece. But it also is important to our friend  Turkey, who stands, as a NATO ally, ready, prepared to help the United  States and its NATO allies in the defense of a region of the world that  is important.   It is important for us to note that the conversation about this  really needs to take place within the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I  think the chairman and the ranking member are very able to discuss it.   A report to Congress was made from this last prior administration  that directly speaks about exactly the circumstances that Mr. Pallone  speaks of. The United States Government sent this Section 211, PL 116- 94, and they said: ``The United States Government is not in a position  to provide a list of confirmed violations of Greece's territorial  airspace.''   This is a basis of what this amendment is about. First, Greece claims  territorial space that extends up to 10 nautical miles from its  coastline and its territorial sea up to six nautical miles. Under  international law, a country's territorial airspace coincides with its  territorial sea space also.                                time  0030    In this instance, Greece treats these differently. Although Greece  currently claims up to 6 nautical miles of territorial sea around the  many islands that it has, its neighbors have not come to a boundary  delineation upon those areas. Thus, Turkey, which stands directly next  to many of these islands, looks at international law.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to recognize at this  time, not just with the United States but with the war that is going on  between Russia and Ukraine, that NATO be prepared to have its top- flight--not just fighters--but the equipment that would be necessary. I  believe this discussion, although I recognize it was made in order by  the Rules Committee, should be placed directly within the Foreign  Affairs Committee.   There needs to be a discussion to resolve this between America's  friends, Turkey and Greece, and depend on them to be able to resolve  this matter, not put this into the National Defense Authorization Act,  which does not have jurisdiction in this matter. We should not invoke  the United States military into this when, in fact, it should be  something that is done by the State Department.   I have great respect for the gentleman, Mr. Pallone. I have great  respect for the Rules Committee, which I sat on for 20 years. But this  issue entirely, from start to finish, belongs upon what might be the  foreign sales of assets that are military oriented. That jurisdiction  is not in the Armed Services Committee.   I stand in opposition, and I ask that the gentleman withdraw his  amendment solely based upon a jurisdictional issue, the need for the  United States of America, the need for NATO and Turkey, as a very  reliable member, to be able to have those things that it would need.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for hearing our argument  tonight, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the gentleman.   First of all, the congressional review of all arms exports is done  through the Foreign Affairs Committee, not through the Armed Services  Committee.   Secondly, it is in America's best interests. One argument could be  made perhaps about Ukraine until Russia attacked. It is now a war that  the United States is funding to huge numbers of appropriations amounts.  There is great concern about not just food shortages but the  destabilization of that area of the world.   We, the United States, as a major supporter of NATO, count on all the  NATO nations there that are part of that to have the top-flight--not  only equipment--but the ability to effectively avoid a further war by  them working together.   I would say two points that the gentleman raised. First, the Armed  Services Committee does not have jurisdiction, and secondly, it is very  much in the United States' best interest to make sure that Turkey has  top-line F-16 fighters.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
