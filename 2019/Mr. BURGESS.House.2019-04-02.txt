 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Madam Speaker, we are here again considering one nonbinding  resolution and a second resolution that will never become law. Both of  these prevent us from focusing on the real business of Congress, which  is to legislate.   The first, H. Res. 271, is a resolution condemning the Trump  administration's recent position in the case of Texas v. United States.   So let's revisit that for a minute. Republicans are supportive of  protecting access to health insurance for individuals with preexisting  conditions. This resolution today will not advance the development of  any policies to improve healthcare for the American people. There are  options that the Democrats could have brought to the floor to lower  healthcare costs and increase access to care; such legislation would  indeed be worthy of our time. But, instead, we are debating expressions  that basically amount to political posturing.   The first vote the Republicans called this year was a motion to  require legislation protecting individuals with preexisting conditions.  Surprisingly, the Democrats voted against that previous question. In  2017, as part of the proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act,  Republicans included legislation that would have preserved access for  those with preexisting conditions.   Speaker Pelosi has already intervened on behalf of the House in Texas  v. United States. While the Department of Justice has weighed in, the  department is not litigating the case. As with every other legal case,  this will play out in the courts. If Congress must act following the  final legal decision, certainly we stand ready to do so. In fact, if  the Democrats wanted to void this case, they know their options. They  could repeal the individual mandate or they could reinstitute the tax  on the individual mandate or they could provide a severability clause  that was somehow left out when the Affordable Care Act was passed the  first time. But we have seen them do none of those options.   The legal process will take time, and no Americans will lose access  to their healthcare while the legal process is being heard. Unlike the  case of Texas v. United States--which we know will not affect coverage  because the judge in that case has issued a stay--individuals covered  by what are known as association health plans may actually lose their  coverage due to uncertainty in the legal outcome of that case. For last  week, a Federal judge in the case of the State of New York, et al. v.  Department of Labor, last week a Federal judge ruled that the  Department of Labor's final rule on association health plans was not  legal.   Association health plans provide employers who otherwise might  struggle to provide health insurance for their employees to access the  group market through an association, based either on geography or a  line of business. The Washington Post recently reported that there are  initial signs that association health plans are ``offering generous  benefits and premiums lower than found in the ObamaCare marketplaces.''   Association health plans have provided additional choices for  Americans seeking innovative healthcare options, but these choices may  soon disappear as a result of the lawsuit State of New York, et al. v.  the Department of Labor.   The Democrats are using the case of Texas v. United States to delay  explaining their real ideas. Their real idea is a one-size-fits-all  healthcare. The so-called Medicare for All would be a terrifying  reality for our Nation. The Democrats' Soviet style, government-  [[Page H2950]]  run, single-payer healthcare bill would not provide access to quality  healthcare for Americans. Instead, it would lead to a massive tax  increase, eliminate private insurance, and bankrupt the already  dwindling Medicare trust fund.   Constituents in my district back in Texas are struggling to afford  their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and I am certain  that we are not the only ones suffering from high premiums and very  high deductibles.   Madam Speaker, what good is health insurance if you are afraid to use  it because you can't afford your deductible?   This is an issue that I would actually like to see us tackle. But I  am confident that a government-run, single-payer system would only  further deteriorate our Nation's healthcare.   As the son of a physician who chose to leave Canada because of their  system of socialized medicine, I worry that the central state control  of healthcare would further damage the doctor-patient relationship. As  a physician, I do not believe that the government should hinder a  doctor's ability to act in the best interest of his or her patient. I  wish the concept of government dictating a physician's practice and  decisions was unthinkable, but I find myself here today having to  deconstruct the idea of further government control of healthcare.    The House Democratic proposal would implement a global budget, and  once that has been set, hospitals and institutions would be required to  stick to that for all outpatient and inpatient treatment.   What happens if the budget runs out?   Are the patients simply told: Sorry, we ran out of money, you may try  again next year?   Today we should be focusing on the parts of the health insurance  market that are working for Americans. For example, 71 percent of  Americans are satisfied with their employer-sponsored health insurance.  This provides robust protections for individuals with preexisting  conditions under ERISA law--a 1970 law, not the 2010 Affordable Care  Act. Quite simply, the success of employer-sponsored insurance is not  worth wiping out for single-payer healthcare.   Since President Trump took office--and this is important--since the  President took office, the number of Americans in employer-sponsored  health coverage has increased.   How much has that increased?   I can't precisely tell you because our Congressional Budget folks  have not seen fit to give us new coverage numbers.   But since the President took office, how many people are employed  that were previously unemployed?   The number is somewhere between 3 and 6 million, and a significant  number of those individuals have employer-sponsored health insurance  who had no insurance before.                                time  1245    The coverage numbers under President Trump, if the story is ever  told, have gone up. Today, there is a greater percentage of Americans  in employer-sponsored health coverage than at any time since the year  2000. That is why it is astonishing that House Democrats would want to  abolish that insurance option entirely.   Instead of building on the success of our existing health insurance  framework, Democrats' radical single-payer, government-run policy would  simply tear it down. It would eliminate employer-sponsored health  insurance, eliminate all private insurance, eliminate Medicaid, and  eliminate CHIP.   Existing Medicare beneficiaries would not be exempt from harm, as the  policy would raid the Medicare trust fund, which is already slated to  go bankrupt in 2026.   Our Nation's seniors count on the existence of Medicare for their  retirement healthcare needs. They have paid into it their entire  working lives. How are we supposed to inform them that not only do the  Democrats want to endanger their access to Medicare services, but,  unbelievably, they will want to increase their taxes also?   There is no question that this policy could be catastrophic for  America's patients today and for generations to come.   At least now there is some degree of honesty. Remember, a previous  administration said, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  Now at least there is some degree of honesty.   You can't keep your doctor. You can't keep your insurance. You can't  keep your personal liberty. You get nothing. Effectively, it would end  all the parts of our healthcare system that are, in fact, working for  the American people.   Quite simply, single-payer healthcare would be another attempt at a  one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. We know this: Americans are  all different. A universal healthcare plan will not meet the varying  needs of each and every one of us as individuals. Single-payer is not  one-size-fits-all. It is really one-size-fits-no-one.   Again, to restate the obvious: Since the beginning of this Congress,  we have heard it. Through the last Congress, we heard it. Republicans  support protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.   Instead of spending our time here today worrying about the judicial  branch, we could focus on our job as members of the legislative branch.  We should be actively working to better our healthcare system, not  spending time taking votes that will fail to accomplish any real  objective.   Madam Speaker, the second resolution included in this rule directs  the removal of the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the  Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.   We considered this resolution once before. At that time, Republicans  successfully passed a motion to recommit that declared the House's  opposition to anti-Semitism. However, this version of the bill does not  include that important provision, and we are again debating legislation  that is, in fact, based on a false premise.   The resolution is fundamentally flawed. United States forces are not  engaged in hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian- backed Houthi forces in Yemen. Previously, the United States was  providing midair refueling to Saudi Arabia but ceased this assistance  in November 2018. The United States continues to provide limited  intelligence-sharing and limited logistics support, which does not  amount to engagement in hostilities.   The Trump administration is focused on countering al-Qaida in the  Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State, mitigating the humanitarian  crisis in Yemen and assisting our allies.   The United States does not command, coordinate, accompany, nor  participate in counter-Houthi operations or any hostilities other than  those directed at al-Qaida and the Islamic State.   I might, here, just add: Those activities against the Islamic State  have been significantly successful over the last 2 years.   This resolution sets a dangerous precedent. America has a security  agreement with Saudi Arabia, just as we do with 117 other countries,  including our NATO allies Canada, Australia, South Korea, and Israel.  If this resolution were to become law, it could set a precedent that  could prevent us from assisting allies and prevent us from meeting our  treaty obligations. Rather than condemning a type of assistance that is  no longer being provided by the United States, we should be finding  ways to aid the millions of Yemenis at risk of starving to death.   Limiting how our forces can engage in the region will only further  exacerbate this conflict and not help bring it to a conclusion.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, here is one of the uncomfortable truths of the  Affordable Care Act: Under the law, every Member of Congress was  supposed to be covered under the Affordable Care Act. Obviously, the  pay and benefits of a Member in Congress exceed the subsidy limits, so  these would be unsubsidized healthcare.gov policies. But then-Speaker  of the House John Boehner, then-Leader of the United States Senate  Harry Reid, and President Obama himself all intervened. They were  fearful that Members of Congress might leave.   There might be a brain drain in Congress--if such a thing was, in  fact, possible--if Members of Congress were required to put their  health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, so they created an  exception for Members of Congress, and Members of Congress only. They  are the only people in the United States who can do this. There is a  tax-free subsidy that a Member of Congress can walk into the D.C.  exchange and get their coverage in the D.C. exchange.   I rejected that option because: Number one, I didn't think it was  right. Number two, I didn't think it was legal. I thought it was going  to be taken away from us. Apparently, no one else shared my concern  because it still exists.   It does make me wonder why we would not offer a health reimbursement  account, and I have brought this up several times in committee, where  that same tax-free subsidy could be available to any American to walk  into a health insurance plan of their choosing. Why not give the people  of the country what Members of the Congress so generously bestowed upon  themselves?   I didn't take the option to go into the D.C. exchange. I didn't take  the option of the tax-free subsidy that went along with it. I bought an  unsubsidized health insurance plan in healthcare.gov, signed up for it  October 1, 2012. Many of you may remember that. We were in the process  of shutting the government down at the time. It was in all the papers.   I started that process October 1, 2012. The check cleared the middle  of January 2013. I went that entire time not knowing if I would have  health insurance in healthcare.gov the next year because I couldn't get  an answer to any questions.   You couldn't call the people at healthcare.gov. You would try, and  you would be put on hold. You would stay on hold for a long period of  time. You would eventually get to talk to a person. You would get cut  off. You would have to start all over at the beginning. It was a  miserable process.   The point is, Members of Congress should have gone through that. We  should have had to deal with what we pushed off on the American people,  at least those people in the individual market.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), the Republican leader of the second oldest committee  in the United States Congress, the Committee on Ways and Means.    I have as many as I need.    It will be me.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to move a resolution that reinforces our long- held views that every American should have preexisting condition  protections.   On the opening day of the 116th Congress, House Republicans brought a  measure to the floor that called on lawmakers to legislate on locking  in protections for patients with preexisting conditions. Unfortunately,  in a fit of partisanship, the Democrats blocked this effort.   If the Democrats were serious, they would take up legislation  immediately to protect patients with preexisting conditions. Instead,  Democrats are trying to score political points.   Our position is simple and clear: Republicans stand ready to protect  those with preexisting conditions in a manner that will withstand  judicial scrutiny. This is why, if the previous question is defeated,  House Republicans will move a resolution that:   Maintains that no American should have their health insurance taken  away or lose protections for preexisting conditions due to the  Democrats in Congress enacting an unconstitutional law;   Instructs Congress and the Trump administration to immediately ask  the Court for a stay in this decision;   Guarantees that no American citizen can be denied health insurance or  coverage or charged more due to previous illness or health status;   Includes commonsense consumer protections;   Provides more choice and affordable coverage than the Affordable Care  Act;   Lowers prescription drug prices for patients;   Strengthens Medicare for current and future beneficiaries; and   Rejects the Democrats' radical, one-size-fits-all, government-run  healthcare that would outlaw the employer-based coverage of more than  150 million Americans.   Finally, it is important to note that Texas v. the United States, the  case that is working its way through the courts, did not immediately  end ObamaCare and will not affect insurance coverage or premiums for  calendar year 2019. Several legal steps remain before the courts reach  a final conclusion.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, if the gentleman is agreeable, I am  prepared to close.   So, in closing, while Republicans stand ready to legislate, we are  again considering unnecessary resolutions. The first seeks to condemn  the position of the Department of Justice in Texas v. the United  States, the case in which the Department of Justice is not a party.   As I have stated several times, Republicans support protecting  coverage  [[Page H2954]]  for preexisting conditions. I would hope we could work together to find  a way to make health insurance affordable for all Americans rather than  considering a divisive messaging resolution.   The resolution to remove the United States Armed Forces from  hostilities in Yemen is not only unnecessary, but may prevent future  assistance for our allies.                                time  1315    The brave men and women who are assisting Saudi Arabia in the fight  against al-Qaida and the Islamic State are working to find solutions to  the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Yemen, a mission for which  we should be unified in our support.   Madam Speaker, with that, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, and a ``no'' on the underlying measures.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
