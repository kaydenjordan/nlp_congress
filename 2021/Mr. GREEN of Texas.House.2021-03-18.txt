 Madam Speaker, it is said that a picture is worth  a thousand words. This is a picture of a symbol of national shame. It  is the Russell Senate Office Building. The Russell Senate Office  Building is named after Richard Russell, a racist and a bigot.   For 49 years, taxpayer dollars have gone into this facility. For 49  years, people have had to endure knowing that this facility is named  after a bigot.   I believe that it is time for change. It is time to take the name of  Richard Russell off this building. We don't have to name it in honor of  someone else. Let it revert to the name that it had prior to Richard  Russell; it was the Old Senate Office Building.   I ask that we do this, and I am going to write a letter to each and  every Senator explaining this and hoping that each and every Senator  will at some point decide that a building paid for with taxpayer  dollars should not be named in honor of a racist and a bigot.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, my constituent, Mr. Jose Escobar,  was living his American Dream, married to an American-born woman, two  American-born children, living in an American-built house, paying  American taxes. Yet when he reported to ICE, he was taken out of the  arms of his wife and babies, sent to El Salvador with $20 and the  clothes on his back. It took us more than 2 years to get him home, but  I went to El Salvador with his wife, and we brought him home.   Madam Speaker, I will support this legislation because I want no one  else to experience what Mr. Jose Escobar experienced.
