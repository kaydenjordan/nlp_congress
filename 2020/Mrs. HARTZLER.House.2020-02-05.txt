 Madam Speaker, the prestigious Milken Educator Awards  have been called the Oscars of teaching. I rise today to pay tribute to  a resident of Missouri's Fourth District who was recently honored as  one of the Milken Family Foundation's outstanding educators.   Melissa Fike of Oakland Middle School of Columbia, Missouri, has  taught for 14 years and was not told ahead of time about her award. She  was shocked to hear her name announced during a recent school assembly  packed by Oakland Middle School students and staff.   As a winner, she receives an award, the recognition of her  colleagues, and a check for $25,000.   Teachers make an indelible mark on the lives of young people through  their kind words, encouraging smiles, impartation of knowledge, or by  helping  [[Page H773]]  plant a seed that bears fruit in future years. Melissa Fike has  distinguished herself and made an impact that will be felt for years to  come.   Madam Speaker, I want to commend Melissa Fike on her great work  making a difference in the lives of so many young people and  congratulate her on this prestigious award.       Recognizing Morris Burger, Former President and CEO of Burgers'                                 Smokehouse     Madam Speaker, it is with great joy that I share news  of Morris Burger, former president and CEO of Burgers' Smokehouse of  California, Missouri, being inducted into the Meat Industry Hall of  Fame.   After serving his country in the Army, Morris returned home to run  the family business with the goal of producing the finest cured ham in  the country. The business was extremely successful and expanded  numerous times over recent decades to the point that its business  orders now exceed 500,000 hams and tens of thousands of pounds of  bacon, sausage, and specialty meats each year.   Morris retired in the 1990s, and the business is now run by the third  and fourth generations of Burger family members.   Morris Burger has left a legacy to be proud of as Burgers' Smokehouse  continues to epitomize quality, taste, and innovation, while playing an  active role in the community and remaining an influential leader in the  industry.   Congratulations, Morris Burger, for being inducted into the Meat  Industry Hall of Fame, a well-deserved honor.               Stop Drug Smuggling By Filling the Tunnels ASAP     Madam Speaker, last week, our U.S. Customs and Border  Patrol agents announced the discovery of a highly sophisticated,  illegal, 4,309-foot cross-border tunnel from Mexico into California  built by the drug cartels.   Unfortunately, while the tunnel was first found in August of 2019, it  will still take several months to close the tunnel as the agency  completes a mandatory environmental review and a lengthy contractor  bidding process.   In October of 2018, I visited the southern border and heard directly  from Customs and Border Patrol agents in Arizona, and I heard a similar  story.   The process of closing drug tunnels is arduous and time-consuming. It  often takes 3 to 4 months to abate this threat. That is unacceptable.   Last year, I introduced H.R. 3968, the Eradicate Crossing of Illegal  Tunnels Act, to address these problems.   This bill expedites the approval process by removing the unnecessary  red tape currently preventing our CBP agents from addressing this  critical vulnerability. It allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to  waive the environmental review and for indefinite contracts to be  secured so drug tunnels can be filled in a timely manner.   We need to ensure our Border Patrol agents have the tools necessary  to efficiently and effectively remove illegal access into our country,  hurting our community with illegal drugs. It is time to pass this  crucial legislation, and I call on my colleagues to support my bill.                            ____________________
