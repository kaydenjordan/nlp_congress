 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of my  godfather and uncle, William James Leavy--a life very well-lived, he  passed away February 16, 2021.   Bill Leavy was married to his wife, my aunt, Gloria, for 67 years.  They had three children: Cynthia, Cheryl, and Colleen, and one  grandchild, Jonathan.   Bill Leavy served in the United States Army in Korea in combat for  two full years, and the horrors that he must have seen.   In his later years, he worked as a letter carrier for the post office  and was awarded a 50-year gold membership in the National Association  of Letter Carriers.   His favorite pastime was poetry, and he was extremely proud of that;  and his family knew him as an ``Irish poet.''   I look back on a life very well-lived. He was my godfather; he was my  uncle; and he married the love of his life.   He fought for this country because he loved this country.   And if we could all honor all our veterans, and, tonight, Bill Leavy.  Thank you.                            ____________________
