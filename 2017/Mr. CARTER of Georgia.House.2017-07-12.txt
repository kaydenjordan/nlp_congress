 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support  of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act, because of its importance to  our healthcare system and the millions of people who depend on it. The  FDA Reauthorization Act is essential as we seek reforms to the way we  develop new drugs and therapies and the ways in which we are able to  get those to market.   Under this legislation, we are streamlining the approval process to  maintain the provisions that make our market, while making changes to  ensure new therapies aren't unnecessarily held up.                                time  1415    We have set benchmarks for reviews to ensure that the drug approval  process is moving along and doesn't get bogged down by bureaucratic red  tape. And most importantly, we are providing patients with a chance to  pursue new and innovative drugs that can really make a difference in  their life.   We have seen progress in the approval of rare disease drugs, helping  millions who suffer from diseases that often have no treatment. With  this bill, we can provide them with new opportunities.   Additionally, we will be able to see more generics entering the  market, increasing competition and driving down costs for consumers.   I applaud Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, and all of my colleagues  on the committee for helping to get this essential legislation to the  finish line.
