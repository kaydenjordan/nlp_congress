 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of two pieces of  legislation. First, H.R. 6216 will designate the United States Postal  Service facility in Montrose, Colorado, after Sergeant David  Kinterknecht, who was killed in the line of duty on July 25, 2009.   Sergeant Kinterknecht was born and raised in Montrose, Colorado, and  graduated from Mesa State College and Delta Montrose Technical College.  His career in law enforcement began in the 1980s, and throughout his  career, he served in the Telluride Marshal's Office, San Miguel County  Sheriff's Office, and the Montrose County Sheriff's Office.   The second bill, H.R. 6217, will designate the Postal Service  facility in Grand Junction, Colorado, in the Third Congressional  District after Deputy Sheriff Derek Geer, who was killed in the line of  duty in 2016. Deputy Sheriff Geer went to school in Grand Junction and  eventually raised his family there. He was a U.S. Navy veteran, and  after his Navy service, he went into the Mesa County Sheriff's Office  for 15 years.   Both Sergeant Kinterknecht and Deputy Sheriff Geer were respected law  enforcement officers dedicated to public service and family men. Their  deaths were mourned by people throughout the Third District and the  State of Colorado. Passage of H.R. 6216 and H.R. 6217 will help  preserve and honor the memories of these police officers in their  communities.                            ____________________
