 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 667 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

The       Speaker or his designee shall consult with the Minority       Leader or her designee on the designation of any matter for       consideration pursuant to this section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), my dear friend, who is the ranking member of the Rules  Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation.   This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3312, the Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act of 2017; and the conference report  accompanying H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and JOBS Act.   Mr. Speaker, this rule, and specifically the underlying conference  report, is the reflection of a bicameral agreement between the United  States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, whereby  we took some of the best ideas from across not only our conference, but  this country, and from our respective ideas to make a tax bill that  would combine them for the best interests of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that what we are doing here today is  that the Republican Party is relying upon the greatest system ever  invented: the free enterprise system.   The free enterprise system has brought the United States of America  not only the greatest economic opportunities in the world, but it is a  system of rule of law. It is a system of a Tax Code. It is a system of  ideas that has made America the envy of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I also get politically what is happening. We are taking  what the Democratic Party and President Obama did to raise taxes by $1  trillion, the largest tax increase in the history of the United States,  and we are trashing that today.   We are saying that the production that it made of 1.2 percent over 8  years is unacceptable to the United States of America. It was  unacceptable then, and we will not allow that to be the gauge that we  will measure our success in the future.   Secondly, we are also going to deal properly and fairly with the  Affordable Care Act, a law that placed extensive burdens not only on  people who did not want the healthcare bill that was placed forward,  but placed a tremendous cost on the middle class of this country and  the American people.                                time  1030    What we are doing today is bold. We are going to make the big deal  the big deal the American people want and need: a stronger, brighter  economic future.   It is a progrowth bill that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash  our free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses of every  size so job creators can focus on hiring workers, increasing paychecks  and growth.   Growth and competition are the keys to an expanding economy. More  jobs and increased wages in my home of Dallas, Texas, have allowed  Texas to lead the Nation not only in job creation, but to make us the  envy of the world. We are now going to do that for the entire United  States and help make back home for every Member of Congress competitive  in the world market.   With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, the  United States today has a broken Tax Code that has forced businesses to  not only move their jobs and research overseas; it has forced us to be  able to strand billions of dollars of economic advantage that should be  in the United States.   That changes today. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will stop and reverse  that trend. It will encourage American companies to bring their jobs  and their operations back to the United States by lowering corporate  tax rates to be competitive anywhere in the world at 21 percent and  encourages U.S. businesses to bring their foreign earnings home,  unleashing trillions of dollars in our economy. That is the future that  the Republican Party wants for the United States of America and the  free enterprise system.   The conference report also simplifies tax filing. It eliminates  costly special interest tax breaks. It protects the abilities of small  businesses to write off interest on loans and offers a first-ever 20  percent tax deduction to businesses organized as S corps, partnerships,  LLCs, and sole proprietorships. This will be a boom not only for the  stock market, which we have seen since the day after the election, but  we have seen a boom on Main Street as job creators and new small  businesses are seeking to reinvest not only in their business and in  their community, but for the opportunity to benefit workers in the  United States of America.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middle- income Americans who have been struggling--struggling for 8, now, 9  years--to get a handle on not only their ability to work with a broken  tax system, but the ability to work with their own local businesses to  make sure that their city succeeds, also.   It reduces the tax rate for low-income and middle-income Americans.  It increases and extends the child tax credit to more families and,  roughly, doubles the standard deduction. With this piece of legislation  today, legislation for middle-income families will allow them to be a  part of an economic growth model for years to come.   We are proud of what we are doing and delighted that we offer this  not only to the United States House of Representatives today, but to  the American people to see the Republican answer for economic growth  and development vitality for the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who serves on the Financial  Services Committee. Congressman Luetkemeyer, from St. Elizabeth, will  talk about a piece of this bill that is from the Financial Services  Committee.  [[Page H10192]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, by the way, the gentlewoman would want to  state that we are not taking this away. There will be a 1-year  transition. So, I am sorry, but it will not be Ebenezer Scrooge at  Christmas. It will be the bright lights of a big future that lies ahead  for us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to, if I could, advise the  gentlewoman that, to balance out the time, I am going to allow her to  have the next couple of speakers so that we can equal the time.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H10195]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Barton).   (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Lawrenceville, Georgia (Mr. Woodall), the Rules Committee designee to  the Budget Committee and the gentleman who sits with esteem on the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise the gentlewoman  that we are through with our speakers, that I will be closing, so I ask  that she go ahead and consume her time.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, the ranking  member of the Rules Committee, and really each of the members of the  Rules Committee for their diligence in working yesterday for a long  period of time.   As the Rules Committee met last night, not only to consider this, but  really to offer full and open debate, an opportunity was given for the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) to come and speak representing  the Democratic Party; the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), to come  and represent the Ways and Means Committee; and the distinguished  gentleman from The Woodlands, Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee, to come and thoughtfully articulate not only  the ideas behind this bill but what we are going to do.                                time  1130    Mr. Speaker, it is true that what we are doing is taking what was  done by President Obama and a Democratic majority in the House and the  Senate that raised taxes a trillion dollars, that, in 2008, 2009, 2010,  and 2011, really raided the American people by raising taxes on them,  by causing an economic downturn, a GDP rate of 1.2 percent--an assault  on not just the taxpayer, but on the free enterprise system.   It is true that we promised this last election, through the election  of Donald Trump, to Make America Great Again. Part of making America  great again means making Americans great again also, making Americans  not only proud of their country, but giving them an economic  opportunity, and that is what the Republican Party is doing here.   We have heard not only from Mike Kelly, Congressman Kelly, who spoke  about making America better, making the free enterprise system better,  we heard from Congressman Woodall about being in 24th place, which is  what America is, 24th in the world in doing business in a friendly  environment.   We cannot survive in 24th place--24th place--by keeping the current  Tax Code we have, where over and over and over we see not only  companies moving to other locations within the United States of  America, but moving offshore, stranding dollars, and jobs going with  that.   What we are attempting to do in this bill is to make America number  one, make America and the American worker number one again. We are  going to make the big deal the big deal for people wherever you live in  the United States. We are going to offer an opportunity for you to not  only be taxed less, but that business that is in your city, your State  that proudly they represent their hometown, they will have the  opportunity to now be competitive.   Forget this, ``Oh, Republicans want to move jobs offshore.'' That is  what we are sick and tired of hearing. We are sick and tired of hearing  that jobs and investments go overseas.   They are coming back to America because this places America, instead  of being the bottom wrung in terms of taxes, as the highest in the  world. We are going to go to where we are the most competitive, where  the American worker will stand a chance to stamp ``Made in America'' on  those items that they want, made from my hometown, the pride of  authorship of the middle class of this country, pride of authorship of  knowing not just is my country going to get better, but my community  and I will be better.   It is about financial responsibility, but it is also about the  integrity of the free enterprise system. The free enterprise system is  the greatest economic system in the history of the world. It will  continue to produce great and better things for so many people.   But, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Party tried to kill the free  enterprise system when they came after the free enterprise system. We  knew it and we saw it, and the world saw it, too. 1.2 percent GDP  growth as opposed to, now, with a new viewpoint about making America  great, we have not only doubled GDP, but we have added, net, 1 million  jobs. If the summer had not produced the storms it had, no telling what  our job growth would be.   This is what lies ahead, and this is what this Republican bill does.  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill on this conference report.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
