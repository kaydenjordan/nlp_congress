 Mr. President, the core business of our Nation does  not stop while we fight the coronavirus. This week, Senate committees  are conducting oversight and holding hearings. Members are tracking the  implementation of the CARES Act. We are discussing how Congress could  do everything from further strengthening the health response to  ensuring that a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits does not redirect  the national recovery into a trial lawyer bonanza.   Here on the floor, we are filling major vacancies in the Federal  Government. Today, we will confirm Bill Evanina to lead the National  Counterintelligence and Security Center. As our Nation grapples with  challenges at home, it is critically important that a full complement  of skilled professionals keep a close watch on our foes, adversaries,  and competitors.  [[Page S2254]]        Mr. Evanina's nomination will make him the first Senate-confirmed  Director of the NCSC. This role represents our government's senior-most  expert in counterintelligence. Fortunately, this nominee has served for  3 decades as special agent with the FBI, as chief of the CIA's  Counterespionage Group, and as one of the principal advisers to the  Director of National Intelligence.   Mr. Evanina's long professional experience has given him a well- trained eye. He has made clear he is focused on the most serious  espionage threats facing our country today: China's insidious efforts  to steal our industrial, governmental, technological, and political  secrets and Russia's continuing efforts to meddle in our democracy. We  have a qualified professional who is tailor-made for an important job.  Our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee have reported him out on a  unanimous bipartisan basis twice. The vice chairman, Senator Warner,  said: ``Bill Evanina should be confirmed without further delay.''   But even still, our Democratic colleagues chose to obstruct his  nomination on the floor this week and require a full day of floor time  to confirm. Ironically, at the same time, we have also heard some of  our Democratic colleagues complain that we spend too much time voting  on nominations. It is bad enough to spend 3 years delaying nominations  to a historic degree and deliberately making the process painful, but  it reached a new level of irony for our Democratic friends to do all  that and then complain that their own strategy is inconveniencing their  schedules.   Essential matters of government do not cease because of the  coronavirus. They do not cease because of partisanship either. As long  as Senate Democrats continue to make incredibly qualified nominees  travel the hard way, including someone whom their own Democratic  ranking member openly praised, then, I will assure them they will need  to continue to show up and cast votes. The country's business will not  go undone.    Mr. President, has the Senate received the President's  veto message on S.J. Res. 68?    I ask unanimous consent that the veto message on S.J.  Res. 68 be considered as having been read, that it be printed in the  Record, and spread in full upon the Journal.    I ask unanimous consent that at 1:30 tomorrow, the  Senate vote on passage of S.J. Res. 68, notwithstanding the objections  of the President to the contrary.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 38, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 562, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 563, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, May 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the veto message on  S.J. Res. 68, under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:18 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 7, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
