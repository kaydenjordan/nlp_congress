 Mr. President, today I recognize Brandy Bunkley,  the Union County Teacher of the Year from Union County High School in  Lake Butler, FL.   Brandy has taught for 21 years and is the career specialist at Union  County High School. Her dedication and support for students has been  credited for the increasing graduation rate at the school.   Brandy believes that every voice has value and that every student  matters. As a teacher, she works to ensure her students are developing  clear and positive career paths for themselves and provides a caring  and enthusiastic support system.   Throughout her time at Union County High School, she has put a high  importance on the value of students' voices and as individuals by  forming strong teaching relationships with her students. She has  continuously proven that being an educator is deeply rooted in her  core.

After receiving this award, Kamille credited the relationships she  builds with her students as one of the reasons for her success. She  works with her students to improve their lives and considers improved  academic results a byproduct. When some students have behavioral  issues, she invites them to have lunch with her instead of writing a  referral, believing this to be an investment in their well-being.   Kamille's eighth grade geometry students score 21 percent higher than  any other school in her district and they outperform their ninth and  10th grade peers. Ninety-three percent of her algebra students pass  their end of course exam, an increase from the previous 50 percent  passage rate 2 years ago. She originally returned to Mount Dora Middle  School with the intention to retire in 2016 after first leaving in  1996. Instead, her students inspired her to continue teaching after  being surrounded by positive influences that reminded her why she  became a teacher.   Kamille earned her bachelor's degree in health education from the  State University of New York Cortland and her master's degree in  education from Florida State University. She has taught over a 32-year  span in Houston, TX, and several schools throughout Lake County. She  also worked as a curriculum specialist for math and science for middle  and high schools in the county.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Kamille for all the  fine work she has done throughout her career for her students and offer  my best wishes on her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Justen Early, the  Hernando County Teacher of the Year from Nature Coast Technical High  School in Brooksville, FL.   Justen's desire to become a teacher began when he first volunteered  as a football coach at Central High School. He became invested in the  success of his players, both on the football field and in the  classroom. From this experience, he decided his next step would be to  enter the classroom.   As a teacher, Justen seeks to build a camaraderie to make students  feel they are a part of a community. He focuses on his students  learning differences and encourages them to make teaching suggestions.   Justen attended Florida A&M University and currently teaches  technology support classes. He serves as the co-offensive coordinator  of the high school's football team. He has been with the school since  2014 and is grateful for his school's administration for providing him  the opportunity to teach. Justen credits his success to his mother,  grandmother, aunt, Mrs. Rosemarie Poluchowicz of the language arts  department, and Coach Rudolph Story for their mentorship.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Justen for his dedication  in helping his students succeed in life and offer my best wishes for  his continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Donelle Evensen,  the Flagler County Teacher of the Year from Rymfire Elementary School  in Palm Coast, Fl.

She tries each day to plan different ways to inspire and excite  students and teachers at her school.   Donelle previously spent 10 weeks backpacking through nine European  countries with her husband. This experience served as a reminder of  life back home and how we treat those around us and the true value of  all lives. She has brought this reflection to her classroom to share  with her students.   Donelle has been an educator for 13 years and currently is the  literacy coach for kindergarten through sixth grade at her school.
