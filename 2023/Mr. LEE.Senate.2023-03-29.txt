 Mr. President, I am here to stand in support of my friend  and colleague from Alabama, Senator Tuberville, as he stands in  opposition and raises his legitimate objections, which I share, to the  Department of Defense's plan to use Federal funds to facilitate the  performance of abortions.   Look, there has long been among the American people a pretty  widespread supermajority of Americans--Republicans and Democrats making  up that supermajority--who say, regardless of how they as individuals  feel about abortions, they don't want U.S. taxpayer dollars going to  fund or facilitate abortions. That overwhelming supermajority  preference for that is reflected in legislation that Congress has  enacted, codified in 10 U.S.C., section 1093.   So what has happened here is the Department of Defense has very  cleverly disguised and very cleverly meandered around that so to  technically comply with that statute. Instead of funding abortions and  performing them on Federal facilities with Federal resources, they are  facilitating, paying for the travel expenses--air, land travel, ground  travel, meals--giving 3 weeks of leave in order to perform these. So  they are still using Federal dollars to facilitate abortion, just in a  way that is carefully gerrymandered around the text of 10 U.S.C.,  section 1093.   Now, I want to echo what Senator Tuberville said a moment ago about  Senator Jack Reed. I have profound respect for him. I admire him as a  Senate friend and colleague, as the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee, as himself, somebody who has given enormously to his country  with his service through the military and otherwise.   I do want to respond to a couple of points that he made because I  don't think they lead where Senator Reed intended them to lead. He  repeatedly described this as a civilian policy decision. Yes, this does  embody a civilian policy decision, and it is a policy decision that is  fundamentally legislative in nature.   Now, if he wanted this made, he could have easily come to Congress.  The Congress, including the U.S. Senate, has long been deferential to  the Department of Defense when they come to us and say: We need this or  that. This will help us perform our mission to keep our Nation safe and  protected from threats to our national security. We are a pretty  generous bunch, especially when it comes to the DOD.    So why didn't they do that?   Well, I think they didn't do that--I know they didn't do that--for  one simple reason: They knew that the answer would be no.   So, yes, the civilian policy decision--the last I checked, the organ,  the branch, of the Federal Government that makes civilian policy  decisions that affect the country--that bind the country with law--is  this branch. We are the ones who get to set that. Now, sure. They are  authorized to make a number of their own internal operating decisions;  but whereas here, a policy is so blatantly at odds with the fundamental  spirit of the Federal statute enacted into law, they have gone around  us. They have carefully written it so as to gerrymander this policy  around 10 USC 1093. They wanted nothing to do with us. What Senator  Tuberville is doing here is standing up for our prerogative as  lawmakers.   Article I, section 1, clause 1 says:         All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a       Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and a House of Representatives.    They want to go around that. I get that. But when they want to go  around that and start doing our job, our prerogative is to tell them:  It is going to take you a little longer to get some people confirmed.   While, yes, it would be very inconvenient if they had to go through  the additional hoops--it is not impossible; they could do it; they  could start; they could get a number of people confirmed--they are  asking Senator Tuberville to make it easy for them. They want to have  their cake and eat it too. So if they want his cooperation, they need  to respect the legislative prerogatives of the Senate for which he is  standing today. I admire him for doing that and stand with him in this.   As far as not injecting politics--political decision making--into the  Department of Defense itself, he has got that exactly backward. He is  making a political decision overriding our prerogative to do that and  then blaming us for the issue.   Finally, with regard to Senator Reed's suggestion that we could deal  with this in the National Defense Authorization Act that is coming  before the Senate in the coming months, I get the point. If he is  serious about that, I would like to suggest something to Senator  Tuberville, and we can talk about this offline, perhaps after we vote.  I suspect that if the Department of Defense wanted to really stand  behind that, they could offer to suspend this regulation that they have  issued--this policy memorandum they issued on February 16--until such  time as we can debate it, discuss it, and work on it in the NDAA.   Look, let this be a message to Secretary Austin: If you want to make  the laws, run for Congress; but you can't legislate from the E-Ring at  the Pentagon. You cannot do that. Until then, stand down and leave the  lawmaking to lawmakers.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 30 seconds. I  would love to respond to that point.    To the Senator from Hawaii, I would be happy--I would be  thrilled--to accept that request, and I will accept it right now. I  can't speak for Senator Tuberville, but I can speak for myself. I will  absolutely accept that right now. Let's get them all done. Get the  Pentagon to lift this policy--to suspend it--until we can get it ironed  out in the NDAA. I will agree to that right now. If this is as bad, as  dire, as apocalyptic, dogs and cats living together in the streets,  Book of Revelation stuff, as you describe it, then we should do that.  But lift the policy. You can't legislate from the E-ring of the  Pentagon. We will stand up for our rights. And we must.
