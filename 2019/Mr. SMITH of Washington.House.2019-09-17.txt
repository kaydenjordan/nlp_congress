 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  [[Page H7738]]  take from the Speaker's table the bill (S. 1790) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the  Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense  activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House; to strike out all after the  enacting clause of such bill and insert in lieu thereof the provisions  of H.R. 2500 as passed by the House; to pass the Senate bill, as  amended; and to insist on the House amendment thereto and request a  conference with the Senate thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands:  This provision is actually completely irrelevant. It will impact  nothing, from a substantive standpoint.   There is no way our troops are going to be harmed whether we pass  this instruction or whether we follow this instruction or not. That is  important to understand.   We authorize military construction projects, when we authorize them,  for 5 years. Every single project that the President has listed as the  ones that he has stolen the money from to build the border wall that  Congress expressly said they did not want to spend this money on is  already authorized.   Whether or not we put an additional authorization into the fiscal  year 2020 defense bill is, literally, irrelevant.                                time  1745    It has no impact whatsoever on whether or not the troops, their  families, whatever the construction projects are, get funded or not.  That will be a DOD decision. They have the authority to do it. How do  they wish to spend their money?   So please don't let anyone say on this motion to instruct that if you  don't vote for it, you are voting to not fund these projects. You are  not. All of them are authorized for 5 years. There are a couple of  projects that were first authorized in 2016, but we are in that 5-year  window for every single project in question, so this has nothing to do  with that.   What this amounts to is a sense of Congress on whether or not we  ought to allow a President to effectively steal $3.6 billion out of the  Pentagon's budget for his own personal policy desire that Congress has  already said they shouldn't.   And in a bipartisan way, I am quite certain, but for the politics  surrounding this issue, that Congress would emphatically say ``no.'' If  we pass a defense budget that says this is where you ought to spend the  money, we are not saying, Mr. President, here's a piggy bank. Have fun  with it. Okay? If you find something, and it is $3.6 billion out of the  military construction fund--it is actually a little over $6 billion  total that the President took out of the FY19 defense budget to build a  wall that Congress said they did not want.   I think this has huge implications and, as members of the Armed  Services Committee, we ought to be alarmed about this. And I can  guarantee you that if President Obama had done this to the defense  budget, for any reason, there would have been no end to the fury about  it, and rightly so. Because if we are going to say, Look, the defense  budget is crucially important--in fact, particularly the members of the  minority party in this body have frequently  [[Page H7740]]  argued that the defense budget is underfunded. They will give you  chapter and verse and, in fact, did just a couple of months ago, about  all the areas in our defense budget that don't have enough money.   Now they are standing up and saying, as short as the defense budget  is, as much as we have claimed that there is not enough money in the  defense budget, we are perfectly okay with the President taking $6  billion out of it for something that has nothing to do with the  Department of Defense. That is an appalling position for any member of  the Armed Services Committee to take.   This motion to instruct, while irrelevant substantially, does give us  the opportunity to express the sense of Congress that this should not  be done for any purpose.   It is worth noting that we had a big fight about 6, 7 months ago when  we shut down the government. The President said he wanted to have his  wall funding, and we entered into a negotiation and, at the end of it,  I think we came up with about $1.5 billion that we allowed the  President for his wall. So we had that fight.   And after that fight, he decided that the Pentagon was just one big  piggy bank; that what we do over here is all kinds of irrelevant. We  are throwing money out there and the President can grab it for any  purpose.   I will just close by saying, I disagree with one statement that the  distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee said, and  that is, you know, We can all argue about who is responsible for this.   Seriously?   It is pretty clear who is responsible for this. The President of the  United States decided to take this $3.6 billion out of existing  Pentagon projects and spend it on his wall after Congress said they  didn't want it to be done.   Now you want to argue that he should have, because for whatever  reason, that is fine. But there is no question why we are here. And  there is no question that if Congress endorses this, if Congress says  it is okay for the President of the United States to use the Pentagon  as his own personal piggy bank--personal is a bit of an overstatement;  I understand this is policy--but basically to decide to spend money  wherever he wants to spend it, irrespective of what we say, why are we  even here?   Why do we even bother to authorize what the Pentagon is doing?   So, again, these projects are already authorized. If the Pentagon  wants to go find the money in the $738 billion that we have now all  agreed that we are going to spend, they can go find it. But there is no  way that the United States Congress ought to even irrelevantly endorse  this particular action by the President.   I would strongly urge every Member to reject this motion to instruct.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to quickly point out, again, this doesn't make any difference  in terms of whether or not these projects get funded.   Then, second, I think the gentleman is correct. This is a debate  about whether or not it makes sense to spend money on the wall. But I  just want to emphasize two points about that:   One, regardless how you feel about the wall, you should not be in  favor of being able to simply take the money out of the Pentagon to pay  for it.   Second, the border crisis that we have is not going to be even  remotely alleviated by a wall. The border crisis that we have right now  is asylum seekers pouring up to the border and turning themselves in.  Now, there are all kinds of challenges associated with that, no  question, and all kinds of policies that have led to that happening.   I think it is absolutely shameful right now the way the United States  of America is handling this. So many people are seeking refuge from  violence and horrific conditions, and we are treating them horribly;  and there is a lot that we need to do to change that.   But building a wall will not stop asylum seekers. It is a billion- dollar waste of money focusing on a campaign promise instead of  focusing on the actual problem that we have. But, again, that is a  debate that Congress should have. They should not have it out of the  Pentagon budget. This is the wrong place for it.   I urge Members to reject this Presidential grab of money out of the  Pentagon that would set a very dangerous precedent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 12 of rule  XXII, I move that meetings of the conference between the House and the  Senate on the bill (S. 1790) to authorize appropriations for fiscal  year 2020 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for  military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of  Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year,  and for other purposes, may be closed to the public at such times as  classified national security information may be discussed, provided  that any sitting Member of Congress shall be entitled to attend any  meeting of the conference.
