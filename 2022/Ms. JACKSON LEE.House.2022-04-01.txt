 Mr. Speaker, I thank the lead sponsor, Chairman  Nadler, for problem solving, along with Mr. Blumenauer, Mr. Cohen,  Congresswoman Lee, and all of those who galvanized all of us. I was  pleased to be able to lead this through the Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security Subcommittee.   The war on drugs simply failed, and I am glad that one interpretation  that has just been evidenced by my good friend on the other side of the  aisle will have little weight and little basis because what we are  doing here is solving a problem.   Let me just indicate from the Health Affairs Culture of Health, a  Black person is still nearly four times more likely to be arrested for  cannabis possession than a White person.   To summarize this bill, it deals with Federal decriminalization,  taxation, and expungement. It does not stop the DA, the Department of  Justice, the FBI or anyone else from doing their job. The bill would  remove cannabis from the list or schedule of federally controlled  substances.    This means that, going forward, individuals can no longer be  prosecuted federally for marijuana offenses. This does not mean that  marijuana would now be legal throughout the United States. The bill  would simply remove the Federal Government from the business of  prosecuting marijuana cases, which would leave the question of legality  to individual States. Forty-seven States already have some form of  legal use of marijuana.   Let me share, my friends, the points that they are going to make. The  bill was designed to help individuals who have been caught up in the  criminal justice system for possessing more small amounts of marijuana  for personal use. It was not designed to help drug traffickers.   By the way, the President has given over a billion dollars to Ukraine  as one of the steadfast leaders and has galvanized NATO and our allies,  and not one of us needs to challenge the President or any one of us in  our fight to help Ukraine.   Let me make it very clear about crime. Read the President's budget.  He has a massive piece in there to reduce crime. It is everywhere,  including rural America, where Republicans say they are, but I don't  look at it that way. It is Americans, we stand together. This bill is  about America.   The expungement provisions are limited to nonviolent marijuana  possession convictions that have loaded up our Federal prisons. If an  individual has other criminal convictions in addition to a covered  nonviolent offense,  [[Page H4093]]  marijuana offense, the bill already includes a stated exemption for  drug kingpins, meaning anyone who received an increased sentence for  being a leader or organizer of drug trafficking will not qualify for  expungement.   Once this bill is passed, it would enable individuals to possess and  use marijuana for personal use. Marijuana will be regulated as a  commodity, but let me tell you what else will happen. We will be able  to research, the scientists will be able to study what is happening to  our young people, our juveniles if that is the case. We have a  definitive position in there about helping those who may become  addicted. We do not overlook those who might as well be using it, so  let us go forward with this bill. I ask support for the bill.   This bill was designed to help individuals who have been caught up in  the criminal justice system for possessing small amounts of marijuana  for personal use. It was not designed to help drug traffickers.   The expungement provisions are limited to nonviolent marijuana  possession convictions only. If an individual has other criminal  convictions in addition to a covered nonviolent marijuana offense,  those other convictions will not be expunged. The bill already includes  a stated exemption for ``drug kingpins,'' meaning anyone who received  an increased sentence for being a leader or organizer of drug  trafficking will not qualify for an expungement.   Once passed, this bill would enable individuals to possess and use  marijuana for a personal use. Marijuana will be a regulated commodity  like alcohol and the transportation, distribution, or selling of  marijuana without complying with federal regulations will continue to  be illegal. For example, an individual will not be able to transport  marijuana across the border without complying with import regulations  and appropriate tax requirements.   The bill already includes a requirement that a study be conducted to  understand the societal impacts of decriminalizing marijuana, including  the impact on juveniles, education, transportation, veterans,  employment, and many others.   Because marijuana will now be considered a commodity or good to be  sold and purchased, like alcohol and even cigarettes, the MORE Act  preserves the FDA's ability to issue regulations to address the  regulation, safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing,  labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis derived  compounds.   Cannabis will be regulated along the same lines as alcohol and  cigarettes, which have age requirements for consumption, sale, and  purchase.   Regulation of cannabis protects children and minors because the black  market and street dealers are not required to ask for the age or ID of  their customers, unlike permitted and regulated sellers.   Driving while impaired is illegal in the United States. The MORE Act  does not change this fact.   Impaired driving occurs when someone operates a vehicle while  impaired by a substance like marijuana, or any other drug, including  prescribed and over-the-counter medicines, or alcohol. Law enforcement  officers are trained to detect impairment of drivers by substances  other than alcohol through field sobriety tests.   Many states have supported the establishment of Drug Recognition and  Classification programs within their State and local police, and the  training of special Drug Recognition Experts, which are law enforcement  officers trained to identify drug-impaired driving using a 12-step,  standardized evaluation that includes behavioral tests and physical  assessments to determine impairment among seven categories of drug  classification.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3617, the  Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021, or the  MORE Act of 2021.   I am pleased to support this long-overdue measure and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the MORE Act, which is an  important step in our continuing efforts to reform the criminal justice  system, and I commend our Chairman for introducing this bill once  again.   To summarize, the provisions of the MORE Act fall into three main  categories--federal decriminalization, taxation, and expungement.   First, the bill would remove marijuana, or cannabis, from the list-- or schedule--of Federally controlled substances. This means that, going  forward, individuals could no longer be prosecuted, federally, for  marijuana offenses. This does not mean that marijuana would now be  legal throughout the United States--the bill would simply remove the  Federal government from the business of prosecuting marijuana cases and  would leave the question of legality to the individual States.   Those states choosing to decriminalize can do so, without ongoing  interference from the Federal government, and those states that choose  to continue to make marijuana illegal can continue to do so, as well.   Second, the bill would establish a taxation structure to collect a  sales tax on marijuana, which, over the course of five years would  increase from five to eight percent. The funds collected from this tax  would be used to establish a trust fund to reinvest in communities  ravaged by the War on Drugs, particularly communities of color.   The trust fund would be used for rehabilitation and reentry programs  in the Department of Justice and for programs in the Small Business  Administration to ensure that participants in the burgeoning marijuana  market are diverse and provide opportunities for entrepreneurship in  communities that have been adversely impacted by the War on Drugs.   Finally, the bill would expunge and seal Federal marijuana arrests  and convictions and resentence offenders, as appropriate--a much-needed  measure of this bill to attempt to undo some of the damage done to  black and brown communities by decades of unjust enforcement.   Thousands of men and women have suffered needlessly from the federal  criminalization of marijuana, particularly in communities of color, and  have borne the burden of collateral consequences that have damaged our  society across generations, such as the denial of affordable housing,  educational opportunities, and employment.   The laws enacted for the purpose of perpetuating the ``War on Drugs''  have led America to imprison more people than any other country.   Expunging and sealing the arrest and conviction records of people  affected by the cannabis laws would remove barriers that helped create  a permanent second-class status for millions of Americans.   Our outdated federal laws and policies unwisely require scarce law  enforcement resources to be expended on cannabis offenses while  conflicting with many states' laws regarding cannabis.   Cannabis does not fit the definition of a Schedule One drug and  federal law must be updated to reflect this reality--just as most  states have already begun to do.   Public support for legalization has surged.   Thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam  have adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis. And eighteen  states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands have  adopted laws for legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use.   A total of 47 States have reformed their laws in one form or another  pertaining to cannabis, despite its continued Federal criminalization.   The State legal-cannabis industry already employs almost a quarter of  a million people, and the federal government needs to get out of the  way of state-level decision making.   We need to open the door to research, therapeutic treatment for  veterans, better banking and tax laws, and we need to help fuel  economic growth within the industry.   We need to do all of this without continuing to spend federal  resources on criminalization and unjust incarceration for marijuana  offenses. Congress needs to pass the MORE Act.   That is why I support passage of this bill today and ask my  colleagues to do so, as well.   I thank our Chairman Jerry Nadler, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and  Congressman Earl Blumenauer for their commitment to this potentially  life-changing bill.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Health Affairs'  ``Culture of Health,'' which shows the importance of cannabis  liberalization policy, and a letter from all of these individuals,  religious groups, and the Center for American Progress.                      [From HealthAffairs, July 2021]          Cannabis Liberalization in the US: The Policy Landscape         The cannabis--or marijuana--policy landscape has shifted       rapidly in past decades, with increasing numbers of states       decriminalizing cannabis possession and legalizing its       medical and recreational uses. Yet under federal law,       cannabis remains prohibited because of the potential for drug       misuse and negative health consequences. This disconnect       between federal and state law has allowed a for-profit       commercial industry to flourish in many states, absent       consistent regulation to ensure product safety. Increasing       cannabis accessibility in the states thus raises important       public health concerns while expanding certain therapeutic       opportunities. A second Health Affairs Health Policy Brief       accompanying this one explores the health effects of cannabis       legalization. It is also important to understand the       framework of policies governing legal cannabis markets, as       each policy category likely has differential impacts on       health benefits and harms associated with canna-bis use and       inconsistencies across jurisdictions have important       population health implications.                           Federal Cannabis Policy         The US federal government began taxing cannabis production       and sales by enacting the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 only       after most states had prohibited the substance. In 1970, this       law was replaced by the Controlled Substances Act, which       designates marijuana as a Schedule I substance considered to       have high abuse potential and no accepted medical use. Under       federal law, the production, sale. possession. and       distribution of cannabis can carry fines and prison time.        During the Obama administration, the federal government       relaxed its enforcement of cannabis-related crimes. In a       series of executive actions, culminating in the 2013 Cole       memorandum, the Department of Justice deprioritized       prosecution of federal cannabis crimes in states where these       activities were legal and robustly regulated. First passed in       2014, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment prohibited the use of       federal funds to prosecute medical cannabis-related       activities permissible under state law.        Other recent federal actions have further facilitated       access to cannabis plant derivatives. although these differ       from the botanical products and simple extracts that tend to       dominate state cannabis markets. The Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) approved several synthetic       tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products in 1985 and 2016. each of       which was placed on a higher controlled substance schedule       than cannabis. The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp, a substance       extracted from the cannabis plant that contains only 0.3       percent THC. Also in 2018. the Drug Enforcement       Administration designated FDA-approved cannabis-derived       cannabidiol (CBD) products containing no more than 0.1       percent THC as Schedule V substances.        Under this authority, the FDA approved the first CBD       product, Epidiolex, to treat childhood seizures.                   Evolution of the State Policy Landscape         Public support for the legalization of cannabis use in the       US rose from 12 percent to 66 percent between 1969 and 2019.       Concurrently, states liberalized their approaches to cannabis       markets. Four central policy categories have evolved:       prohibition, decriminalization, medical legalization, and       recreational (also known as adult use) legalization.       Decriminalization regimes were generally adopted first (in       the 1970s-1980s, with a resurgence in the 2010s).       Decriminalization laws were later complemented by medical       legalization or replaced by recreational legalization.       Exhibit 1 shows the current status of these four policies,       and exhibit 2 depicts state adoption of legalization policies       for medical and recreational cannabis since 1996.      Prohibition        States began prohibiting cannabis cultivation,       distribution, and possession in the early twentieth century.       By 1937, every state had some form of cannabis legislation,       often motivated by concerns (largely unsubstantiated by       scientific evidence at the time) that cannabis products were       psychologically addictive, produced insanity, and motivated       crime. Although liberalization policies have largely replaced       prohibitions, two states--Idaho and Kansas--still ban       cannabis in all forms and assign criminal penalties for the       possession of even small amounts. Another ten states permit       the use of ``low-THC, high-CBD'' products but maintain       prohibitions and criminal penalties for all other cannabis       activities (included in the ``prohibition'' category in       exhibit 1).      Decriminalization        Decriminalization is the repeal of criminal penalties       associated with cannabis possession for personal use and       casual exchange (that is, not sales). ``Depenalization''       policies that lower these penalties without removing them do       not qualify as decriminalization regimes. Decriminalization       also differs from the nonenforcement policies adopted in       several US cities, where enforcement of low-level cannabis-      involved offenses is deprioritized. Decriminalization falls       short  [[Page H4104]]       of legalization because it still prohibits and criminally       penalizes cannabis cultivation, production, and sales and       maintains civil penalties for possessing cannabis. Since the       1970s, states have increasingly adopted decriminalization       policies. By 2020, sixteen states had such a policy (exhibit       1). The laws vary along several dimensions, including the       levels of civil fines, penalties for repeat offenses, and       threshold amounts of cannabis that are exempt from criminal       penalties.      Medical Cannabis Legalization        Medical cannabis laws typically permit patients with       ``qualifying conditions'' certified by a medical professional       to purchase cannabis at dispensaries operating within the       state. Medical cannabis laws differ from low-THC and high-CBD       laws, which only legalize the supply and use of cannabis       products with low THC content. The most common qualifying       condition for which medical users can be certified is chronic       pain, although states regularly add conditions to their       lists. Since California passed the first medical cannabis law       in 1996, the number of jurisdictions adopting such programs       has grown steadily (exhibit 2). Today, more than two-thirds       of Americans live in one of the thirty-six states and four       territories that have approved medical cannabis use (exhibit       1).        The first medical cannabis laws passed (1996-2000) were       vague and defined medical use broadly. Although laws passed       between 2000 and 2009 offered more regulatory guidance over       the legal supply chain, laws passed or modified in more       recent years (2009-17) feature more comprehensive regulatory       programs that prioritize product safety. Still, the vast       majority of participants in medical cannabis programs are in       what are considered ``nonmedicalized programs,'' which lack       components consistent with evidence-based medicine and       pharmaceutical regulation (for example, testing and labeling)       and are largely divorced from medical practice. Ways in which       current laws differ from each other include the qualifying       conditions approved, channels of access dispensaries,       collective versus home cultivation, and so on), registration       card renewal requirements, and use by patients from other       states.      Recreational Cannabis Legalization        Recreational cannabis laws remove the criminal and civil       penalties associated with supply or possession of the       substance by adults ages twenty-one and older. These laws       typically allow individuals to grow four to six cannabis       plants and limit possession and purchase to one to two       ounces; most also impose at least a 10 percent retail excise       tax on sales. Most states with recreational laws prohibit the       use of cannabis while operating a motor vehicle, although       four states have specific per se THC limits while driving.        Legalization of recreational use is a relatively new       phenomenon. In 2012, Colorado and Washington were the first       jurisdictions globally to allow adult cultivation and       possession of cannabis. In 2020, fifteen states and       Washington, DC, had laws that legalize adult cannabis supply       and possession in some form (exhibit 1), resulting in more       than one-third of the US population having legal access to       the substance. With the exception of Illinois and Vermont,       all laws passed through 2020 have advanced via ballot       measures rather than through the legislature.        States have choices in their recreational cannabis       regulatory regimes. Most states have opted for a commercial       model, wherein private industry is allowed to produce,       supply, and sell cannabis subject to regulation at the state       and sometimes local levels. Washington, D.C., uniquely does       not allow for commercial production or retail sale but,       rather, permits only small amounts of cannabis for personal       possession, use, and cultivation. Although Vermont originally       prohibited commercial sale, the state authorized the       establishment of a commercial retail market in October 2020.       Factors that can vary within commercial regimes include how       producers and suppliers are regulated, the types of products       that may be distributed, taxes, prices, marketing       restrictions, and ways in which products can be used or       personally cultivated.        States that enacted recreational legalization laws saw       declines in adult cannabis-related arrests, although racial       disparities in those arrests persist. Some cannabis       policies, including the 2021 New Mexico, New York, and       Virginia legalization initiatives, incorporate reforms to       address harms experienced by communities       disproportionately affected by cannabis criminalization.       Some laws include provisions to expunge or pardon       cannabis-related minor offenses Other states have       initiated programs to increase minority participation in       the legal market. Some jurisdictions have earmarked tax       revenue generated from cannabis sales to support       socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.                     Policy Challenges And Opportunities         Limited national regulation of cannabis, the persistent       divide between national and state policy, and the growth of       state cannabis markets present numerous challenges for       population health, in part because the safety of many       cannabis products is uncertain and varies from state to       state. A dearth of federal regulation around cannabis       products has resulted in an unevenly regulated for-profit       industry that generates high profits and maintains       substantial control over marketing, promotion, and products       supplied.        Cannabis's Schedule I designation under federal law poses       additional challenges. It hinders the research into the       safety and adverse effects of cannabis-based products that       would be required for FDA approval. It also restricts       cannabis supplied for clinical trials to that which comes       from federal sources, which fails to reflect the potency and       type of products actually marketed in the states, although       the Drug Enforcement Administration is poised to approve       several manufacturers' applications to cultivate marijuana       for research needs. Institutions for higher education may be       reluctant to allow cannabis to be used in research on their       campuses for fear of losing federal funding. Cannabis       consumers remain uncertain over the stability of their supply       chain and risks that they may be prosecuted under federal law       or become ineligible for federal benefits. Finally, cannabis       cultivators and distributors face barriers accessing       financial services, given that the banking industry is       subject to federal laws, resulting in an inability to design       investment and growth strategies that could enhance the       legitimacy of the industry and safety of the products.        The lack of comprehensive, consistent oversight of cannabis       products and the disconnect between federal and state policy       suggest a number of important considerations for policy       makers.      Enhanced Federal Oversight of Product Safety and Development        Several options exist to improve federal oversight of       cannabis markets and products and to better align national       and state policies. Modifying cannabis's classification in       the Controlled Substances Act would facilitate enhanced       product safety research at the federal and state levels,       relax consumer and industry fears of criminal prosecution,       and facilitate legitimate financial transactions for cannabis       companies. It also would provide federal policy makers with       additional regulatory controls, such as premarketing       approval, which is currently unavailable for substances       designated as Schedule I, and would acknowledge cannabis's       medical benefits This modification could be accomplished by       amending the Controlled Substances Act to remove cannabis       from Schedule I and moving it to a higher schedule;       descheduling cannabis altogether, but having it meet the       threshold for FDA oversight, similar to nicotine and tobacco       products; or creating a new schedule for cannabis that       distinguishes it from other Schedule I substances. The       Medical Marijuana Research Act recently approved by the US       House of Representatives promotes cannabis research by       allowing scientists to access cannabis from state-level       dispensaries. Federal policy makers could also further       facilitate state regulation of cannabis supply by passing       legislation that restricts federal prosecutorial interference       with state cannabis markets.        Notwithstanding the above changes, the FDA already       possesses some regulatory powers to enhance the safety of       cannabis products. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of       1938 and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act as       affirmed in the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA can regulate       cannabis-containing and cannabis-derived compounds. Under       this authority, the FDA has taken particular interest in       overseeing the science and safety of CBD products. Of concern       are health claims made by some cannabis product manufacturers       and the introduction of foods containing THC or CBD into       interstate commerce--both of which are areas under FDA       jurisdiction. The agency could take more aggressive action       than issuing warning letters to questionable (CBD-related       commercial practices and could extend the rigor of its       investigations into THC products. For example, it could limit       the allowable THC content, which is concerningly high in many       cannabis products and is capable of inducing dependence or       cannabis use disorder.      State Strategies for Overseeing Cannabis Product Safety        Without changes in the federal regulatory architecture or       enhanced FDA oversight, states that move forward with       legalization must carefully consider how to safely oversee       cannabis markets.        Medical and recreational legalization have encouraged a       proliferation of product forms. Data from early       recreationally legalized states suggest that although the       flower of the plant still accounts for the largest proportion       of the market, heterogeneous extracts for inhalation are the       fastest-growing market segment. Cannabis products vary not       only in form but also in the potency of THC, CBD, and other       cannabinoids, as well as in the types and amounts of       pesticides and other impurities. Cannabis food and drink       products pose unique regulatory challenges. The health risks       associated with edibles, including for minors, likely result       from minimal consistency across products relating to potency,       inaccurate labeling, and the fact that many edibles contain       multiple servings of the advised THC dose. Further, users may       fail to appreciate the delayed effects of ingestion compared       with inhalation.        State legalization provides an opportunity for enhanced       regulatory oversight that can improve the safety of legal       cannabis products and limit the health risks and other risks       associated with the illegal marketplace. Policy makers can       consider ways to align legal cannabis markets with public       health strategies gleaned from tobacco and alcohol, such as       minimizing youth advertising exposure, restricting sale and       marketing locations, and requiring childproof packaging.       Frameworks could also consider medical and recreational       legalization regimes that adopt safety standards, for       instance, by limiting the concentration of THC  [[Page H4105]]       in products to levels not associated with dependence.      Standards for Medical Training        Despite the increasing prevalence of cannabis use in states       with and without legalization, many physicians do not receive       training on the potential health benefits and harms of       medical and recreational cannabis. To address this gap,       states could mandate that state-licensed physicians complete       continuing medical education credits on medical cannabis use       before certifying patients for medical cannabis registration.       Medical schools and residency programs could also design       coursework on the biochemical effects, clinical relevance,       and legal evolution of cannabis policy. These education       activities could be regularly updated with emerging evidence       on the health effects of cannabis. Outreach could extend to       patients and the public to inform them of the evidence-based       therapeutic uses of cannabis. All such training would be       better informed by enhanced research, as discussed above.      Considerations for Criminal Justice and Racial Equity        As cannabis liberalization progresses throughout the       country, states must address the collateral consequences of       cannabis-related criminal justice contact. Although states       with legalization and, to a lesser degree, decriminalization       regimes have experienced overall declines in arrests for       cannabis across racial groups, disparities in arrests across       races remain notable. Although cannabis-related arrests       decreased by 18 percent during the past decade, a Black       person is still nearly four times more likely to be arrested       for cannabis possession than a White person.        Cannabis policy reforms that aim to address criminal       justice and social disparities warrant consideration.       Cumbersome and expensive expungement processes, significant       entry obstacles associated with the legal market, and       declines in price that in turn reduce funds earmarked for       community programs threaten initiatives that address harms       produced by cannabis criminalization. As states begin to       implement social equity measures, they should carefully       assess which communities have been disproportionately harmed       by cannabis prohibition; how to encourage equitable,       sustainable participation in the cannabis industry--including       training and business support; and how earmarked cannabis       revenue will be disseminated to equity-enhancing initiatives.                                  Conclusion         Cannabis policy liberalization provides opportunities for       therapeutic benefit but also presents the potential for       health harms, the full consequences of which remain unknown,       given the nascency of the research and inconsistency in       findings (see the accompanying Health Affairs Health Policy       Brief) For policy makers considering reforms, policy choices       extend beyond blunt categories of prohibition,       decriminalization, medical legalization, and recreational       legalization and involve decisions related to the panoply of       regulatory provisions that govern legal and illegal cannabis.       The specifics of how to implement and enforce cannabis policy       and regulation are important to health, and researchers       should endeavor to evaluate these nuances as well as the       broader policy categories. Some states have included within       their legalization initiatives provisions requiring policy       evaluation. For example, Washington State earmarked cannabis       tax revenue to fund a continuous cannabis research program.       Other states, including Vermont and New York, reviewed the       potential impacts of regulating a recreational cannabis       supply chain before policy reform. More efforts such as these       will help to unpack the independent and comparative health       harms and benefits of various cannabis policy regimes and       regulatory approaches.                                   ____                                                      March 1, 2022.      Speaker Nancy Pelosi,      Washington, DC.      House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer,      Washington, DC.      Re Bring the MORE Act to the House Floor for a Vote        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer: We, the       undersigned criminal justice, civil rights, drug policy,       labor and advocacy organizations who make up the Marijuana       Justice Coalition, write today to urge you to swiftly bring       to the House floor the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and       Expungement (MORE) Act of 2021 (H.R. 3617). This legislation       would end federal marijuana prohibition, address the       collateral consequences of federal marijuana criminalization,       and take steps to ensure the legal marketplace is diverse and       inclusive.        This historic legislation first passed the House in       December of 2020 with a bipartisan vote of 228-164 but was       not considered by the Senate prior to the close of the 116th       Congress. Given that nearly every minute one person in this       country is arrested for a minor marijuana crime, the public       deserves to know if members of the 117th Congress stand on       the side of justice and against the outdated and cruel policy       of prohibition and criminalization of marijuana.        Mass criminalization and over-enforcement of drug law       violations have devastated the social and economic fabrics of       entire communities, while also tearing apart the lives of       millions of individuals and families. And while Black,       Latino, and Indigenous people have carried the brunt of       marijuana criminalization, they have been shut out of the       regulated marijuana marketplace due to these very same       criminal records in addition to financial barriers to entry.        The MORE Act seeks to solve these problems through a       comprehensive approach. The bill would declassify marijuana       as a controlled substance under federal law, expunge       marijuana convictions, and reduce marijuana sentences. The       Congressional Budget Office estimates that the MORE Act would       have reduced time served by 73,000 person-years, over the       2021-2030 period, among existing and future incarcerated       individuals. The bill, after solving the industry's 280E tax       issue, would also place a minor initial five percent federal       excise tax on marijuana sales at the manufacturer level in       order to fund services in communities adversely impacted by       drug prohibition and to build up Small Business       Administration programming to support a more diverse and       inclusive marketplace with local ownership.        The previous House vote on the MORE Act came on the heels       of an election where five states--Montana, Arizona, South       Dakota, Mississippi, and New Jersey--had marijuana reform on       the ballot and each voted to loosen their marijuana laws.       Since then, even more states have chosen to reform their       marijuana laws. More recently, Connecticut, New York, New       Mexico, and Virginia passed marijuana legalization bills       rooted in social justice bringing the total number of states       that have legalized adult-use of marijuana to 18, in addition       to the District of Columbia, while 37 states and the District       of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, most recently       Mississippi earlier this year.        A recent Pew Research poll shows that a record number of       U.S. adults--91 percent--now support marijuana legalization       for medical or adult use, a policy that is only achievable by       removing the substance from the Controlled Substances Act as       the MORE Act does. In short, the resounding shift in favor of       marijuana reform demonstrates what we have been saying:       marijuana justice is a winning issue and it is long past time       for the federal government to catch up.        The time to end federal prohibition is long overdue. We       urge you bring the MORE Act to the House floor in March.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  thoughtful amendment, and I thank him for helping to further enhance  this bill.   For clarity's sake, let me be very clear. This bill decriminalizes  possession on the Federal level. All State laws and all State law  enforcement are able to do their job. But let me remind you, Mr.  Speaker, the President has put in an enormous amount of money for  reducing crime in his budget.   This legislation is extremely important for those of us who recognize  the key responsibilities on the Nation's highways. That is a Federal  responsibility, and the gentleman has offered an important amendment to  give $10 million to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  to find the technology to enhance safety on highways.   The bill also includes a requirement that a study should be conducted  to understand the societal impacts of decriminalizing marijuana,  including the impact on juveniles, education, transportation, veterans,  employment, and many others.   The gentleman's amendment, Mr. Gottheimer's, enhances this bill and  makes it a direct response to the concerns that Americans may have.   Mr. Speaker, I support the amendment and the underlying bill, and I  thank the gentleman for clarifying this important responsibility.    Mr. Speaker, it is incredulous when good ideas come  to the floor that should draw bipartisan support--one cannot look, in  the old country, they say, a gift horse in the mouth.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for recognizing that what we  do in Washington, what we do for the people of this Nation, is to make  sure we give them good facts. It will be good facts if his amendment is  assessing a very important place in our lives, the workplace, or  another very important place in our lives, schools.   This legislation, as I indicated, the underlying legislation just  decriminalizes possession. It gives people another lifeline. It takes  the criminalization away from this mounting incarceration of people of  color.   I support the gentleman's amendment and say it is reasonable and good  law. Let us support that amendment and the underlying bill.
