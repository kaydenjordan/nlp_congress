 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry for yielding and  for his great work leading us on the NDAA.   I would like to address two amendments that are coming up in en bloc  packages.   First of all, on Iran, my amendment to the NDAA, No. 361, requires  the President, along with various agencies, to provide the House with a  report regarding Iran's use of commercial aircraft for illicit  activities. I am doing this with Representative Roskam.   Diligent research from think tanks, such as the Foundation for  Defense of Democracies and the American Enterprise Institute, have  demonstrated the need for the intelligence community to provide  Congress with a report of their activities.   In total, Iran Air, Mahan Air, Pouya Air, Cham Wings Airlines, and  the Iranian Air Force operated at least 404 flights from Iran to Syria  since the Iran nuclear deal was adopted on July 14, 2015.   Now, this report does not block the sale of commercial aircraft to  Iran, but asks the intelligence community to take a serious look at  these sales so Congress can determine if they should continue.   The other amendment I would like to address, Mr. Chairman, is No. 364  on boost-phase missile defense. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry  for including this amendment, which was cosponsored by Mr. Kinzinger,  Mr. Hunter, Mr. Franks, and Mr. Wilson from South Carolina, to advance  boost-phase missile defense programs.   As you know, ballistic missiles are at their most defenseless when  they are in their boost phase, the initial phase of flight. They are at  their slowest, and they have not yet deployed decoys and  countermeasures that would make it more difficult to shoot them down in  later phases of flight.   This amendment will make Americans safer as we move towards advancing  this absolutely critical technology.
