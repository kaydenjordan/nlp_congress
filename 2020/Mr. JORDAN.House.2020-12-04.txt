 Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the  State of North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), the good doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was all over the State of Ohio in the recent campaign.  I was all over the country. I was in Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin,  Pennsylvania, and Texas, all over the place. Not once--not once--did an  American citizen come up to me and say: Do you know what? The first  thing I hope the Congress does after this election, the first major  piece of legislation I hope the Congress takes up after this election  is to legalize marijuana.   Not once did that happen.   But this bill does more than that. This bill says it is not enough  just to legalize marijuana. They want taxpayers to pay for it. This  bill sets up a grant program. This is the marijuana business  infrastructure bill. It sets up an office in the Department of  Justice--a special office in the Department of Justice--for the  marijuana industry. Grant dollars, taxpayer dollars are going to this  industry.   I didn't have anyone tell me: Do you know what? I hope the first big  bill the Democrats do after this session is to give my tax dollars to  the marijuana industry.   That is exactly what has happened here. But, frankly, this shouldn't  surprise us. Think about what the Democrats did earlier this week.  Their first big hearing--actually, their first hearing--since the  election in the Judiciary Committee was Wednesday in the Crime,  Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee. It was a hearing about  letting criminals out of prison early because of the COVID issue-- letting criminals out early in an environment where violent crime is  increasing.   We know that, this summer, aggravated assaults are up 14 percent and  homicides are up 53 percent. Democrat mayors and city councils around  the country in our major urban areas in that environment are defunding  the police. So in that overall environment where homicides are up,  aggravated assaults are up, and there are less cops on the street, they  want to release criminals early.   I want to read from a letter that Mr. Nadler and Congresswoman Bass  sent to the Attorney General back in March:         We urge you to use every tool at your disposal to release       as many prisoners as possible to protect from COVID-19.    They go on to further to state--and this is the part that is scary:         What you do with individuals who are high risk of       contracting COVID-19, who are not in low- or minimum-security       facilities, who have been convicted of serious offenses, we       urge you to consider that even these individuals in these       categories be assessed for release.    Mr. Speaker, so even the most violent criminals they were looking at  and they were encouraging the Attorney General to release on our  streets.   Oh, and just like with this marijuana bill, they want your tax  dollars to pay for a grant program to the States to release criminals  early--even the most violent criminals. In an environment where violent  crime is up, where our Democrat mayors are defunding their police and  taking cops off the street, they want to release criminals early and,  oh, your tax dollars pay for it. Mr. Speaker, that is what they want to  do.   Now they say: Oh, by the way, it is not just enough that your tax  dollars go to States to release criminals early in that environment  when they are defunding the police and violent crime is up, we also  want you to pay for the marijuana industry.   You have got to be kidding me, Mr. Speaker. You have got to be  kidding me. They started the week off having a hearing on paying States  to release criminals out of our jails, and now they are going to end  the week by saying that taxpayers pay for the marijuana industry.   This is crazy. This is exactly what they want to do. Think about this  for a second, Mr. Speaker. Think about a small business owner. Let's  just pick Portland. A small business owner in Portland, who paid their  local taxes, who this summer had their business destroyed because  Democrat leaders in that city would not protect their business, now  Democrats in Congress are saying: Oh, we want your Federal tax dollars  to be used to release criminals early and to buttress the marijuana  industry.   Such a deal for the taxpayer. That is what the Democrats have  prioritized this week in the United States Congress. It is ridiculous.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just point out the American Medical Association  put out a letter 2 days ago saying they oppose this legislation for the  reasons that Dr. Murphy highlighted in his opening remarks.   I would also just, again, point out what the Democrats on the  Judiciary Committee did on Wednesday. It was about releasing criminals  from prisons early.   Again, just to read from the letter that the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee sent to the Attorney General of the United States  on March 30, 2020, he says. . . . who have been convicted of serious       offenses or who have high pattern risk scores, we urge you       to consider that even these individuals in these       categories be assessed for release.    I don't know how you can say it any plainer, Mr. Speaker. These are  some of the most dangerous people in our Federal prison system. They  wanted the Attorney General to look at releasing them into the public.  That is how they started the week. They are going to end the week by  decriminalizing marijuana and giving American tax dollars to  businessowners to further the marijuana industry.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), a former police officer who has seen firsthand  what drugs can do to individuals and to communities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, House Democrats started the week off with a hearing on  letting criminals out of jail early. They end the week with a bill  legalizing drugs. And they want the American taxpayers to pay for both  programs.   They introduced a bill earlier in the year to give grant dollars to  States to let criminals out of jail early, even violent ones, according  to the letter Mr. Nadler and Chairwoman Bass sent to the Attorney  General. Now, they want to create a trust fund in this bill to give  grants to the marijuana industry and finance the marijuana industry.   Mr. Speaker, these are the actions the Democrats take, the first  actions they take after a national election. Go figure. Maybe that is  why they lost 27 out of 27 toss-up seats around the country. Maybe that  is why our party almost took back the majority.   That is what they choose to focus on at a time when you have Democrat  leaders around the country defunding the police, locking down  businesses, destroying small businesses all over our Nation. This is  what they choose to focus on. This is what they choose to focus on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
