 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, the  Energy Diplomacy Act. Across the globe, our friends and allies want a  stable and reliable supply of American energy. America, in turn, must  actively engage our friends and allies to provide alternatives to  energy from rogue regimes.   Look what is happening in Europe. For over a decade, Russia has used  their natural gas pipelines flowing into Eastern and Central Europe as  a point of leverage over these countries. Ukraine has been most  affected, with Russia turning off their natural gas supply in the  winter of 2008 and during the annexation of Crimea in 2014. By twisting  a knob and turning off Ukrainian heat, they were able to exert an  outsized amount of influence on Ukraine.   Now, Russia's proposed Nord Stream II pipeline with Germany further  threatens to expand Russia's energy influence throughout Eastern and  Central Europe.    Make no mistake: Russia is a destabilizing regime that constantly  exploits the vulnerabilities posed by Europe's reliance on their  natural gas. The United States must be involved to curb this influence.   Over the past decade, the United States has reduced our reliance on  foreign sources of energy in order to achieve energy independence. As a  result, we are now exporting energy abroad, including from my home  State of Texas. In fact, in 2015, I helped champion the repeal of the  outdated crude oil export ban. Now, U.S. producers are finding new  customers in both Asia and Europe.   That is why I authored the Energy Diplomacy Act. It elevates the  Bureau of Energy Resources at the State Department. It replaces the  International Energy Affairs Coordinator with an Assistant Secretary.  This Assistant Secretary will carry out the State Department's  functions on behalf of the United States.   It also ensures the State Department is staffed with sufficient  personnel to support this mission. This will empower the State  Department to promote and advance a bold U.S. energy diplomacy policy.   As energy-rich adversaries expand their malign influence and our  allies continue to purchase from such states, the United States must  project strong energy diplomacy now more than ever.   It is not just Russia with whom we are contending. One of Iran's main  goals in negotiating their nuclear deal was to open up their energy  markets to more foreign investment and to expand their oil exports  globally.   Since the U.S. departed from the JCPOA, our European allies and our  strategic partner India are deciding between complying with United  States sanctions or ignoring them and buying Iranian oil.                                time  1345    We also need our diplomats on the front lines promoting reliable  American energy.   These two circumstances underscore the need for an Assistant  Secretary for Energy Resources to project U.S. energy diplomacy  throughout the world.   I want to thank Chairman Royce for his leadership, as well as Ranking  Member Engel, an original cosponsor of my bill.
