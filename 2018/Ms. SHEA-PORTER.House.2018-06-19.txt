 Mr. Speaker, America is looking on, indeed the world  is looking on with horror as they see pictures of children in cages.   First it was denied. They were saying, No, we weren't separating  families. Then they said, Well, we are not putting them in cages.   And now America and the world sees the truth. And it is up to the  President. He could change this tonight if he wanted to. I think we  have to ask ourselves: Why won't he? Why won't this Congress do  something?   The world is watching. We are losing our moral authority as we speak.  I beg the President and the Speaker of the House and others in this  Congress to stop this now.                            ____________________
