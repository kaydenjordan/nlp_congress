 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today one last time to ask the House to drop  these charges against our duly elected President, if, for no other  reason, because the process that they have used has been the exact  partisan process that was just condemned on the floor by people who  were the first to call for impeaching the President, the Speaker of  this body.   This is a 2.5-year endeavor, in spite of it being only a few months  after the call to Ukraine that is supposedly the abuse of power that  the President engaged in.   As for the other charge, they say that it was obstruction of justice,  but the House didn't even bother to enforce its own subpoenas.   The impeachment process boldly broke with that of Presidents Nixon  and Clinton. The urgency was so great that the House declined to  enforce its subpoenas and relied on shaky evidence, trying to move  swiftly so they didn't lose the momentum.                                time  1515    Now, when they realize they haven't made the case--not just that it  will be needed in the Senate, but for the American people, first and  foremost--they  [[Page H232]]  want to strong-arm the Senate into adopting the same unfair partisan  course charted here in the House.   Fortunately, it doesn't work like that. Voters deserve better from  our House of Representatives, but it is not the House's prerogative to  dictate the rules of the Senate.   This partisan impeachment should be dropped today. This political  charade is a waste of taxpayer dollars. It is unfair to the President  of the United States or anyone else to be treated beneath the law.  Certainly no one is above the law, but the President of the United  States is certainly not beneath the law.   Rather than give in to our worst partisan inclinations, Congress  should strive to work together on real policies that will benefit all  of the American people.
