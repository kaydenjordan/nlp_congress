 Mr. Speaker, due to a prior family  obligation, I was unable to vote on the following four rollcall votes.  I would like the record to reflect how I would have voted.   Rollcall No. 619--``Yes.''   Rollcall No. 620--``No.''   Rollcall No. 621--``Yes.''   Rollcall No. 622--``No.''                            ____________________
