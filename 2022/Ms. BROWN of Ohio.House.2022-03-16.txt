 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the CROWN Act. This long-overdue legislation would finally ban hair  discrimination in schools, in the workplace, and in other public  spaces.   No worker should be denied employment because of their natural hair.  No child should be sent home from school because they choose to wear  protective hairstyles like Bantu knots or braids.   Discrimination against Black hair has been and always will be a form  of racism. Every person deserves to be their true, authentic self, and  crowns of all types should be embraced.   I was proud to wear braids on the day of my swearing-in, just as I am  proud to wear braids as I speak on the House floor today.   It is time to end hair discrimination in America. It is time to pass  the CROWN Act.                            ____________________
