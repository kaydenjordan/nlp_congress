 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remind my colleagues of  the contributions that immigrants have made to our country.   I want to direct your attention to the poster next to me. This is  Corporal Jose Angel Garibay; he is a Dreamer who lived in my district  and joined the U.S. Marine Corps. Jose Angel Garibay was the first  serviceman from Orange County to be killed in action in Iraq. Jose  Angel Garibay was a Dreamer who made the ultimate sacrifice for  America.   Madam Speaker, if I can call your attention to a second poster. This  is Gregoria, a farmworker who has risked her life during the worldwide  pandemic to feed our country. Even during droughts and fire season in  California, these farmworkers still went to work to make sure that our  country was fed, and America was kept healthy. Gregoria has been living  and working in my district for 28 years. She is a mother and  breadwinner.   People like these two individuals, Gregoria and Jose Angel Garibay,  have  [[Page H5912]]  earned the right to American citizenship. Madam Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to continue to fight for a pathway to citizenship for  millions of individuals like Gregoria and Jose.                            ____________________
