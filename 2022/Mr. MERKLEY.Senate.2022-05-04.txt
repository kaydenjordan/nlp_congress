 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this motion to  instruct for one simple reason: It is up to America to lead the world  in reducing the use of fossil fuels and in pivoting to renewable  energy. Yet this motion to instruct says we cannot do anything to help  foreign entities address any aspect of the climate objective: not to  fight forest fires that come from climate change, not to address the  salinization or the acidification of the sea, not to address  reforestation or deforestation.   It is up to America to help make sure that we provide nonfossil fuel  energy for the future that will help us all address this huge list of  issues. It is important that we lead the world, not neglect the world.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, when vigorous storms attack the heartland  and destroy crops, I hope that the President has emergency powers to  assist those farmers. When fires--fiercer fires in a longer fire  season--proceed to burn not just one town but six towns to the ground  in the State of Oregon in an almost unbelievable, horrendous reduction  to ashes, I hope the President has emergency powers to declare a major  disaster and assist the good people of my State or your State when  these disasters happen. If changing temperatures and changing rain  patterns bring the sandfly to Texas and leishmaniasis or some other  deadly disease, then, indeed, the President needs to have the power to  declare a public health service emergency.   Taking away the ability for the President to declare major disasters  or health emergencies or national emergencies when there are disasters  striking our people is a terrible idea, and I encourage you to vote no  on this motion to instruct.                                Vote on Motion     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
