 Mr. Speaker, one of the worst things that can  happen to any of us is to lose their voice, and I have lost mine. I  know some of the Democrats are glad about that.   But I want to say this on behalf of the SAFER Act. There are, in our  country, on shelves, in warehouses, and in law enforcement office  buildings rape kits that have never been examined. That is shameful.  And everybody is to blame, from the Federal Government to local  government.   It is shameful because victims--and I knew a lot of them at the  courthouse as a judge--don't know who committed this crime against  them, and we have the ability to tell them, but we don't because of  bureaucratic incompetence. These haven't been examined. They have the  right to know who sexually assaulted them.   Also, there are criminals running loose, who have never been  prosecuted, because these rape kits have never been analyzed. And, yes,  there are people incarcerated who are innocent, and the rape kit can  prove their innocence. It is important that we pass the SAFER Act. Get  those sexual assault kits analyzed. There are no more excuses.   Mr. Speaker, in 1984, Michelle was raped at knifepoint by two men who  broke into her home.   They blindfolded her, tied her up with a phone cord, and gagged tit  her before sexually assaulting her.   During the assault, they laughed and bragged that they had been  getting away with committing this crime for seven years.   Much to Michelle's surprise, they left without ending her life. But  hers would now be a life filled with suffering and fear. Michelle  called the police and had a rape kit taken.   She hoped that by achieving justice against her attackers she would  find some measure of peace and closure.   Michelle waited for the results, but she waited in vain.   The backlog of untested kits was too large, so her kit was never  tested.   Over the next years, while her rape kit sat collecting dust on a  shelf, break-ins and rapes continued to happen in her neighborhood.   She was in constant fear that her attackers were still on the loose.   Not only does the inability to test rape kits deny victims justice,  it also puts the safety of other innocent people in jeopardy by keeping  criminals on the streets.   To address this issue, Congresswoman Maloney and I introduced the  Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act or SAFER Act, which was  signed into law in 2013.   This bill provides funds to states and localities to increase rape  kit testing and expand forensic lab capacities.   In the years since SAFER's enactment there has been progress, but  there are still hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits across the  nation.   SAFER was slated to expire at the end of this year, but thankfully,  with bipartisan support, Congress has secured its re-authorization and  continued existence.   This legislation will continue to reduce the national rape kit  backlog and help victims achieve justice.   I want to thank Senator Cornyn who has worked with me on SAFER for  many years.   And I want to thank the Chairman for bringing this bill to the floor.  I applaud its passage here today.   And that is just the way it is.
