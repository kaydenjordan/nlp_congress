 Mr. President, I would like to thank you, Chaplain Lundy,  for coming all the way from Terre Haute. That is on kind of the west  central side of our State, a pretty good trek out here.   You heard what the senior Senator from Indiana said. You have had a  storied career in the military, but I think having a life led based  upon strong faith, there is no substitute for it, serving there with  the National Guard.   Indiana has the notoriety for having a lot of veterans in our own  State, always coming to the call when there is a need, whether it is  through the National Guard or through Active Duty.   You play such an important role because so often the troops who give  the most, who serve, need the help of probably the Almighty more than  any of us in that task. Thank you for doing that. Caring for that  spiritual well-being, it is hard to imagine how that works in some  instances. Again, doing it, you ought to feel good about the career you  have made and spent, especially back home in Indiana.   We are a State where, I think, faith is the cornerstone of so much of  what we do. Our families and our communities all intertwine. Every  town, I think, needs that. Every State needs that.   Thank you, again, for doing this today, opened the Senate session in  prayer, and for what you have done throughout your storied career.   Chaplain LUNDY. Thank you.    You are welcome.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader
