 Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Books Save Lives  Act, legislation to combat the rise in book bans.   This past school year had more than 3,000 instances of books banned  across 33 States, and in my home State of Massachusetts, libraries saw  challenges to books quadruple.   Let me make it plain: Book bans are discriminatory and harmful, and  Congress must unite against them. As a child who endured sexual abuse,  when I read Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' it was  the first time in my life I knew I was not alone, and it helped me move  forward. When I say that books save lives, I mean that.   My bill would recognize this by ensuring libraries offer diverse  books and treat discriminatory bans as violations of Federal civil  rights law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation for all  the people who are saved by books each and every day.                            ____________________
