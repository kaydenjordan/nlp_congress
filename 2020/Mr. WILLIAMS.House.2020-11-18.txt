 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of the Save  Our Cities and Stages Act, better known as the Save Our Stages Act, as  a standalone bill so that independent live music venues can survive and  recover from COVID-19.   During this pandemic, these venues have been hardest hit, as they  were the first to close and will be among the last to reopen due to  safety restrictions and government mandates.   They generate billions of dollars in our national economy and create  thousands of jobs every year. They are a cultural staple in central  Texas and the 25th District, unlike any other place in our Nation.   Over the last several months, I have had the privilege of working  with owners and managers of dozens of venues like Hudson's On Mercer  Street in Dripping Springs, Songbird Live in Cleburne, and The Broken  Spoke in Austin to highlight the urgency of passing this legislation.   It is crucial we deliver, not only for their livelihoods, but for the  artists who start out on their stages and the future generations  inspired by their work. Every day we waste is detrimental to this  industry.   Mr. Speaker, I call on Speaker Pelosi to bring the Save Our Stages  Act to the House floor for a vote.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
