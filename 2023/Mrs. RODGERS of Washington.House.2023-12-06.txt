 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  4468, the CARS Act.   President Biden's rush-to-green agenda is failing. Just last week,  nearly 4,000 auto dealers all across this country sent a letter to  President Biden urging him to stop his EV mandates. They said demand  isn't there and the EVs are just sitting on their lots.   The administration has allocated billions for EV charging, yet not a  single charger has come online as a result. All of this failed central  planning is shipping our auto future and jobs to China. This is not the  future Americans want or deserve.   For more than a century, affordable transportation has helped drive  America's economic success. Our cars have allowed people all across  this Nation and around the world to increase our mobility and raise our  standard of living.   H.R. 4468 ensures that we can keep building on this legacy of  American leadership and prosperity. Let's stop President Biden. He  wants us all driving EVs, 100 percent battery electric, not plug-in,  not hybrid, not plug-in hybrid. We don't agree. Vote for the bill.
