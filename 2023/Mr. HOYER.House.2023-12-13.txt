 Mr. Speaker, we have less than 10 hours left until we go  home for the holidays, less than 10 hours when we leave the field, and  less than 10 hours before we act responsibly.   The men and women of Ukraine will not go home for the holidays. They  will not leave the lines in eastern Ukraine. They will not have a  Christmas dinner without the fear that they will be bombed in Kyiv or  assaulted in eastern Ukraine.   Why is that?   I ask that to both Chambers: Why are we going home and leaving our  Ukrainian allies unarmed?   Why do we shrink from our responsibility to confront those who would  undermine democracy, freedom, and international law?   Why, Mr. Speaker, do we retreat from the field while our Ukrainian  allies are at risk?   Mr. Speaker, we have 1 day left. We can accomplish the goal of  passing Ukrainian dollars.   We can achieve the goal of giving aid to our ally, Israel.   We can achieve the goal of making Taiwan a little bit stronger.   Or we can send a message to Mr. Putin, to Mr. Xi, to Iran, and to  Hamas that America is unable to stay the course.   I am told that the reason we can't do that is because it is  absolutely essential to have border security addressed. It is. I am for  doing that.   Nevertheless, I want to call to the Speaker's attention, so that he  can remember that in the 115th Congress, as a Member of Congress, he  cosponsored a bill, H.R. 395. Some others cosponsored that bill who may  be at least hearing me, Mr. Speaker, or maybe even on the floor. That  bill said that it was incumbent that we ``end the practice of including  more than one subject in a single bill by requiring that each bill  enacted by Congress be limited to only one subject.''   Was that situational ethics, situational principles, or just  temporary principles to be thrown away when they are not convenient,  perhaps?   That bill was sponsored by Speaker Johnson; by Mr. Meadows who became  Chief of Staff of Donald Trump; by Mr. Emmer, the majority whip; and by  Mr. DeSantis, candidate for President. It was a temporary, perhaps just  political, piece of rhetoric.   Mr. Speaker, America is better than that. America needs to be a more  reliable ally than that. America needs to create confidence, not  undermine confidence. America needs to be reliable. America needs to  confront the criminality, the venality, and the murderous acts of  Vladimir Putin.   Yet we are scheduled to go home in just a few hours.   John Kennedy wrote a book, ``Why England Slept.'' It was about why  they thought that Hitler was going to stop. It just involved, after  all, the mainland, not England, and they paid a terrible price for that  negligence, and the free world paid a terrible price for that  negligence.   Mr. Speaker, let us not go home, let us do our duty, and let us be  the kind of America that we say we are.                            ____________________
