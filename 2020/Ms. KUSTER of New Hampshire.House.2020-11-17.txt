 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  6435, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act of 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to help introduce this bipartisan bill with  my colleague Buddy Carter in April, and I appreciate the support of our  colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle. I would like to take a  moment to commend Buddy for his leadership on this important topic.   During these challenging times for our country, I have constantly  been impressed by Americans' commitment to helping their neighbors pull  through this crisis. Sadly, where many see an opportunity to lend a  helping hand, others see a chance to make a quick buck.   Scammers have posed as medical researchers, offering opportunities to  participate in clinical trials. They have attempted to sell nonexistent  PPE. They have even tried to trick seniors into buying fake COVID-19  test kits. These shameful acts must not only be condemned, but Congress  must take action to crack down on these scams and inform the American  people of these devious efforts.   Our bipartisan legislation will help stop COVID scams by directing  Federal agencies and departments to inform Americans about these  criminal schemes so they can stay alert and keep themselves safe. By  aggregating data and providing the public with information on mail,  telemarketing, and robocall fraud schemes, Americans can defend  themselves and their families.    Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step forward, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.
