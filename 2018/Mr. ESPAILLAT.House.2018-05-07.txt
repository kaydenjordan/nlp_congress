 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Semana Dominicana,  Dominican Week, to recognize the American Chamber of Commerce of the  Dominican Republic.   Since this organization was founded in 1923, its members and partners  in the Dominican Republic and the United States have grown in scale,  and the diversity of its commerce has led to the economic development  and the empowerment of small businesses.   During this week, Semana Dominicana, it is my pleasure to welcome and  recognize David Fernandez, the president of the American Chamber of  Commerce of the Dominican Republic, and Nelson Toca, the Dominican  Republic Minister of Industry and Commerce.   As the first Dominican elected to U.S. Congress, I am proud to  support Dominican-U.S. relations and hope we will continue to  strengthen the ties between the Dominican Republic and members of the  Dominican diaspora here in the United States.                            ____________________
