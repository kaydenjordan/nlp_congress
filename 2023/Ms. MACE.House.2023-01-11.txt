 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of  Charleston in South Carolina's First Congressional District.   For the 10th consecutive year, the Holy City has been recognized as  the best city to visit in the United States by Travel and Leisure  magazine.   It is easy to see why. Charleston's tremendous natural beauty, rich  history, and friendly faces make it a magnet to visitors from across  the country.   To quote Travel & Leisure's article: ``The city expresses the perfect  balance of Southern charm, knockout food and drinks, and walkability.''   When they say drinks, they mean some of the best cocktails in the  South.   I want to commend our tourism and hospitality industry, our mayor,  and every resident of the city of Charleston for this decades-long  recognition.                              Saving Sea Turtles     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Hilton Head Island  Sea Turtle Patrol and their sister group, the Turtle Trackers.   From the beginning of May until the end of October every single year,  hundreds of sea turtles return to Hilton Head Island to lay their eggs  on 14 miles of sandy beaches.   These turtles are a crucial part of our ocean environment, and each  nest is critically important for protecting their future as they are  still endangered.   For over 15 years, Amber Kuehn, has led the effort to protect the  island's sea turtle nests. When she began the Turtle Trackers program,  it was just Amber and about six other women. Today there are over 500  volunteers across Hilton Head Island who work hard to remove obstacles  from the beach. They fill holes, and they make it easier for the mother  turtles to return safely and return to the water every year.   Her elite corps of 18 expert volunteers forms the Hilton Head  Island's Sea Turtle Patrol. They travel the whole length of the beach  every morning in search of sea turtle nests. Since they began their  work, the number of sea turtle nests on Hilton Head Island has  increased by over 300 percent. In 2021 they tracked and maintained  approximately 423 nests.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in commending Amber and her  team for their incredible conservation efforts.                Beaufort, South Carolina, and Ostroh, Ukraine     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the city of  Beaufort on raising three-quarters of a million dollars for their  sister city, Ostroh, in western Ukraine.   After the invasion of Ukraine began, Mayor Stephen Murray was looking  for ways to help so he began looking for a sister city. There are many  very strong similarities between Beaufort and Ostroh. They are very  similar in size, both have centuries of rich history, and both have  some of the oldest universities in their respective regions.   After connecting with Mayor Yurii Yahodka in Ostroh, which currently  houses thousands of refugees from the eastern part of the country,  Mayor Murray and the residents of Beaufort spent the next 4 months  raising money and raising awareness across the Lowcountry.   Beaufort's famous Thibault Gallery sold Ukrainian flag pins, and they  raised over $40,000. Community groups, businesses, and citizens from  all walks of life raised almost $150,000 through raffles, fundraising  drives, and several large anonymous donations to represent and assist  their sister city.   Mayor Murray did not stop there. He worked tirelessly with members of  the city council to secure MREs, grits, and cornmeal from local South  Carolina businesses to bring approximately $600,000 worth of food and  supplies to the people of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mayor Murray and all of the residents of  Beaufort for this incredibly generous effort.                             Honoring Sara Cathey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sara Cathey, a paramedic  who lost over 125 pounds to donate her kidney to her niece Natalyn.  Natalyn had both of her kidneys removed at only 1\1/2\ years of age due  to a devastating genetic condition.   As a healthcare professional, Sarah understood the difficulty of  securing a donor kidney and had herself tested. She was a perfect  match. But one thing stood in the way. When Sara learned her weight  could prevent her from saving Natalyn's life, she was more determined  than ever to get in shape. She got to work changing her habits and her  lifestyle so that little Natalyn could have a chance at life.   Through grit and determination, she reached her goal and was cleared  for surgery. The hard work and effort she put forth shows the love and  compassion she has for her family and everyone in the Lowcountry whom  she selflessly serves each and every day.                   Congratulating the Charleston RiverDogs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Charleston  RiverDogs, our Lowcountry minor league baseball team, on clinching  their second consecutive league championship finishing the post season  with a 4-0 record.   I have twice had the privilege of throwing out the first pitch. The  RiverDogs is an integral part of the Charleston community and has  created lasting memories for our community and in the Lowcountry for  the better part of the last 40 years.   This year's team also tied the franchise record for the number of  wins in a season, and I want to congratulate the RiverDogs on a  terrific season and wish them all the best of luck in the next season.                            ____________________
