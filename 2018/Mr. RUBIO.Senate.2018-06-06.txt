 Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Molly  Winters Diallo, the Miami-Dade County Teacher of the Year from Alonzo  and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus in North Miami, FL.   Molly's inspiration to become a teacher began when she was young. Her  parents were teachers, and they instilled in her the importance of  education. When students walk into her classroom, Molly tells them they  are going to college, and she will help them get there. Her school has  students from 66 different countries and speak several languages. To  many, her words of encouragement made the difference.   In Molly's classroom, students are taught the importance of investing  in education. Her students are asked for their thoughts on topics, what  they want to learn, and what changes she can make to better suit their  needs.   Molly's bond with her students extends beyond high school. She has  helped them throughout their college application process, providing  advice and has served as a shoulder to lean on when they encounter  setbacks.   Molly grew up in Connecticut and began teaching at a private school  in the British Virgin Islands. After receiving her master's degree from  Tufts University, she moved to Miami in the early 2000s. She previously  taught at Miami Edison Senior High for 5 years before transferring to  Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus, where she  teaches advanced placement human geography and psychology and honors  U.S. history.   I extend my sincere recognition and appreciation to Molly for her  hard work and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Michelle  Dinwiddie, the Polk County Teacher of the Year from Lake Gibson High  School in Lakeland, FL.   Michelle follows what she calls the Pro Principle, that she and her  students should be professional, productive, and proficient in all  aspects of their lives. She challenges her students to demonstrate  professionalism in speech and attire, productivity in achievement, and  proficiency in learning so they can succeed.  [[Page S3031]]    Michelle fosters growth in student learning and behavior. She uses  whiteboard tables within her classroom to enhance student engagement  and learning gains. While her academic responsibility is to increase  the reading and writing scores on the Florida State Assessment, her  professional responsibilities far exceed the walls of her classroom.  She serves as department chair, leading educators in professional  development. Michelle seeks to mentor new teachers and nurture future  teacher leaders. She serves as an ambassador for teacher collaboration  and observation, both factors she believes will create positive change  within her school.   Michelle holds a bachelor's degree in secondary English education  from Southeastern University in Lakeland, FL, and is currently pursuing  a master's degree in collaborative teaching. She received the  Southeastern University Award and Most Outstanding Secondary English  Major Award in 2009, publishing two original poems locally and  nationally.   I extend my sincere thanks to Michelle for her dedication to helping  her students achieve success. I look forward to hearing of her  continued success throughout her teaching career in the years  ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Nicole Grebosz, the  Volusia County Teacher of the Year from Citrus Grove Elementary School  in DeLand, FL.   In the same county where she completed her high school degree about  17 years ago, Nicole was named her county's Teacher of the Year. She is  a technology special area teacher, focusing on new technology  instruction.   Thanks to Nicole's hard work, more than 940 students at her school  have access to the tools that will help steer their education. Nicole  says her students think they cannot code because it involves a language  they do not speak, but she knows this is not the case. She strives to  make them believe in themselves.   Nicole transitioned to elementary school in 2015, after having  started her career in education at her alma mater, Pine Ridge High  School. During her 9 years at the high school, she taught English and  language arts. She also headed a web design class at Florida Virtual  School.   I thank Nicole for the commitment she has made to teaching her  students to understand our rapidly evolving technological world. I  extend my best wishes to Nicole on her continued success in future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Samantha Neff, the Seminole County Teacher of the Year from Idyllwilde  Elementary School in Sanford, FL.   Samantha's administrators say she brings enthusiasm and creative  energy to her school. She is determined to help her colleagues become  better math teachers in order to help their students feel confident  tackling the sometimes difficult subject.   Samantha joined the school this year and has already helped  Idyllwilde teachers, particularly its 24 new ones, improve their  lessons. She spends hours in classrooms, modeling lessons and observing  their styles. According to her principal, Samantha is exemplary and is  dedicated to contributing her time, energy, and resources into the  school's students. Seventeen years into her career, Samantha still  loves teaching and is eager to encourage her love of math.   Samantha grew up in Seminole County and graduated from Lake Mary High  School. She has spent her entire teaching career in the district,  working as an elementary school teacher, then as a math coach whose job  is to help other teachers become better math instructors. She is also  an adjunct professor at the University of Central Florida, her alma  mater.   I am grateful for the dedication Samantha has shown to her students  throughout her teaching career. I express my best wishes to her and  look forward to hearing of Samantha's continued success in the years  ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Kylie Ondriezek,  the Sumter County Teacher of the Year from Wildwood Middle High School  in Wildwood, FL.   Kylie was recognized with the Teacher of the Year award because of  her dedication to providing her students with countless opportunities  for success in her classroom. She strives to provide her students with  a quality education and creating a friendly atmosphere to learn.   Kylie's colleagues and students note she makes herself available to  their needs throughout the school day. She is devoted to being a  positive role model and wants to make sure she is able to help all of  her students as they continue their educational careers long after  leaving her classroom.   Kylie graduated from Wildwood Middle High School and returned to the  school in 2015 to teach English II and English II honors.   I am pleased to congratulate Kylie for receiving this important  recognition.
