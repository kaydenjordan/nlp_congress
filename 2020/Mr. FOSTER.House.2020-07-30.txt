 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, this bipartisan amendment offered by Mr.  Kelly and me and supported, also, by Mr. Schweikert and Dr. Bera, would  strike section 510, which bans HHS from adopting standards for a unique  patient identifier that would allow patients to be identified uniquely  across electronic health record systems.   In the 21 years that this misguided policy has been in place, tens of  thousands of Americans have died due to getting the wrong drug to the  wrong patient or due to incorrect or incomplete electronic medical  records, all arising from the inability to simply and correctly merge  health records from different systems.   Matching records properly requires a unique identifier for each  patient. A Federal ban on doing this properly makes our healthcare  system more expensive and less safe for patients.   A Johns Hopkins study recently calculated that more than 250,000  deaths per year are due to medical errors, and patient  misidentification is a significant contributor to this.                                time  1445    This ban is also handcuffing us in our fight against opioids. A 2018  roundtable on the opioid crisis, cohosted by HHS and the nonprofit  Center for Open Data Enterprise, recommended the generation of a unique  identifier for each patient.   This would not only guard against so-called ``doctor shopping'' for  opioids by those struggling with substance use disorder, but could also  prevent those in recovery from accidentally being given prescription  opioids after an injury, surgery, or childbirth, thereby triggering a  relapse.   Finally, the ability to identify patients across the care continuum  is also critical in our efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  Accurate identification of patients is one of the most difficult and  crucial operational issues during a public health emergency. Field  hospitals and temporary testing sites in parks, convention centers, and  parking lots only intensify these challenges.   Laboratories that are testing patient specimens for COVID-19 are  reporting that patient misidentification is causing COVID-19 test  results to be returned to the wrong patient with potentially deadly  consequences.   Madam Speaker, repealing this ban tackles a known and fixable problem  in our healthcare system. I urge support for this bipartisan amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), chairwoman of the Appropriations, Labor-HHS  and Education Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Kelly), my colleague, for cosponsoring this bipartisan amendment  so that we can move our healthcare system into the 21st century, save  money, and, most importantly, save lives.   Madam Speaker, this amendment is supported by over 50 health groups,  including the American Heart Association, the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians,  the American College of Surgeons, the College of Healthcare Information  Management Executives, the Opioid Safety Alliance, and many others.   Madam Speaker, last year, the House resoundingly passed this  amendment to strike this ban. I urge my colleagues to once again pass  this amendment. I urge the Senate to take proper action when we do, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
