 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and  legacy of Betty Ray McCain, who sadly passed away last week.   She was a force of nature. She spent decades fighting for North  Carolinians, from working for former Governor Jim Hunt to serving on  UNC's Board of Governors.   Much of the social progress we have made in North Carolina can be  credited to Betty Ray McCain's work with the  [[Page H8724]]  North Carolina Democratic Party, where she served as the first  chairwoman. In the 1970s and 1980s, she was one of the most important  voices in the fight to ratify the ERA.   As a long-time resident of Wilson, North Carolina, Betty Ray McCain  always gave back to the community she called home. She paved the way  for women like me, and her legacy will inspire future generations.   Betty Ray McCain left her mark on North Carolina history, and we are  better because of her.                            ____________________
