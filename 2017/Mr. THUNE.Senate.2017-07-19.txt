 Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Maci Burke.  Maci hails from Chamberlain, SD, and is a rising sophomore at the  University of Nebraska-Lincoln.   While interning on the Commerce Committee, Maci assisted the Surface  Transportation Subcommittee. She is a dedicated worker who was  committed to getting the most out of her internship. I extend my  sincere thanks and appreciation to Maci for all of the fine work she  did for the committee and wish her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
