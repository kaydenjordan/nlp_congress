 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work and  leadership on this bill, and I thank Ranking Member Lowey for her good  stewardship.   This is the culmination of efforts over the last year, hundreds of  meetings, oversight hearings. We have a strong final product, and we  are proud of what we have accomplished.   In my committee's Legislative Branch bill, we focused on conservative  priorities such as security, responsibility, and transparency. This  legislation, once again, rejects pay increases for Members of Congress,  which we have done every year since 2010; and further, the funding of  the House of Representatives remains 12 percent below 2010, spending  less than we spent 8 years ago.   After the vicious attack on  Steve Scalise and other Members of this  body, we have enhanced Capital security with new support for Members,  staff, constituents, and visitors, with enhancements for Capitol Police  and the Sergeant at Arms.   We have expanded Wounded Warrior fellowships, creating an additional  31 spots, and we have added support for family issues like the House  Child Care Center and additional support for the Library of Congress  Visitor Experience, which is an exciting new product.   Lastly, in a strike for transparency, for the first time, all  Congressional Research Service reports will be open to  [[Page H2025]]  the public, making government more transparent and a win for our  constituents.   I want to thank my ranking member, Mr. Ryan, who is a gentleman and a  scholar, and the collaboration of all the committee members and staff  for putting this product together.
