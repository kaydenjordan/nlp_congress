 Madam Speaker, when I stood in John Lewis' presence, I  stood in awe, in reverence, and with great respect.   John Lewis was an extraordinary man of faith, perseverance, virtue,  and kindness. He endured ridicule and beatings during his nonviolent  fight alongside Dr. King.   He spent a lifetime fighting against injustices, poverty, white  supremacy, and racism, and for equality and human dignity. He was a  social justice and civil rights warrior who inspired me, all of us in  this Chamber and this Nation.   He was a man of God on a relentless mission of peace to create the  kingdom and bring to Earth life as it is in Heaven.   As great a man as he was, he was always humble and gentle. He was  always faithful in his fight for freedom from oppression.   John was also a friend. He always asked how my daughters, Sky and  Sage, were doing on the House floor and in the hallways, and even  visited them during their birthday parties in my D.C. office.   He will undoubtedly be greeted in Heaven by our creator with the  words, ``Job well done, my humble servant,'' an honor well-deserved and  greater than life itself.   May John Lewis rest in God's almighty power.   I love you and I miss you, brother.
