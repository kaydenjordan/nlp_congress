 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding and for his leadership. I especially thank my  good friend and colleague, Ms. Bass, for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, last August, my staff director Greg Simpkins and I  visited Juba, South Sudan, to press President Salva Kiir, his Vice  President, the minister of defense, and five of his top generals to end  the civil war, protect innocent lives, and reverse the conditions  causing rampant disease and severe malnutrition that could soon lead to  a famine.   Mr. Speaker, just 2 months ago, famine was formally declared in South  Sudan. I especially asked President Kiir to personally intervene and  issue and enforce an executive order of zero tolerance on rape and  sexual abuse by his soldiers and security personnel against mostly  humanitarian aid workers and civilians. I told the President that it  was unconscionable in the extreme that South Sudanese soldiers had  raped, beaten, and murdered humanitarian aid workers in July at the  Terrain compound. One of those workers that was sexually assaulted, as  it turned out, was from my own district. I didn't know until 3 days  before leaving on that trip that she was in the compound and came close  to being raped and it was the intervention of other forces that  precluded her from suffering that horrible trauma, but she was, indeed,  severely traumatized.   I asked him for a review to hold people to account and put them in  prison--yes, there have been arrests, but there have been no  prosecutions yet--and, again, to issue a zero tolerance policy.   On March 28, I chaired a hearing on the famine and the growing crisis  in South Sudan, which is also being chaired by some of the other  neighboring countries in the region.   Matt Nims, the acting director of the Office of Food for Peace  testified that for 3 years the international community has employed  massive efforts to stave off famine in South Sudan. Yet, as conflict  intensified, the food security situation continued to deteriorate. And  he said:         This is a man-made crisis and the direct consequence of       prolonged conflict.    Ken Isaacs, the vice president of Samaritan's Purse--and Samaritan's  Purse has an extensive footprint in South Sudan doing unbelievably  great humanitarian work--testified:   [[Page H2834]]              The most significant driver of the current crisis in the       worst hit areas of South Sudan, however, is the political       insecurity and brutal conflict that continues to engulf       the region. In South Sudan alone, 1.85 million people have       been internally displaced because. Because of this, many       people are calling this a man-made famine, and it is hard       to argue with that assessment.    Today, the United Nations reports that two-thirds of South Sudan's  population requires humanitarian assistance, and almost 5 million  people--more than 40 percent of the population--are in urgent need of  food, agriculture, and nutritional assistance.   Clearly, the Government of South Sudan and the rebels they face are  more interested in winning and holding territory than in finding ways  to feed and nurture their people and allow humanitarian access. Two  months ago, there were 70 humanitarian-access incidents reported,  causing suspension of operations in multiple locations. Aid workers are  being targeted in South Sudan, where eight Samaritan's Purse workers  were kidnapped and later released in February, and six African aid  workers in South Sudan were killed in March.   Stephen O'Brien, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of  Humanitarian Affairs, accused South Sudan's Government of blocking  foods and medicines and restricting U.N. peacekeepers from protecting  civilians. He described active hostility, access denials, and  bureaucratic impediments to humanitarian organizations serving that  beleaguered nation. This is a manmade crisis. This resolution puts us  on record and, again, encourages our administration and the world to do  more to end it.
