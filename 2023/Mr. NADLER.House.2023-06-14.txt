 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an  estimate of a rule's effect on inflation in the congressional review  report.   I oppose this amendment because it requires an estimate of a rule's  effect on inflation, which would require the Comptroller General to  speculate, based on limited evidence, how rules that likely have little  to do with the economy would affect inflation.   The GAO has already reported to Congress that they would be unable to  assess a rule's impact on the economy with the limited information  available, and in any case, the 15 days provided for major rule reports  do not allow for the GAO to make a determination on a rule's effect  even if they had the necessary information.   Adding more requirements for various officials to estimate a rule's  effect on the economy when they lack the necessary time and information  to provide a concrete answer will not heighten the efficacy of this  bill but will, rather, create more unnecessary estimates for Congress  to weigh in their review of agency rules.   In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has  previously noted that estimating the total cost of regulations is  inherently difficult and that such estimates of the cost of regulation  should be viewed with a great deal of caution. Like the OMB, CRS has  noted that there are significant methodological challenges to  estimating and aggregating the total costs and benefits of rules.   I oppose this amendment because it focuses only on the cost of  regulatory protections while completely ignoring the monetary benefits  of those critical rules and because it asks the Comptroller General to  do what is impossible to do.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is very nice to say that we should  examine the inflation that has occurred and the spending that has  occurred, but that is not what the amendment calls for.   The amendment requires the Comptroller General to include an estimate  of a rule's effect, a rule that presumably hasn't yet been issued, on  inflation in the congressional review report.   Now, I stated before why it is impossible to do that, why the CRS and  the OMB say that there are significant methodological challenges to  estimating and aggregating the total costs and benefits of rules.  Therefore, we shouldn't be asking the impossible. It certainly has  nothing to do with looking at prior expenditures or prior borrowing.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as I noted in our debate on the REINS Act last  night, the REINS Act is aimed at undermining and frustrating the  purpose of government by grinding Federal rulemaking to a halt.   By lowering the threshold of this dangerous bill from $100 million to  $50 million, this amendment would make the REINS Act even more  destructive.   I accordingly oppose this amendment for the same reasons I oppose the  REINS Act at large. By requiring Congress to vote to approve and for  the President to sign a resolution of approval for any major rule from  the executive branch, we will be putting our constituents in harm's  way.   Just last week, we saw how a small faction of far-right Republicans  can hold the legislative process in the House hostage, all to make a  point to the Speaker.   I oppose this amendment and the efforts of the majority to make the  functions of government more political and subject to the whims of  individual Members of Congress.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The central fallacy of the REINS Act that I noted last night is that  Congress can possibly legislate on all the things, on all the  regulations that we have. There are thousands of regulations, and there  must be for the safety of our people.   How many parts per billion of arsenic in the atmosphere are safe? Is  it 15? Is it 20? Is it 200? No one in this body has the expertise to  say that, but there are experts in the agencies who are trained to do  that.   How much exposure to radiation from x-rays is safe for an individual?  We are not competent to decide that. That is why Congress has delegated  over the years these decisions to agencies to make on our behalf. We  write the general law, and we delegate the general power to decide  these specific questions, and they do.   The central fallacy of the REINS Act is that it would make us try to  make decisions in all of this. That is bad enough. The REINS Act now  says you have to have Congress vote on every decision over $100  million. That is bad enough. This amendment would make it over $50  million, which makes it even worse.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment as I oppose the act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.  [[Page H2908]]     Mr. Chair, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service  has previously noted that estimating the total cost of regulations is  inherently difficult and that such estimates of the cost of regulation  should be viewed with a great deal of caution.   Like the OMB, CRS has noted that there are significant methodological  challenges to estimating and aggregating the total costs and benefits  of rules.   I rise in opposition to this amendment as it requires the OMB to make  a specific determination of a rule's impact when they already say it is  difficult to make an estimate of the impact.   This amendment requires the OMB to do the impossible, to make a  specific finding when OMB and CRS have already said that even estimates  are very difficult and inherently unreliable. To request a finding is  to request the impossible, and, therefore, I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have expressed my opposition to the entire  REINS Act because, as I said before, we are not competent. Congress  cannot possibly decide how many parts per billion of arsenic is safe in  the air for people to breathe or how many rads of radiation are safe to  have in x-rays before it causes cancer. We don't know that. That is why  we write general laws, and in those laws, we have delegated the power  to make specific rules to agencies who are staffed by thousands of  experts in each particular field. That is why the REINS Act is so  pernicious, because it would stop this. It would make us make those  decisions. We have no competence to make those decisions.   The REINS Act is bad enough, but this amendment, which says that OIRA  must issue a finding for each rule determining whether the rule has a  significant economic impact, given that OMB and CRS have both said that  it is very difficult to make even estimates, you can't make a finding.  A finding implies exactitude. Given the fact that even the estimates  are very difficult and unreliable, a finding is impossible. The  amendment should not require that someone do the impossible. Therefore,  I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is unnecessary. Congress  already has many ways to control agency rulemaking. We can delegate  authority to agencies with specificity, thus limiting the scope of an  agency's authority. We can impose restrictions on rulemaking through  appropriations. We can influence rulemaking through oversight  activities. If all of these measures fail, we also have the blunt tool  of the Congressional Review Act.   Therefore, we do not need the oversight the REINS Act offers, but we  also do not need to open the door to revising rules that have been in  place for years. Doing so would create uncertainty for businesses who  have adapted to rules that were passed years ago and continue in force.   The current Congressional Review Act only allows Congress to roll  back rules within a short time period. The CRA was drafted with a short  period of review intentionally, and to open the door to reviewing years  of rules would be a huge expansion of the CRA, and it would create too  much uncertainty for businesses and for all other economic actors.   For these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman said that rules tell Americans  what kind of cars they can drive. No, they do not. They do provide for  the safety of the cars that Americans drive. They provide for all of  the safety mechanisms that must be in the cars.   Again, Congress does not have the competence to know what safety  mechanisms ought to be in the cars. That is why we have delegated  rulemaking authority to agencies which have experts on how many parts-- I keep using this example--how many parts per billion of arsenic can be  in the air, what safety measures must be in a car, et cetera.   The REINS Act violates this and is very dangerous to the American  people. This amendment makes it even worse by essentially saying every  rule has to be reviewed in 5 years by Congress. Congress can't possibly  review all of these rules.   Therefore, this amendment will make Americans even less safe in many  ways, and I oppose the amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, we have a very clear difference of  perspectives here. The gentleman talks about the right to life. I talk  about the right to freedom. The right to reproductive freedom is a core  human right that is protected by our Constitution.   The majority of the work our agencies do has little to do with the  private decisions women make with the consultation of their doctors. In  an effort to continue the culture wars, my colleagues have added this  purposefully politicized amendment to signal that they, contrary to  their supposed beliefs, do think that Big Government is good and that  Big Government's reach extends to a woman's private decisions about  what to do with her body.   All the rhetoric about the REINS Act is that Big Government is bad,  that we should have less government. That is all the rhetoric of the  Republican Party, generally. Yet, here they are, saying that government  should reach into the private decisions of a woman with respect to her  own body that were made in consultation with her doctor or perhaps with  her husband or whomever. It is up to her, and government shouldn't  determine her decision for her.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and the Republicans' crusade to  create more laws about what we can do with our bodies and our  reproductive decisions because government should not be in the business  of dictating private decisions to private people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the Republican Party claims to be the party  of freedom, but not when it comes to women and the decisions they make  with respect to their own bodies. It is then the party of government  repression and dictation.   You cannot do what you decide to do. You cannot do what you think is  best. You must do what government thinks is best--namely, not have an  abortion.   I proudly support the right to abortion. I believe abortion should be  safe and legal. Whether it is rare is up to the individuals. It is a  personal freedom. The Democratic Party supports personal freedom,  unlike the Republican Party, which while claiming to support personal  freedom seeks to repress it.   They are a party that says you cannot decide what to do with your own  body, a party that says you cannot read what we don't want you to read,  a party that says: Let's ban books. Let's ban plays. Let's take them  out of the school libraries and out of the public libraries.   Some freedom.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. It is another example of the  Republican Party's attempt to suppress freedom, and it must not pass.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chairwoman, while the estimate of the economic impact of any  rule by the GAO would be highly speculative and should be considered  with caution--as the GAO itself said--this rule would at least lessen  the harm that this dangerous bill would effect.   Although this amendment does not cure all the ills in the REINS Act,  the amendment would at least reduce the number of rules REINS would  apply to, and, therefore, I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment amends the definition of rule  to include interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and all  other guidance documents.   However, guidance documents from agencies are not given the force of  law in court. Expanding this bill to also require any guidance the  agency gives to businesses about how the rules will be enforced is a  gross expansion of the Congressional Review Act and would ensure that  agencies provide less guidance for business thus creating more  uncertainty. More uncertainty in business stifles business.   Madam Chair, you want to know the environment you are operating in if  you are a businessperson.   This amendment is an overstep and would stifle further the work of  our agencies and would make it much more difficult to conduct business  in this country.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close.   Madam Chair, at the risk of sounding repetitive from what I have said  in several other amendments, Congress is not capable of making the  judgments--the thousands and millions of judgments--on specifics like  how many parts of arsenic per billion in the atmosphere is safe? What  should the tolerance of a braking system in the automobile be? How many  units of radiation can a person tolerate that is worth risking in an  MRI or a CAT scan?   That is why Congress has delegated to agencies, which we created, the  power to make these decisions which we are not competent to make, the  thousands and thousands of specific decisions on scientific and other  questions; mostly scientific questions.                                time  1330    The REINS Act is a very bad piece of legislation because it would say  that the agencies can't do this, that Congress must do it, and we don't  have the capacity. We don't have the time, and we don't have the  knowledge.   How many people here know how many units of radiation are safe?   How many hearings must be conducted for the thousands or even  millions of decisions that must be made each year?   The REINS Act is a bad idea. This amendment, in effect, expands the  REINS Act to include interpretive rules and general statements of  policy. It makes it even more impossible. Therefore, it makes a very  bad bill worse, and I oppose it and urge its defeat.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, the REINS Act would already frustrate the  point of government by grinding the critical actions of our agencies to  a halt.   Why, Mr. Roy--and I presume the majority generally--feels the need to  also include efforts to protect some of the most vulnerable among us is  beyond me.   America has a long history of discrimination, and efforts to include  these historically marginalized groups should be celebrated and  supported, not subjected to further scrutiny by Congress just because  the majority disagrees with supporting these individuals.   May I remind you that we represent all the people, and amendments  like this undermine our service to our constituents.   I would ask, why should we tell hospitals not to perform certain  medical procedures? If gender-affirming surgery is necessary for the  patient and the doctor says it is, why shouldn't the VA hospital  provide such surgery?   We do not, I presume, want to say it is because we want to  discriminate against transgender people, or we want to discriminate  against gay or lesbian people. I hope that is not what we are saying,  but that is what this amendment seems to do.   I oppose this amendment because it goes against our notions of  equality and our notions of fairness.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, the gentleman says: Why don't we legislate  on some of this? We have.   Might I remind the gentleman that last year we passed the Respect for  Marriage Act, codifying the rights of two men to marry each other or  two women to marry each other because we respect freedom?   The amendment does not respect freedom. The amendment, by its  description by its sponsor, would say, no, we don't want to do gender- affirming surgery. We don't want to perform surgery that people need  because we disapprove of them. That is wrong.   The REINS Act is a very bad act for all the reasons I have stated  many times already today. I am not going to repeat them. This amendment  would make it worse because diversity, equity, and inclusion executive  orders are things to be celebrated, not things to decry.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a list of organizations opposing  H.R. 277.                           Opposition to H.R. 277         The Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, consisting of over       160 labor, consumer, and environmental organizations,       including:      AFL-CIO      Alliance for Justice      American Association of University Professors      American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees      American Federation of Teachers      American Forum      American Lung Association      American Rivers      American Sustainable Business Council      Americans for Financial Reform      BlueGreen Alliance      Campaign for Contract Agriculture Reform (CCAR)      Center for American Progress      Center for Biological Diversity      Center for Digital Democracy      Center for Food Safety      Center for Foodborne Illness, Research & Prevention      Center for International Environmental Law      Center for Progressive Reform      Center for Responsible Lending      Consumer Federation of America      Consumer Reports      Demos      Earthjustice      Economic Policy Institute      Environment America      Farmworker Justice      Free Press      International Brotherhood of Teamsters      International Center for Technology Assessment      International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &       Agricultural Implement      Workers of America (UAW)      League of Conservation Voters      Main Street Alliance      Media Matters for America      National Association of Consumer Advocates      National Consumers League      National Employment Law Project      National Family Farm Coalition      National Women's Health Network      National Women's Law Center      Natural Resources Defense Council      Partnership for Working Public Citizen      Reproductive Health Technologies Project      Sciencecorps      Service Employees International Union      Sierra Club      STOP Foodborne Illness      The Arc of the United States      U.S. PIRG      Union of Concerned Scientists Union Plus      United Food and Commercial Workers Union      United Steelworkers      Voices for Progress      Waterkeeper Alliance      Worksafe        The Center for Progressive Reform; a coalition of health       partners including American Lung Association, Allergy &       Asthma Network, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and the       National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practioners; and the       American Association of Government Employees, AFL-CIO.     Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, yet again, we have another amendment aimed  at dividing us instead of allowing us to serve the people who elected  us.   Vaccinations help us eradicate terrible diseases, like smallpox,  polio, measles, mumps, tuberculosis, rubella, and on and on and on.   Adding this amendment would not help us govern. It will not help us  serve our constituents. Instead, it would just serve to undermine  necessary health and safety rules.   We here in this Chamber cannot know what contagious diseases we may  face in the future, and I oppose any amendment that would undermine our  ability to protect our constituents.   Madam Chair, before I was allowed to go to school--I won't tell you  how many years ago that was--I had to be vaccinated for diphtheria, for  whopping cough, for the diseases that they then knew how to vaccinate  against. Nothing has changed. We are to vaccinate people to prevent  diseases and pandemics.   The fact of the matter is that people should be required to be  vaccinated, especially a nurse, a nurse who is dealing with patients,  who is breathing on those patients. She can transmit the disease. So  certainly, she should be required to be vaccinated because the  vaccination not only protects her, but it also protects against  transmission of the disease to the next person. The healthcare worker  certainly ought to be required to be vaccinated.   When we have a pandemic like the COVID-19 pandemic that we had, 2- year-olds should have been required to wear masks. It would be child  abuse for parents not to do that because there was no vaccination  available for 2-year-olds. The only way to protect them against COVID  was to have them wear masks. These mandates are meant to protect the  public's health and safety.   God willing we won't have another pandemic such as we had, but in the  future, we will be required, I presume, to be vaccinated against major  threatening diseases. That is right. To expand the major rule to  include any increase in mandatory vaccinations is intended to prevent  mandatory vaccinations. That is a crime against the public health.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, why the COVID-19 vaccine should be more  politicized than any other vaccine, I don't know. I don't understand  that.   And why the COVID-19 vaccine is considered by the gentleman to be  politicized, I don't understand that either.   It is just another vaccine. It is another vaccine for a very raging  pandemic we just had and which is hopefully over--although people are  still dying of COVID-19. People should get vaccinated against it, if  they haven't been vaccinated.   But the REINS Act would make it much more difficult to require or  even to drop the requirement for vaccination, and this amendment would  specifically make it more difficult.   That is ridiculous from a public health point of view, therefore, I  oppose the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
