 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the wonderful  accomplishments of two young women from my district. April Vassell and  Nevaeh Parker were each selected to attend the United Nations  Foundation's 2018 Women in Science, or WiSci, Girls STEAM Camp in  Namibia.   The camp will bring together 100 high school girls from the African  Continent and the United States for a 2-week intensive learning  program.   This amazing camp is co-hosted by the U.S. Department of State and  private partners. It brings girls together to help close the gender gap  in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics.   April and Nevaeh will have the opportunity to enhance their STEAM  skills, grow as young leaders, and develop relationships with their  sisters from Africa. These two young women and the other campers have a  lot to be proud of.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their achievements,  their potential, and success.                            ____________________
