 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I am offering here on the  legislation we are considering would prohibit any of the funds in this  appropriations bill from being used to carry out so-called  environmental justice activities.   This so-called environmental justice is nothing more, in the end,  than a synthesis of divisive racial ideology and policies that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to promote with radical  environmentalism.   Basically, they are taking the radical environmental policies  perpetuated in the EPA and Interior through this administration,  doubling down on them, injecting divisive race policies, and now  creating a larger problem for the American people.   The entire ideology is based on the notion that Federal environmental  funding should be allocated based on immutable characteristics. Let's  think about that for a minute. Not only do we need to destroy the  American economy with radical environmental policies, but we need to  inject divisive race policies in the middle of it. That is where we  are.   People are running around, going to the gas station to get gasoline.  They are trying to power their homes. They are wondering why we are  having massive instability around the world. They wonder why China is  on the rise. They wonder why Iran is able to enrich itself by selling  oil to China. They wonder why they can't afford to live their own lives  while inflation is destroying their well-being. Now, we are injecting  race into the middle of it all.   Biden's so-called Justice40 Initiative directs 40 percent of Federal  clean energy and energy efficiency spending based on ethnicity, migrant  status, and income status. You literally just can't make up this  absurdity.   Here are some of the examples.   ``Developing a roadmap to dismantle environmental racism'' in  Brunswick, Georgia.   Ecology Action in Bloomington, Illinois, ``seeks to identify and  develop mitigation strategies for disproportionate climate impacts . .  . and increase tree equity.'' What in the hell is tree equity?   Supporting summer high school environmental internships in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, ``to build climate resilience and connect mainly young  people of color to life skills and environmental sector career  pathways.'' However, a recent study conducted by President Obama's  former Energy Secretary found, on average, solar workers make $12,000 a  year less than oil and gas workers.   The fact of the matter is that we are destroying the American economy  by chasing the climate agenda, which my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle fully acknowledge and admit is being  [[Page H5384]]  driven by the climate agenda and that the American people must suffer  higher inflation and higher costs--an inability to afford their own  homes and their own cars to go about their own jobs and their own way  of life--in order to pursue an agenda that everybody acknowledges that,  even if we do everything my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  say we should do, wouldn't dent CO2 production relative to  what is happening in China, India, and countries around the world.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the fact is, I have not heard one  constituent--not one constituent among the 750,000 people who I  represent--come up to me and say: Do you know what I need, Congressman  Roy? I need environmental justice funding.   Calls to my office are just begging for environmental justice  funding. Has anybody had a constituent do that, call up and say: Will  you please solve the world's problems with environmental  justice funding? No.    Do you know what I have had? I have had phone calls to my office  saying: I can't afford gas. I can't afford electricity.   I have had calls from workers from a refinery in my district saying  that they are going to drive us out of business and that they don't  know what they are going to do.   That is all a direct result of a radical agenda by Democrats in the  White House, the administration, and my colleagues across the aisle in  this Chamber and the other Chamber who are more interested in advancing  a radical agenda than standing up for American citizens who simply want  to live their lives.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a straightforward amendment. It would  do what the American people want us to do, which is focus on our job  here in this Chamber to deliver our constitutional duties and nothing  more and not divide us by race while also destroying the American  economy with radical environmentalism.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, before I talk about this amendment, the  gentlewoman referred to the importance of having trees. No one  disagrees with that. Yes, I live in the Texas Hill Country, where live  oaks are something we try to figure out how to protect, especially, for  example, when you have an ice storm like earlier this year. You are out  there figuring out a way to go save your trees by cutting limbs and  figuring out how to preserve the beauty that God gave us. Nobody  disagrees with that.                                time  0930    Nonetheless, the idea that a core responsibility of the Federal  Government is tree equity is absurd. The State of Texas is the eighth  largest economy in the world. We are perfectly capable of figuring out  how to deal with trees.   We don't have any money. We are $34 trillion in debt, $2 trillion a  year in deficit spending, and we are talking about tree equity?   What the hell are we doing? That is the question here.   I love trees. I love live oak trees. I do everything I can to  preserve and protect the environment in which I live because--this is a  crazy idea--I live there. I actually like to fish, and I like to live  in clean air and clean water. I like to have an environment that is  great to be in for my kids and my family.   We had a Clean Water Act and a Clean Air Act in Texas before the  Environmental Protection Agency was even created here in this town.   The fact of the matter is we can do what we need to do to protect our  communities without this place spending money we don't have to  interfere with this. Yes, there are interstate issues we must deal  with, and we can deal with those things. Nevertheless, the fact is we  can do these things.   This amendment that I am offering prohibits any of the funding in the  Interior-Environment appropriations bill from being used to carry out  President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   These executive orders direct the EPA to wage its regulatory war on  the United States energy production and the internal combustion engine.  The fact of the matter is there are ambitious efforts to convert our  entire fleet of vehicles to have two-thirds of new vehicles be electric  vehicles by 2032.   Now, that might sound good in a little focus group in some Ivy League  cabal in Boston, but the idea of what this is going to actually do to  hardworking Americans is something we ought to actually flush out for  the American public when the average EV is $16,000 more than a vehicle  with an internal combustion engine.   Maybe we should talk about the racial justice issues of cobalt miners  around the world who are being exploited in the Congo so that we can  empower China by buying all of their batteries rather than producing  American oil and gas.   If people think that all of this stuff is an accident of what we are  seeing unfold in the Middle East and what we are seeing unfold in  Ukraine while our prices are going up and while our national security  strength is going down because we are pursuing this radical agenda,  these things are all connected.   So, yes, we should not be funding these radical executive orders that  are destroying the American way of life and making it virtually  impossible for people to figure out how to live their lives while we  pursue unicorn energy theories that we are going to be able to somehow  magically produce power without the use of reliable power.   Texas has tons of wind and solar. That is great, but we also have a  grid that is decreasingly reliable directly as a consequence of Federal  regulatory impact on our ability to manage our grid. That is wrong, we  shouldn't do it, and we shouldn't be funding a continuation of it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the fact of the matter is that, yes, this bill  returns the funding to the ever-efficient model of effectiveness of the  2018 Federal Government.   Yes, it does back up the funding levels. Frankly, we ought to be  doing it for more of our agencies, and we are trying to take those  steps forward. I will say that unapologetically because the American  people are sick and tired of the Federal Government spending money we  don't have to fund agencies that are directly at war with their way of  life. That is the truth.   That is why gasoline is $1 more than it was when Biden took office,  despite the fact that the President has completely dumped our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve in order to try to preserve political benefits for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle. That is just the simple  truth, and everybody knows it.    Yet, we run around here ignoring the reality of what that means for  the American people who are trying to get by every single day while the  Federal Government is directly at odds with their ability to prosper,  earn a living, pay their bills, pay for their energy, pay for their  schools, buy cars, and do what they need to do.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5386]]
