 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, my amendment supports the 43 million family caregivers  nationwide who provide long-term services to their aging or disabled  loved ones.   These individuals provide the vast majority of long-term care in our  country. In fact, AARP, if you had to put a dollar figure on it, has  estimated that family caregivers provide some $470 billion a year in  uncompensated care.   Respite care services provide short-term relief for these family  caregivers and is one of the most frequently requested services.   Let's face it, if a caregiver can't take care of their own health or  get a break and look out for their well-being, they certainly will have  a very hard time providing the very best care for their loved ones in  need.   Access to respite care has been shown to improve caregiver health and  well-being, promote family stability, and avoid or delay the need for  admission to costly institutional settings, resulting in significant  savings for both the healthcare system and taxpayers.   The Lifespan Respite Care Program is the only Federal effort that  provides respite care services regardless of age or disability. The  Lifespan Respite Care Program is often the only open door for families  affected by conditions with an earlier onset, like multiple sclerosis,  since other Federal programs are focused on children or seniors.   Madam Chair, 37 States and the District of Columbia have used  Lifespan Respite Care grants to coordinate and streamline respite  services as well as provide direct resources to help families pay for  planned or emergency respite care.   Providing an additional $4.5 million for the Lifespan Respite Care  Program will allow the Administration for Community Living to award  additional grants to States and allow existing grantees to reach more  families.   By investing in the Lifespan Respite Care Program, we support family  members who perform the rewarding but demanding task of caregiving and  empower individuals to live at home, where they are most comfortable,  while reducing costs to the healthcare system.   Madam Chair, in closing, let me thank my good friend Ms. DeLauro, the  chair of the subcommittee, for her years of leadership fighting to  improve the healthcare system for the underprivileged.   By adopting this amendment, we will be setting the appropriation at  the highest level since the program was authorized in 2006 by  legislation authored by myself as well as Congressman Mike Ferguson. It  was a bipartisan bill.   I deeply appreciate the chairwoman's attention to this issue, among  many others, and I would again like to thank her and the ranking member  for their work on this bill.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to show their support for family  caregivers by voting in favor of this amendment.  [[Page H4560]]    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).                                time  1930     Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of the time.   Madam Chair, I want to, again, stress the importance of providing  respite services to our Nation's 43 million family caregivers. Respite  care has been proven to save both the healthcare system and taxpayers  money, and the lifespan respite care program is the only Federal effort  that provides these services regardless of age or disabilities.   We can make a difference for these family caregivers by giving them  additional support and respite. It is the right thing to do. It will  help them to preserve their own health and preserve the family unit so  that they can stay strong to provide further care for their loved ones.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
