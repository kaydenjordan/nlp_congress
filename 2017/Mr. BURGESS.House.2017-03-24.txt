 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we all know why we are here--the problems that exist  within the Affordable Care Act. It is simply not working for the  American people--limited choice, costs going up, and millions without  access to care. Unfortunately, these are not just talking points, but  real issues affecting real Americans.   The Affordable Care Act has damaged the individual market. It has  driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing one- third of all United States counties with only one insurer. And among  the plans that have chosen to remain in the markets, there have been  widespread, double-digit premium increases.   The individual markets are a death spiral and are failing to live up  to the promises made 7 years ago--that Americans would be able to  receive affordable health care. As we knew then, and we know now, this  was an empty promise that has left an estimated 19.2 million Americans  without coverage. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay  the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of  the costs to purchase and use health insurance.   Nine months ago, Mr. Speaker, we began our Better Way plan to save  the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the American  people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American  Health Care Act, laid out the policies to stabilize the collapsing  insurance markets and to repeal the more burdensome Affordable Care Act  taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to  care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care Act does.   First and foremost, it provides immediate relief to the State  insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that one-size-fits-all works  for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The  States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets  and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage.    To do this, we relaxed two of the egregious market regulations that  were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums  cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3-to-1  ratio, and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.   The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has  driven up the cost for coverage for younger and healthier Americans and  has pushed away those seeking coverage by the millions. Of the 19.2  million Americans who have sidestepped the individual mandate, it  estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the  age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the  markets have further plunged into death spirals, as insurers hike up  premiums year after year.   To change this, we are relaxing the ratio to 5-to-1. It will lower  premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize the  markets.   Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to  provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage  options.                                time  0930    To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient  and State Stability Fund. This fund provides States with $100 billion  over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower cost and  increase access to health care for unique patient populations in each  State. The goal is simple: to provide States with maximum flexibility  as to how they address the cost of care for their citizens.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the  Stability Fund and other proposed changes to the market would reduce  premiums by 10 percent by calendar year 2026. We all want patients to  have access to high-quality, affordably priced coverage. The Patient  and State Stability Fund can help to lower costs.   In Medicaid, in addition to supporting the insurance market, the  American Health Care Act provides needed reforms to the Medicaid  program. Without changes, the Medicaid expansion alone is expected to  cost $1 trillion over the next decade. Medicaid desperately needs  reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children,  people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.   To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases  out the Medicaid expansion, the expansion that has crippled State  budgets and limited States' ability to ensure that  [[Page H2377]]  resources will continue to be available for those vulnerable  populations.   Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by  shifting programs toward per capita allotments. The per capita  allotments, an idea that originated during the Clinton administration,  will set limits on the annual cost for growth for per capita  expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the  Federal Government.   The American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that  States have in managing their Medicaid programs. The bill scales back  the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State's ability to  tailor their plans to the needs of their beneficiaries. States can and  should be trusted to manage the needs of their beneficiaries, and this  bill allows States to do that.   Additionally, the bill before us today furthers the goal of providing  the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs  by providing States with the option to implement two additional  opportunities: work requirement and block grants for Medicaid.   This time around we chose to engage our State counterparts in the  discussion and listen--listen--to their input as we designed this bill.  At the top of their list were the desire to see the work requirement  built in and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant.   We don't tell them what to do. They are given the permission to do  what they feel is best for their citizens. Republicans trust the States  and trust the Governors and the elected leaders in those States.   Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources  to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases in  the community health center funding, offers enhanced funding to support  safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends  the cuts to the disproportionate share hospital payments.   We are committed, Mr. Speaker, to ensuring that our local providers  can continue to deliver lifesaving care. The American Health Care Act  turns this commitment into action. For millions of Americans in rural  and medically underserved areas, these actions will provide needed  relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act.   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting process. We  had a 27\1/2\-hour markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We have  had over 15 or 16 hours in the Rules Committee. This bill has been  almost talked to death. I want to just acknowledge that I appreciate  the input of the administration. I appreciate the fact that the  directive to us last night was to put our pencils down and turn our  papers in. It is time, Mr. Speaker.   This is a good bill. The rule deserves our support. The underlying  bill deserves our support.
