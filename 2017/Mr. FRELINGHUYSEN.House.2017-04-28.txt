 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 289, I  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 99) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2017, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 289, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 99         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That the       Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017 (division C of Public Law       114-223) is further amended by--        (1) striking the date specified in section 106(3) and       inserting ``May 5, 2017''; and        (2) inserting after section 201 the following new section:        ``Sec. 202. (a) This section may be cited as the `Further       Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act'.        ``(b) Section 402(h)(2)(C)(ii) of the Surface Mining       Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C.       1232(h)(2)(C)(ii)) is amended--        ``(1) in subclause (II), by striking `April 30, 2017' and       inserting `May 5, 2017';        ``(2) in subclause (II)(aa), by striking `the Continued       Health Benefits for Miners Act' and inserting `the Further       Continued Health Benefits for Miners Act'; and        ``(3) by adding at the end the following: `For purposes of       subclause (II)(aa), a beneficiary enrolled in the Plan as of       the date of the enactment of the Further Continued Health       Benefits for Miners Act shall be deemed to have been eligible       to receive health benefits under the Plan on January 1,       2017.'.        ``(c) The provisions of section 167(d) of Public Law 114-      223 (as added by Public Law 114-254) shall apply to this       section.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will  control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 99.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to present H.J. Res. 99, a short-term continuing  resolution that will keep our government open for an additional week  while work is completed on a full-year funding package.   First, I would like to thank Ranking Member Lowey for her efforts on  this bill and, more broadly, on her valuable participation in the  appropriations process over many years.   Our current continuing resolution expires today at midnight. Working  together with the Senate, our leadership, and the White House, we are  on track to have a full-year, fiscal year 2017 appropriations  legislation completed soon, but we need a little more time to process  it and prepare it for the floor.   This resolution will ensure that the government stays open for  another week, until May 5, 2017, to give Congress additional time. It  extends current funding levels for essential government operations that  the American people rely on, including, most importantly, our national  defense.   It continues all policy and funding provisions in the currently  enacted continuing resolution. In addition, it includes an extension of  the December CR provision for healthcare benefits for retired coal  miners and their dependents for the length of the continuing  resolution.   Congress must pass this legislation today to keep the government open  and operating as we wrap up our full-year fiscal year 2017 work. It is  our constitutional duty and responsibility.   A continuing resolution is never anyone's first choice for funding  the government; however, this is our best path forward. This CR is very  short term, very limited in scope, and will help us complete our  important work of funding the government for the rest of fiscal year  2017.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about H.J. Res. 99,  ``Making Further Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.''   This resolution is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations for FY  2017, because it does not fully fund the government for the entire  fiscal year and it keeps in place sequestration.   H.J. Res. 99 goes against sound fiscal practice by including the  budget gimmickry known as sequestration, a fiscal bludgeon that makes  across the board cuts in funding for the valuable services depended  upon by American children, seniors, workers, veterans, students, and  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, the Continuing Resolution before us extends current  Fiscal Year 2017 government funding by seven days, through May 5, 2017,  at its current rate, which means a continuation of the across-the-board  cut of .19% for all accounts, defense and non-defense, contained in the  expiring continuing resolution that was approved December 8, 2016.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have again been placed in the  position of having to fund the government through the device of a  continuing resolution rather than through the normal appropriations  process of considering and voting on the twelve separate spending bills  reported by the Committee on Appropriations.   H.J. Res. 99 is far from perfect, but it is a modest and positive  step since it ensures that funding for appropriated entitlements will  continue at a rate maintaining program levels under current law and,  for a week at least, prevents congressional Republicans from shutting  down the government again and manufacturing a crisis that only harms  our economy, destroys jobs, and weakens our middle class.   The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the  Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion.   The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees  and the people they serve, however, was irreparable.  [[Page H2957]]    As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is not perfect  and it only funds the government until May 5, 2017.   As veteran and seasoned Members of Congress, we have been in this  challenging position before.   But working together--in a spirit of goodwill, bipartisanship, and  realism, I believe we can reach a long-term agreement that will avert a  shutdown of government operations and the disruption a shutdown causes  to the lives of millions of Americans who depend upon federal programs  to do their jobs, educate their kids, care for their parents, and  contribute to their communities.   Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make  responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy  prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education,  healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic  development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment.   This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American  people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the  Constitution's Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources  that will:   ``establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty.''   The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump  Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are  irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects,  insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on  the lives of real people living in the real world.   They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the  public.   To win such support, I believe that it is essential that any  subsequent continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill  achieves the following goals and objectives:   ``To establish justice'' and ``To promote the general welfare'':   1. Full funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights  Division and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that  they have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting  rights, and prosecuting hate crimes.   2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income  housing programs in urban and rural communities.   3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and  low-income persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in  Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their  legal rights in courts of law.   4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound  seniors, such as Meals on Wheels.   5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderate- income families access to affordable higher education and provides  students with special needs the support needed to receive the free  appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive  environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA Act).   6. Fully funds before and after school programs and other student  enrichment programs that help students succeed.   7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through  energy efficient heating and cooling systems.   8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income  communities.   9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of  Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and  transportation technologies.   ``Provide for the common defense'':   1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to  advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the  security interests of the United States.   2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions  throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in  developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia,  Yemen, and Nigeria.   ``To ensure domestic tranquility'':   1. Fully funds cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to  compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums  for low-income customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.   2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70  million Americans.   3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so  that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed.   4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention into block grants which would hinder the nation's ability to  respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola,  Zika, and HIV/AIDS.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that if all members of the House and Senate  work together, we can reach agreement on an appropriate budget  framework that invests in the American people, preserves our national  security, and keeps faith with the values that have served our nation  well and made the United States the leading nation on earth.
