 Mr. Speaker, all gave some, and some made the ultimate  sacrifice. This Saturday is Veterans Day, a day we pause to honor the  brave men and women from our communities who have served our country.  Veterans represent the best in America. Veterans embody loyalty and  honor by always putting their fellow soldiers and country before  themselves.   Veterans prove this determination in getting the mission done. This  country has made a promise to every person who puts on that uniform.  You stand for us, and we will stand for you. Their mission was  protecting us. Our mission in Congress is to protect them.   To all of our vets, thank you for your service. Thank you for serving  our country.                            ____________________
