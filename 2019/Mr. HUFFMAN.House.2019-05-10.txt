 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for her work on this disaster  supplemental, as well as her broader efforts to advance this disaster  funding. It is unfortunate that our colleagues in the Senate have not  yet acted to deliver disaster relief to communities across the country.   My amendment responds to the needs of communities who are rebuilding  their highway infrastructure after disasters.   I am joined in these efforts by my colleagues, Harley Rouda and Norma  Torres from California. I thank them for their support. And I would  also like to thank the California State Association of Counties for  their important work on this issue in support of this amendment.   We need to send a clear message to the Federal Highway  Administration.   Congress expects FHWA to work with communities who are simply seeking  reasonable extensions for the use of their emergency relief funding.   Under current policy, the FHWA requires that when a road or highway  suffers serious damage, the State or local agency receiving Federal  assistance must begin the construction project within 2 years of the  disaster.   And we all agree that Federal money should get out the door as  quickly as possible.   But this well-intended policy allows for extensions, if there are  reasonable difficulties in moving toward construction.   Sometimes it just takes longer than expected to scope a project, to  finalize all the permits. In other cases, the scale of the disaster  itself means that counties simply don't have the capacity to move all  their projects to construction within 2 years, even though they are  moving as quickly as they can and doing everything right.   The problem is, in a recent decision, FHWA began denying a series of  extension requests, including one in Humboldt County, in my district.   My amendment would pause FHWA's ability to deny these extensions  moving forward. And I hope this amendment gives FHWA the opportunity to  correct course and to get back to working with communities who are  trying to rebuild as quickly as they can.   Communities across the country, especially those in California  recovering from flood and fire, are now facing the possibility of  paying back millions of dollars that they desperately need, adding  insult to injury.   How widespread is this problem?   Well, State-wide in California, FHWA denied 66 out of 73 projects  requesting an extension. So we need some help, and we need this  amendment.                                time  1030    We need this amendment. This amendment will not address all of the  problems caused by FHWA's extension denials, but it gives them an  opportunity to reconsider their decisions and make things right.   As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I am  committed to working with my colleagues to establish clear guidelines  on how the FHWA should manage emergency relief funds going forward; but  for now, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina  for his comments.   Madam Chair, the purpose of this supplemental appropriations bill is  to help communities rebuild from disasters, and my amendment simply  ensures that we give communities reasonable time to rebuild and  recover.   We shouldn't be yanking the rug out from under them before they have  gotten themselves back on their feet. For that reason, I urge adoption  of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
