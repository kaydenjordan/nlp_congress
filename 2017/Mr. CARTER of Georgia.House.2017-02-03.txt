 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Mrs. Emily  Hart, who passed away on Monday, January, 23, 2017. She was 82 years of  age.   Mrs. Hart was born in 1934 to her parents, Emily and Edwin Tribble,  in Washington, D.C., where her father worked as an editor of the old  Washington Star newspaper for nearly 40 years. She spent her early  education in Washington, D.C., before she moved on to Vassar College in  New York City, where she studied political science.   No matter where she was, Mrs. Hart dedicated her time and energy to  bettering the community. In Washington, she was a proud member of the  National Cathedral Foundation and the National Preservation Historical  Society. In St. Simons, she joined the Coastal Georgia Historical  Society; was a devout member of the Christ Church Frederica; and worked  with the St. Simons Land Trust, which works to preserve the island's  natural beauty and improve the quality of life in the community.   Although she was always aiding the community, her greatest joy came  from her family, which included her husband--retired U.S. Marine  Colonel Nick Hart--her three children, and her seven grandchildren.   Her sharp wit, passion for learning, and detailed stories of the past  are what will be remembered most dearly. I express my condolences to  Mrs. Hart's family for their loss. She will be missed.                            ____________________
