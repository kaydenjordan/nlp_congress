 Mr. Speaker, this week, we will see on the floor the  Championing Healthy Kids Act. It will include a number of different  reforms, which will include the Children's Health Insurance Program,  the CHAMPION Act, and my bill, the CARE Act.   We must increase access throughout our communities across the  country. By expanding our residency program, we will see new doctors,  especially in these underserved areas. Expanding our residency program  will allow our medical schools to have people in our communities  practicing medicine, and, ultimately, filling this doctor shortage that  we have today.   I look forward to the passing of the Championing Healthy Kids Act,  which will, again, help our children with their health insurance  coverage and expand our residency program at a much-needed time.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act. When we fail to actively manage our  forests and Federal lands, we put ourselves and our neighbors at risk.  It is time to better manage our fire-prone forests and fix how we pay  for wildfire suppression.   California just experienced the deadliest wildfire in our history,  and 2017 is on track to be the worst fire season on record. We can't  wait until next season. We have got to put the right policies in place  now.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act gives us the tools to immediately  reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires. It allows us to expedite  the removal of dead trees and rapidly mitigate disease-infested areas.  It enables us to responsibly manage our forests and improve ecosystems,  and it permanently solves the fire borrowing problem. No longer will we  deplete forest restoration and management accounts to pay for wildfire  suppression. This will give our firefighters the resources they need  without hindering prevention efforts.   As California recovers from this year's fires, this bill will help us  mitigate future wildfires. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and  help improve the health and resiliency of our Federal forests.  [[Page H8328]]    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Association  of California Water Agencies in support of H.R. 2936.                                                      Association of                                       California Water Agencies,                                                   October 31, 2017.     ACWA Support for H.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017         The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA)       respectfully requests your support for H.R. 2936, The       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. ACWA's 430 public       water agency members supply over 90 percent of the water       delivered in California for residential, agricultural, and       industrial uses.        Recent severe drought and one of the most destructive       wildfire seasons on record have focused renewed attention on       the health of California's headwaters. That attention is well       placed because the forests, meadows and source waters that       play a critical role in our water supply and water management       system are threatened by factors ranging from climate change       to incomplete management to a lack of planning and       coordination.        H.R. 2936 addresses many of these factors. It incentivizes       and rewards collaboration with local governments and       stakeholders by expediting environmental review for       collaborative projects up to 30,000 acres in size. It also       includes important provisions that will increase the yield       and protect the quality of our headwaters.        Additionally, H.R. 2936 solves the perennial ``fire       borrowing'' problem, in which federal land management       agencies must raid non-fire suppression accounts in order to       pay for suppression activities. H.R. 2936 ends this practice       by allowing FEMA to transfer funds to the Forest Service/BLM       when all fire suppression accounts have been exhausted.        As stated in ACWA's headwaters framework, ACWA believes       with more effective management ``healthy headwaters'' could       provide multiple benefits to California's water management       system and the environment. These benefits include: Increased       Water Supply Reliability; Improved Water Quality; Reduced       Impacts from Catastrophic Wildfires; Increased Renewable       Energy Supplies; Improved Response to Climate Change; and       Enhanced Habitat.        ACWA encourages you to vote for H.R. 2936.        If you have any questions please contact David Reynold.
