 Mr. President, Americans are currently dealing with the  worst inflation in more than 30 years--high grocery prices, high rent  prices, high gas prices, high car prices, increases in the price of  household goods, and the list goes on. Inflation is so bad that it has  outstripped wage growth,  [[Page S9005]]  resulting in a de facto pay cut for many Americans.   One of the price hikes hitting Americans hard is the increase in the  price of gas. Gas prices have risen 40 percent since President Biden  took office--40 percent. That takes a tremendous toll on family  budgets. And, of course, high gas prices and other energy costs  contribute to price increases on a whole host of other goods.  Manufacturers facing higher transportation costs thanks to high gas  prices, for example, are likely to pass on at least some of those  increased costs to consumers in the form of price hikes.   In my home State of South Dakota, families are facing an increase in  home heating costs as high as 50 to 100 percent, depending on how  severe of a winter we face.   Nationwide, concerns over high heating costs this winter have been  tempered by mild weather so far, but predictions of huge energy bills  could return with a period of sustained harsh weather. And that would  be another financial blow for families whose budgets are already  severely stretched by our current inflation crisis.   It is easy for, say, a wealthy Democrat politician to dismiss the  consequences of inflation, but for families living paycheck to  paycheck, an increase in the grocery bill or heating costs or the cost  of a tank of gas could mean tough decisions, like choosing between  adequately heating the house or filling the car to get to a job.   So what has President Biden been doing to help alleviate rising  energy prices and inflation? Well, the answer is not much. First, he  pleaded with the OPEC cartel to increase oil production and increase  global supply, which is the single most influential factor when it  comes to gas prices. OPEC was unmoved.   Then the President recently announced the release of 50 million  barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Oil Reserve, a move that  Congress had, in part, already mandated.   Unfortunately, this is nothing more than a short-term relief measure,  if that, as it will do little to give our energy sector the certainty  it is seeking to bring production and American energy jobs back online.   While Democrats helped create the inflation crisis that we are  experiencing by flooding the economy with unnecessary government money  earlier this year, the President is not solely to blame for high energy  prices, which have also been driven up by COVID-related issues.  However, the President is certainly to blame for the hostile attitude  his administration has displayed toward conventional energy production.  And he is certainly to blame for the reckless tax-and-spending spree he  is pushing, which would further drive up energy prices for American  families.   The President made clear that his attitude toward conventional energy  production on day 1 of his administration, when he canceled the  Keystone XL Pipeline, an environmentally responsible pipeline project  that was already underway and that would have delivered more than  10,000 construction jobs and helped decrease energy costs by increasing  regional energy supply, all while being offset with a $1.7 billion  investment in renewable energy.   The President also almost immediately banned new oil and gas leases  on Federal lands, sending a clear signal to oil and gas producers that  his administration would be reluctant to work with them to increase  American energy production.   Then, of course, there was the release of the first outlines of the  President's reckless tax-and-spending plan, which displayed a clear  hostility to conventional energy.   Given this record, it is no surprise that many energy producers have  been less than enthusiastic about coming fully back online as we emerge  from the pandemic. The market signals to increase production are being  muted by this administration's burdensome policies and clear intent of  sidelining American energy development.   Then there is the current version of the reckless tax-and-spending  spree, which Democrats are pushing to pass in the very near future.  This legislation will not only likely worsen our current inflation  situation, it will also make our energy less reliable and more  expensive.   If Democrats succeed in passing their legislation, American families  will have to brace themselves for even higher energy bills. One major  driver of those higher energy bills will be the bill's new fee--or  tax--on methane, which is targeted at crippling the natural gas sector  that spurred America's recent energy renaissance and has actually been  the largest driver of coal displacement.   The American Gas Association says the proposed fee could add as much  as 34 percent to natural gas bills. And that is on top of any increases  Americans may already be facing.   As I mentioned earlier, home heating bills are already projected to  rise as much as 50 to 100 percent in my State this winter--and that is  without the reckless tax-and-spending spree piling on.   And if progressive Democrats have their way, Democrats' tax-and- spending spree could also penalize our oil and gas sector by ending  longstanding tax provisions like the percentage depletion deduction,  which underpins an overwhelming number of independent producers  representing roughly 90 percent of wells drilled in the United States.   Simply put, this administration wants to make it more expensive and  more difficult to develop our abundant energy resources in favor of  their preferred energy technologies and electric vehicles, with  predictable consequences for Americans' pocketbooks.   And just a word about those electric vehicles. The President's  Transportation Secretary recently suggested that families feeling the  pinch of high gas prices could solve their problem by buying an  electric vehicle, which would allow them to ``never have to worry about  gas prices again.''   Well, I have news for the President's Transportation Secretary. A lot  of Americans can't afford to replace their car with an electric  vehicle, not to mention that electric cars and trucks are still not a  practical option for many Americans for other reasons. Secretary  Buttigieg's statement shows just how far out of touch Democrats have  become with ordinary Americans.   I know Democrats are deeply invested in their Green New Deal  fantasies of an instant, mostly electric energy regime. But the reality  is that American consumers will need to use liquid fuels and  electricity and heat for natural gas well into the future. And  punishing or discouraging responsible energy development in oil and  natural gas will do nothing--nothing--but drive up energy prices for  consumers and force our Nation to rely more on oil and gas imports from  unstable areas of the world.   We should be encouraging American energy development of every kind-- from oil and natural gas to wind, solar, and biofuels--not artificially  picking winners and losers and discouraging essential energy  production.   And with American consumers struggling with long-term inflation, the  last thing we need to be doing right now is passing legislation that  will drive up energy prices. Unfortunately, if Democrats have their way  and succeed in passing their tax-and-spending legislation, Americans  will soon be able to add even higher energy bills to the list of  challenges that they are currently facing.   So much for building back better for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, while I am on the topic of energy, I would  like to briefly comment on yesterday's announcements from the EPA and  USDA concerning biofuels. To put it simply, the administration can't  have it both ways on the renewable fuel standard, something agriculture  stakeholders in South Dakota know all too well.   Yesterday, the EPA announced a proposal to take the unprecedented  step of clawing back previously set biofuel blending targets; 2020  volumes would be reduced by 2\1/2\ billion gallons, and 2021 would see  a reduction.   Now, the EPA is trying to sell this by simultaneously proposing an  increase in the 2022 blending volumes, which on its own would be  favorable, but it is far from enough to make up for the lost gallons.   And keep in mind that the EPA's proposal pulls back blending  obligations from a final rule, giving stakeholders little confidence  that this promised 2022 increase won't meet the  [[Page S9006]]  same fate. Again, not every component of yesterday's announcement is  bad on its own.   Signaling an end to the out-of-control small refinery exemption  program is long overdue, and it is consistent with the renewable fuel  standard and a Tenth Circuit Court ruling. It is also good to see the  Department of Agriculture moving forward with assistance funds for  biofuel producers, but this was funding signed into law last December.  It is almost as if it was withheld from our producers for months so  that USDA could help the EPA sell our ag stakeholders a bill of goods.   I urge the administration to make good on its commitments to our  farmers and to finally leverage American biofuels for the energy and  environmental solutions they can provide.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3335         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
