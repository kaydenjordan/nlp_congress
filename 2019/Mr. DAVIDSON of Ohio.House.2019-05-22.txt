 Madam Speaker, today, I honor the life of a  great man. Born in Piqua, Ohio, Father Angelo Caserta was the oldest  active priest in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. He peacefully passed  away last week.   Those who knew Father Caserta recall his talent and love for people,  his comforting words, and his love for our community.   When asked about the secret to his longevity, Father Caserta said:  ``My secret is the good Lord. The Lord gets all the credit. I'm the  only classmate surviving in my class. Not many average that milestone.  . . . It's a celebration of God's goodness, how He could choose someone  like me and take care of me for 70 years while doing his work in the  priesthood.''   On Tuesday, Father Caserta's life was celebrated in Piqua, as he was  laid to rest by family and friends.   While I did not know him personally, I knew of his deeds by those who  did and the love he had for our community.   Madam Speaker, I use my time on the floor today to honor Father  Caserta's life of service, to celebrate his faith, and to extend my  condolences to those who knew him.                            ____________________
