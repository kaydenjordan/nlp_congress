 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Betty Walker of  Chiefland, Florida, who passed away on Monday, February 25.   Mayor Walker served the citizens of Chiefland as an elected city  commissioner for over 15 years and as mayor and vice mayor for 11 of  those years.   Betty Walker was the first African American female elected official  for the city of Chiefland. She was a great leader. She loved her  community immensely. She advocated for the police and fire departments  and the maintenance departments as well.   Mayor Walker had recently retired after spending almost 40 years  helping adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.   She truly loved the people of Chiefland. She was passionate about  parks and recreation and always had a vision for her city.   Mayor Walker leaves behind a rich legacy that not many can match.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring a life well lived and a  community leader who will be missed by many, Mayor Betty Walker of  Chiefland.                            ____________________
