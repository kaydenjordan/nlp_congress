 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate an important milestone in  the fight to protect patients from unfair and expensive surprise  medical bills.   For too many middle-class families, receiving an unexpected and very  expensive bill from an out-of-network provider is devastating and can  lead to severe anxiety, depression, and financial ruin.   That is why, yesterday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee  passed H.R. 3630, the No Surprises Act, a bill that will protect  millions of hardworking Americans from receiving a surprise medical  bill through no fault of their own.   I am fighting to end surprise medical bills once and for all. The No  Surprises Act includes my bipartisan amendment to create an independent  arbitration process that keeps patients out of the middle and off the  hook for surprise medical bills.   As an emergency medicine physician, my life's work has been about  putting patients first, and I am still fighting to put their health  above all else.   I thank Chairman Pallone for leading an open, inclusive, and  collaborative process that has brought us one step closer to a  bipartisan solution that protects patients and ends surprise medical  bills.                            ____________________
