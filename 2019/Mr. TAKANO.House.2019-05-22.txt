 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1500, a  bill that will ensure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has the  necessary tools to defend American consumers.   The CFPB was created in the wake of the financial crisis as consumers  fell victim to unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.   My Republican colleagues have tried to undermine it for nearly a  decade since its arrival. The Trump administration has worked to  kneecap the CFPB, using a strategy that prioritizes big businesses over  individual consumers. As can be seen, enforcement has decreased by 75  percent at the CFPB.   H.R. 1500 will fortify the CFPB's core mission to protect consumers  and remedy the Trump administration's harmful anticonsumer tactics.   My home district lies in California's Inland Empire, and the  constituents I serve understand the importance of CFPB's mission all  too well. At the height of the housing crisis, one in five local  households were behind on their mortgages. In 2008 alone, over 30,000  families from Riverside County lost their homes to foreclosure.   This was, however, by Wall Street's design. In no other area of the  country did subprime loans aggressively pushed by lenders claim a  bigger proportion of the overall mortgage market. This bill ensures the  CFPB is equipped and empowered to fight this type of predatory lending  and much more.   Simply put, the Consumers First Act ensures that CFPB maintains the  authority and resources to do its job and proactively protect consumers  from unfair, misleading, and abusive practices.   Let's pass this bill to make crystal clear that the CFPB truly does  have the back of every single American consumer. I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1500.
