 Madam Speaker, several weeks ago, we witnessed a very  unfortunate milestone, the 80th anniversary of the signature of an  executive order by the President of the United States to incarcerate  over 100,000 Japanese Americans during World War II.   This was a direct violation of the founding principles of our country  that say that no one should be deprived of their liberty without just  cause.   That is why I was so proud to see this body pass my bill, H.R. 6434,  this week that would create a historic network of sites linked to the  incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.   Madam Speaker, the power of history is to gain perspective and learn  from the mistakes of the past. I am in hopes that this network will  call attention to this unjust imprisonment and ensure that this  injustice never occurs in the United States again.                            ____________________
