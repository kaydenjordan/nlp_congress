 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my speaking  time be taken from leader time, not the debate time.    Mr. President, as the Senate continues the debate on the  Republican healthcare bill, it seems the Republican majority is no  clearer on what the endgame is because there is no good way out of  this.   Last night, the Senate Republican TrumpCare bill--after months of  backroom negotiating and provisions aimed at all kinds of individual  States and Members--died, with nine Republicans voting against the  measure and many others who voted for it gritting their teeth  unhappily.   Later today, we will vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act  without replacing it. I know that you, Mr. President, have championed  that bill. Based on public comments and public criticism from the other  side of the aisle, repeal without replace will fail as well. It is  becoming clearer that in the end, the majority leader might push a much  scaled-back version of repeal in the hopes of passing something--a so- called skinny repeal--just to get to conference. My colleagues, make no  mistake about it, skinny repeal is equal to full repeal. It is a Trojan  horse, designed to get the House and Senate into conference where a  hard-right flank of the House Republicans, the Freedom Caucus, will  demand full repeal or something very close to it. They will demand all  the things--deep cuts to Medicaid, generous tax breaks for the wealthy,  elimination of preexisting conditions, slashing the kinds of things  people need for nursing homes and opioid treatment and disabled kids-- that many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate have very sincerely  tried to undo.   There is no such thing as skinny repeal. It is a ruse to get to full  repeal, with all the concomitant cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks which  are so unpopular and which so many of my Republican colleagues here on  the other side have opposed. It is clear House and Senate Republicans  are miles apart. They are divided on major issues--on Medicaid, tax  breaks, and preexisting conditions. The differences between House  Republicans and Senate Republicans are virtually irreconcilable. So  what is the point of a conference?   You can imagine a conference that turns into an endless game of hot  potato; the Republican leader and the Senate passing the potato to the  House; the Republican leader of the House passing the potato back to  the Senate because neither wants to be responsible for what is  inevitable: the demise of TrumpCare. Of course, it is likely a  conference could probably produce no agreement at all, keeping the  incredibly toxic and unpopular TrumpCare bill the topic of conversation  for another 3 months, stalling the legislative agenda for another 3  months, and in the end getting nothing done.   My Republican colleagues should consider that. Many of them want to  work with us on so many issues. Above all, NDAA, which my dear friend  John McCain, who we pray for every day, wants to get to right away, and  the Energy bill, which my colleague from Washington and her chair, the  senior Member from Alaska, could bring to the floor and get moving in a  bipartisan way. Leader McConnell has made it clear he wants to move  nominations.   If we stop playing this game with TrumpCare and send it back to  committee and do regular order, as John McCain preached so well  yesterday, we could move on to all these other things in a good, strong  bipartisan way and start to get things done. My Republican colleagues  should consider that carefully.   We Democrats want to start working with our Republican colleagues on  the issues I mentioned. We also want to work on improving ACA. No one  has ever said ObamaCare was perfect. I have called five or six of my  Republican colleagues on the other side and said if we stop this effort  with TrumpCare--with repeal or repeal and replace with something far  worse than the present--we can go back to committee and improve the  present healthcare system and get premiums lower, make healthcare  better, and stabilize the system so there is more competition. We will  do that.   My good friend the Senator from Wyoming, not the Senator sitting here  but his colleague--I heard he was saying to some Members: Oh, the  Democrats will never negotiate. Schumer will never negotiate. I saw him  last night on the floor, and I assured him we will. That is our goal.  He accepted that in good faith, which I very much respect.   So the bottom line is simple. I say to my Republican colleagues, when  you find yourself in a hole, the first rule is stop digging. By  continuing this process--trying to send something, anything, to  conference with the House--Republicans are just digging a deeper and  deeper hole for themselves and for this body. I implore my Republican  colleagues to stop digging and come work with Democrats. We can work to  improve our Nation's healthcare system, but Republicans have to turn  back soon, and they are running out of chances.   One more thing I would add. I heard my friend the Republican leader  say we are going to have a full amendment process. He is trying to  convince the folks on the other side that, oh, we will do a bunch of  amendments, and then we will have no choice, we will have to send  something to conference because we couldn't get anything major done.  That is a lot of bunk. We have had no hearings, we had no amendments,  we had no bipartisan discussions, and we will not even be able to have  debate on many amendments on one of the most major bills affecting us,  that affects tens of millions of people's health, and affects one-sixth  of the economy. Don't fall for this, oh, we are having a full process.  I like my friend the Republican leader. We get along well, but  sometimes he says things that when I hear them, I get a little twinge  in the stomach. We have a full and open amendment process, he said  three or four times. Everyone in this Chamber knows that is not the  case. Don't be deluded into thinking, well, we tried. We haven't tried  until we go back to regular order.            Comments of the President on Attorney General Sessions    Mr. President, on another matter, President Trump continues to find  new ways to humiliate his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, a man  who stuck his neck out for the President before any other Senator  would. I heard President Trump say: I was already popular. As I  remember it, when Jeff Sessions supported him, he was an underdog, and  everyone said: Wow, Jeff Sessions is doing that out of loyalty and  friendship with Donald Trump, not because he was jumping on a train  that was headed down the track. Maybe he saw that, but no one else did,  and now the President humiliates him.   I would say to my fellow Americans--Democratic, Republican, liberal,  conservative--every American should be troubled by the character of  this person who humiliates and turns his back on a close friend after  only 6 months. We are already far beyond the dangers of a chilling  effect at the Department of Justice. The President is taking almost  every opportunity in public to demonstrate an open hostility toward the  Attorney General. It seems clear the President's intention is to make  life unbearable for the Attorney General, hoping to prompt his  resignation. All Americans should be wondering why the President is  publicly demeaning and humiliating such a close friend and supporter--a  member of his own Cabinet. They should wonder if the President is  trying to pry open the office of Attorney General to appoint someone  during the August recess who will fire Special Counsel Mueller and shut  down the Republican investigation. Let me say, if such a situation  arises, Democrats will use every tool in our toolbox to stymie such a  recess appointment.   Second, I can't imagine my friends on the Republican side,  particularly my friends in the Republican leadership, the majority  leader and Speaker Ryan--I can't imagine they would be complicit in  creating a constitutional crisis. They must work with us and not  [[Page S4229]]  open the door to a constitutional crisis during the August recess.                                Sanctions Bill    Mr. President, one final point because I know my colleagues are  waiting: sanctions--finally, a word on them. Yesterday, the House of  Representatives passed nearly unanimously, 419 to 3, a sanctions bill  that was a product of bicameral, bipartisan negotiations and includes  strong sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The Senate must  act quickly on the legislation from the House.   I understand that earlier today the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee indicated he plans to strip out a section of this package  that relates to North Korea. This is yet another delay generated by  Republicans to prevent this bill from landing on the President's desk  before we leave for the recess. Even as we debate other items here on  the floor, we shouldn't delay this legislation any longer.   I will work with the majority leader to schedule another vote on the  sanctions bill so that we can send the legislation to the President's  desk before the recess, and I expect the vote will constitute a veto- proof majority, just like the vote in the House.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise this evening to announce the  Democrats will offer no further amendments to the pending legislation  until the Republican leader shows us what the final legislation will  be.   Clearly, the Senate bill--repeal and replace--has failed. Senator  Paul's bill--repeal without replace--has also failed. We know the  Republicans are not going to take a final vote on the underlying House  bill, which is still the pending legislation.   Now the Republican leadership team has been telling the press about a  yet-to-be-disclosed final bill. If the reports are true, the  Republicans will offer a skinny repeal plan.   We just heard from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that  under such a plan as reported in the press, 16 million Americans would  lose their health insurance and millions more would pay a 20-percent-- 20-percent--increase in their premiums--at least 20 percent.   I thank Senator Murray and Senator Wyden for working with CBO so that  we could figure out what exactly is going on, if this skinny bill is  the bill that is brought to the floor.   My Republican friends come to the floor every day to assail the  problem of high premiums. If the reporting is accurate and skinny  repeal is their plan, it makes premiums far higher than they are today.  We don't know if skinny repeal is going to be their final bill, but if  it is, the CBO says that it would cause costs to go up and millions to  lose insurance.   In the meantime, Democrats are not going to continue to try and amend  the House plan that is already dead. Certainly, we are not going to do  that while there is some secret legislation--skinny repeal it is  reported--waiting to emerge from the leader's office.   The Republican leader has said that this is a robust amendment  process. No, it isn't--far from it. We don't even know what bill to  direct our amendments to. Certainly, a process that bypassed the  committees and public hearings was never an open and transparent  process. There was never a robust amendment process to this bill, but  now it has gotten even worse. Since the beginning of this debate, we  have just been taking votes on amendments to a piece of dead  legislation.   What kind of process is this? Anyone who listened, as we all did, so  intently to Senator McCain's wonderful speech yesterday and applauded  the sentiment that he mentioned--getting back to regular order and  proper procedure--anyone who listened to that speech would blush at  this sham of an amendment process thus far. We don't even have a final  bill to amend. The idea that this is a robust amendment process, I  would say to my dear friend the leader, defies credulity. No one  believes it. I bet not a single person on either side of the aisle  believes it. So Democrats are not going to participate in this one- sided and broken process.    Once the majority leader shows his hand, reveals what his bill will  actually be, Democrats will use the opportunity to try to amend the  bill. But we have to see it first, and we ought to see it soon in broad  daylight, not at the eleventh hour.   Until we see the real bill, Democrats will offer no further  amendments.   Thank you, and I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bruce King,  Charlie Ellsworth, Veronica Duron, and Matthew Fuentes of my staff be  given all-access passes to the floor during the consideration of H.R.  1628.
