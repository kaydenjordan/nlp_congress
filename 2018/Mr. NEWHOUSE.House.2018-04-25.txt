 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Woodall, my  good friend from the Rules Committee, for yielding me such time.   Mr. Speaker, I also welcome Mrs. Torres to her first management of a  rule on the floor. It is a pleasure to have her as part of the Rules  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, including the underlying  legislation, H.R. 3144, of which I am a proud original cosponsor.   H.R. 3144, Mr. Speaker, is a vital piece of legislation for my  constituents as well as for the greater Pacific Northwest region.   The legislation keeps in place a groundbreaking, comprehensive plan  which governs the operations and salmon protection management plan for  the Federal Columbia River Power System.   This plan was the product of painstaking negotiations conducted by  the Bush and the Obama administrations, scientists, engineering experts  at Federal agencies, affected States, sovereign Northwest Tribes, and  local stakeholders. In fact, every Tribe in the region was consulted in  the development of the 2014 biological opinion, and all but one  supported it.   H.R. 3144 ensures that Tribal consultations provided for under the  BiOp continue unaffected.   These experts collaborated to develop this comprehensive plan to both  protect Endangered Species Act-listed salmon and to provide certainty  for our region's ability to continue providing clean, renewable, and  affordable power derived from hydroelectric dams.   Now, unfortunately, a Federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has decided  to throw out this comprehensive plan and negate years of serious  concerted efforts by a diverse set of Federal, State, and local  stakeholders. He has anointed himself the sole expert of this river  system and has begun dictating scientific and engineering decisions.   As my friend Jack Heffling says: ``One judge in Portland does not  know how to manage this river system better than the experts and  professional workforce who keep the lights on for the entire Pacific  Northwest.''   Jack is president of the United Power Trades Organization, a labor  union representing more than 600 men and women who maintain and operate  the equipment at hydroelectric projects throughout the Pacific  Northwest.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with Jack today and all of the men and women of  the power trades. I believe the experts, scientists and biologists,  engineers, and professional workers at Federal agencies and on the  ground working at our dams should be deciding how to best manage this  system, not a judge sitting behind a bench.   Unfortunately, this judge thinks otherwise and now has mandated an  ongoing forced spill order over eight of our dams in the region. This  order could have devastating impacts on transportation and barging  systems, on our flood control capabilities, and irrigation systems; it  could impair our agricultural economy, both by limiting modes of  transportation for our commodities and by hobbling our irrigation  resources.   While there are no cost estimates of the effects this decision will  have on transportation and barging, flood control, or irrigation,  Federal agencies have estimated that the forced spill will cost  ratepayers, utility ratepayers, $40 million per year in increased  electrical rates starting in the very near future.   The judge's order could also harm the very fish he is claiming to  protect. The Bonneville Power Administration, or the BPA, notes that  the risks of exposing fish to the maximum total dissolved gas levels  have not been evaluated, nor has it been recommended by the National  Marine Fisheries Service or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.   They warn that the potential for adverse effects from exposure to  these gases in the river is a concern recognized by experts in the  region and also creates risk of adverse consequences for other aquatic  species.   The judge's decision to recklessly dictate a water management plan  could, in fact, harm or even kill these ESA-listed salmon.   This order also threatens the reliability of the Federal power and  transmission system. BPA has also warned of blackouts, stating:         When the Lower Columbia and Lower Snake generators are       operating at minimum generation levels, however . . . there       is far less generation available for use. . . . Under the       right conditions, local blackouts may occur if there is       inadequate transfer capability in the transmission system to       move the necessary electric power to loads.    I am already hearing from our local cooperatives and public utility  districts that this threat is not far off. Our communities could be  facing the risk of rolling blackouts in the coming months due to this  order.   Mr. Speaker, it is because of this reckless antiscience order that  constituents and stakeholders from a great variety of backgrounds and  viewpoints have joined with me and my colleagues from the Pacific  Northwest over these past several months to stand against this decision  and support a rational, science-based resolution.   I have been overwhelmed and invigorated by these supporters, whether  it is the barge captains on our rivers, who move commodities like wheat  for export; or small-business owners, who depend on our affordable  electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest; it is the union workers  at our hydropower dams and the irrigators, who provide the incredibly  vital resource of water for our region; it is the local cooperative  managers and public utility district leaders across Washington State  and throughout the Northwest who have rallied to bring this legislation  to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives today, and I could  not be more proud to stand with all of them in support of H.R. 3144.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, not every aspect of this matter has been  as inspiring. I have been disappointed to see radical and ideological  groups use hyperbolic language to insinuate that my colleagues and I  are actively advocating for the extinction of our native salmon  species.    Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the  truth, and, frankly, I have been appalled that some of my colleagues in  this very body have decided to use these same scare tactics to  fearmonger other Members of this House.   They claim we advocate for an illegal or an unlawful plan that does  not do enough to help fish, yet they fail to mention that it was  President Obama's administration who formally approved of this plan  after years of work with scientists, with experts, with affected  States, and, like I said, with sovereign Northwest Indian Tribes.   Mr. Speaker, I take offense to these fringe voices and proudly stand  with the reasoned, serious contributors who have been a part of these  collaborative and unprecedented negotiations.   I challenge these detractors, let this plan actually come to  fruition, let us actually have a plan that has the intent of continuing  our salmon restoration efforts, rather than constantly bogging down our  Federal action agencies and experts running the system in decades of  litigation after litigation.  [[Page H3518]]    Honor the work of these diverse stakeholders who, in a good faith  effort, worked to build a plan to both save our salmon and save our  dams.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, support the rule and support H.R.  3144. Join me to save our salmon and save our dams.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Natural  Resources Committee for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon, I had the opportunity during  debate on the rule to rise and speak about this bill, as well as the  great coalition of constituents and stakeholders who have collaborated  to support H.R. 3144.   Some of the strongest voices are that of our local public utility  districts and rural electric cooperatives across the Pacific Northwest,  who have been immensely helpful in their advocacy and engagement of  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a stack of letters and  resolutions of support from these groups in Oregon, Idaho, and also my  home State of Washington. I would like to express my sincere gratitude  for their support as well.                                    Blachly-Lane Electric Co-op,                                          Eugene, OR, March 1, 2018.      Re Support H.R. 3144 to Protect the Northwest's Economy,           Environment, and ESA-Listed Salmon.         Dear Members of the Northwest Congressional Delegation:       Blachly-Lane Electric Cooperative joins Northwest       RiverPartners and our fellow northwest electric cooperatives       in thanking you for your bipartisan opposition to misguided       components of the President's FY19 budget proposal related to       the Bonneville Power Administration's transmission assets and       rates. We value that the delegation recognizes BPA's       transmission and power generation assets as a pillar of the       Northwest economy and critical to our region's carbon-free       electric energy production, and your united concern for       constituents in the region.  [[Page H3550]]         Your bipartisan commitment to protecting BPA's statutory       mission and the longevity of the Federal Columbia River Power       System allows us to ask you for support of H.R. 3144. The       bill will protect the region's access to renewable, carbon       free, and reliable federal hydropower while mitigating       hydropower impacts and protecting Endangered Species Act       listed salmon.        H.R. 3144 would allow the NEPA process to continue as the       Court has ordered, with a comprehensive and transparent       review of federal hydrosystem operations, while postponing       costly and potentially harmful experimental spill and hydro       operations in the interim.        BPA faces uncertainty as escalating fish and wildlife costs       and related litigation negatively impact its power rates.       Keeping BPA sound and competitive serves to shield the agency       from political attacks coming from outside the region. H.R.       3144 provides vital near-term certainty by temporarily       retaining the federal hydrosystem operations plan supported       by both the Bush and Obama Administrations that was       extensively vetted by independent scientists, only until an       ongoing NEPA review process concludes in 2021.        BPA estimates the Court-ordered spill experiment could cost       its power customers an estimated $40 million this year. NOAA       Fisheries' Science Center modeling shows this additional       spill would provide little or no added benefits to protected       juvenile salmon or returning adults. The costs of this       experiment to our electric cooperative members are far too       great, and the outcome to fish far too negative.        If that isn't enough, the spill operations will add 840,000       metric tons of carbon emissions by removing 815 megawatts of       carbon-free federal hydrosystem generation and replacing it       with fossil fuels. This large loss of hydroelectric       generation simply can't be replaced by increasing efficiency,       intermittent wind or solar resources. The Court-ordered spill       undermines Oregon and Washington's progress toward our       carbon-reduction goals.        Your support of H.R. 3144 will keep scientifically       recognized ESA-listed salmon protection measures in place       while allowing a rational, deliberative NEPA process to       generate credible data for future potential dam operations       and salmon-management strategies. H.R. 3144, contrary to       critics' statements, will simply allow for a much-needed       ``time out'' from over 20 years of litigation and allow the       federal agencies to focus their limited resources on       conducting the best NEPA process possible to comply with the       court's order.        Also know that the region is not in agreement on the Court-      ordered 2018 spill operations. The federal Action Agencies       (BPA, Army Corps, and Bureau of Reclamation), RiverPartners,       Idaho, Montana, Confederated Tribes of the Colville, the       Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, and the Salish-Kootenai tribe, have       appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit. The Court-ordered       spill would abandon federal agencies' best science and       expertise in favor of dictating from the bench an operational       ``experiment'' for the complex and crucial federal       hydrosystem. That is not a proper role for any Court.        We urge members of the delegation to support this       commonsense bill with a continued bipartisin spirit. Your       leadership is imperative to keep BPA's hydropower generation       assets affordable and to improve the agency's competitiveness       as quickly as possible. Without a competitive product to       transmit over the wires, BPA will be challenged to meet its       important statutory obligations of providing power and       protecting fish and wildlife.        Passage of H.R. 3144 is critical to help avoid BPA's       current perilous trajectory and further harm to the       fisheries. Modest, practical action now will help BPA avoid       the economic cliff it faces. To wait and later bail out the       agency could impose enormous costs on regional ratepayers and       taxpayers.        Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration of one       of the most crucial issues facing the Northwest in years.            Sincerely,                                                        Joe Jarvis,      General Manager.                                   ____                                            Northern Lights, Inc.,                                           Sagle, ID, March 9, 2018.        Dear Senator Risch: Northern Lights, Inc. strongly supports       H.R. 3144, bipartisan legislation that protects the       Northwest's access to renewable, clean and reliable federal       hydropower while mitigating hydropower impacts and protecting       ESA listed salmon. We urge you to advance H.R. 3144 as part       of the Fiscal Year 2018 appropriations bill or any other       legislation considered this Congress.        BPA is in a precarious financial situation with a rate       trajectory that is unsustainable. If this unsettling trend       continues, BPA will not be competitive with alternative power       supply choices in the region when it seeks customer contract       renewal in 2028. While we greatly value the carbon free,       flexible hydropower resources that BPA provides, as an       electric cooperative, we have a responsibility to deliver       power to our members at an affordable rate whether that comes       from BPA or elsewhere.        Although BPA's power rates are influenced by a variety of       cost-drivers, one of the largest variables is fish and       wildlife program costs. Along these lines, we are       particularly concerned about ESA-driven litigation over       federal hydro system operations that has plagued our region       for almost 20 years. Most recently, as a result of legal       proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of       Oregon, a federal judge has ordered a spill experiment that       could cost BPA power customers an estimated $40 million just       this year. Yet federal modeling shows that this additional       spill would provide little or no added benefit to protected       juvenile salmon or returning adults. This is particularly       troubling to a consumer-owned power community that remains       committed to funding the largest mitigation for threatened       species in the nation.        As stewards of the Columbia River, it is our collective       responsibility to get off the sidelines and identify       practical solutions to tough problems. H.R. 3144 is just       that, it would provide much needed relief from the endless       litigation by temporarily keeping in place a 2014 biological       opinion built on the best available science from two       consecutive Administrations (Bush and Obama). We are pleased       that this biological opinion has resulted in improved salmon       survival at dams due to changes in operations and the       installation of new fish passage technologies. Retaining the       2014 biological opinion also allows the federal agencies to       focus on the court-ordered NEPA environmental review process       without being distracted by litigation.        Let's take a time out from the courtroom and rally around a       practical solution. On behalf of Northern Lights, Inc. we       urge you to support H.R. 3144.            Sincerely,                                              Annie Terracciano,                                                    General Manager,      Northern Lights, Inc.                                   ____                                                        Salmon River                                      Electric Cooperative, Inc.,                                       Challis, ID, August 25, 2015.        Dear Members of the Northwest Congressional Delegation:       This letter is submitted by Salmon River Electric       Cooperative, Inc. We are a small rural electric cooperative       located in central Idaho. We distribute electricity to 2700       electric accounts over eight hundred miles of distribution       lines. Our economy is made up of ranching and agriculture,       mining, recreation and tourism, and public land management.       Ninety-eight percent of the lands around us are public lands.       This leaves very little tax base to operate our local       economies. Low cost, clean, environmentally safe and carbon       free, and reliable electricity has been and will remain       critical to the lives of our member owners. We were pleased       to see the congressional delegation recently join together in       a bipartisan manner to oppose ill-advised components of the       President's FY19 budget proposal related to the Bonneville       Power Administration's (``BPA'') transmission assets and       rates. At a time defined by partisan rancor, it is refreshing       that our elected officials are able to unite to protect       constituents in the region and recognize that BPA's       transmission and power generation assets are the backbone of       the Northwest economy and the mainstay of our region's       carbon-free electric energy production.        This ongoing bipartisan commitment to protecting BPA's       statutory mission and the longevity of the Federal Columbia       River Power System (``FCRPS'') is why we are asking you to       support legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 3144) that       would protect the region's access to renewable, carbon free,       and reliable federal hydropower while mitigating hydropower       impacts and protecting Endangered Species Act (``ESA'')       listed salmon. This commonsense legislation temporarily keeps       in place a federal hydrosystem operations plan supported by       both the Bush and Obama Administrations. and was extensively       vetted by independent scientists, only until an ongoing NEPA       review process is concluded in 2021. H.R. 3144 would allow       the NEPA process to continue as the Court has ordered, with a       comprehensive and transparent review of federal hydrosystem       operations, while postponing costly and potentially harmful       experimental spill and hydro operations in the interim.            Sincerely,      Ken Dizes.                                   ____                                                       Benton PUD,                                                     March 13, 2018.      Re Support H.R. 3144.         Dear Members of the Washington State Congressional       Delegation: On behalf of Benton PUD customers, we urge you to       support H.R. 3144 that protects the hydro system and the       benefits it brings to the region through clean, renewable and       affordable power.        H.R. 3144 provides relief in the endless litigation of       federal hydro system operations by directing the federal       agencies to implement the current Biological Opinion that has       been vetted and supported by previous presidential       administration's top scientists and resulted in wild salmon       numbers trending significantly upward due to changes in       operations and the installation of new passage technologies.        Over the years of the operation of the Federal Columbia       River Power System (FCRPS), Northwest electric ratepayers       have invested over $16 billion on infrastructure and fish       enhancement efforts. We are appreciative of the countless       efforts that have already been made within the FCRPS       operations to improve juvenile fish passage survival.        H.R. 3144 allows the court ordered NEPA process to continue       with a comprehensive and transparent review of federal       hydrosystem operations, while postponing costly and       potentially harmful experimental spill operations in the       interim.  [[Page H3551]]         As Commissioners of public utilities located in the heart       of the Northwest, we strongly believe that we can achieve our       goal to balance the needs of healthy salmon and steelhead       populations with the imperative to preserve a valuable       hydropower system that is integral to our region's quality of       life. To do so, we must provide stability and certainty to       management of the FCRPS and fish recovery efforts.        The legislation is needed to protect the Snake River dams       and the renewable, carbon-free, affordable and reliable       hydropower provided to our customers and the customers across       the region.            Sincerely,      Commissioner Barry Bush.      Commissioner Lori Sanders.      Commissioner Jeff Hall.                                   ____                             Resolution No. 2413                              (July 25, 2017)       SUPPORTING H.R. 3144 FEDERAL LEGISLATION ADDRESSING THE FEDERAL               COLUMBIA RIVER POWER SYSTEM BIOLOGICAL OPINION         Whereas, Customers of Public Utility District No. 1 of       Benton County, Washington, hereinafter referred to as ``the       District'', receive 77 percent of their electricity from the       Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS); and        Whereas, Hydropower provides 70 percent of Washington       State's renewable, affordable and reliable electricity and 60       percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity with the       majority of the power produced by the FCRPS; and        Whereas, Hydroelectric dams also provide many benefits to       the region, including flood control, navigation, irrigation,       and recreation; and        Whereas, Federal legislation requires the federal agencies       responsible for the management of the FCRPS (Bonneville Power       Administration (BPA), Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of       Reclamation) to operate the hydro system in compliance with       the Biological Opinion (BiOp) approved by NOAA Fisheries in       2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014; and        Whereas, The FCRPS BiOp has successfully improved fish runs       including 97 percent of young salmon successfully making it       past the dams proving that both dams and fish can coexist;       and        Whereas, BPA has spent $15.28 billion in total spending on       infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978; and        Whereas, Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in       March 2017, the United States District Court for the District       of Oregon (Court) directed the federal agencies to undertake       a comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the       federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass       or breaching one or more of the four lower Snake River dams;       and        Whereas, H.R. 3144, ``To provide for operations of the       Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain       operation plan for a specified period of time'', was       introduced in the United States House of Representatives to       ensure the FCRPS BiOp remains in effect until 2022;        Whereas, The federal legislation would continue federal       hydro operations through September 30, 2022, or until the       court-ordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process       concludes, a new BiOp is in place, and judicial review is       complete; and        Whereas, The federal legislation would prohibit studies,       plans or structural modifications at the dams which would       impair hydroelectric power generation or navigation on the       Columbia River.        Now, therefore be it hereby resolved That the Commission of       Public Utility District No. 1 of Benton County, Washington,       (``District'') supports federal legislation H.R. 3144       introduced to ``provide for operations of the Federal       Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation       plan for a specified period of time'';        Be it further resolved that the District supports this       legislation as it:        1. Offers a creative solution that is good for both listed       salmon and the economy of the Northwest and Benton County.        2. Provides relief in the endless litigation of federal       hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to       implement the current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014       Supplemental BiOp. This BiOp was vetted and supported by the       previous presidential administrations' top scientists and has       resulted in wild salmon numbers trending significantly upward       due to changes in operations and the installation of new       passage technologies.        3. Provides time for the federal agencies to complete the       court-ordered NEPA environmental review process analyzing       federal hydro system operations and focuses the general       agencies limited resources on getting that process right.       Without the legislation, the agencies would be compelled to       author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of the new science       and public input provided by the comprehensive NEPA review.        4. Avoids experiments or spill tests at the eight Columbia       and Snake River dams, and studies and modifications at the       dams which would restrict electrical generation, which would       create uncertainties in BPA's power costs and supply and       raise Northwest electric customers' rates.        Adopted at an open meeting as required by law this 25th day       of July, 2017.                                   ____                                       United Electric co-op inc.,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2018.      Re H.R. 3144 To provide for operations of the Federal           Columbia Power System pursuant to a certain operation           plan for a specified period of time, and for other           purposes.         Dear Senator Risch: On behalf of the membership of United       Electric Co-op, Inc. (United Electric), I am once again       writing to seek your support to help pro-actively preserve       the economic value of the Federal Columbia River Power System       and its multiple uses: flood control, power generation,       irrigation, navigation and commerce and recreation. United       Electric serves 6,400 meters in portions of Minidoka and       Cassia counties in Southern Idaho and purchases its wholesale       power supply from the Bonneville Power Administration.        As you know, the Bonneville Power Administration has been       plagued by litigation over the biological opinion which has       been vetted through three administrations and was updated in       2014 by the Obama Administration, referred to as the 2014       Supplemental Biological Opinion. Judges in Oregon have       ignored science, the experts in the industry, and NOAA's top       scientists in what appears to be agenda driven rulings.        This common sense legislation temporarily keeps in place       the 2014 Biological Opinion's hydro system operations and       allows the court ordered NEPA process to continue with a       comprehensive and transparent review, while postponing costly       and potentially harmful experimental spill operations in the       interim.        Please see the attached Resolution adopted by the Board of       Directors of United Electric in support of H.R. 3144. United       Electric supports the proposed legislation and encourages you       to join the bipartisan effort. H.R. 3144 is very important       legislation to the Pacific Northwest's public power,       agriculture, inland port and business communities.        Thank you,                                                            Jo Elg,      General Manager.                                   ____                                  Resolution                             (October 23, 2017)    Supporting H.R. 3144 Federal Legislation Addressing Federal Columbia                   River Power System Biological Opinion         Whereas, Members of United Electric Co-op, Inc., Idaho,       receive 94% percent of their electricity from the Federal       Columbia River Power System (FCRPS); and        Whereas, Hydropower provides 60 percent of the Pacific       Northwest's renewable, affordable and reliable electricity       which the majority of it is produced by the FCRPS; and        Whereas, hydroelectric dams also provide many benefits to       the region, including irrigation, flood control, navigation,       and recreation: and        Whereas, federal legislation requires the federal agencies       responsible for the management of the FCRPS (Bonneville Power       Administration (BPA), Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of       Reclamation) to operate the hydro system in compliance with       the FCRPS Biological Opinion (BiOp) approved by NOAA       Fisheries in 2008/2010 and supplemented in 2014, and        Whereas, The FCRPS BiOp has successfully improved fish runs       including 97% of young salmon successfully making it past the       dams proving that both dams and fish can coexist; and        Whereas, BPA has spent $15.28 billion in total spending on       infrastructure and fish mitigation projects since 1978; and        Whereas, Despite the success of the current FCRPS BiOp, in       March 2017, the United States District Court for the District       of Oregon (Court) directed the federal agencies to undertake       a comprehensive review of hydro operations under the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and strongly urged the       federal agencies to include analysis of the removal, bypass       or breaching one or more of the four lower Snake River dams;       and        Whereas, H.R. 3144, ``To provide for operations of the       Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain       operation plan for a specified period of time'', was       introduced in the United States House of Representatives to       ensure the FCRPS BiOp remains in effect until 2022, and        Whereas, The federal legislation would continue federal       hydro operations through September 30, 2022 or until the       court-ordered, comprehensive environmental NEPA process       concludes, a new Biological Opinion is in place and judicial       review is complete, and        Whereas, The federal legislation would prohibit studies,       plans or structural modifications at the dams which would       impair hydroelectric power generation or navigation on the       Columbia and Snake Rivers; and        Now, therefore be it hereby resolved by the Board of       Directors of United Electric Co-op, Inc., Idaho, supports the       federal legislation identified as H.R. 3144 which was       introduced to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia       River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a       specified period of time;        Be it further resolved that United Electric supports this       legislation as it:        1. Offers a creative solution that is good for both listed,       salmon and the economy of the Northwest and Cassia and       Minidoka Counties.        2. Provides relief in the endless litigation of federal       hydro system operations by directing the federal agencies to       implement the  [[Page H3552]]       current federal salmon plan, known as the 2014 Supplemental       BiOp. This BiOp was vetted and supported by the Obama       Administration's top scientists and has resulted in wild       salmon numbers trending significantly upward due to changes       in operations and the installation of new passage       technologies.        3. Provides time for the federal agencies to complete the       court-ordered NEPA environmental review process analyzing       federal hydro system operations and focuses the general       agencies limited resources on getting that process right.       Without the legislation, the agencies would be compelled to       author a new 2018 BiOp without the benefit of the new science       and public input provided by the comprehensive NEPA review.        4. Avoids experiments or spill tests at the eight Columbia       and Snake dams, and studies and modifications at the dams       which would restrict electrical generation, which would       create uncertainties in BPA's power costs and supply and       raise Pacific Northwest electric customers' rates.        Adopted as a non-binding Resolution for the purposes       recited herein at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board       of Directors this 23rd day of October, 2017.     Mr. Speaker, many advocates for the environmental lobby  claim to be pro-science, but it is clear that far too often they only  rely on that science when it is convenient.   The spill order mandated by this judge could have harmful effects on  the very fish species the BiOp was created to protect, and yet my  colleagues in opposition to this bill say that we are the ones trying  to hurt the fish.   Federal agencies and scientific experts warn of the risks these spill  mandates can place on the fish. We should listen to these experts. We  should support science. Now is not the time to be pushing ideology. Now  is the time to be pushing pro-science pragmatism to both save our  salmon and save our dams.
