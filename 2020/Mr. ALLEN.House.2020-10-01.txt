 Mr. Speaker, here we are once again debating a partisan  messaging bill that will never become law. The Heroes Act 2.0 is the  Democrat's costly attempt to appease their far-left base, and it comes  with a $2.2 trillion price tag.   To name just a few of the progressive provisions of this bill, their  social wish list includes allowing illegal immigrants to receive direct  stimulus payments, defunding the police, subsidizing ObamaCare, and  removing safeguards that would prevent taxpayer money from bailing out  Planned Parenthood.   While American families, workers, and businesses are keeping their  heads down working to revitalize our economy, Speaker Pelosi and the  Democratic leadership are moving forward with a bill that largely has  nothing to do in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, and are ignoring  moving forward legislation that could immediately support our small  businesses.   Thanks to the leadership of our Governor in my home State of Georgia,  we are open for business and leading the Nation in economic recovery.  Our biggest problem is that we do still have businesses that need help.  But I hear from business leaders every day that we must stop this  expanded unemployment because, as their requirements grow, they need  their employees to come back to work.   Our COVID cases are down 28 percent. Hospitalizations are down 60  percent. But, yes, we still have businesses that need help. That is why  I signed the discharge petition, right down there, to bring legislation  to the floor to extend the Paycheck Protection Program, and I urge my  colleagues to sign that so that we can get meaningful help to those  businesses that need it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to stop holding hostage critical  assistance for our small businesses and oppose this partisan power  grab.
