 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank,  celebrate, and congratulate my dear friend and colleague,  Jim  Langevin, who will be leaving us to enjoy his much-deserved retirement.   It has been an honor and privilege to work so closely with him for  more than a decade, especially in our efforts to advance career and  technical education for Americans of all ages.   We have made great strides to improve access and public awareness to  the many benefits of career and technical education. By giving students  the ability to explore career paths and build transferable skills, we  are one step closer to developing a stronger, more skilled American  workforce. I thank Jim for making such a difference in our work on  that.   I send my very best wishes to Jim as he enters this next stage. I  will miss our conversations, our dinners, and his presence around the  Halls of Congress.   I thank Jim for his friendship and leadership over the years. He will  be sincerely missed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend  from Arkansas for his leadership on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1942, the  National Heritage Area Act.   National Heritage Areas provide countless economic benefits to the  communities that they serve, while preserving important cultural,  historical, and nationally significant areas across the country.   In my district, I am proud to represent the Oil Region National  Heritage Area, which is home to the birth of the petroleum industry  located in Venango County, Pennsylvania.   The Oil Region National Heritage Area includes oil artifacts, scenic  communities, farmlands, woodlands, and industrial landscapes, which  provide valuable information and insight into the world's first  successful commercial oil well, the Drake Well, and the legacy of the  petroleum industry.   This successful public-private partnership has maximized Federal  dollars, increased economic investment, and preserved places of local  and national significance throughout northwest Pennsylvania.   This legislation before us will provide increased certainty to the  Oil Region National Heritage Area and all National Heritage Areas by  creating a National Heritage Area System to extend technical and  financial assistance to the entities that support the maintenance and  operation of existing heritage areas.   This bill will also provide a clear set of criteria for establishing  new National Heritage Areas, and this bipartisan legislation is long  overdue.   I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of S. 1942.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the desert terminal lakes program was created to help  restore terminal lakes, provide conservation benefits, and protect  agricultural and other interests throughout surrounding watersheds.   However, with the program's sunset date approaching on October 1,  2023, this legislation will authorize the program an additional 2  years, through October 1, 2025.   This program has been credited with conserving significant amounts of  water to protect Tribal, agricultural, environmental, and habitat  interests. By extending the program's sunset, Congress ensures that the  program has the opportunity to finish up the effective conservation  work achieved by the program and the ability to shut down in a fiscally  responsible manner.   Funding for the program has already been obligated and uses have  already been identified for the remaining money. This bill does not  authorize any new funding, and the CBO estimates that the bill will  have no budgetary impacts.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues' attention to this matter,  and I urge them to join me in supporting this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
