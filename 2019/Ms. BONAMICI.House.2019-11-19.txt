 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4674, the College Affordability Act. I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of this comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education  Act.   The Federal role in education is centered on equity. When we promote  and realize equity in education, when we expand and invest in  educational opportunities, we can improve outcomes for all students, at  all levels.   President Johnson signed the first Higher Education Act into law in  1965, more than 50 years ago. The goal was to make certain that no  student is denied a college education because of a lack of resources.  At that time, President Johnson said: ``This act means the path of  knowledge is open to all that have the determination to walk it.''   We have made some progress over the past 50-plus years. But for many  students, especially first-generation and low-income students and many  students of color, they have the determination, but there are still too  many barriers for them to overcome.   I am glad this bill addresses those barriers and includes several of  my longtime priorities, informed by conversations I have had with  students, community colleges, colleges, and universities across my home  State of Oregon. These priorities include strengthening financial  counseling for student borrowers and modernizing the Federal work-study  program to direct resources to students who need it most.   I have also heard from numerous student loan borrowers in northwest  Oregon who describe loan repayment as anxiety-inducing, daunting, and  overwhelming, which is why I have included language in the College  Affordability Act to help protect many borrowers from default by  getting and keeping them in manageable, income-driven repayment plans.   Also, unfortunately, I have heard that housing and food insecurity  are prevalent for too many students across this country. This bill  includes language I authored, along with my Education and Labor  Committee colleague Representative Takano, to address the issue of food  insecurity by making sure that students who are eligible for SNAP are  aware of their eligibility and have the support they need to secure  those benefits.   The College Affordability Act also increases Pell grant funding,  supports school-based childcare centers, provides stronger  accountability measures for institutions, creates an emergency grant  program for students who encounter unexpected financial barriers, and  makes urgently needed improvements to the public service loan  forgiveness program.   I am proud of the work that the Education and Labor Committee has  done in crafting the College Affordability Act. I am grateful to  Chairman Scott for his leadership. I urge all of my colleagues to  support this crucial legislation when it comes to the floor as we  continue our work to make college affordable and equitable for  everyone.                            ____________________
