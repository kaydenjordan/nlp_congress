 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas for her leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8124, the Criminal Judicial  Administration Act of 2020.   This bipartisan bill will bring more efficiency and fairness to the  criminal justice system by making two commonsense improvements to the  administration of justice in America.   First, the bill would authorize courts to direct the U.S. Marshals  Service to provide subsistence and return transportation to the very  small group of noncustodial defendants who are required to travel to  court proceedings but are financially unable to cover the costs of  doing so. While current law provides subsistence and travel to  proceedings, there is a gap in the statute.    H.R. 8124 will expand the statute to cover transportation, lodging,  and food for defendants who are innocent until proven guilty, as they  return home from these proceedings.   Second, the bill will authorize magistrate judges to decide post- judgment motions in misdemeanor cases in which they have already  exercised trial jurisdiction. Magistrate judges try and sentence  individuals in misdemeanor cases, but to consider a post-judgment  motion, current law requires a referral by a district judge or the  party's consent.   This provision in H.R. 8124 will facilitate judicial economy and help  reduce the caseloads of Article III district court judges by removing  this requirement. The more efficient we can make our court system, the  more effective and just it will be. These two noncontroversial changes  would meaningfully improve the ability of our Federal courts to deliver  equity and justice to the people that they serve.   The Judicial Conference of the United States, the national  policymaking body for our Federal court system, supports this important  and necessary legislation.   I thank the Committee on the Judiciary, and both sides of the aisle,  for approving this bill by voice vote last month.   I would also like to thank my colleague and partner, Representative  Martha Roby, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Courts,  Intellectual Property, and the Internet, for partnering with me on this  effort.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 8124.                                time  1400
