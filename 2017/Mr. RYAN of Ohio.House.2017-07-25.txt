 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the  [[Page H6267]]  ranking member for their leadership on this.   This clearly is a big issue pressing the country, and I just wanted  to rise in support of what is happening here today; of taking a firmer  stance on Russia, Iran, and North Korea; trying to stabilize the  peninsula; trying to take care of the funding that is coming out of  Iran to all of these terrorist groups across the country and across the  world.   What is happening with these sanctions here in the targeting of  Russian gas pipelines--their number one export--I think is entirely  appropriate. The Nord Stream 2, which carries gas from Russia through  the Baltics to Germany--and I know Germany isn't happy about it, but  this is something that we have to do.   The point I want to make is that we have to address this issue in a  comprehensive way. We must continue to focus on how we get our gas here  in the United States, our natural gas to Europe, to our allies, so they  are not so dependent on Russia. We have got to have the sanctions, but  we also have got to be shipping liquid natural gas to some of these  allies of ours so they are not so dependent on the Russians, which is  part and parcel of this entire approach.
