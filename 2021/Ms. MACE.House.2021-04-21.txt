 Madam Speaker, today I rise to wish a very happy birthday  to a South Carolina hero, a community leader and someone who just  yesterday turned 104 years young, Lieutenant Colonel Retired Sam  Mulrain.   Lieutenant Colonel Mulrain has done so much in his life and I am  proud to recognize him today, and I am grateful for all of his  accomplishments. His legacy is inspirational to our Nation and the  Lowcountry. We owe Lieutenant Colonel Mulrain so much for his  contributions, both in military service and in his humanitarian  efforts.   He was part of the Greatest Generation, storming the beaches of  Normandy where he was wounded and received the Purple Heart. He played  baseball with Hall of Famer Phil ``The Scooter'' Rizzuto.   In and around Hilton Head, the community knows him for his tireless  dedication to public service.   Today, we in Congress, wish Sam a very happy birthday.
