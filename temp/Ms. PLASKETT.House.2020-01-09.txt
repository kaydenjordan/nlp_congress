 Madam Speaker, as I rise today to begin discussing  infrastructure, I cannot let go the remarks from my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, their being completely appalled by the Speaker  not bringing over one resolution in what they believe to be a timely  manner, but expressing no concern for the fact that the Senate has not  taken up 400 bills that have been passed by this House, 275 that were  bipartisan, from their own side.   But they have no concern for that. They do have concern for one bill.  That is inappropriate, and I am very sad about my colleagues for this.   Democrats have been working hard to fulfill a promise to the Nation.  Americans in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico are feeling the  brunt of aging and weakening infrastructure--  [[Page H78]]  demonstrated by a series of recent major disasters--which the Democrats  are working hard to support.   We must remain committed to rebuilding disaster-stricken communities,  replacing crumbling infrastructure, and developing and deploying the  infrastructure needed to connect us like never before, including  through 5G.   We cannot allow the Senate and this administration to impede our  efforts to make American infrastructure better, safer, and more  resilient.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   This amendment is simply a correction. It would make the United  States territories eligible for additional Safe Drinking Water Act  funding authorized to address emerging contaminants like PFAS.   Today, we are discussing PFAS, toxic chemicals that have posed  adverse public health risks and have persisted because they could not  break down. Their carbon fluoride bond is the strongest bond in nature,  so PFAS contamination is continuing to be found all across the country:  in the water, air, and soil. It has been extraordinarily widespread.   EPA has acknowledged that millions of people in this country receive  drinking water with PFAS over the health advisory limit, and the United  States territories have been no exception to this.   It has been a serious issue for communities that have been impacted,  and more and more communities will be known to be impacted. A lot of  those who have detected it are taking actions, which are expensive, to  remove it from the drinking water.   That is why this bill, as reported out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and under the recent NDAA, provides new grant funding to  assist water utilities struggling with this issue, contamination in the  drinking water and others.   However, as currently written, this grant funding has only been made  available to States through the Drinking Water Act's State Revolving  Fund program, which does include the District of Columbia and Puerto  Rico, as States, but not other U.S. territories, which are generally  provided with a separate reservation of overall program funding  annually.   My amendment simply corrects this new program to permit the EPA to  provide such grants to these American territories, including my  district in the U.S. Virgin Islands, to assist their water utilities  with PFAS treatment if it is found.   These territories have some of the most severe needs for Federal  assistance in the area of clean water and drinking water-related  infrastructure, and these needs have historically tended to be woefully  underfunded.   They often have received less on a per capita basis than a number of  similarly situated States. If Congress is to assist American  communities with the removal of toxic PFAS from drinking water, it is  only fair to include all American territories as eligible to receive  this assistance.   I urge approval of my amendment as simply a matter of fairness. I  would also take this opportunity to gently remind my colleagues to  please consider Americans in territories in developing legislation  intended to assist all Americans.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in closing, I would like to just  acknowledge to the Chair the support of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, particularly my good friend, Mr. Tonko from New York, as  well as Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, for introducing this legislation  and all of the staff that has worked on this.   I urge adoption of this amendment as part of fairness to all  Americans who face this issue, and I yield back the balance of my time.
