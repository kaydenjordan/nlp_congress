 Mr. President, a few months ago, I had a chance to go up  to the Colorado-Wyoming border to spend a night at the Ladder Ranch. It  is a beautiful property--that is an understatement--situated in the  Little Snake River Valley. If you were designing a postcard for the  American West, you would struggle to do better than this place.   The ranch is owned by Pat and Sharon O'Toole. It has been in the  family for six generations, dating all the way back to 1881. To give  you some sense of how long that is, at the time, the State of Colorado  was just 5 years old, and the Ottoman Empire was still around. Our  world has been transformed since then, but the Ladder Ranch has endured  through the Depression, the Dust Bowl, the two World Wars, and the  transformation of our economy.   Of course, none of that happened just by chance. It happened because  the family looked ahead and made hard choices to deliver that ranch  from generation to generation. Pat and Sharon are continuing that  legacy today, and they are joined on the ranch by their daughters, and  their son, and a whole bunch of grandkids.   I am sharing the story of the Ladder Ranch because in many ways, it  is the story of farmers and ranchers across my State and across the  country--of people applying their ingenuity and common sense to hand  more opportunity to the next generation.   One of the privileges of representing a State like Colorado is that I  have had the opportunity to learn about places like the Ladder Ranch  and the legacy of every one of our farms and ranches represent.   When I joined the Senate Ag Committee, the truth is that I had no  idea how hard it can be for our farmers and ranchers. Like many people,  I had very little appreciation of where our food comes from. If you are  in agriculture, you can do everything right and still fall behind  because of forces beyond your control.   Today, farmers and ranchers in this country are facing tremendous  uncertainty. They have persistent drought, which is growing worse due  to climate change and threats of wildfire. They have low commodity  prices and challenges with finding people who can work, because of our  immigration debate here in Washington, and to find the seasonal labor  they need. Dairies are struggling to hire the workers they need.   Now, on top of all of that, they have the confusion of the existing  trade policies of the United States. Two weeks ago, the USDA announced  that farm incomes are projected to drop 12 percent this year. When you  add it all up--the uncertainty, the policy, the politics--farm income  is going to be down 12 percent this year. All of this acts like a  weight on our farmers and ranchers, making it even harder for them to  pass on the legacy of their work to the next generation.   Earlier this year, our Agriculture Commissioner in Colorado, Don  Brown, who is himself one of the most successful farmers in our State,  said: ``You're only 22 once.'' By that he meant that there is an entire  generation out there deciding whether or not to pursue a career on the  family farm or ranch, and they are looking at all of this uncertainty,  and a lot of them are deciding that it is not worth it. That is why the  average age of farmers is what it is in the United States.   We owe it to our farmers and ranchers to provide consistency where we  can and to help to preserve the legacy of American agriculture for  years to come.   By passing the 2018 farm bill, that is exactly what we have done.  This bill means more certainty for America's producers in this volatile  environment. This bill maintains crop insurance, and it makes risk  management tools more effective. Most important to Colorado, this bill  helps our farmers and ranchers to diversify their operations for the  first time in 50 years.   This bill fully legalizes hemp. The majority leader was out here  earlier. I want to congratulate him on his work to do that. In  Colorado, our hemp growers have operated under a cloud of uncertainty  for years. Our farmers worry about maintaining access to their water.  They couldn't buy crop insurance or transport seeds. Some ran into  redtape opening a bank account or even applying for Federal grants.   Despite these challenges, hemp cultivation in my State grew sixfold  over the last 4 years. Again, it is interesting that the majority  leader has wanted this, as well, because the climate in Kentucky and  the climate in Colorado have almost nothing in common. But hemp grows  in Kentucky, and it grows in Colorado.   We see hemp as an opportunity to diversify our farmers who  manufacture high-margin products for the American  [[Page S7424]]  people. Now, Coloradans will be able to grow and manufacture hemp  without a cloud of uncertainty hanging over them.   This bill also helps farmers and ranchers hand more opportunities to  the next generation. It increases funding for conservation easements  and makes it easier for people to secure them.   It invests in America's farm economy to drive innovation in  agriculture and to keep up our competitiveness in the 21st century. It  doubles funding to help communities in places like my State to deal  with forest health, and it protects our watersheds better.   Working with the Presiding Officer, we increased funding for wildlife  habitat and provided more opportunities for hunting and fishing on  private lands.   We worked with Senator Boozman of Arkansas to give rural communities  new ways to improve housing and infrastructure.   The bill also provides new resources to help farmers and ranchers  adapt to major challenges like climate change. For example, it creates  tools for farmers and ranchers to sequester carbon, improve soil  health, and become more resilient to drought.   We increased resources in this bill for renewable energy and energy  efficiency for rural businesses.   All in all, this 2018 farm bill is an excellent piece of legislation,  and a lot of credit lies in the approach we took on the Agriculture  Committee. It should be like this for all of our committees. It is a  committee on which we don't have partisan differences. If we have  differences, we have regional differences, and we work them out. That  is why that committee, which I am proud to serve on, is one of the only  functioning committees in the Senate. We passed a 5-year farm bill the  last time there was a farm bill, not a 6-month one, not a 6-day one,  but a 5-year farm bill. This is another one because Republicans and  Democrats both know we have to support our farmers and ranchers, not  create even more uncertainty for them.   The other privilege of being on that committee is that I spend a lot  of time in my State in counties where it is unlikely that I am ever  going to win 10 or 20 percent of the vote, but I keep going back and  back, not because I think I will win but because I think, as a country,  we have to find a way to bring ourselves together and solve problems.   Our farmers and ranchers are a model for that. They are applying  their ingenuity to things like climate and drought every single day.  They don't have the luxury--and I would say we don't have the luxury-- of pretending that politics is the only thing that matters. They are  focused on delivering their farms or ranches to the next generations  and handing more opportunity, not less, to them. That is all that  matters, and that is the ethic we should be applying to our national  politics.                     Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act    Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to call on the Senate to  pass the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act.   The bill extends critical VA benefits to veterans who were exposed to  toxic chemicals while they served in the waters off Vietnam.   There is no reason the Senate shouldn't pass this. Our country  already provides these benefits to veterans who served on land, and it  is well past time we extended care to those who served at sea.   This bill is the result of a lot of good bipartisan work in the  Senate, and the House has already passed it. To get this across the  finish line, we should look to the example our veterans set for how to  come together and fight until the job is done.   In Colorado, the United Veterans Committee has advocated strongly for  this bill, and veterans from across our State have spoken out on behalf  of their colleague veterans who deserve justice with the passage of  this bill. Their example reminds us that there is no obstacle we cannot  overcome to provide every veteran who has served in the United States  of America with the greatest healthcare in the world as a reflection of  their service. In this moment, we should rededicate ourselves to that  goal by passing this significant bill.   Let me end by thanking Senator Gillibrand and the Presiding Officer  for their leadership, along with Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member  Tester for getting it to this point.   We need to pass this bill in the Senate before we go home. It is the  right thing to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
