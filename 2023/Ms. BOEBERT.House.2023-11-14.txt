 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that will  transfer funds from government bureaucracy to the Small Rural Hospital  Improvement Grant Program.   The rural hospital closure crisis continues to intensify.  Unfortunately, over 138 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 and over  450 additional facilities are vulnerable to closure.   While recent innovations in healthcare, such as the implementation of  telehealth technology, show promise to rural communities, rural America  is facing crises that are leading to dwindling access to essential  care.   Competitive grant programs like the Small Rural Hospital Improvement  Grant Program play a large role in ensuring that Americans living in  rural communities can access quality, cost-effective healthcare.   This program supports small rural hospitals in meeting value-based  payment and care goals for their respective organizations through  purchases of hardware, software, and training.   While current spending for rural health discretionary programs is  relatively small in the largest discretionary spending bill, it plays a  critical role in solidifying the fragile healthcare infrastructure and  workforce in rural communities.   Americans, especially in rural communities, continue to struggle with  affordable coverage, yet Joe Biden has done nothing to actually lower  costs.   Let's empower our rural communities to keep providing high-quality  healthcare and eliminate red tape and useless bureaucracy that is  standing between doctors and patients. This amendment takes an  important first step to accomplish both of these goals.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that will  transfer funds from the HHS bureaucracy to the Small Rural Hospital  Improvement Grant Program. Again, I urge colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my straightforward  amendment that seeks to provide more resources in the bill for  telehealth services for veterans in rural areas.   Colorado's Third Congressional District has over 100,000 veterans who  call our beautiful State home. I am committed to ensuring that our  veterans receive the care and respect they have earned for their  service and sacrifice.  [[Page H5774]]    That is why I am here today to talk about the importance of  telehealth for veterans in rural areas. Telehealth is the use of  technology to deliver healthcare services remotely, such as through  video, phone, or online platforms.   Telehealth can help veterans access quality care from the comfort and  convenience of their homes or nearby locations without having to travel  long distances or face transportation barriers.   Telehealth is especially important for veterans who live in rural or  highly rural areas like many of the veterans in my district.   According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are 2.8  million rural veterans who are enrolled in and rely on VA healthcare  systems. However, these veterans often face challenges in accessing  timely and quality care due to provider shortages, limited facilities,  and geographical isolation. These challenges can result in poor health  outcomes, such as higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health  issues, and, unfortunately, even suicide.   For instance, rural veterans are more likely to be diagnosed with  diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart conditions than veterans  living in more urban areas. Rural veterans are also 65 percent more  likely to die from suicide than those residing in urban areas.   These statistics are unacceptable. They are absolutely heartbreaking.  Our veterans deserve better. They deserve to have access to the best  care possible regardless of where they live.   I will continue to advocate for these programs and for the expansion  of telehealth access for rural veterans. I believe that telehealth is  not only a matter of convenience, but a matter of necessity. It is a  matter of honoring our veterans and fulfilling our promises to them.   Let's pass my amendment so we can increase telehealth services for  veterans in rural areas.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that will  transfer funds from the Federal bureaucracy to the Rural Emergency  Hospital Technical Assistance Program. Programs like the Rural  Emergency Hospital Technical Assistance Program play a large role in  ensuring that Americans living in rural communities can access quality,  cost-effective healthcare.   The program works to ensure rural hospitals and the communities they  serve have the information and resources needed to make informed  decisions as to whether rural emergency hospitals are the best model of  care for their communities and facilitate a successful implementation  of REH requirements for those hospitals converting to this new provider  type.   This program provides hospitals and rural communities considering  this new model assistance across a broad range of issues, including  financial analysis, workforce or staffing planning, establishment of  referral relationships and processes, determining REH service lines,  community health needs, and impact on the community health system  including emergency medical services.   I will keep working for responsible healthcare policies that respect  the dignity of individuals, support rural communities, decrease  healthcare costs, and restore free market competition to the healthcare  industry.   Let's empower our rural communities to keep providing high-quality  healthcare and eliminate red tape and useless bureaucracy that is  standing between doctors and patients. This amendment takes an  important step to accomplish both of these goals.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that will  transfer funds to the Rural Emergency Hospital Technical Assistance  Program, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that will  transfer funds from government bureaucracy to the Rural Residency  Planning and Development Program to support physician workforce  expansion in rural areas.   On top of closures, the healthcare workforce shortages continue to  plague rural communities. Over 75 percent of rural counties are  designated Health Professional Shortage Areas.   Programs like the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program  support the development of new rural residency programs in family  medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry to address the physician  workforce shortages and challenges faced by rural communities.   Rural residency programs are accredited medical residency training  programs that train residents in rural settings for greater than 50  percent of their total time in residency and focus on producing  physicians who will practice in rural communities.   This program also contributes jobs to rural economies, provides  access to a range of medical services, and strengthens communities  throughout rural America.   Competitive grant programs, like the Rural Residency Planning and  Development Program, play a large role in ensuring that Americans  living in rural communities can access quality, cost-effective  healthcare.   Let's support our rural communities instead of handicapping them with  one-size-fits-all mandates as the Biden administration has done.   In September, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed  a rule to mandate increased nursing home staff ratio which will put  nursing homes, particularly in rural areas, in an impossible dilemma as  they grapple with how to manage current occupancy levels with the  insufficient workforce available to meet the requirements.                                time  1300    Rules like this fail to adequately balance the needs of both patients  and healthcare staff in rural communities in the face of the current  staffing shortage gripping our Nation.   This is why we should focus on giving our rural communities the  resources and support that they need to provide low-cost, high-quality  healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that will transfer funds  to the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program to support  physician workforce expansion in rural areas.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to offer my amendment to redirect $2 million in this  bill to the Office of Inspector General to combat waste, fraud, and  abuse.   As a proud member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, I  am a firm believer in holding our government accountable to the people  we serve. Honest, hardworking American citizens should be able to trust  that their tax dollars are being spent responsibly. To achieve this  goal, the Office of Inspector General must have the funding they need  to ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services is using our  tax dollars efficiently and for their intended purpose.   Inspectors general across the Federal Government have saved taxpayers  billions of dollars and exposed numerous instances of criminal  wrongdoing. According to the most recent report from the HHS on  healthcare fraud and abuse: ``In FY 2021, investigations conducted by  HHS's Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) resulted in 504 criminal  actions against individuals or entities that engaged in crimes related  to Medicare or Medicaid, and 669 civil actions, which include false  claims and unjust enrichment lawsuits filed in the Federal district  court, and civil monetary penalty (CMP) settlements. HHS-OIG also  excluded 1,689 individuals and entities from participation in Medicare,  Medicaid, and other Federal healthcare programs. Among these were  exclusions based on criminal convictions for crimes related to Medicare  and Medicaid or to other healthcare programs, for beneficiary abuse or  neglect, and as a result of State healthcare licensure revocations.''   Mr. Chair, the American people believe the government is corrupt and  rife with fraud. The only way to address these concerns is to promote  accountability in the Federal Government and ensure that their tax  dollars are used responsibly for their intended purpose.   My commonsense amendment will ensure that the HHS Office of Inspector  General has the funding and resources they need to keep this agency in  line. Two million dollars is a small sum to pay to restore faith in our  institutions and to potentially uncover billions and billions in fraud.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to promote  accountability and oversight in the Department of Health and Human  Services, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge all of my colleagues to  support this amendment, which would provide for additional funding  reductions for NIH.   If we have learned nothing else from the executive branch's  involvement and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the very least,  we learned just how corrupt and money hungry the NIH as an organization  truly is.   It has been over 3\1/2\ years since the initial COVID lockdowns and  the NIH continues to cover up and downplay its gain-of-function  research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   Earlier this year, the Inspector General's report found that between  2014 and 2021, the NIH did not adequately follow its policies with  respect to three grants totaling about $8 million to the EcoHealth  Alliance.   The EcoHealth Alliance had a relationship with the Wuhan Institute of  Virology in which it subawarded $600,000 to research coronaviruses in  the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The NIH terminated the EcoHealth grant in April of 2020, then later  reinstated it, only to suspend it again after setting conditions for  resumption that EcoHealth claimed it could not meet.   The NIH permanently terminated the award in August 2022 for  compliance issues, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology's failure  to provide NIH with laboratory notebooks related to the funded  experiments.   Then again, in May of this year, the NIH reinstated grants to renew  its ``collaborative research to understand the risk of bat coronavirus  spillover emergence.'' Seriously?   In late last year, the NIH issued a new grant to EcoHealth Alliance  for a project titled: ``Analyzing the Potential for Future Bat  Coronavirus Emergence in Myanmar, Vietnam, and  [[Page H5782]]  Laos.'' The grant provides EcoHealth Alliance with $653,392 covering a  period until August 31, 2027.   Why is an organization that failed to comply with reporting  requirements continuing to receive more and more American tax dollars?   Even more disturbing, earlier this year, the acting director of NIH,  Dr. Tabak, testified before the House Appropriations Committee. I asked  him whether gain-of-function research was conducted at the Wuhan  Institute of Virology, and he responded ``no.''   In an October 20, 2021, letter to then-Oversight and Reform Committee  Ranking Member James Comer, the NIH admitted to funding gain-of- function research on bat coronaviruses at the WIV. Ironically, Mr.  Tabak authored this letter in which he stated that the limited  experiment tested whether spike proteins from naturally occurring bat  coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human  ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. This is classic gain of function and  this is unacceptable.   Americans deserve to know the truth, especially when their tax  dollars are funding these dangerous practices.   As if that were not enough evidence to justify a budget cut, the  Biden administration has also inappropriately used the NIH as an  extension of the President's radical, unethical policies. For instance,  in April of 2021, the NIH reversed restrictions governing Federal- funded research to allow the use of fetal tissue obtained from elective  abortions.   I am grateful the underlying bill includes several guardrails for  fiscal year 2024, such as prohibiting funding for unethical human  embryo and aborted fetal tissue research, prohibiting any support to  the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and prohibiting gain-of-function  research in an adversarial country. These are good provisions, but they  are simply not enough.   I recognize that the underlying bill has reduced the NIH's funding by  about 12\1/2\ percent, but I strongly believe a larger cut is warranted  if we want the NIH to realign its priorities with congressional intent.   Not only would a larger budget cut force the NIH to eliminate  irresponsible spending and research, but it would also send a strong  message to the Biden administration that Congress does not approve the  NIH's actions.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  transfers funds from government bureaucracy to charter school grants.   As a mom raising four boys, I understand that families across this  country want the best education possible for their children. One size  does not fit all when it comes to education and our Nation's youth, and  education matters are best handled at the State, local, and especially  family levels.   Charter schools are an important part of the public education  landscape because they empower parents to choose a high-quality  educational environment for their child regardless of income or ZIP  Code. The unique educational experience of attending charter schools  ensures more children have a chance to achieve the American Dream.   During the first two full school years of COVID, nearly 240,000  additional students enrolled in public charter schools. Charter schools  were the only sector of public education to grow during the COVID  lockdowns. They also serve our Nation's marginalized children.   A 2021 analysis of research on charter school effects and competitive  influence by the National Bureau of Economic Research highlighted  trends from three decades of research on charter schools. They found  that charter schools boost student test scores, particularly for Black,  Hispanic, and low-income students, and that attending charter schools  increases college enrollment and civic engagement.   The competitive impact of charter schools on traditional public  schools suggests a beneficial influence on neighboring schools' student  achievement.   The Charter Schools Program is the only program at the Department of  Education that supports school choice and allows parents to place their  children in a school that works for their unique needs. Parents know  how to raise their children better than government bureaucrats and  teachers' unions.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that  transfers funds from the government bureaucracy to charter school  grants, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I also have an amendment to add funding to  the IG's account, and this amendment takes no funds from public  schools. This is simply giving more choice to families throughout our  Nation.   Transparency is good, and the argument that we just heard was not so  good. Parents know how to raise their children better than government  bureaucrats and politicians. We certainly experienced that during the  COVID lockdowns. The restrictions that we saw to our children's  education and the educational experiences that were lost during those 2  years or more of COVID lockdowns were a travesty.   I cannot reiterate enough that parents know how to raise their  children better than politicians, better than bureaucrats, better than  teachers' unions. We want to strengthen the Charter Schools Program,  and that is what this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  transfers funds from the Department of Education bureaucracy to support  the Rural Education Achievement Program, REAP.   Most of the country's poorest counties are rural and are often  disconnected from the nonprofits and social service agencies that fill  the gaps in urban and suburban schools.   After decades of population loss and divestment by State governments,  many rural communities are struggling to keep up when it comes to  educating our children and are being forced to close. When these  schools close, children are forced to travel additional hours to get to  school. Closures and consolidations also force teachers,  administrators, and educators out of their jobs.   Yet, America has continued to turn a blind eye, leaving our rural  communities helpless. More than 9.3 million children attend rural  schools. This makes up nearly one-fifth of public school students  across the country.   Rural children had an especially hard time keeping up when Democrats  shut down our schools for 2 years and required students to learn via  Zoom. Many of our children in rural communities don't have access to  the internet, and some don't even have cell phone service. They deserve  better than this.   The Rural Education Achievement Program initiatives are designed to  help rural districts that may lack the personnel and resources to  compete effectively for competitive Federal grants.   There are two dedicated programs funded by this account that aim to  assist rural school districts with improving teaching and learning in  their schools. The Small, Rural School Achievement Program provides  funds to rural districts that serve a small number of students. The  Rural and Low-Income School Program provides funds to rural districts  that serve concentrations of poor students regardless of the number of  students served by the district.   Our children deserve a proper education no matter what their ZIP Code  is, and it is our duty to build a better future for them.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that  transfers funds from the Department of Education bureaucracy to the  Rural Education Achievement Program.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment on behalf  of the thousands of Native Americans who deserve a quality education  that respects their culture, history, and identity. These students face  unique challenges and opportunities in their communities, and they need  our support to achieve their full potential.   The Federal Government has a trust responsibility to provide  educational services to Tribes and their members as established by  treaties, statutes, and court decisions. However, for far too long,  this responsibility has been neglected and underfunded, resulting in  poor outcomes and inequities for Native students.   According to the Office of Indian Education, there are 183 bureau- funded elementary and secondary schools located on 64 reservations in  23 States, serving approximately 42,000 Native students. These schools  are often in remote and rural areas with limited access to resources,  technology, and qualified teachers. Many of these schools are also in  dire need of repair and renovation, posing health and safety risks to  students and staff.   Mr. Chair, I believe that education is the key to empowering  opportunity and prosperity for all Americans. I also believe that we  have a moral and legal obligation to honor our commitments to Tribes  and their members and to respect their sovereignty and self- determination.   By redirecting wasteful spending in this bill to Native Americans'  education, we can make a difference in the lives of Native students and  in the strength and resilience of Tribal communities.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to transfer  funds from the Department of Education bureaucracy to the Indian  Education account.  [[Page H5788]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my commonsense  amendment to transfer $2 million from government bureaucracy to the  Office of Inspector General to combat waste, fraud, and abuse.   As a proud member of the House Oversight Committee, I am a firm  believer in holding our government accountable to the people we serve.   Honest, hardworking American citizens should be able to trust that  their tax dollars are being spent responsibly and for their intended  purpose.   The Department of Education Office of Inspector General must have  adequate resources and funding to uncover waste, fraud, and abuse to  ensure that the Department can focus on providing for the education of  America's children.   Ever since the passage of the Inspector General Act of 1978,  inspectors general have uncovered billions of dollars of fraud and  exposed numerous instances of criminal wrongdoing. The Department of  Education is no exception.   According to this year's semiannual report, the Department of  Education Office of Inspector General ``closed 32 investigations  involving fraud or corruption and secured more than $41.92 million in  restitution, settlements, fines, savings, recoveries, and forfeitures.  As a result of this work, criminal actions were taken against numerous  people, including current and former school officials and service  providers who cheated students and taxpayers.'' The inspector general  accomplished these feats in only half a year.   In fiscal year 2023, the Department of Education had a budget of a  whopping $271 billion. The American people should be able to trust that  these funds are being used to support the education of their children  and for no other purpose.   My commonsense amendment will ensure that the inspector general has  the funding and resources they need to ensure that the Department's  funds are being used responsibly. We have a sacred duty to ensure that  Department of Education funds are used to further the education of our  children, and we must not tolerate any wrongdoing that defrauds  America's children, students, and families.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to increase  funding for the Department of Education Office of Inspector General,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
