 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against H.R. 986.   I think everyone in this Chamber can agree that individuals with  preexisting conditions should be protected and that the American people  should have access to affordable and quality healthcare. This bill  falls short of achieving, or even making progress towards, these  important goals.   This bill showcases a fundamental misunderstanding of section 1332  waivers, which allow States to pursue more creative and innovative  strategies to provide their residents with access to high-quality  health insurance. This bill actually rolls back the ability of States  to innovate lower costs and expand coverage options for patients and  families.   Additionally, this bill is disingenuous in suggesting that it is  protecting individuals with preexisting conditions when section 1332  waivers already require States to do so. Rather than calling this the  ``Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act,'' this bill  would be more appropriately named the ``Don't Let States Innovate  Act.''   Not surprisingly, this bill also neglects to address the grievous  shortcomings of ObamaCare.   In my district, not a day goes by that I don't hear from constituents  about the untenable costs of ObamaCare. It is no secret that ObamaCare  has led to skyrocketing premiums and deductibles, offering anything but  affordable care to the American people. However, the data clearly shows  that States using section 1332 waivers to create their own reinsurance  programs saw premiums drop by an average of nearly 20 percent.   We must make our country's healthcare system work better by  supporting choice, access, and affordability. This bill forces our  country on a pathway towards one size fits all, Big Government-centered  healthcare. And this Democrat vision of a top-down healthcare system is  one that I absolutely cannot support.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and  the underlying bill.
