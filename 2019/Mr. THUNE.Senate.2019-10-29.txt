 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to say I was sad to  hear of the death of former Senator Kay Hagan yesterday. Kay  represented the State of North Carolina in the Senate.   She was a very dedicated public servant. I think she was someone whom  all of us who were here at the time enjoyed working with and always was  a very bright presence. As I said, she was tremendously dedicated to  the people she represented and the issues she cared so deeply about.  Our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family today. I ask all  Members to continue to lift her family up.                                  H.R. 3055    Mr. President, I also congratulate the Senator from Maine on the work  she is doing on the appropriations process as it is moving forward. She  chairs a very important subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee  and also is involved in so many other issues.   One thing she was speaking about that I certainly wanted to mention  was the work she does to protect seniors across this country. It is a  very vulnerable population--vulnerable to the  [[Page S6210]]  fraud attempts made by bad actors out there. She mentioned robocalls.  She has been a leader on the legislation to try and ban the types of  robocalls that prey on our senior citizens and lead to all that fraud  that happens--the billions of dollars she referenced every single year.  It is important because there are so many perpetrators of schemes out  there that are designed to prey on and take advantage of those  populations in our country, particularly our elderly who are  susceptible to that. I thank her for her leadership on that, as well as  many other issues that are involved in the appropriations bill she  mentioned earlier.                            Health Insurance Plans    Mr. President, later this week, we are going to vote on a Democratic  resolution to repeal guidance the President issued to give States more  flexibility to design insurance plans that meet the needs of their  residents. Democrats have tried to portray this resolution as a move to  protect people with preexisting conditions. That is just a smokescreen.  Democrats know very well that Republicans are committed to protecting  those with preexisting conditions.   In reality, this is just another political messaging bill. It is also  another attempt by Democrats to maximize Washington control of  American's healthcare. In keeping with their push toward socialism,  Democrats want to make very sure the States don't have the chance to  escape from any of ObamaCare's bureaucracy.   Let me back up a minute and talk about the waiver and guidance from  the President the Democrats are attacking. Section 1332 of the  Affordable Care Act--the law the Democrats enacted on a completely  partisan basis--allows States to apply for waivers from certain  ObamaCare requirements. The requirements that can and cannot be waived  are the same today as they were the day ObamaCare passed. Let me repeat  that. The ObamaCare requirements that can or cannot be waived are the  same today as they were the day ObamaCare passed.   The 2018 guidance from the White House did not change anything about  what requirements can and cannot be waived under section 1332. Let me  be very clear, 1332 waivers do not allow States to waive ObamaCare's  preexisting condition protections; they do not allow health plans to  utilize preexisting condition coverage exclusions; they do not allow  health plans to refuse coverage for people with preexisting conditions;  and they do not allow plans to charge individuals more based on a  preexisting health condition.   So what do 1332 waivers do? The waivers give States the opportunity  to take action to stabilize insurance markets and try out new ways of  providing coverage to individuals who might not otherwise be able to  afford insurance. My colleagues across the aisle would have the  American public believe these waivers will ``allow States to greenlight  substandard, junk insurance plans.'' Well, let me remind my colleagues  that these plans that they deride as ``junk plans'' are the very same  short-term, limited-duration plans that were permitted in 7 out of the  8 years of the Obama administration.   Another refrain that we will hear from my Democratic colleagues is  that the administration's guidance will permit States to waive certain  health benefits, or what we call EHBs. I remind them that the  Affordable Care Act itself permits the waiving of EHBs by States. The  Trump administration guidance does not change this. Again, while the  Democrats would have people believe the Republicans are destroying  essential health benefits, States can already choose to waive them but,  to date, have not.   Most of the States that have applied for waivers have wanted to use  them for reinsurance programs in order to drive down premiums. Again,  waivers give States some relief from ObamaCare's one-size-fits-all  requirements, which allows them to try out new ways to drive down  prices and help individuals afford care. It is about choice. It is  about empowering Americans to decide what type of coverage meets their  needs.   We might not be having this conversation today if ObamaCare had lived  up to the rosy promises that were made when it was passed. Yet I don't  have to tell anyone that it didn't come anywhere close to living up to  those promises. ObamaCare was supposed to give Americans without health  insurance access to affordable care while it preserved the health  insurance of the millions of Americans who were satisfied with the  plans they already had. As everyone knows, what actually happened was  quite different.   Millions of Americans lost their plans. Health insurance premiums  went up, not down. Also, premiums and out-of-pocket costs on the  exchanges were unaffordable for many people from the very first day.  The average monthly premium for a family plan on the exchanges has  increased by $742 over the past 4 years. That is close to the average  mortgage payment in my home State of South Dakota. So it is not  surprising that States would be looking for ways to help families  afford care through these 1332 waivers.   Waivers are, in fact, helping to lower premiums. Seven States that  received waivers saw the average premiums for a benchmark silver plan  drop by 7\1/2\ percent from 2018 to 2019. States are using these 1332  waivers to make healthcare more affordable and ObamaCare premiums less  burdensome. They are not using the waivers to do anything to undermine  protections for people with preexisting conditions, which is something,  as I said earlier, they cannot legally do anyway.   It is worth noting that more than one State with a Democratic  Governor--not a Republican Governor but a Democratic Governor--has  applied for a 1332 waiver this year. So are Democratic Senators here  suggesting that these Governors want to undermine the protections for  people with preexisting conditions? I don't think so.   Numerous Americans are struggling to afford their ObamaCare premiums,  and many others have been priced out of the ObamaCare market  altogether. It only makes sense to give States as much flexibility as  possible to address ObamaCare's problems and expand insurance access  for their residents. Yet the Democrats are so set on maximizing  Washington's control of American's healthcare that they are determined  to oppose any ObamaCare flexibility even if that flexibility results in  there being lower premiums for the American people.   Today's resolution is just another example of the Democrats'  prioritizing their political ideology over the welfare of the American  people, and I hope it will be defeated.   I yield the floor.
