 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a great American,  and I want to say at this point in time: Well done, thy good and  faithful servant.   I rise to recognize the Keeper of the Mace for the United States  House of Representatives on this day, Joyce Hamlett, who has been a  caretaker, a defender, a person who has kept this House in order, a  person who knows the rules better than most Members and has also been a  friend.   She has helped me with doctors, talked to me when I have been in bad  shape, and kept me warm out in the hall. She is a consummate servant  for this House.   For 35 years, she has given her life to the United States House of  Representatives. I am deeply moved on this day, which is why I did my 1  minute from here, so I could address her and look her way and say: Well  done, thy good and faithful servant.   There is no one who is more serious about the business of this House  than Joyce Hamlett. She will be missed.   I know it is bittersweet for her, as well. I know she can't wait till  she leaves, but as she thinks about it, it is not a happy day.   Let me wish her continued success. She has earned this retirement.  She has earned this retirement, working with the Members that she has  probably had come through this House. God bless her. I thank her, and  may the Lord keep her.                            ____________________
