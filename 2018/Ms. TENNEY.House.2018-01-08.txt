 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a new record in  Oswego County, New York. The town of Redfield now has the record for  the most snowfall in 48 hours. An astonishing 62 inches of snow fell in  this idyllic town along the Salmon River with only 550 people near Lake  Ontario.   While subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions keep most people  inside our homes, National Weather Service observer and constituent  Carolyn Yerdon braved the elements to announce the record shattering  news standing atop a 5-foot snow bank.   The total snowfall breaks the world record of 57 inches in a 48-hour  period set in 2008 by Bennetts Bridge in Oswego County.   Home to some of the harshest winter conditions in the country,  upstate New York experiences heavy lake-effect snow, high winds, and  bitter temperatures all season long.   As snow blankets our region this winter, we are grateful to our first  responders, who continue to go above and beyond and keep our roadsides  safe, to protect and rescue some stranded vulnerable citizens--yes, in  5 feet of snow, you can lose people--and providing assistance to all  our communities.   A special thank you to Carolyn Yerdon, our special National Weather  Service employee. May I just say her favorite words: Let it snow, let  it snow, let it snow.                            ____________________
