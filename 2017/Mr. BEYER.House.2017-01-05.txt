 Section 2:   ``The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of  the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when  called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the  opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive  departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their  respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves and  pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of  impeachment.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise to read a letter from my constituent,  Mrs. Karen O'Hern, of Alexandria, Virginia:   ``Congressman Beyer,   ``We are a family of four. The company my husband worked for went  bankrupt in 2009 after the 2008 financial meltdown--losing income,  retirement savings, and health care.   ``He now owns a small business and we now get our healthcare  insurance through healthcare.gov.   ``We need you to defend the ACA. We depend on the availability of  this insurance option.   ``My son had surgery on December 30 at Fairfax Hospital to remove a  brain tumor. His prognosis is good. I cannot imagine how we would  manage financially without this health insurance.   ``Please be strong on this matter and represent the needs of your  constituents.   ``I need my Affordable Care Act health insurance.   ``Regards, Karen O'Hern.''   Mr. Speaker, millions like Karen O'Hern will lose their coverage if  the Affordable Care Act is repealed. We must not make America sick  again.                            ____________________
