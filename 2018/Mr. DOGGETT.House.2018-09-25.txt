 Madam Speaker, unfortunately, there is just no wonder  drug that will cure prescription price gouging. And with many prices  for drugs rising at 10 times the rate of inflation, and with an  unaffordable drug being 100 percent ineffective for the many that  cannot afford it, many Americans are really desperate.   In this Congress, we have another lost year of failing to address  prescription price gouging. Now, on election eve, we take this  miniscule step forward. A few of the many consumers who have been  scrimping to get their medications, could at least find out if by  paying cash, they can get a particular prescription at a lower price.  No longer will gag provisions deny pharmacists the right to counsel  about this issue.   After learning about this problem about two years ago, I consulted  with experts, with patient advocates, with pharmacists about these  clauses, and asked the CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services to prevent this administratively, which they could have done,  but they failed to do so.   Finally, months ago this year, I filed two bills as companion  legislation to the measures we are considering today by Senators  Collins and Stabenow, and was joined by 32 Members of the other house  in supporting and sponsoring those measures.   This Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, the House version of it,  was endorsed back in June by the National Community Pharmacists  Association, thereafter, by the National Association of Chain Drug  Stores, and by the American Psychiatric Association.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record their letters of support.   [[Page H8798]]                                                   National Community                                         Pharmacists Association,                                                      June 28, 2018.      Re National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) Support           of H.R. 6143 & 6144.       Hon. Lloyd Doggett,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Doggett: The National Community       Pharmacists Association (NCPA) is writing today in strong       support of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act and the       Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, H.R. 6143 and 6144, two       bills that would ban provisions in contracts between pharmacy       benefit managers (PBMs) and pharmacies (so called ``gag       clauses'') that prohibit pharmacists from being able to       inform patients of cheaper alternatives for their medication.        NCPA represents the interests of America's community       pharmacists, including the owners of more than 22,000       independent community pharmacies. Together, they represent an       $80 billion health care marketplace and employ more than       250,000 individuals on a full or part-time basis.        ``Gag clauses'' refer to contract provisions and/or       requirements embedded in lengthy provider manuals that       include overly broad confidentiality requirements, and non-      disparagement clauses, as well as requirements that       pharmacies charge insured patients what the PBM says at point       of sale, leaving pharmacies with little to no ability to       inform patients of actual drug costs. Such provisions have       the effect of chilling a range of pharmacist communications       with patients and others for fear of retaliation by the PBM.        NCPA strongly supports passage of the Patient Right to Know       Drug Prices Act and the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 to       help ensure that patients are not being charged inflated       prices for their drugs. Thank you for your leadership in       addressing this issue, and we look forward to working with       you to advance these pieces of legislation.            Sincerely,                                           Karry K. La Violette,                                 Senior Vice President of Government      Affairs & Director of the Advocacy Center.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                               Chain Drug Stores,                                       Arlington, VA, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Lloyd Doggett,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Doggett: The National Association of       Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) is pleased to support your       legislation, the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018 (H.R.       6144), to prohibit PDP sponsors, Medicare Advantage       Organizations, and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMS) from       restricting pharmacies from informing individuals regarding       the prices for certain drugs and biologicals.        NACDS believe gag clauses should not be allowed in       contracts between health plans and pharmacies. Such clauses       prevent pharmacists from informing patients when a medication       can be purchased at a lower price without using insurance.       The prohibition and/or removal of gag clauses in contracts       between Part D plans, Medicare Advantage plans, PBMs, and       pharmacies will enhance patient access to medications, enable       pharmacists to have improved relationships with patients, and       keep healthcare costs for patients to a minimum.        Pharmacies are the face of neighborhood healthcare and are       a highly trusted source of healthcare information, products,       and services. Your legislation helps ensure that Medicare       beneficiaries can continue to trust their local pharmacies       for accurate and helpful information regarding their       prescription drug costs.        Again, we appreciate your leadership on this critically       important healthcare issue.        Sincerely,                                                  Tom O'Donnell,                                              Senior Vice President,      Government Affairs and Public Policy.                                   ____                                                    August 16, 2018.      Hon. Lloyd Doggett,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Doggett: On behalf of the American       Psychiatric Association (APA), the national medical specialty       association representing more than 37,800 psychiatric       physicians, I write in support of your bill H.R. 6143, the       Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. H.R. 6143 seeks to       enhance transparency in the pricing of prescription drugs by       forbidding insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from       imposing ``gag clauses'' in their contracts with pharmacies.       These clauses forbid pharmacies from disclosing to patients       the difference between the amount of the drug's copay under       their insurance plan and the amount they would pay for the       drug without using their insurance. As providers, we are       deeply concerned about the barriers these clauses impose on a       patient's access to affordable medications. Federal       preemption of these clauses is among the proposals included       in President Trump's blueprint to lower drug prices and       reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients.        As you know, the list prices for prescription drugs       continue to rise. PBMs seek to lower those prices by       negotiating discounts directly with drug manufacturers.       However, the amount of these discounts may result in an       insurance plan's copay for a drug exceeding the actual cost       of purchasing the drug out-of-pocket because the copay is       typically calculated based on factors other than the actual       price of the drug. Unfortunately, because the amount of these       discounts is not publicly available, consumers do not know       when their insurance plan copay is higher than the actual       price of the drug and often assume that their copay       represents only a portion of the best possible price of the       drug.        According to a recent study of 2013 drug pricing and       payment data, consumers overpaid for their prescription drugs       by $135 million. Almost a quarter (23%) of all prescriptions       filled in 2013 involved a patient copayment that exceeded the       average price of the drug by more than $2.00. Prescriptions       for drugs commonly used to treat mental health disorders are       prone to this overpayment phenomenon. The medications cited       as having the highest frequency of overpaid prescriptions       include drugs commonly used to treat insomnia, depression,       and some side effects of psychiatric medications.        Thank you for your ongoing commitment to finding bipartisan       ways to enhance transparency in the prices consumers pay for       their health care. Accordingly, we welcome an opportunity to       aid your efforts to advance H.R. 6143, the Patient Right to       Know Drug Prices Act from the Energy & Commerce Committee.            Sincerely,                                    Saul Levin, MD, MPA, FRCP-E,                                           CEO and Medical Director,                                  American Psychiatric Association.     Madam Speaker, I am pleased that finally our House  Republican colleagues have agreed to approve this proposal today. With  families nationwide concerned about soaring drug prices, this  legislation would end a restrictive, anticompetitive, and anticonsumer  provision for those who rely on ObamaCare in the marketplace and for  group employer ERISA plans.   I must note, however, that of all the many bills I have either  introduced or supported from other colleagues dealing with excessive  medication costs, this is the most narrow of the proposals out of all  of them.   Instead of really saving lives, some may view this as simply a life  preserver for those who have ignored prescription price gouging for the  past two years. Approving this modest, narrow bill is not a substitute  for tackling the pervasive problem of prescription price gouging.   Pharmacists are not the only ones who are, apparently, gagged. Right  here in this Congress, some seem to be unable to find their voice and  vote for real reform that would lower drug prices when we are  outnumbered by two pharmaceutical lobbyists for every Member of this  House of Representatives.   Repeated attempts to pass measures that would lower prices have been  blocked. Republicans even blocked my amendment to the opioid  legislation to authorize the Trump administration to negotiate the  price of naloxone, the lifesaving opioid overdose reversal drug whose  prices soared by 700 percent.   During the past week, Big Pharma, with considerable help from the  Republican majority leader, sought to hitch a ride on this very same  opioid legislation to get an unrelated $4 billion gift. It is enough to  make you gag. Hopefully, we have got that stopped.   Passage of this bill today is one modest step that we can take, but  so much more is needed. That this bill even counts as progress,  demonstrates how far we have to go. And while this bill brings some  transparency to the pharmacy counter, the transparency which is most  needed is comprehensive legislation like the Transparency Drug Pricing  Act that I have introduced, to shed some light on where the prices get  set. And that is by the manufacturer who hides the whole process  through discounts, rebates, and fees.   Now, we all know that President Trump solved the problem with his  Rose Garden press conference early in the summer when he announced that  prices are going down. But I have yet to find anybody who has benefited  from that announcement. And, in fact, the Associated Press just  analyzed drug prices since that announcement and they couldn't find any  company that had made any significant reduction on prices.   And when questioning the executives of 24 large drug companies, the  AP didn't find a single one committed to cutting prices.    Madam Speaker, the attitude was best captured by one  pharmaceutical executive who within  [[Page H8799]]  the last month said that he had a, ``moral requirement . . . to sell  the product for the highest price.''   Today's two minor prescription drugs bills are being passed in this  process that is called ``suspension.'' But let's not create any further  suspense for families that are in need on their healthcare costs. Let's  approve real, comprehensive prescription drug pricing reform in a new  Congress that is not indifferent to the needs of American healthcare  consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to hear from neighbors in my part of Texas  and beyond who are unable to afford their prescription drugs,  lifesaving drugs. They are cutting back on necessities, cutting pills  in half, or cutting into what little savings they may have.   After seeking administrative action to address this gag order problem  with no success, I introduced with Senators Stabenow and Collins here  in the House, along with 32 colleagues, a House bill to do what their  measures do today.   Despite repeated requests, the House Ways and Means Committee, which  enjoys jurisdiction over this matter as a Medicare bill, along with the  Commerce Committee, declined to consider them.   This particular bill that we are considering now will allow those  Medicare beneficiaries, seniors and individuals with disabilities, to  turn to a professional pharmacist to learn if there is information  available that, on a particular drug, they might be able to get a less  expensive alternative by paying cash.   While pleased that this modest Know the Lowest Price bill will become  law, we have had too much aiming low and shooting low in this Congress  that has really been indifferent to the overall plight of seniors  burdened with exorbitant prescription drug costs.   What a low bar that has been set. Patients want real change on this  matter. Yet, we do the least possible to address this problem. We take  baby steps when bold steps are required. To borrow from Mark Twain, I  believe seniors can recognize the difference between lightning and a  lightning bug, like we are getting today.   While this may enable some to learn the lowest available price, I  believe what we need to find out about is the highest price that is  being extorted in too many cases. The sky seems to be the limit.  Whatever can be obtained from someone who is sick or dying seems to be  the price point.   We may be able to cure some cancers and diseases--we want to  encourage a price that will encourage continued innovation--but it need  not come at the levels that are being charged too many people today  only because this Congress is unwilling to curb the government monopoly  that it has granted.   Pharmaceutical pricing is a tangled knot. There is no one panacea.  Every step forward is a good step forward.   I formed a House Prescription Drug Task Force three years ago to  begin to look at administrative and legislative steps in how we  encourage innovation without being exploited by monopoly prices.   I think there is much more we can do, much more for someone like Bob  from San Antonio, who has suffered from crippling arthritis for  decades. He has seen the prescription that he relies on skyrocket from  about $200 a year to $22,000 in co-payments annually. He finally had to  switch to a less expensive drug and lives with the fear that it will  not adequately cover his pain, even though it has become too painful to  afford it.   Patients like Bob need much more than modest bills. We need a  Congress that does not repeatedly cave in to the Big Pharma lobbyists.  What is happening this week, this very week, is yet another reminder of  the choice that has been made between a special interest and the needs  of seniors.   With the active assistance of the Majority Leader, Big Pharma tried  to exploit bipartisan opioid legislation and further burden patients  with a provision undoing what had been a bipartisan agreement that  helped plug the so-called donut hole and lowered patients' out-of- pocket drug spending in Medicare.   Pharma's plan would save them $4 billion, but the costs would have  been shifted either to our seniors and individuals with disabilities  directly or through the premiums that they pay.   Unable to defend this heist on its merits of flawed and misleading  advertisements, and a hoard of lobbyists who have been here to try to  get that $4 billion, I hope that we have it stopped. Hopefully, in  fact--speak of hope--in a new Congress, we can see some action on what  really might make a difference, and that is the ability of Medicare to  negotiate for our seniors to get lower prices in much the same way the  Veterans Administration does for our veterans.   I have introduced, along with almost 90 sponsors, the Medicare  Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act to harness the purchasing  power of the government through the Health and Human Services  Secretary. If negotiations fail, the Secretary would use good old  American competition to lower them, bringing in generics, bidding, and  competition, a real American way to solve what is a serious American  problem.   Patients should not have to fight their insurer or a drug company  when they need to be fighting their disease. Patients need this  Congress to reclaim its voice and to not be gagged any longer. It can  no longer let Big Pharma and its agenda define the debate. Instead, we  need to end Big Pharma's exploitation of patients in order to get  windfall profits.
