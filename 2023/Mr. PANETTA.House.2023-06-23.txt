 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the service and the  legacy of the United States Army's 54th Coast Artillery Regiment that  served during World War II.   As the Army's only all-Black heavy artillery regiment in World War  II, they were given used weapons and secondhand uniforms from World War  I. Despite that lack of fancy gear and guns, the men of the 54th stood  firm and stood fast as they guarded the entire central coast of  California, from San Francisco Bay to Port San Luis, from Morro Bay to  Monterey Bay, and from Lighthouse Point in Santa Cruz to Point Pinos  Lighthouse in Pacific Grove.   Through their service, but also through their social lives, the  soldiers impacted and became entwined in our community. They formed a  local baseball league during their assignment, and after their service  some even returned to the Central Coast to serve our community.   Mr. Speaker, the history of the all-Black 54th Coast Artillery  Regiment is not just important to the 19th Congressional District, but  it is about the broader story of our military. Americans of all levels,  all races, all genders, all creeds coming together to fulfill their  responsibility of living in our democracy by defending our communities  and serving our country.                            ____________________
