 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nominee  for Secretary of State. I will be brief and to the point.   Mr. Rex Tillerson led his last organization in a lobbying campaign to  undermine the national security interests of the United States in favor  of Russia, Iran, and corporate profit. Putting narrow corporate  interests ahead of America's national security interests is inexcusable  for a CEO and disqualifying for a nominee to be our Nation's chief  diplomat.   I will vote against Rex Tillerson's nomination for Secretary of  State, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
