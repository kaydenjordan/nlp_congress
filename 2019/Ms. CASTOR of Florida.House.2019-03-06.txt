 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the  Rules Committee for yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the For the People Act, H.R. 1, and  the rule.   We promised the American people, and our neighbors back home have  urged us on, to strengthen America's ethics laws, to fix our broken  campaign finance system, and to empower American voters.   I represent the State of Florida, and you better believe that we have  to protect access to the ballot box, ensure the voting rights of  everyone, and count every vote.   I thank the Rules Committee for including a bipartisan amendment that  I have worked on to address the abuse of zombie campaigns. Many folks  don't understand this, but sometimes Members who retire from Congress  keep their campaign accounts, and they live on for decades, hence the  title ``zombie campaigns.'' Oftentimes, they will misuse the unspent  campaign funds. It is wrong for campaign accounts to live on forever,  and we are going to address that abuse as well.   This bill has important reforms that strengthen American democracy,  root out corruption, and ensure that our government here in the United  States of America works for the people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote.
