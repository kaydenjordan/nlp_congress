 Mr. Chair, I am literally losing my voice, but  somehow I will find the strength to make my voice heard on this  dangerous bill.   I rise today to speak against this bill's completely dated, out-of- date insistence on stripping women of their fundamental freedoms, not  to mention the 80 percent cut to title I across this country. This is  funding for our most at-risk students everywhere, in every community in  this country. It will eliminate over 200,000 teachers and jeopardize  the education of 26 million students.   First, I will take you back to a week ago when Americans all across  this country from Ohio to Kentucky to Virginia came out in droves to  reject extremist efforts to strip a woman's right to make decisions  about her own body.   Now, Republicans here in Washington are doubling down on that same  out-of-touch agenda, this time by sneaking partisan policy wins into  what is supposed to be a bipartisan process for funding our government.   Conservatives have spent 50 years saying abortion should be left up  to the States. They finally got their way when the Supreme Court  overturned Roe v. Wade. Now, even after local communities everywhere  are demonstrating clearly that they believe in a woman's fundamental  freedoms, radical House Republicans are doing everything they can to  make abortion illegal at a national level.   It is time to wake up, listen to women across this country from the  coasts to the hills to the deserts who have spoken and will continue to  say: Hands off our bodies. It is our choice. Let's leave it that way.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' This nonsense needs to end.
