 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. Davis of Illinois  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have a scheme to take over elections, and it  has taken a very disturbing turn. The Federal takeover of elections  bill is masquerading as what was a noncontroversial NASA bill.   The Constitution, Mr. Speaker, is clear: State legislators alone  determine the time, place, and manner of elections, period.   Voter participation, Mr. Speaker, over the past 20 years has  enormously increased; it is well over 70 percent at this point because  States have implemented policies assuring easy access while maintaining  voter integrity to the best of their ability.   Nevertheless, Democrats want a Federal takeover of all elections.  This plan legalizes ballot harvesting nationwide, bans voter ID laws.  Does America hear that? Prohibits the ability to ask for an ID to vote.  Somehow that is in the interest of our election integrity. I don't  think so.   It allows noncitizens to vote, Mr. Speaker, and imposes new mandates  on all precincts, regardless of their size or resources. Perhaps most  egregiously, they want to provide millions of dollars in taxpayer  funding for campaigns.   Under this new taxpayer scheme, the American taxpayer would give our  Speaker of the House $22 million and a whopping $44 million to Senate  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer for his campaign.   Americans can't get COVID tests, hospitals are being overwhelmed,  businesses can't find workers, and this is the focus, to blow up the  Senate filibuster and seize control of all elections to secure future  Democrat majorities.   Let's vote ``no.''
