 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this so-called resolution of insistence is being rushed  to the floor as an emergency measure.   There are many emergencies facing the United States at this hour. The  subject matter of this resolution is not among them.   This resolution is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law, wrong on the  rules, and a dangerous precedent to set for the House of  Representatives.   First, the resolution is riddled with inaccuracies. Taking this  document at face value, you might think that the Department of Justice  had not already sent us hundreds of thousands of documents, many of  which the sponsors of this resolution delight in leaking to the public.   It also relies heavily on the March 22 subpoena issued by Chairman  Goodlatte, a subpoena that was not issued in compliance with House  rules, and that, according to past House counselors with whom we have  consulted, likely cannot be enforced.                                time  1030    Second, this resolution is premised on a demand for documents to  which Congress is not entitled and which the Justice Department cannot  give.   To be clear, I firmly believe that when the House Judiciary Committee  asks the executive branch for information, our committee is entitled to  that information in almost every case. But we are not entitled to  information that goes to the core of an ongoing criminal investigation.   This prohibition is both a matter of constitutional law, as it falls  to the executive branch to enforce the law, and a matter of basic  fairness. It is wrong to inject politics into criminal proceedings.   I suspect that the sponsors of this resolution already know this.  They are asking for documents that they know they will probably never  receive, and they likely view this impossible request as a win-win  proposition.   If they somehow bully the Department of Justice into turning over  materials that go to the core of Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation, that information could be and probably would be shared  with the subject of the investigation, namely, President Trump. Indeed,  Mayor Giuliani has hinted exactly that. Based on past precedent, that  information would next be shared with anybody watching FOX News.   If they do not pry these documents from the Department, they will use  that fact to further smear the special counsel, the Deputy Attorney  General, and anyone else investigating the President. They have even  suggested impeaching the Deputy Attorney General, a proposal that is  both without historical precedent and patently ridiculous.   The real purpose of this resolution, and of this whole attempt, is to  cast aspersions, is to defame the special prosecutor, the special  counsel, and the people associated with him, the Deputy Attorney  General.   Finally, voting on this resolution today sets a dangerous precedent.  The majority will, in effect, have shown the American people that pure  politics is more important than the facts and more important than the  law. And for what?   You can force this fight with the leadership of the Department of  Justice. You can demand documents that the Department cannot give us,  and to which we are not entitled. You can attack the character of  lifelong public servants like Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and  Special Counsel Mueller. You can burn bridges with your colleagues to  speed this resolution to the floor. But you cannot stop the special  counsel's investigation.   Before Members vote today, we must ask: When the special counsel's  work is complete, when the enormity of what he has found has been laid  bare, how will the American people judge the House's actions here  today?   I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless, dangerous measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the distinguished ranking member of the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield further time, I have a  parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 970, which is before us now,  includes a reference to a document unilaterally issued by the House  Judiciary Committee on March 22, 2018. It is my understanding that the  issuance of this purported subpoena is defective because it did not  comply with committee rules providing that:   At least two business days before issuing any subpoena, the Chair  shall consult with the Ranking Member, and the Chair shall provide a  full copy of the proposed subpoena.   While, in this instance, the chairman did provide me, as ranking  member, with a copy of a proposed subpoena on March 19, the document  the chairman issued on March 22 was substantively and materially  different from the document that was shared on March 19, in abrogation  of committee rules.   My parliamentary inquiry is whether these circumstances would have  any bearing on consideration of this resolution, H. Res. 970, and,  absent that, whether the defective nature would have any bearing on any  future attempts by the House to enforce the supposed subpoena?    Could the Chair repeat that last sentence? I couldn't  hear.    Mr. Speaker, in that case I will include in the Record a  copy of a letter that I sent to the chair dated June 21, 2018,  detailing the facts and background concerning the defective nature of  the subpoena purportedly issued on March 22.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 21, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I am writing to inform you that       the subpoena you issued to the Department of Justice on March       22, 2018 does not comply with Committee rules and is       therefore not a valid subpoena under the Rules of the House.        On March 22, 2018, you issued a subpoena to the Department       of Justice ``seeking documents related to [the Majority's]       ongoing investigation regarding charging decisions in the       investigation surrounding former Secretary Clinton's private       email server in 2016.'' House Republicans have repeatedly       accused Department officials of failing to comply with this       subpoena--and even threatened some of those officials with       contempt of Congress and impeachment proceedings.        As you know, if you choose to issue a subpoena       unilaterally--instead of putting the proposed subpoena to a       vote of the Committee--our rules require you to ``consult''       with me in advance. Specifically:        At least two business days before issuing any subpoena       pursuant to subsection (a), the Chair shall consult with the       Ranking Member regarding the authorization and issuance of       such subpoena, and the Chair shall provide a full copy of the       proposed subpoena, including any proposed document schedule,       at that time.        As we discussed on at least one other occasion, our       ``consultation'' is not complete--and the subpoena may not       issue--until you have transmitted a full copy of the subpoena       to my office.        On March 19, 2018, we met to discuss a subpoena for       documents related to the Department of Justice's handling of       the Clinton investigation. At that time, you provided me with       a document that describes 14 different categories of       information sought from the Department and the FBI. I have       enclosed a copy of this document for your convenience.        The subpoena you issued on March 22 is substantively and       materially different from the document you shared with me on       March 19. The subpoena requests nine categories of       information, not 14. It is also significantly different in       scope than the document you shared with me at our meeting.       Our Committee rules prevent the Majority from making       substantive changes to a proposed subpoena without       appropriate notice to the Minority. Because you did not       provide me with a copy of the subpoena that actually issued,       the subpoena that you eventually issued would be       unenforceable as a matter of law.        Although you certainly have the option to issue another       unilateral subpoena to cure this defect, I would urge you to       consider a more bipartisan response. As you know, we recently       changed our rules to give the Chairman the option of issuing       a subpoena without first putting the proposal to a vote of       the Committee. We agreed to this change based largely on your       guarantee that you would only use the unilateral subpoena       power ``during periods of recess'' or in ``extraordinary       circumstances.'' This Congress, you have proposed to issue a       unilateral subpoena on three occasions. I have objected each       time, on the grounds that the circumstances did not meet your       own standard and that the full Committee should have an       opportunity to debate the wisdom of using our time and       resources in this manner. I am similarly concerned about your       refusal to include Democrats in discussions of what documents       the Committee should request and which individuals should be       interviewed and when meeting with Department of Justice       officials to negotiate how they will respond to Committee       requests.        On a broader level, I hope that this defective subpoena       will give the Majority an opportunity to reassess its       priorities. I believe that other work should take precedence       over this largely unproductive investigation. Foreign       adversaries continue to threaten our elections, the President       has created an immigration crisis at our borders, gun       violence plagues our schools and our homes, and the Trump       Administration continues to disregard even the most basic       ethics rules. Surely any one of these topics, each one       squarely within the Committee's jurisdiction, is more       important than the unending hunt for Hillary Clinton's email.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler.        Enclosures.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 22, 2018.      Hon. Rod J. Rosenstein,      Deputy Attorney General,      U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Rosenstein: Four months have passed since Chairman       Gowdy and I, along  [[Page H5831]]       with Representatives Jordan, Meadows, Buck, and Ratcliffe,       wrote you seeking documents related to our ongoing       investigation regarding charging decisions in the       investigation surrounding former Secretary Clinton's private       email server in 2016. To date, the Department has only       produced a fraction of the documents that have been       requested. In addition, in early February, I wrote the       Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation seeking       documents related to potential abuses of the Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Act. No documents have been       provided to the Committee in response to this request.        Given the Department's ongoing delays in producing these       documents, I am left with no choice but to issue the enclosed       subpoena to compel production of these documents.        Moreover, since our requests for documents related to the       Clinton email server investigation were made, it has come to       light that the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility       recommended the dismissal of former FBI Deputy Director       Andrew McCabe. This recommendation appears to be based, at       least in part, on events related to the investigation       surrounding former Secretary Clinton's private email server.       Accordingly, the subpoena additionally covers all documents       and communications relied upon by FBI's Office of       Professional Responsibility in reaching its decision to       recommend the dismissal of former Deputy Director McCabe.        Thank you for your prompt attention to this important       matter. If any part of the production has been designated as       classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526, please contact       Committee majority staff so that arrangements may be made to       ensure that the documents are handled appropriately within       the House.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.        Enclosure.  [[Page H5832]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28JN18.001         [[Page H5833]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH28JN18.002         [[Page H5834]]                                        Schedule         In accordance with the attached instructions for responding       to Judiciary Committee document requests, you are required to       produce the following documents in unredacted form:        1. All documents and communications provided to or obtained       by the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector       General (OIG) regarding the FBI's decision-making with       respect to the FBI's investigation of former Secretary       Clinton's private email server;        2. Documents sufficient to show the names, titles, and       business addresses of all personnel who participated in       deliberations concerning the decision whether to charge       Clinton. In lieu of documents, you may provide a list of the       requested information;        3. The document referenced by James Rybicki during his       January 18, 2018 interview with the Committee referring or       relating to court cases or judicial decisions used in       considering, justifying, or communicating possible charges       against, or decisions not to charge, Clinton;        4. All documents and communications relied upon by FBI's       Office of Professional Responsibility in reaching its       decision to recommend the dismissal of former FBI Deputy       Director Andrew McCabe;        5. All documents and communications with the Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Court (``FISC'') referring or       relating to any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act       (``FISA'') applications associated with Carter Page or       individuals on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign       or part of the Trump administration;        6. All documents and communications referring or relating       to FISC hearings and deliberations, including any court       transcripts, related to any FISA applications associated with       Carter Page or the Trump campaign or Trump administration;        7. All documents and communications referring or relating       to internal Department of Justice or FBI management requests       to review, scrub, report on, or analyze any reporting of FISA       collection involving, or coverage mentioning, the Trump       campaign or Trump administration;        8. All documents and communications referring or relating       to defensive briefings provided by the Department of Justice       or FBI to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Clinton or       President Trump; and,        9. All documents and communications referring or relating       to proposed, recommended, or actual FISA coverage on the       Clinton Foundation or persons associated or in communication       with the Clinton Foundation.            Responding to Judiciary Committee Document Requests         In responding to the document request, please apply the       instructions and definitions set forth below:                                 INSTRUCTIONS         1. In complying with this request, you should produce all       responsive documents in unredacted form that are in your       possession, custody, or control or otherwise available to       you, regardless of whether the documents are possessed       directly by you.        2. Documents responsive to the request should not be       destroyed, modified, removed, transferred, or otherwise made       inaccessible to the Committee.        3. In the event that any entity, organization, or       individual named in the request has been, or is currently,       known by any other name, the request should be read also to       include such other names under that alternative       identification.        4. Each document should be produced in a form that may be       copied by standard copying machines.        5. When you produce documents, you should identify the       paragraph(s) and/or clause(s) in the Committee's request to       which the document responds.        6. Documents produced pursuant to this request should be       produced in the order in which they appear in your files and       should not be rearranged. Any documents that are stapled,       clipped, or otherwise fastened together should not be       separated. Documents produced in response to this request       should be produced together with copies of file labels,       dividers, or identifying markers with which they were       associated when this request was issued. Indicate the office       or division and person from whose files each document was       produced.        7. Each folder and box should be numbered, and a       description of the contents of each folder and box, including       the paragraph(s) and/or clause(s) of the request to which the       documents are responsive, should be provided in an       accompanying index.        8. Responsive documents must be produced regardless of       whether any other person or entity possesses non-identical or       identical copies of the same document.        9. The Committee requests electronic documents in addition       to paper productions. If any of the requested information is       available in machine-readable or electronic form (such as on       a computer server, hard drive, CD, DVD, back up tape, or       removable computer media such as thumb drives, flash drives,       memory cards, and external hard drives), you should       immediately consult with Committee majority staff to       determine the appropriate format in which to produce the       information. Documents produced in electronic format should       be organized, identified, and indexed electronically in a       manner comparable to the organizational structure called for       in (6) and (7) above.        10. If any document responsive to this request was, but no       longer is, in your possession, custody, or control, or has       been placed into the possession, custody, or control of any       third party and cannot be provided in response to this       request, you should identify the document (stating its date,       author, subject, and recipients) and explain the       circumstances under which the document ceased to be in your       possession, custody, or control, or was placed in the       possession, custody, or control of a third party.        11. If any document responsive to this request was, but no       longer is, in your possession, custody, or control, state:        a) how the document was disposed of;        b) the name, current address, and telephone number of the       person who currently has possession, custody, or control over       the document;        c) the date of disposition; and        d) the name, current address, and telephone number of each       person who authorized said disposition or who had or has       knowledge of said disposition.        12. If any document responsive to this request cannot be       located, describe with particularity the efforts made to       locate the document and the specific reason for its       disappearance, destruction, or unavailability.        13. If a date or other descriptive detail set forth in this       request referring to a document, communication, meeting, or       other event is inaccurate, but the actual date or other       descriptive detail is known to you or is otherwise apparent       from the context of the request, you should produce all       documents that would be responsive as if the date or other       descriptive detail were correct.        14. The request is continuing in nature and applies to any       newly discovered document, regardless of the date of its       creation. Any document not produced because it has not been       located or discovered by the return date should be produced       immediately upon location or discovery subsequent thereto.        15. All documents should be Bates-stamped sequentially and       produced sequentially. In a cover letter to accompany your       response, you should include a total page count for the       entire production, including both hard copy and electronic       documents.        16. Two sets of the documents should be delivered to the       Committee, one set to the majority staff in Room 2138 of the       Rayburn House Office Building and one set to the minority       staff in Room 2142 of the Rayburn House Office Building. You       should consult with Committee majority staff regarding the       method of delivery prior to sending any materials.        17. In the event that a responsive document is withheld on       any basis, including a claim of privilege, you should provide       a log containing the following information concerning every       such document: (a) the reason the document is not being       produced; (b) the type of document; (c) the general subject       matter; (d) the date, author, and addressee; (e) the       relationship of the author and addressee to each other; and       (f) any other description necessary to identify the document       and to explain the basis for not producing the document. If a       claimed privilege applies to only a portion of any document,       that portion only should be withheld and the remainder of the       document should be produced. As used herein, ``claim of       privilege'' includes, but is not limited to, any claim that a       document either may or must be withheld from production       pursuant to any statute, rule, or regulation.        (a) Any objections or claims of privilege are waived if you       fail to provide an explanation of why full compliance is not       possible and a log identifying with specificity the ground(s)       for withholding each withheld document prior to the request       compliance date.        (b) In complying with the request, be apprised that (unless       otherwise determined by the Committee) the Committee does not       recognize: any purported non-disclosure privileges associated       with the common law including, but not limited to, the       deliberative-process privilege, the attorney-client       privilege, and attorney work product protections; any       purported privileges or protections from disclosure under the       Freedom of Information Act; or any purported contractual       privileges, such as non-disclosure agreements.        (c) Any assertion by a request recipient of any such non-      constitutional legal bases for withholding documents or other       materials shall be of no legal force and effect and shall not       provide a justification for such withholding or refusal,       unless and only to the extent that the Committee (or the       chair of the Committee, if authorized) has consented to       recognize the assertion as valid.        18. If the request cannot be complied with in full, it       should be complied with to the extent possible, which should       include an explanation of why full compliance is not       possible.        19. Upon completion of the document production, you must       submit a written certification, signed by you or your       counsel, stating that: (1) a diligent search has been       completed of all documents in your possession, custody, or       control which reasonably could contain responsive documents;       (2) documents responsive to the request have not been       destroyed, modified, removed, transferred, or otherwise made       inaccessible to the Committee since the date of receiving the       Committee's request or in anticipation of receiving the       Committee's request, and (3) all documents identified during       the search that are responsive have been produced to the       Committee, identified in a log provided to the Committee, as       described in (17) above, or identified as provided in (10),       (11), or (12) above.        20. When representing a witness or entity before the       Committee in response to a document request or request for       transcribed  [[Page H5835]]       interview, counsel for the witness or entity must promptly       submit to the Committee a notice of appearance specifying the       following: (a) counsel's name, firm or organization, and       contact information; and (b) each client represented by the       counsel in connection with the proceeding. Submission of a       notice of appearance constitutes acknowledgement that counsel       is authorized to accept service of process by the Committee       on behalf of such client(s) and that counsel is bound by and       agrees to comply with all applicable House and Committee       rules and regulations.

The terms ``referring'' or ``relating,'' with respect to       any given subject, mean anything that constitutes, contains,       embodies, reflects, identifies, states, refers to, deals       with, or is in any manner whatsoever pertinent to that       subject.        7. The terms ``you'' or ``your'' means and refers to you as       a natural person and the United States and any of its       agencies, offices, subdivisions, entities, officials,       administrators, employees, attorneys, agents, advisors,       consultants, staff, contractors, or any other persons acting       on your behalf or under your control or direction; and       includes any other person(s) defined in the document request       letter.        8. The term ``administration'' means and refers to any       department, agency, division, office, subdivision, entity,       official, administrator, employee, attorney, agent, advisor,       consultant, staff, or any other person acting on behalf or       under the control or direction of the Executive Branch.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on  Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the vice ranking member of the Judiciary  Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished ranking member of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Democratic leader of the  House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close. I am not going to repeat what I said before. I will summarize.   The request being made here is for information that the Department of  Justice cannot provide because it relates to an ongoing criminal  investigation and because some of it would identify informants. The  motive is probably simply to politically embarrass the Department and  provide a means of embarrassing and defaming the special prosecutor and  the people associated with him in the Department.   I will read from a letter that the Deputy Attorney General sent to  Senator Grassley and the Speaker of the House yesterday.   He quotes the following: ``Throughout American history, wise  legislators have worked with Department officials to limit oversight  requests in order to respect the Department's duty to protect national  security, preserve personal privacy, and insulate investigations from  the appearance of interference. For instance, the Department sent a  letter to a House committee chair in 2000 describing the Department's  policies on responding to congressional oversight requests. The letter  explains:''--I am now quoting from the 2000 letter--``Such inquiries  inescapably create the risk that the public and the courts will  perceive political and congressional influence over law enforcement and  litigation decisions. Such inquiries also often seek records and other  information that our responsibilities for these matters preclude us  from disclosing.''   That is the end of the quote from the 2000 letter.   ``The letter quotes President Ronald Reagan, who wrote that a  `tradition of accommodation should continue as the primary means of  resolving conflicts between the branches.' Regardless of whether an  interbranch information request is made by letter or subpoena, the  relationship between the branches gives rise to `an implicit  constitutional mandate,' to `reach an accommodation short of full-scale  confrontation.'''--quote from President Reagan.   ``It must not be the case that the Department is required to risk  damage to reputations, put cases and lives at risk, and invite  political interference by opening sensitive files to congressional  staff without restriction.''--from the letter from Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein.   That is exactly what these requests would do. They would risk damage  to reputations, put cases and lives at risk--already two people, two  informants, have had their identities outed--and invite political  interference by opening sensitive files to congressional staff without  restriction.   We ought to let the special counsel complete his work without  hindrance. We ought to see whatever the special counsel finds, react to  it as appropriate, and perhaps hold hearings into the findings when we  see them. All we know about the special counsel so far--unlike all the  allegations against him and his investigation, it is a witch hunt, it  is this, and it is that. All we really know is that there are 20  indictments, five guilty pleas, and we know what he has pleaded in  court.    There have been leaks, so you can't really say anything about the  investigation other than, in this time period, they have already gotten  20 indictments, five guilty pleas, including from some of the closest  people to the President in his administration and in his campaign. We  will see where it goes from there.   These requests are an attempt to sabotage the investigation, and we  should not go along with it.  [[Page H5843]]                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                           Office of the Deputy Attorney General,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2018.      Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley: Thank you for your letter of May       17, 2018, and for meeting with me last Thursday, along with       Ranking Member Feinstein. I appreciate your commitment to       allow the Special Counsel investigation ``to follow the facts       wherever they lead without any improper outside       interference.''        I know that you and Ranking Member Feinstein share my       commitment to protecting the integrity of federal       investigations. Agents and prosecutors must base each       decision on neutral standards and credible evidence. As we       seek to do in all cases, the Department of Justice will       complete the Special Counsel investigation as promptly as is       feasible. When the investigation is finished, I anticipate       that any objective and nonpartisan review will conclude that       the Department consistently sought to make reasonable       decisions and to comply with applicable laws, regulations,       policies, and practices.        Legal, ethical, and policy obligations often prevent       prosecutors from responding to criticism. As Attorney General       Robert Jackson observed in 1940, prosecutors have a duty ``to       face any temporary criticism'' and ``maintain a       dispassionate, disinterested, and impartial enforcement of       the law.'' The Inspector General's report addresses the       consequences of trying to preempt criticism by disregarding       principles that prohibit public statements, leaks to the       media, and improper disclosures to the Congress about       criminal investigations. Department officials must defend       those principles in order to ensure that all investigations       remain independent of partisan politics. We do not compete to       win the hourly news cycle.                  Special Counsel Appointment and Authority         Your May 17 letter asks a series of questions concerning       the scope of the Special Counsel's authority. The current       Special Counsel differs from an ``independent counsel'' and       some previous ``special counsels,'' because Special Counsel       Mueller was appointed by the Department of Justice and       remains subject to ongoing supervision.        The Attorney General retains the general authority to       designate or name individuals as ``special counsels'' to       conduct investigations or prosecutions of particular matters       or individuals on behalf of the United States. Under       regulations issued by the Attorney General in 1999, the       Attorney General may appoint a ``special counsel'' from       outside of the Department of Justice who acts as a special       employee of the Department of Justice under the direction of       the Attorney General. The Attorney General, however, may also       appoint an individual as a special counsel, and may invest       that individual with a greater degree of independence and       autonomy to conduct investigations and prosecutions,       regardless of any ``special counsel'' regulations, as       Attorneys General did in 1973, 1994, and 2003.        What a prosecutor is called--including ``independent'' or       ``special''--is a separate question from whether that       prosecutor is subject to supervision by the Attorney General.       Under the terms of his appointment, both by statute and by       regulation, Special Counsel Mueller remains accountable like       every other subordinate Department official.        Special Counsels have been appointed for a variety of       matters throughout history. For example, Attorney General       William Barr appointed three Special Counsels from outside       the Department of Justice during his 14-month tenure: (1)       Nicholas Bua to investigate an array of allegations related       to the ``Inslaw Affair,'' on November 7, 1991; (2) Malcolm       Wilkey to investigate the House Bank controversy, on March       20, 1992; and (3) Frederick Lacey to investigate the Bush       Administration's handling of a bank fraud case involving       loans to Iraq, on October 17, 1992.        Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Robert Fiske as a       Special Counsel to investigate the Whitewater land deal and       other matters on January 20, 1994. Mr. Fiske explained that       the appointment order was ``deliberately drafted broadly . .       . to give me total authority to look into all appropriate       matters relating to the events . . . .'' For example, Mr.       Fiske investigated a suicide in order to determine whether it       might involve a crime related to his investigation--it did       not--and prosecuted a fraud case with no obvious connection       to Whitewater. Federal agents and prosecutors already were       investigating crimes when Mr. Fiske was appointed, but the       appointment order did not mention the crimes. When asked       about supervision of Mr. Fiske, Attorney General Reno said,       ``I do not expect him to report to me, . . . and I do not       expect to monitor him.'' That is not true of Special Counsel       Mueller.        Then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey took a different       approach in 2003, when he invoked his authority as Acting       Attorney General to appoint Patrick Fitzgerald as a special       prosecutor to investigate the Valerie Plame matter. Mr. Comey       did not make that appointment under the Department's Special       Counsel regulation. Instead, he delegated to the special       prosecutor ``all the authority of the Attorney General . . .       independent of the supervision or control of any officer of       the Department.'' Mr. Comey followed up with a letter       reinforcing that his delegation was ``plenary.'' That is not       true of Special Counsel Mueller's appointment.        The Ethics in Government Act allowed several statutory       Independent Counsels to be appointed in the absence of       probable cause that a crime had occurred, and some of those       appointments were not publicized. Even under the Act, when       prosecutors were under much less supervision than Special       Counsels are under the Department's regulation, Congress did       not interfere in the investigations. The statute required the       Independent Counsel to submit an annual report to the       Congress, but it allowed him to ``omit any matter that in the       judgment of the independent counsel should be kept       confidential.''        Because the Attorney General's authority over Independent       Counsels was limited, the judicial orders appointing them       were a principal way to cabin their jurisdiction.       Nonetheless, appointments often were made with ``a broadly       worded charter.'' For example, the appointment order for       Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr gave him       authority to investigate ``whether any individuals or       entities have committed a violation of any federal criminal       law . . . relating in any way to James B. McDougal's,       President William Jefferson Clinton's, or Mrs. Hillary Rodham       Clinton's relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan       Assn., Whitewater Development Corp., or Capital Management       Services Inc.'' McDougal owned and managed Madison Guaranty,       so that charter provided vast discretion to investigate       essentially any crime committed by any person that involved       the savings and loan association. The Independent Counsel       identified other unrelated matters of investigative interest,       and he obtained orders from the court expanding his mandate,       including ``Travelgate,'' ``Filegate,'' and the Lewinsky       matter. The Attorney General did not supervise or control the       Independent Counsel's decisions about which crimes and       subjects to investigate within his broad mandates, or which       persons to prosecute.        When the Independent Counsel statute expired, the       Department adopted the current Special Counsel regulation as       an internal policy concerning the appointment and management       of Special Counsels. The regulation provides for       congressional notification when an appointment is made and       when it concludes. At the conclusion of the investigation, it       requires notification to Congress of instances when the       Attorney General concluded that a proposed action by the       Special Counsel should not be pursued. The regulation       contemplates ongoing consultation with Department components       and continuing oversight by the Attorney General (or the       Acting Attorney General), who remains accountable as in all       other cases handled by the Department of Justice. The       regulation achieves the objective of conducting an       independent investigation while following normal Department       policies, including supervision by a Senate-confirmed       officer.        There is no statutory requirement to identify criminal       violations before appointing a Special Counsel from outside       the Department, and there is no requirement to publicize       suspected violations in the appointment order under the       Special Counsel regulation. Only one previous Special Counsel       was appointed under the current regulation: John Danforth, to       investigate the Waco matter, on September 9, 1999. As with       Special Counsel Mueller, Mr. Danforth's appointment order did       not publicly specify a crime or identify anyone as a subject.        Special Counsel Mueller's Appointment and Delegated Authority         I determined that the appointment of Special Counsel       Mueller to take charge of criminal matters that were already       under investigation by federal agents and prosecutors was       warranted under the Special Counsel regulation. The       appointment order mentions 28 C.F.R. 600.4 to 600.10 because       they bear on the authority and duties of the Special Counsel.       The public order did not identify the crimes or subjects       because such publicity would be wrong and unfair, just as it       would have been wrong and unfair to reveal that information       prior to Special Counsel's appointment, and just as it would       be wrong and unfair in other cases handled by a U.S. Attorney       or Assistant Attorney General.        So long as the Attorney General or the Acting Attorney       General remains accountable, there is federal statutory and       regulatory authority to assign matters to a Special Counsel,       just as the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General       (even when the Attorney General is not recused) have       authority to assign matters to an Acting U.S. Attorney or any       other Department official. The U.S. District Court for the       District of Columbia recognized as much in its opinion in       Manafort v. United States.        When Special Counsel Mueller was appointed, he received       comprehensive briefings about the relevant allegations and       documents that described them in considerable detail, as with       previous special counsel appointments. Some of the FBI agents       who were investigating those matters continued to do so. The       Department assigned a team of career and non-career officials       to provide supervision and assist the Acting Attorney General       in determining which leads should be handled by the Special       Counsel and which by other Department prosecutors, and to       review any proposed indictments in conjunction with       Department components that ordinarily would review them.        The regulation states that the Special Counsel has the       powers and authority of a  [[Page H5844]]       U.S. Attorney (who may or may not be Senate-confirmed) and       must follow Department policies and procedures. Under those       policies and procedures, the Department should reveal       information about a criminal investigation only when it is       necessary to assist the criminal investigation or to protect       public safety.        In August 2017, Special Counsel Mueller received a written       internal memorandum from the Acting Attorney General. The       memorandum eliminated the ability of any subject, target, or       defendant to argue that the Special Counsel lacked delegated       authority under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 515 to represent the United       States. The names of the subjects were already in Department       files, but we did not publicly disclose them because to do so       would violate the Department's confidentiality policies.        Many of the questions raised in your letter concern the       distinction between a counterintelligence investigation and a       criminal investigation. The primary goal of a       counterintelligence investigation is to protect against       national security threats by, among other things, collecting       intelligence information and disrupting foreign influence       operations. The goal of a criminal investigation is to       determine whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute a       criminal suspect in federal court. There was a ``wall''       between the two prior to September 11, 2001. There is no       longer a wall, but agents and prosecutors are mindful that       counterintelligence investigations may be broader than any       criminal prosecutions that they generate.        The public announcement of the Special Counsel's       appointment purposefully included no details beyond what       Director Comey had disclosed at a public House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on March 20, 2017.       Director Comey revealed that:       the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is       investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere       in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes       investigating the nature of any links between individuals       associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian       government, and whether there was any coordination between       the campaign and Russia's efforts. As with any       counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an       assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Because it       is an open, ongoing investigation, and is classified, I       cannot say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we       are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we       have taken the extraordinary step . . . of briefing this       Congress's leaders, including the leaders of this Committee,       in a classified setting, in detail about the investigation.         As is now publicly known, the Department of Justice and the       FBI were conducting several investigations with potential       relevance to Russian interference in the 2016 election when       Special Counsel Mueller was appointed in May 2017. The public       order explained that the Special Counsel will ``ensure a full       and thorough investigation of the Russian government's       efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.''       Special Counsel Mueller is authorized to investigate       potential criminal offenses. Counterintelligence       investigations involving any current or future Russian       election interference are not the Special Counsel's       responsibility.                       Congressional Oversight Requests         Department of Justice and FBI personnel are working       diligently and in good faith to provide an unprecedented       level of congressional access to information that members of       Congress believe may be relevant. Our responses to the many       related and overlapping congressional inquiries are       consistent with longstanding best practices. We respond as       quickly as possible to the inquiries and accommodate requests       when possible. We cannot fulfill requests that would       compromise the independence and integrity of investigations,       jeopardize intelligence sources and methods, or create the       appearance of political interference. We need to follow the       rules.        In 2016 and 2017, then-Director Comey made disclosures to       the public and to Congress that he has acknowledged would not       have been appropriate under regular order. He maintains that       his 2016 statements to the public and to the Congress about       the Hillary Clinton email investigation were justified by       unique circumstances comparable to a ``500-year flood.'' He       further believes that his 2017 disclosures about the       investigation of alleged links between the Russian government       agents who interfered in the election and persons associated       with the Trump campaign were an ``extraordinary step''       justified by ``unusual circumstances.''        It is important for the Department of Justice to follow       established policies and procedures, especially when the       stakes are high. It may seem tempting to depart from       Department policies and traditions in an effort to deflect       short-term criticism, but such deviations ultimately may       cause a loss of public confidence in the even-handed       administration of justice. We should be most on guard when we       believe that our own uncomfortable present circumstances       justify ignoring timeless principles respected by our       predecessors. I urge you and your colleagues to support us in       following the rules.        At my confirmation hearing, I promised that Department       employees would conduct ourselves ``with deep respect for the       institution and employees of the Department of Justice, with       acute understanding of our role in the constitutional       structure, and with profound appreciation of our weighty       responsibilities. My commitment to the Department's       longstanding traditions carries with it an obligation to       ensure that we keep pending law enforcement matters separate       from the sphere of politics and that there be no perception       that our law enforcement decisions are influenced by partisan       politics or pressure from legislators.        Regardless of political affiliation, thoughtful former       Department leaders recognize that departures from our       confidentiality policies pose an extraordinary threat to the       Department's independence and integrity. Former Deputy       Attorneys General Larry Thompson and Jamie Gorelick explained       that the Department of Justice ``operates under long-standing       and well-established traditions limiting disclosure of       ongoing investigations to the public and even to Congress. .       . . These traditions protect the integrity of the department.       . . .'' Violating those policies and disclosing information       about criminal investigations constitutes ``real-time, raw-      take transparency taken to its illogical limit, a kind of       reality TV of federal criminal investigation'' that is       ``antithetical to the interests of justice.''        Punishing wrongdoers through judicial proceedings is only       one part of the Department's mission. We also have a duty to       prevent the disclosure of information that would unfairly       tarnish people who are not charged with crimes. In 1941,       Attorney General Robert Jackson explained that disclosing       information about federal investigations to Congress could       cause ``the grossest kind of injustice to innocent       individuals,'' and create ``serious prejudice to the future       usefulness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.'' It is       useful to quote at length from the Attorney General's letter:         [W]e have made extraordinary efforts to see that the       results of counterespionage activities and intelligence       activities of this Department involving those elements are       kept within the fewest possible hands. A catalogue of persons       under investigation or suspicion, and what we know about       them, would be of inestimable service to foreign agencies;       and information which could be so used cannot be too closely       guarded.        Moreover, disclosure of the reports would be of serious       prejudice to the future usefulness of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation. As you probably know, much of this information       is given in confidence and can only be obtained upon pledge       not to disclose its sources. A disclosure of the sources       would embarrass informants--sometimes in their employment,       sometimes in their social relations, and in extreme cases       might even endanger their lives. We regard the keeping of       faith with confidential informants as an indispensable       condition of future efficiency.        Disclosure of information contained in the reports might       also be the grossest kind of injustice to innocent       individuals. Investigative reports include leads and       suspicions, and sometimes even the statements of malicious or       misinformed people. Even though later and more complete       reports exonerate the individuals, the use of particular or       selected reports might constitute the grossest injustice, and       we all know that a correction never catches up with an       accusation.        In concluding that the public interest does not permit       general access to Federal Bureau of Investigation reports for       information by the many congressional committees who from       time to time ask it, I am following the conclusions reached       by a long line of distinguished predecessors in this office       who have uniformly taken the same view. . . .        Since the beginning of the Government, the executive branch       has from time to time been confronted with the unpleasant       duty of declining to furnish to the Congress and to the       courts information which it has acquired and which is       necessary to it in the administration of statutes.         Attorney General Jackson's letter mentioned that the       pending congressional request was ``one of the many made by       congressional committees.'' He understood the profoundly       harmful consequences of proceeding down a road that would       empower congressional members and staffers to choose which       federal investigations should be publicized.        Congressional leaders respected Attorney General Jackson's       obligation to do the job he swore an oath to perform--``well       and faithfully execute the duties of the office'' --by       preserving the independence of federal law enforcement and       protecting it from political influence. President Eisenhower       later agreed, finding that ``it is essential to the       successful working of our system that the persons entrusted       with power in any of the three great branches of government       shall not encroach upon the authority confided to the       others.''        Requiring the Department of Justice to disclose details       about criminal investigations would constitute a dangerous       departure from important principles. Criminal prosecutions       should be relatively transparent--because the public should       know the grounds for finding a citizen guilty of criminal       offenses and imposing punishment--but criminal investigations       emphatically are not supposed to be transparent. In fact,       disclosing uncharged allegations against American citizens       without a law-enforcement need is considered to be a       violation of a prosecutor's trust. As stated in the       Department's Principles of Federal Prosecution:        In all public filings and proceedings, federal prosecutors       should remain sensitive to the privacy and reputation       interests of uncharged third-parties. In the context of       public plea and sentencing proceedings, this  [[Page H5845]]       means that, in the absence of some significant justification,       it is not appropriate to identify (either by name or       unnecessarily-specific description), or cause a defendant to       identify, a third-party wrongdoer unless that party has been       officially charged with the misconduct at issue. In the       unusual instance where identification of an uncharged third-      party wrongdoer during a plea or sentencing hearing is       justified, the express approval of the United States Attorney       and the appropriate Assistant Attorney General should be       obtained prior to the hearing absent exigent circumstances. .       . . In other less predictable contexts, federal prosecutors       should strive to avoid unnecessary public references to       wrongdoing by uncharged third-parties. With respect to bills       of particulars that identify unindicted co-conspirators,       prosecutors generally should seek leave to file such       documents under seal. Prosecutors shall comply, however, with       any court order directing the public filing of a bill of       particulars.        As a series of cases makes clear, there is ordinarily ``no       legitimate governmental interest served'' by the government's       public allegation of wrongdoing by an uncharged party, and       this is true ``[r]egardless of what criminal charges may . .       . b[e] contemplated by the Assistant United States Attorney       against the [third-party] for the future.'' In re Smith, 656       F.2d 1101, 1106-07 (5th Cir. 1981). Courts have applied this       reasoning to preclude the public identification of unindicted       third-party wrongdoers in plea hearings, sentencing       memoranda, and other government pleadings. . . .        In most cases, any legitimate governmental interest in       referring to uncharged third-party wrongdoers can be advanced       through means other than those condemned in this line of       cases. For example, in those cases where the offense to which       a defendant is pleading guilty requires as an element that a       third-party have a particular status (e.g., 18 U.S.C.       203(a)(2)), the third-party can usually be referred to       generically (``a Member of Congress''), rather than       identified specifically (``Senator X''), at the defendant's       plea hearing. Similarly, when the defendant engaged in joint       criminal conduct with others, generic references (``another       individual'') to the uncharged third-party wrongdoers can be       used when describing the factual basis for the defendant's       guilty plea.        Even when we file federal charges, Department policy       strongly counsels us not to implicate by name any person who       is not officially charged with misconduct.        The recent Inspector General report emphasizes the solemn       duty of federal law enforcement officials to defend the       confidentiality of federal investigations. I hope you and       your colleagues in the Senate and House will support us in       restoring those principles. The Department of Justice must       not proceed along the unhappy road to being perceived as a       partisan actor, deciding what information to reveal and what       information to conceal based on the expected impact on the       personal or political interests of its temporary leaders and       congressional allies.        The current investigation of election interference is       important, but there are also thousands of other important       investigations pending in the Department of Justice and the       FBI. Every investigation is important to the persons whose       reputations may be irreparably damaged or whose careers may       be permanently disrupted. No matter who an investigation       involves--an ordinary citizen, a local or state politician, a       campaign official, a foreign agent, or an officer of the       federal legislative, executive, or judicial branch--agents       and prosecutors are obligated to protect its confidentiality       and preserve the Department's independence from political       influence.        Throughout American history, wise legislators have worked       with Department officials to limit oversight requests in       order to respect the Department's duty to protect national       security, preserve personal privacy, and insulate       investigations from the appearance of interference. For       instance, the Department sent a letter to a House committee       chair in 2000, describing the Department's policies on       responding to congressional oversight requests. The letter       explains:        Such inquiries inescapably create the risk that the public       and the courts will perceive undue political and       Congressional influence over law enforcement and litigation       decisions. Such inquiries also often seek records and other       information that our responsibilities for these matters       preclude us from disclosing.        The letter quotes President Ronald Reagan, who wrote that a       ``tradition of accommodation should continue as the primary       means of resolving conflicts between the Branches.''       Regardless of whether an inter-branch information request is       made by letter or subpoena, the relationship between the       branches gives rise to ``an implicit constitutional       mandate,'' to ``reach an accommodation short of full-scale       confrontation.'' It must not be the case that the Department       is required to risk damage to reputations, put cases and       lives at risk, and invite political interference by opening       sensitive files to congressional staff without restriction.        Tension between Congress's oversight interests and the       Department's solemn responsibility to protect law enforcement       information is unavoidable. In 1989, then-Assistant Attorney       General William Barr wrote that misunderstandings often arise       because congressional investigations, by their nature, are       usually adversarial and unbounded by the rules of evidence.       In another 1989 opinion, the Department's Office of Legal       Counsel explained that ``the executive branch has . . .       consistently refused to provide confidential information'' to       ``congressional committees with respect to open cases.''        Sometimes there is a strong temptation to seek short-term       benefit at the cost of long-term values. But departures from       Department traditions contribute to a loss of public       confidence. We can build public confidence if we stick to the       principle that the prosecutor is ``the servant of the law,       the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape nor       innocence suffer.''        Approval of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Applications         Finally, you asked whether I delegated approval authority       under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Such       approval authority is not delegable beyond the approving       officials designated in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance       Act. FISA affidavits are written and sworn under oath by       career federal agents who verify that they are true and       correct. They are reviewed by investigative agency       supervisors and attorneys, and by Department of Justice       attorneys and supervisors. Before filing, they must be       approved by an intelligence agency leader, usually the FBI       Director, and by either the Attorney General, the Deputy       Attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General for the       National Security Division. In every case, the ultimate       decision on whether to allow surveillance is made by a       federal judge who independently determines whether the       evidence provided under oath by the federal agent meets the       requisite legal standard.                                  Conclusion         I hope that you find this information helpful. I regret       that the many duties of my office preclude me from responding       personally to every congressional inquiry. I am deeply       grateful to have the support of a talented and dedicated team       that understands our obligation to work cooperatively with       the Congress to protect the American people and preserve the       rule of law.            Sincerely,                                                 Rod J. Rosenstein.                                           Deputy Attorney General.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think I made the case clear. I think Mr.  Zeldin has added nothing to the debate that I have to refute.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
