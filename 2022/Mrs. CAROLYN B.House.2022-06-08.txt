 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of the Protecting Our Kids Act.   Today, the victims' families and community members from the mass  shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde appeared before the Oversight Committee  demanding action. These communities have faced unspeakable tragedy.   It is our duty as lawmakers to listen to them and work to build a  world where they will never have to see these horrific events repeated.  This legislation will save countless lives from the violence these  families have had to endure.   We must support every title in this bill, especially title II,  cracking down on interstate gun trafficking. I have spent over a decade  fighting for gun trafficking and straw purchases to be made a Federal  offense. The illegal interstate movement of firearms into New York,  known as the ``Iron Pipeline'' has caused countless firearms to enter  our State unlawfully. Preventing gun trafficking across State lines  should be a bipartisan goal.   As a mother and teacher, I am horrified by these attacks on our  schools, grocery stores, and our communities. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
