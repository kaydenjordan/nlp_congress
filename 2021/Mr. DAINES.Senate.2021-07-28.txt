 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Darrell Hueth of Valley County as Montanan of the Month for  his devotion to the Glasgow community and passion for Montana  agriculture and education.   Darrell has been a staple in Glasgow since his high school football  and basketball days. He went on to become a star athlete for the  Montana State University Bobcats from 1956-1959--``Go Cats!'' During  his time at MSU, Darrell studied agriculture economics.   Darrell brought his athletic experience and agriculture knowledge  back to Glasgow a a teacher and coach. Under his leadership, the  Scotties' football team went undefeated for 2 years and won three State  championships. Darrell also led the Scotties' wrestling team to three  state championships. When he wasn't on the field or in the gym, Darrell  taught consumer economic accounting and bookkeeping, a course that is  crucial for the next generation of Montana ag leaders.   Teachers serve an important role as they shape the minds of young  Montanans and have the opportunity to influence the next generation and  help prepare them for future careers. Montana has a rich legacy of  agriculture, and it is our No. 1 economic driver. There is no doubt  that Darrell's passion for teaching about agriculture helped encourage  young Montanans to pursue careers in this important field.   His educational impact extends beyond the great State of Montana. As  professor emeritus at the University of Maryland's Department of  Agricultural and Resource Economics, Darrell has had many academic  articles, working papers and books published throughout his  professional career.   It is my honor to recognize Darrell for dedicating his life to  education and making a positive impact on young Montanans through  athletics and agricultural studies. Keep up the great work,  Darrell.                            ____________________
