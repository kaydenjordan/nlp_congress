 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the legacy of  David Rudd, who is retiring as the president of the University of  Memphis.   Dr. David Rudd came to the University of Memphis in 2013 as the  provost for the university. He had previously served as the dean of the  College of Social and Behavioral Science and scientific director of the  National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah.   President Rudd succeeded Dr. Shirley Raines as president and Brad  Martin as interim president of the University of Memphis, becoming the  University of Memphis president in 2014.   The University of Memphis has a student population of around 22,000  students, with 17 bachelor's degrees in more than 250 areas of studies,  master's degrees in 54 subjects, doctoral degrees in 26 disciplines,  and graduate certificate programs in 44 areas of study. The University  of Memphis also has one of the finest law schools in the southeast  United States.   No matter your alma mater, one thing most can agree on is that it is  extremely challenging leading a school of higher education today,  especially in the era of COVID.   With that said, the University of Memphis has flourished under David  Rudd's tenure as president. There have been a number of major  accomplishments during this time. Maybe the most significant  achievement during the David Rudd era is the University of Memphis  obtaining the research classification known as R1 by the Carnegie  Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. For the first time  in its history, this puts the University of Memphis in the top tier of  research universities across the Nation.   I asked my friend, Doug Edwards, the chairman of the Board of  Trustees of the University of Memphis, about David Rudd. Doug told me:  ``David Rudd is a transformative leader who has had a profound impact  on the University of Memphis. He has elevated the stature of the  university to that of the second flagship university in Tennessee and a  top-tier research institution.''   Soon Dr. Rudd will take a well-deserved sabbatical from his  leadership and administrative duties. When he comes back to the  University of Memphis in the next year, he will return to teaching and  research as a distinguished professor of psychology and will run the  new Rudd Institute for Veteran and Military Suicide Prevention at the  University of Memphis.    The institute is appropriately named. As a veteran of the Gulf war  and a former Army psychologist, David Rudd is one of the Nation's  leading experts on suicide prevention among our Nation's veterans.   We wish the utmost best to him and his wife, Dr. Loretta Rudd,  herself a distinguished educator and researcher in higher education.   On behalf of the many alumni and residents of the Eighth  Congressional District of Tennessee, Roberta and I congratulate,  salute, and honor David Rudd for his remarkable and outstanding tenure  as the president of the University of Memphis.                            ____________________
