 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from  Massachusetts. He is exactly right, the Department of Defense Medical  Research Program is already spending money on tick-borne diseases. I  believe it is about $5 million this year. It was about $5 million last  year. And as I understand the gentleman's amendment, he would expand  the number of diseases that they can research.   I rise to claim the time in opposition, however, to express concern  about the direction of this program.   Mr. Chairman, I have a chart that indicates the tremendous growth of  dollars going into this congressionally directed medical research  program. It has increased tremendously in recent years, and I would  like to take just a few moments to read some of the diseases that it is  researching: ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, autism, bone marrow failure,  breast cancer, leukemia, muscular dystrophy, epilepsies, food  allergies, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis. There is a couple here that  I can't pronounce, so I won't read. Osteoporosis, ovarian cancer,  Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, Peer-Reviewed Orthopaedic, prostate  cancer, spinal cord injuries, of course, tick-borne disease, tubular  sclerosis, and the list goes on.   And let me just say I certainly support Chairman Tom Cole's attempts  to increase funding for NIH and other sorts of medical research through  the NIH. What I am concerned about is that, increasingly, DOD dollars  are being spent to research diseases that have a tangential, at best,  connection with the Department of Defense and our military. And what  happens is it is taking dollars away from the sorts of injuries and  diseases that our military does confront. This is a trend that is  getting worse each year.   So I don't necessarily oppose the gentleman's amendment. As he points  out, there is research going on here, but it is a trend I do think we  have to be cautious about.   And for that reason, I want to at least raise a warning flag about  the trend to add to the amount of money and the number of diseases  which we are looking to the Department of Defense to help research  diseases which are not related, necessarily, to key functions of the  Department of Defense.   So I appreciate the gentleman letting me express that concern, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Perry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from  Oklahoma and his consistent and strong leadership on this issue. I,  like him, believe that it is time to have a new AUMF, given the change  of circumstances and the evolution of the threats which we face. This  is the third administration that has had to take the 2001 AUMF and  stretch its meaning to encompass all sorts of groups in all sorts of  countries in all sorts of circumstances.   I think, from a legal standpoint, we need to update the AUMF so that  we are consistent with the intent of the Constitution. The even more  important point is the point that the gentleman from Oklahoma made, and  that is that the men and women who are out there risking their lives  deserve to know that they have the full backing of the country that  comes from an AUMF that Congress has passed.   I do want to take exception with one point that is sometimes made.  This House has voted twice to update the 2001 AUMF. It voted in 2011  and in 2012 to update that AUMF to include associated forces. It  happened to be part of the NDAA, even though the Armed Services  Committee is not the committee of jurisdiction. The Foreign Affairs  Committee worked with us, and we passed it twice in the House. It did  not survive contact with the Senate, and although there was some  detention language that came from it, but there had been efforts in  this House to update this language.   But I think the gentleman's approach is exactly right as for the  strategy, the budget that goes with it, and the legal framework we are  to follow, including the AUMF. So I do think it is a methodical,  deliberate process that will take us closer to doing what we ought to  do, and that does include updating this Authorization for Use of  Military Force against terrorist groups as that terrorist threat  evolves.   I commend the gentleman for his amendment and I support it.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), a combat veteran.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I, too, urge adoption of the amendments  en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 440, I  offer additional amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package consists of a  variety of amendments from Members from both sides of the aisle. I  believe that they deserve the support of the House. I recommend  adoption of the en bloc package.   I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5823]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
