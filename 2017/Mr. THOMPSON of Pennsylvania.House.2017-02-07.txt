 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak  about some significant changes for our education system that will help  reestablish local control for our States, for our educators, and, above  all else, for our students.   The Every Student Succeeds Act, or the ESSA, was passed in December  of 2015, with overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and the  Senate. This bill took unilateral power over the public school system  away from the Secretary of Education in Washington and gave it back to  the States and the local education agencies. This change allowed States  to develop their own accountability systems with which to measure the  success of their schools and educators.   However, the final guidance on this law issued by the Obama  administration, in November of 2016, contained a number of provisions  that significantly expanded the law's requirements and violated the  statute's prohibition against overreach by the Secretary. Essentially,  this action ignored congressional intent by attempting to constrain  State decisionmaking.   Mr. Speaker, the very intent of ESSA is to encourage flexibility and  innovation in education, not stifle it. This landmark legislation is  meant to prepare students for the 21st century economy, empower parents  to get out of the bleachers and back into the classrooms, and to allow  our dedicated educators to teach and inspire future generations.   ESSA moved the Federal Government out of the way and gave our  educators flexibility to forget about the ``teach to the test''  environment that had become commonplace in our public schools. Teachers  were, again, allowed to truly teach and not merely focus on meeting the  demands of the Federal Government. Education should serve the needs of  our youth, our children, not the needs of government.   This happened by taking unprecedented steps to rein in the unilateral  power of the United States Secretary of Education and give it back to  the States and local education agencies. It prohibited the Secretary  from adding new requirements to State education plans, being involved  in the peer-review process, and exceeding his or her statutory  authority. It also allows school districts to gradually disentangle  themselves from Common Core without penalty.   Mr. Speaker, what we know is that one-size-fits-all options do not  work. ESSA was passed with the promise that the Education Department's  role would be limited, and that States would be back in control of  education decisions. It is critically important that Congress keep this  promise, and that over-regulation will not continue to negatively  impact our Nation's teachers and our students.   That is why I support the Congressional Review Act resolution in the  House today that disapproves of the Obama administration's requirements  that significantly expanded the Department of Education's purview  regarding accountability and State plans under the Every Student  Succeeds Act.   This Congress must ensure ESSA is enacted as it was intended and be  stripped of any provisions that expand the reach of the Secretary of  Education.   Now, I am looking forward to going back to the original intent of  this bipartisan bill that was approved in both Chambers, and I want all  of our children to love learning from passionate teachers who don't  teach to a test, but they teach to the students. Our kids deserve no  less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on  behalf of the veterans that have made incredible sacrifices for our  country. Our Nation must ensure that they have access to resources that  they need to be successful in civilian life. This certainly includes  access to nutritious food.   Out of the 22 million veterans in the United States, about 1.7  million are in households that currently participate in the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Approximately 46  percent of our veterans are senior citizens, including those who served  in World War II, Korea, or Vietnam.   Veterans of all ages may also have widely varying levels of  disabilities or limitations. Veteran advocacy groups are focused on  obtaining a veteran's earned benefits. Often veterans are not connected  to SNAP right away and they should be.   As the Agriculture Committee prepares to reauthorize SNAP, we must  remain vigilant in our dedication to serve those who have given so much  in defense of our Nation. SNAP cannot solve all of the challenges a  veteran faces, but it can be a vital component of serving eligible  veterans once they return home.                            ____________________
