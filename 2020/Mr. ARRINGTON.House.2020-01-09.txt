 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and fellow Texan,  Ranking Member McCaul, for his strong leadership.   Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to weaponize impeachment to discredit  the President. It is a whole other thing to handcuff our Commander in  Chief and jeopardize the safety of our soldiers and prevent them from  defending themselves.   Thankfully, this is a partisan resolution that is going nowhere. But  it is also disturbing insight into the naive and impotent ideology of  appeasement that invited Russia into Syria, created ISIS in Iraq, and  emboldened Iran to terrorize and brutally murder throughout the Middle  East.   This is not a resolution. This is a retreat, a de facto apology. But  for what? For ridding the world of a brutal terrorist with American  blood on his hands?   If this resolution were to become law, Mr. Speaker, it would be a  death warrant, and not for the worst of terrorists, but for the best of  Americans, our sons and daughters on the battlefield who would be left  defenseless, sitting ducks for a murderous mob of mullahs in Iran and  Iranian-backed militias throughout the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
