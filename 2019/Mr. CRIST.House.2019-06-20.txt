 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens) for her incredible leadership on an issue we should all be  able to agree upon: protecting all of God's creatures, great and small.   When Congress creates laws, we intend for them to be enforced. That  is pretty simple. The Stevens amendment would help the Department of  Justice do exactly that.   This issue is bigger than senseless animal abuse. There is an  established link between animal fighting and abuse and drug trafficking  and gang activity. This means that laws protecting animals also protect  our communities.   This amendment is common sense, and I urge support.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Florida,  Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for her leadership on this  important issue and for working with me and the Florida delegation to  include banning drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico in this  amendment.   I represent most of Pinellas County, Florida, on the Gulf Coast. My  district is surrounded by water on three sides. It is virtually a  peninsula. As you can imagine, this issue is deeply important to me, my  constituents, and all Floridians.   I was Governor of Florida when the Deepwater Horizon exploded in  2010. I saw the tar balls wash up along Florida beaches. I saw the harm  done to Florida's economy and our way of life. I have seen firsthand  the consequences of offshore oil drilling. I hope to never see it  again.   We must protect the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the environmental,  economic, and national security benefits it provides to the region and  to the United States of America. I could not be more proud that the  Florida delegation stands united to do exactly that.   I urge passage of this amendment and the underlying legislation.
