 Mr. President, today, Democrats are forcing a vote to  repeal the administration's sensible rule to disallow bogus charitable  deductions that are designed to circumvent the SALT, or the State and  local tax, deduction cap that was part of the 2017 tax reform bill.   Frankly, I welcome this vote and today's debate. It gives us an  opportunity to review all the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   While drafting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress made a conscious  choice to cap the State and local tax deduction, or SALT, at $10,000.  Doing so allowed us to provide additional tax relief to the middle  class, support families by doubling the child tax credit, and simplify  the Tax Code for filers by nearly doubling the standard deduction.   These changes resulted in the average family of four in my home State  of South Dakota receiving a tax cut of more than $2,000.   In response to this cap, certain high-tax States adopted--what some  would call ``creative'' but what I would call ``bogus''--schemes to try  to circumvent the cap. These so-called charities that these States have  set up are designed solely as an alternative method of paying State and  local taxes so millionaires can shirk their Federal tax obligations. So  the IRS did what the tax law directed. It enacted sensible regulations  to shut down these bogus tax avoidance schemes. But it did so in a  thoughtful manner, carefully considering more than 7,700 comments and  creating a safe harbor for certain donations to avoid unintentionally  discouraging actual charitable giving.   It is ironic that Democrats, who uniformly opposed the middle-class  tax cuts in the new tax law, are now calling for a tax cut for the most  well off Americans. Based on nonpartisan data from the Joint Committee  on Taxation, 94 percent of the benefit from passing this CRA would flow  to taxpayers with incomes of over $200,000. Fifty-two percent of the  benefit would go to those with incomes of over $1 million.   In fact, repealing the SALT cap would result in millionaires  receiving an average tax cut of nearly $60,000, while the average tax  cut for taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 would be  less than $10.   If you put that into perspective, the choice here is very clear.  Today, we have an opportunity to vote no--to vote no--on the Democrats'  proposed tax cut for millionaires.                              Religious Freedom    The Democratic Party has undergone quite an evolution over these past  3 years. Like all political parties, the Democratic Party has always  had an extremist fringe, with the far-left wing of the Democratic Party  rapidly becoming its mainstream. Democrats have been falling all over  each other to see how far they can run to the left. Socialism, a  concept that, in America at least, seemed to have been firmly consigned  to the ash heap of history is now being openly embraced by the  Democratic Party. Leading Democrats have embraced putting the  government in control of everything from American's energy usage to  healthcare.    It is not socialism or government-run healthcare that I want to focus  on today. I want to talk about another trend that has been gradually  emerging in the Democratic Party but doesn't always get the coverage  that proposals like Medicare for All receive. It is the growing  Democratic hostility to religion, which culminated a couple of weeks  ago in a Democratic Presidential candidate's proposal to selectively  tax churches based on whether he agrees with their religious beliefs.   Let me repeat that. Think about that for a minute. A Democratic  Presidential candidate proposed that the government should selectively  tax churches and synagogues and mosques based on whether their  religious beliefs pass muster with the President. That is, or should  be, a shocking statement.   The idea of taxing churches based on whether their religious beliefs  meet with a political party's approval is antithetical to the  fundamental right to freely exercise one's religion. It is not just  antithetical, but it is unconstitutional. Targeting churches for  discriminatory treatment based on their theology is a violation of the  First Amendment.   It is an understatement to say that it is deeply disturbing to see  this proposal emerge from a mainstream candidate. But what might be  even more disturbing is that members of the Democratic Party aren't  lining up to reject this outlandish and unconstitutional proposal.   Maybe we shouldn't be surprised. This is not the first time a  Democrat has shown signs of regarding religious people as second-class  citizens. During some of the judicial confirmations of this  administration, it became clear that Democrats believed religious  people should be subjected to extra scrutiny.   There was the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett during the first year  of this administration. She was an outstanding judicial candidate who  received the American Bar Association's highest rating of ``well  qualified.'' The ABA's evaluation, as the Democratic leader once said,  is ``the gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''   Yet during the confirmation process, it became clear that some  Democrats thought she should be disqualified because she is a  practicing Catholic. ``The dogma lives loudly within you'' is a quote  from the Democratic ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, with the  implication that anyone who takes his or her religious faith seriously  can't be trusted to hold public office.   Last December, Democrats raised questions about another judicial  nominee because he is a member of a Catholic charitable organization,  the  [[Page S6054]]  Knights of Columbus, which participates in such disturbing activities  as serving veterans, raising money for the needy, and providing young  people with scholarships. The Constitution is very clear on whether  being a person of faith can disqualify you from public office. From  article VI, ``no religious Test shall ever be required as a  Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.''   ``No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any  Office or public Trust under the United States.'' That is a quote from  article VI of the Constitution.   Religious liberty is a foundational part of our system of government.  There is a reason it is the very first freedom mentioned in the Bill of  Rights. More than one of the 13 original colonies were founded for the  express purpose of securing religious freedom. By religious freedom, I  don't mean the right to worship privately as long as you don't bring  your faith into the public square. What people were looking for in  America--what they still look for in America--is the freedom to live  according to their religion and according to their conscience and  beliefs, freely and publicly, without interference from the government.  That is what the First Amendment was intended to protect.   I want to move away from the Constitution for a minute, though. There  is no question that Democrats' increasingly hostile public attitude  toward religion raises some serious questions about constitutionality.  I think that is clear. That is not the only disturbing aspect of it.   I am also profoundly disturbed by the none-too-subtle implication  that religious people are somehow second-class citizens, that we may  have to tolerate them, but that we should seek to push them out of  public life. That idea is also one that would be absolutely  antithetical to the Founders.   The Founders didn't see religion as something to be tolerated. They  saw it as an absolute good, and that isn't just because a number of the  Founders were men and women of faith. They didn't think religion was  just a private good--that it kept you in a good place with God. No,  they thought religion was good for society. Think of the famous passage  from Washington's Farewell Address, which we read in the Senate,  literally, every single year in observance of Washington's birthday.    Let me quote:         Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political       prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.       In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who       should labor to subvert these great pillars of human       happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and       citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man,       ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not       trace all their connections with private and public felicity.    Again, this is from President Washington's Farewell Address. This is  a sentiment that occurs over and over again during the founding--that  religion is a benefit not just to individuals privately but to the  public, that it makes men and women into good citizens. It encourages  them to uphold the law, to live virtuous lives, to take their oaths  seriously, to respect the property of others, and to moderate  problematic passions like vengeance and avarice.   That is not to say that you have to be religious to be a good  citizen, but it does point to the truth that religion is something that  adds value to society and that it builds men and women who are a  blessing to their neighbors and to their country.   Americans are known for being a generous people. I don't think it is  much of a coincidence that Americans are also known for being a  religious people. Again, to be clear, that doesn't mean you have been  to be religious to be generous, but religion encourages generosity.  Think about how much of the charitable work in this country would go  away overnight without religion. Churches and religious organizations  support food banks and homeless shelters and crisis pregnancy centers.  They run tutoring programs and scholarship programs and mentoring  programs. They reach out to immigrants and refugees and to struggling  parents and struggling families. They serve military members and first  responders. They sign up people to vote. They help families looking to  adopt. They implement recycling programs. They collect aid for  individuals caught in the path of natural disasters. They build houses  for those without a home, and I could go on and on and on.   I will provide just one South Dakota example. A few months ago, I  visited LifeLight's new youth center in the Pettigrew Heights area of  Sioux Falls. In addition to providing spiritual opportunities, the  center is focused on providing a safe place where underprivileged  children can come to hang out, play games, have a snack, and do their  homework. It is just one of the many tremendous things being done by  churches and religious organizations in Sioux Falls and around my  State. I doubt there is any area where good work is being done in this  country where you won't find religious people helping out.   I don't just want to see religious people tolerated. I want to see  the Democratic Party rejecting the un-American idea that being  religious somehow makes you less qualified to participate in the public  square, and I want to see the Democratic Party standing up to condemn  unconstitutional ideas like that proposed by one of their Presidential  candidates.   Until then, I will keep fighting to ensure that every American's  fundamental right to live in accordance with his or her religious  beliefs is protected.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).
