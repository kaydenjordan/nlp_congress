 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Armed Services be discharged from further consideration of the bill  (H.R. 4641) to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to  John L. Canley for acts of valor during the Vietnam War while a member  of the Marine Corps, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
