 Mr. President, today I wish to thank Andrew Klein  for his remarkable tenure as dean of the Indiana University Robert H.  McKinney School of Law. Of the 21 years Mr. Klein has served the law  school, he spent seven serving as its dean.   Under Mr. Klein's leadership, IU McKinney acquired national  recognition as one of the best value law schools. Additionally, the  school's legal writing and health law programs have often been ranked  among the top in the country by U.S. News & World Report.   Over the course of his years as dean of IU McKinney, Mr. Klein  frequently called the position the greatest honor of his professional  life. Those who worked with Mr. Klein in this capacity admired him for  his people-focused and institutionally minded leadership style. Back  home in Indiana, Mr. Klein's service to the legal profession has not  gone unrecognized. In 2019, he was presented with the Indianapolis Bar  Association President's Award for service to the legal profession and  the Indiana University Bicentennial Medal for service in support of the  university's mission.   Upon announcing his retirement as dean, Mr. Klein made clear that his  work at IU McKinney is not yet finished. In addition to his strong  leadership capabilities, Mr. Klein has a natural ability to teach and  will continue to serve as a professor at the School of Law. His  outstanding efforts as an instructor have earned him several  prestigious awards, including the Indiana University Trustees Teaching  Award.   Mr. Klein's commendable service to the Indianapolis community extends  beyond his role at IU McKinney. He serves on the board of directors for  the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society, an organization committed to  providing legal advice to vulnerable populations. Additionally, Mr.  Klein serves on the board of directors for Play Ball Indiana, an  organization that fosters opportunities for inner-city youth to play  baseball and grow as individuals.   Mr. Klein's retirement as dean of IU McKinney marks the end of a  laudable chapter for the school, and I look forward to seeing him  continue to impact lives there while serving as a professor. I  congratulate him on all his tremendous achievements throughout his  career and look forward to his further contributions to the greater  Indianapolis community and the State of Indiana as a whole.                            ____________________
