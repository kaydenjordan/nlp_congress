 Madam Speaker, today I stand here to honor Nina  Otero-Warren, a New Mexican educator, suffragist, and politician who  created a legacy of civil service through her dedication and work.   As the first female superintendent of the Santa Fe Public Schools,  she advocated to improve education, especially for the Hispano  communities of her beloved State. She preserved the language and  cultural heritage of our communities.   One hundred years ago, Nina made history in our country as the first  Hispanic woman to run for U.S. Congress. She did so immediately after  she led the suffragist movement and helped New Mexico sign the law. So,  100 years ago, she led the effort and was the first Latina to run for  Congress, and 100 years later, I am the first Latina to represent  Congressional District Three and her Santa Fe home.   Her work paved the way for Latinas like myself and my colleagues to  raise their voices and the needs of our families and communities in the  people's House. As we continue the fight for election reform here in  Congress, it could not be a better time to honor her legacy with this  year's American Women Quarters.   She will join Maya Angelou, who we celebrated earlier this week.  Maya's words still inspire so many of our colleagues. We are so happy  that the women poets, educators, and astronauts will finally be the  faces on the coins of our land.              Protecting Human Rights of LGBTQ-Plus Communities     Madam Speaker, whether it is in New Mexico or  across the world, no one should be in danger for living as their  authentic self. Yet, in many places, lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender, queer, and intersex individuals are continuously targets  of horrifying human rights abuses. Many suffer cruel and inhumane  punishment, imprisonment, and even death just for being who they are.  This is unacceptable.   That is why I proudly cosponsor and support the Global Respect Act.  This bill demands accountability for individuals around the world who  commit human rights violations against LGBTQ-plus communities. It also  ensures that we track international human rights information more  accurately so that we can help end these egregious crimes.    Madam Speaker, I look forward to voting for this lifesaving  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. There is  absolutely no justification for violating another individual's human  rights for simply being who they are.             Building on Black History's Foundations of Progress     Madam Speaker, Black history is American  history. From the dream of Dr. King to the good trouble of Congressman  John Lewis, Black History Month is a powerful reminder to honor those  before us who built the foundations of progress for our Nation.   Their unyielding dedication to the cultural, economic, and political  advancement of all people paved the way for others to follow, but their  legacy continues on in the Black leaders of today in New Mexico like  Judge Shammara Henderson.   I campaigned with her and met her and just came to rejoice in her  wisdom. She is the first Black woman judge to serve on the New Mexico  Court of Appeals and win a statewide election in New Mexico. She is  blazing trails never traveled before.   It is also through people like Dr. Charles Nwankwo, who served as the  president of Clovis Community College. I had the honor of touring  Clovis Community College and meeting with Dr. Nwankwo just a couple of  weeks ago.   His work opens doors and unleashes the potential of so many New  Mexicans. He is truly dedicated to inspiring the next generation to  achieve new heights and conquer new frontiers.   It is through people like Beverly McMillan, who works at the Family  Advocacy Center to support victims of domestic violence, child abuse,  and domestic trauma. Every child, single mother, or victim of abuse who  opens the door of a better future is a testament to the power of love  and compassion.   These are just a few of the many heroes we have in the great State of  New Mexico writing the next chapter of leadership, courage, and service  in the Black community.   Judge Henderson, Dr. Nwankwo, Ms. McMillan, and so many more, thank  you for the work you do to create a more just world.                            ____________________
