 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I hear a lot of complaints about what it is going to do  for California. Well, don't cry for California. We do a lot of bad  ideas that affect the whole country. Indeed, we have one-eighth of the  country's population and a little over one-eighth of the country's auto  sales.   So what does that mean? Well, we are not going to get a whole lot of  help from the manufacturers or the CEOs because they want to get along  with Washington, D.C., but we are here about preserving choice for all  Americans on automobiles.   The California Air Resources Board is an unelected board appointed by  Governor Gavin Newsom, who is not the guy that is on your side for  freedom.   As well, recently, after this mandate in California came out by 2035,  a few days later he said, oh, people, will you please not charge your  electric vehicles right now because it is going to affect our grid  because we don't have enough power in our grid--rolling blackouts, bans  on hydroelectric dams. They almost took down our last nuclear power  plant.    So California is not the place a lot of solutions are going to come  from. You said Republicans put these in place. Well, these have been  weaponized in the 50 years since then with the Air Resources Board and  all the other entities that have been put in place.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1435 will preserve choices for people. I have  actually lived it myself as I have had a real job on a farm.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  motion to recommit and ``yes'' on H.R. 1435.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise to speak about the passing  of a very good friend and an American hero, Lieutenant Commander Jim  Gibson of Redding, California.   Pictured here at an Honor Flight here in Washington, D.C., I got to  accompany him that day. It was a lot of fun and very gratifying.   Jim was a career Navy officer for 26 years. He joined the Navy as an  engine man right out of high school and rose to the rank of ensign  before becoming a commissioned officer.   After working his way through the ranks to captain, he was assigned  command of a submarine rescue ship in the 7th Fleet. This vessel, the  USS Coucal, had the worst reputation in the entire U.S. 7th Fleet. When  Jim took command, he turned things around and made it the premier  submarine rescue vessel in the entire U.S. 7th Fleet.   After retiring from active service, Jim remained devoted to the ideal  of duty. He was very active in veterans' affairs, founding a submarine  veterans group in northern California and serving as its president. He  was instrumental in raising money for the Veterans Memorial in Anderson  River Park. I was proud to have him as a member of my congressional  advisory committee on academy appointments, where he did a great job of  helping us screen the best new and brightest.   Jim was faithful to his fellow veterans to the last, working  faithfully out of the Igo Veterans Cemetery. He was always there to  ring the bell for the last watch when a Navy veteran was laid to rest.   He is survived by his wife, Mary Lou. My heart goes out to her and  their family at this time of grief. They will be in our prayers.   We will miss him dearly. Fair winds and following seas, Jim.                            ____________________
