 Mr. Speaker, on November 20, 2019, only 3 weeks ago,  Vermont lost a great Vermonter and an inspiring American, Jake Burton  Carpenter, the person who started Burton Snowboards, the person who  actually created the whole sport of boarding.   Jake was a great Vermonter and pioneer of snowboarding. He was a  great husband to his wife, best friend, and business partner for  decades, Donna Carpenter, and the proud father of George, Taylor, and  Timi, snowboarders or riders all.   Jake's life was one of great effort, inspiring originality, perpetual  decency, and deep love of the snowboarding sport Jake created, deep  love of the people who came to the sport, and deep love of his  community and all the people who worked in his company.   Snowboarding in 2019 is a wildly popular sport that Jake started. It  has a prominent place in our Winter Olympic Games, and it has  extraordinary champions. It was once shunned and prohibited in all our  ski areas.   Mr. Speaker, you couldn't bring a board to a mountain, and it was  because the kids who wanted to do this were rambunctious, energetic,  and Jake would sometimes say disrespectful of their elders. But they  loved to ride, loved to be outdoors, and loved to be with each other.  It was this culture of community that Jake created as much as this  extraordinary sport that allowed people to demonstrate amazing physical  skills.   He started this company in Stratton, Vermont. He worked as a  bartender at night. During the day, he worked not in his garage but in  a barn at a house where he was housesitting. By himself, he was making  these snowboards.   This is one of his early Burton Snowboards.   With Donna, whom he met in 1982 and married in 1983, he then started  promoting to ski areas to let these rambunctious kids ride. Ski area  after ski area relented and ultimately came to see riding as the  economic future of their mountains because as ski trips have gone down,  boarding has gone up.   The company that Jake left behind that he started out of nothing now  has about 32 percent of the sales in this huge market, about $400  million. It is over a $1 billion industry. It has over 1,000 employees  in six different countries.   Riding today is something you do if you dare. It wasn't always so.  When Jake started in 1977, he started from nothing, but he loved it.   After he graduated from NYU in 1977 and a short stint on Wall Street,  the last time I think Jake ever wore a suit, he went to pursue his  dream in Vermont. He marketed this board initially to 22-year-olds.  Then he realized that when he was a kid, the first time that he got on  something that was the predecessor to these beautiful Burton  Snowboards, it was two skis bound together with a rope at the top  called a Snurfer, and he was 15 or 16. He started marketing to even  younger kids. They went outside, got on the mountain, and then a sport  was born.   Mr. Speaker, so many champions have been folks who rode these boards  in their glory. One of them, of course, was Shaun ``The Flying Tomato''  White. The Flying Tomato got so many awards that he has become one of  our greatest Olympic champions.   Now, Jake's life was not without real suffering. He lost his beloved  brother, George, in the Vietnam war. His mom, Kitty, died when he was  17.   I want to end with Jake's words: ``The riders, the product, the  process, this is my heart and soul. I just love the freedom  snowboarding gives you to do whatever you want.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, the House is going to have an  opportunity to do something that has long-needed to be done and will  benefit every single American in every single business that is  providing health insurance for their valued employees. We have a chance  to pass the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.    Here is what is significant about it, but first a word about Elijah:   In April of 2017, Elijah and I went to the White House and met with  President Trump, who said all the right things:   ``Why are we getting ripped off by Pharma?''   ``Why can't we import safe medications?''   ``Why can't we lower costs?''   Today, President Trump, we are going to do it.   Two things are finally being done:   First, the House of Representatives, on behalf of all consumers, is  going to allow the Health and Human Services secretary to negotiate  prices, not just pay the rip-off prices demanded.   Second, we are adopting an idea that President Trump had: ``Put a  cap, 120 percent.'' We will not pay more than that, what other  countries pay for the same medication.   President Trump put it in his blunt way: ``We are being suckers.''   We are putting a cap on that price. This will lower the cost of  prescription drugs over 10 years by a half a trillion dollars.   Finally, our government is standing up on behalf of consumers in not  protecting Pharma against unlimited price gouging.   And second, what is inspiring to me about this is the benefits go to  everyone. Employers in Vermont, they want their employees to have  healthcare, but those premiums keep going up and up and they have to  trade healthcare benefits for wages and salary increases.   So that means our employers are going to get the benefit of lower  premiums; our individuals are going to get the benefit of lower  premiums; and seniors, who have been hammered with co-pays and  deductibles, are going to get lower costs as well.   Individual drugs, too, you won't be getting killed on those, folks  with insulin and others. So let's pass this for Elijah.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We have done in our committee some bipartisan work that attacks  patent abuse and will help bring down the costs of drugs, but there is  a question. It is not a partisan question. It is really a judgment. Can  we stop pharma from what has been relentless price increases--I would  call it price gouging--without the government intervening on behalf of  the consumer? We are the only country where the government sits on its  hands while pharma boosts the prices.   President Trump told Elijah that is a rip-off. That is what the  President told Elijah, and the President said he would be okay with  bringing in safe drugs from abroad for price negotiation, or as the  President called it, getting a better deal.   The President's idea, which is a good one and incorporated in the  bill, was to have an international reference price so we don't pay  four, five, six times what they pay in Europe. That is a good idea.   But bottom line, the question is, will pharma stop killing us if we  don't step up with governmental authority for consumers? That is not  partisan. That is a judgment. It won't happen without us asserting that  authority, as is done in this bill.   Then, the benefits are extended to employers who are struggling to  pay health insurance for their folks and can't give them a raise, to  seniors, and to every individual.
