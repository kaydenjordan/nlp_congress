 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  subsequent votes be 10 minutes in duration.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 1, and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, every American family must balance its own  family's budget, and voters wonder why Congress never balances its  budget. The Democratic budget before us will add $15 trillion of debt  over the next decade. The Pennies Plan budget, which is consistent with  the balanced budget amendment that most Republicans have voted for,  balances the budget in just 5 years.   When I first introduced this budget a few years ago, all you had to  do was cut one penny over 5 years, and the budget balanced, but as  Congress has blown through the budget caps, it has  [[Page S445]]  become much more difficult. Last year, it was two pennies--a 2-percent  cut per year to balance in 5 years. Now it is a three-penny plan, and  you have to have a 3-percent cut, but it is still foreseeable that we  could balance our budget.   It is the right thing to do. It is good for America. It will make us  a stronger country to leave for our kids and our grandkids, and I urge  a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 441 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Probably nothing makes Americans madder than to see their  hard-earned tax dollars sent overseas to boondoggle after boondoggle-- countries that laugh at us, burn our flag, take our money, and then ask  for more. Meanwhile, our roads and bridges are crumbling in our  country. We can't fix our own infrastructure because we keep building  roads and bridges in other countries.   My amendment would take the $26 billion we send in foreign aid  welfare and keep it here and put it into our infrastructure in our  country.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
