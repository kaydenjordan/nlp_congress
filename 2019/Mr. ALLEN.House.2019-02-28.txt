 Madam Speaker, I rise here this morning to speak out  against the extreme priorities of our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle. With so many pressing issues facing the 116th Congress, I  find it appalling that H.R. 1 has been reserved for legislation that  completely undermines the democratic framework of our country.   Simply put, this bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled power grab  through more government, more regulation, and political speech  repression. To call this legislation the For the People Act is  borderline ludicrous.   H.R. 1 would eliminate States' authority to set voting  qualifications, restore voting rights of convicted felons even if it  contradicts State or local policy, outlaw voter verification, and force  taxpayers to subsidize anonymous donations even if it is for a  candidate they do not support.   This is just the tip of the iceberg. H.R. 1 is not for the people  but, rather, an attempt to expand power to Federal bureaucrats and  unelected Federal judges, undercutting the will of everyday citizens  and the Constitution.   This is not reform. This is a shameless attempt to keep one party in  power, and the American people deserve better.                            ____________________
