 Mr. Speaker, I think we have had a lot of important  discussions this Congress, but there is one important discussion that I  truly believe we need to take very seriously. It is section 702 of the  reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   I want to remind us that our main job as Representatives of the  people is to protect people's rights to life, liberty, and property. We  will never have equal opportunities and will always want to have equal  outcomes, but the equality of rights is the job of Congress and the  legislature.   We know very well that the constitutional rights of Americans have  been violated.   I am going to cite some excerpts from the report that the Privacy and  Civil Liberties Oversight Board just issued recently. That board was  created to oversee due processes, and the issue in line was the  reauthorization. It is actually run by Democrats, and the chair is  appointed by President Biden.   This is from the report: ``The board finds that section 702 poses  significant privacy and civil liberties risks, most notably from U.S.  person queries and batch queries. Significant privacy and civil  liberties risks also include the scope of permissible targeting.''   It also talks about new types of procedures that have been recently  authorized, in 2022, and we had challenges about collection that some  thought Congress would put a stop to. However, it says that the new  procedures that we just authorized were used in a widespread fashion.  It could be extraordinarily intrusive.   It also says the board finding a risk of overboard government  collection of communications is very real and can cause harm with no  individualized judicial review of targeting decisions. We had an almost  300 percent increase in surveillance since 2013, double in the last 5  years.   This search is very concerning since there is no specific review of  that.   Also, it says that a lot of things that are collected could be  political, religious, and social advocacy. There are significant  concerns about this program overall.   The changes that the FBI has done, they say, have not been sufficient  to protect privacy and civil liberties. It is also actually confirmed  by the internal audit of a recent report--the most recent was in May  2023 when the internal audits of the FBI was talking pretty much about  over 90 percent of queries not having any evidence of justification for  these queries.    It is like the FBI is very good. They don't record and don't recall,  so they want all the liability. It is a serious issue.   We had some discussions, and I think the Judiciary Committee bill is  somewhat bad. At least it requires a warrant for queries of a U.S.  person. Still, both the bills that the Intelligence Committee and the  Judiciary Committee are proposing lack some very serious consideration.   There is no outside review of what data is collected, and this is  something the board pretty much recognizes. As an agency, they collect  information on Americans, but they cannot assess how much. At the  least, there needs to be some sampling by a FISA court when they do  certification to start figuring it out because, ultimately, there is a  potential that our agencies have access to be able to collect without  warrant and surveil many Americans. We don't know how many Americans  they are surveilling and what the NSA is doing when they do filtering  procedures.   There is no ability for us to even know what is going in the review  of that. The board brings these concerns, but also there are concerns  with documentation.   I think Congress should have for us--we do it in other areas, and in  accounting, we do it, too--where, through evidence and documentation,  we can have preventative controls in systems. When queries are run,  there is evidence of review and evidence of approval and justification  by the FBI as to why they are using this loophole in the law that  potentially violates the rights of U.S. citizens and many Americans.   I think the magnitude of this problem is significant, and the  magnitude of violations could be very material. I think Congress needs  to be much more serious in its consideration before we reauthorize the  section.   The other thing the board talks about is national security. It is an  important section, but actually, the agency didn't prove that queries  that they are doing actually give justification to what they are doing  to provide them more expansion on that.  [[Page H6201]]    I think we need to put up more guardrails, and I hope we will have  more discussions on this issue and this bill if they are going to move  forward in the way they are because I want to remind us that if we are  not willing to stand up for the rights of Americans here, then I don't  know why we are even in Congress.   This Fourth Amendment right is a significant right, and it is a  bipartisan issue. I hope we will take a more serious look at how we can  improve this FISA reauthorization before it is reauthorized and have  better legislation.                                time  1930
