 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  work of the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,  Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who left his post on September 1. His  tireless efforts enabled him to become a voice for those who found  themselves defenseless against those who abuse the human rights of  others in order to gain and maintain power.   High Commissioner Zeid was very helpful during the debate over the  passage of H. Res. 128, supporting respect for human rights and  encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia. He not only publicly  endorsed the resolution, but sent a representative during the critical  negotiations to bring H. Res. 128 to the floor of the United States  House of Representatives for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, former United Nations High Commissioner Prince Zeid  Ra'ad Al Hussein will forever be remembered by the Ethiopian people for  his role in the passage of H. Res. 128.                            ____________________
