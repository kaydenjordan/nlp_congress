 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my colleague  Pramila Jayapal from Seattle, Washington. We wanted to talk about what  has been happening over the last week with the executive orders on  immigration and asylum that have taken place, and we want to try to  take a broad perspective on this; to put it in some historical, legal  and constitutional context; and then also to talk very specifically  about the executive orders and what has been taking place with them in  different parts of the country; and about the multiple Federal judicial  rulings imposing injunctions on enforcement of those orders.   But I wanted to begin, actually, by stepping back from the heat of  the current crisis and looking, instead, at the idea of America.   Well, what is the idea of America? America was created, as the great  Tom Paine said, as a haven of refuge for people fleeing political and  religious repression from all around the world.   Remember the radicalism of the American Revolution and our  Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. We were the first  Nation on Earth conceived in revolutionary insurgency against monarchy,  dictatorship, autocracy, theocracy, and the merger of church and State.   The American colonists were rebelling against, not just the king and  all of the whimsical depredations and abuses of the crown, but also  against centuries of religious warfare in Europe between the  Protestants and the Catholics, holy inquisition, holy crusades,  witchcraft trials, endless wars between the Catholics and the  Protestants.   Our forefathers and foremothers wanted to break from that history and  put into our Constitution the separation of church and State--as  Jefferson called it, the wall of separation between church and State,  the establishment clause, the idea of free exercise of religion,  freedom of speech, the right to petition for redress of grievances, the  right of people to assemble, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience  in the United States.   But it would be a land that would be open to people who were fleeing  authoritarianism, who were trying to get away from repressive regimes,  and kings, and monarchs, and princes, and tyrants, and dictators, and  despots everywhere. That was the idea behind America.   Well, then in this Presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump  said that he wanted to impose a Muslim ban, a ban on Muslims coming to  America, which would cause our forefathers and foremothers to turn over  in their graves to hear that somebody running for President of the  United States wanted to impose a ban on the immigration of people based  on their religious faith, in a country that was designed on the  principle of free exercise of religion, designed on the principle of no  establishment of religion, designed on the principle of no religious  tests for public office or political participation that suddenly we  would say we are not going to accept people--in the 21st century--based  on their religious heritage.   And of course, anybody can make up their religion anyway. Anybody can  say what they are. So it is as futile and as silly as it is anathema  and apathetical to our basic constitutional ideals.   Well, that Muslim ban has, in its bizarre way, become law now in the  United States of America. The President issued an executive order as  one of his first actions on people coming to our country from Iran,  Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, those seven countries.  And we have got to interrogate what exactly the logic of this is.    The President and his chief strategists of the alt-right, named Steve  Bannon, have defended this order on the grounds of national security.  The idea is that somehow we are defending the national security and the  defense by banning people from those countries.   All right, we all support national security. If that would advance  our national security, it is something we should look at.   Well, what is the evidence that that is going to benefit our national  security? Our country now is no stranger to terror and to terrorism.  All of us remember that shocking, fateful day, 9/11, back in 2001, when  America changed forever.   Those 19 hijackers came from three countries. And which three  countries on this list of seven did they come from? None of them. Those  hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. The overwhelming majority of them  came from Saudi Arabia, then Egypt then United Arab Emirates.   None of those three countries is on this list of seven. Why not?  Well, a couple of different theories are out there. One is that  President Trump has business interests in those countries. He is doing  business with corporations in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, and in the United  Arab Emirates. So that is one leading theory that is out there. The  other is that these are rich and powerful countries. So despite the  fact that they were the lead exporters from this prism of terrorist  hijackers to the United States, they get a pass.   And instead, we pick on Yemen, and Somalia, and Iraq--our presumed  ally--that another Republican President sunk hundreds of billions of  dollars into waging a war based on the mythology that there were  weapons of mass destruction in that country, but now they are on our  side. Yet, we have imposed a ban of people coming in as refugees from  Iraq. But Saudi Arabia gets a pass; Egypt gets a pass; United Arab  Emirates gets a pass because they are on the rich side.   So what exactly do these seven countries have in common if it doesn't  have anything to do with our national security? Because if you look at  the other terrorist events that have taken place in our country, for  example, the Boston Marathon bombers, those young men who were  implicated in that crime against the people of the city of Boston and  the people of the United States came from Russia originally.   Is there a ban on Russia being imposed here? Quite the contrary.  Earlier today, President Trump relaxed sanctions on Russia, made it  easier for American businesses to export information technology to  Russian companies, according to news reports.   I haven't seen the exact order yet, but there is an executive order  that is lessening sanctions on Russia, despite the fact that two of the  most infamous terrorists against the United States originally came from  there. So what do those seven countries have in common?   Well, they are all Muslim countries. They are poor Muslim countries.  They are poor Muslim countries that Donald Trump doesn't do business  with. And so maybe that is it. Maybe the idea is, we are going to wage  a worldwide war on the poorest, most vulnerable Muslim countries, even  if they don't pose any special threat to us, because that will conform  to Steve Bannon's ideological world view of a major contest between the  Christian west and radical Islamic terror.   I think that would be it. But President Trump, of course, puts his  business interests even above the racism and White nationalism of Steve  Bannon, because the business interests have to come first in all cases.   So that is the best that we can make of what has been imposed on the  country, an Orwellian policy imposed with Kafkaesque incompetence all  over the United States of America. So the airports are in an uproar,  families have been dislocated, children agonized over the situation,  panic spreading across America. And part of me wants to think, well,  this is just the misfortunes of a beginning President. Maybe this is  part of a design by Steve Bannon who has proclaimed himself a Leninist  who wants to tear the system down, tear the government down; to start  over again.   Maybe that is what is going on. Who knows? But all of this brings us  back to the emoluments clause. Now the emoluments clause, Article I,  section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution was inserted by our great  Founders because they feared foreign monetary dominance of the United  States Government.   They knew that kings and princes, dictators and despots, traitors and  saboteurs all over the place would try to use their money to compromise  the integrity of Republican government, Republican democracy.   Remember, we were trying something new here, what our great  Republican President Abraham Lincoln would later come to call the  ``government of the people, by the people, and for the people.''  [[Page H923]]    That was the experiment that we launched then, and they knew that  there was a basic problem, which is, the room will not hold all. We  can't have a New England town meeting every time we need to make a  decision, so we have got to elect people to go be our Governors.   But when you elect them, now you have got an agent. And the problem  all of you lawyers know out there--in principal agent law--is how do  you make sure the agent actually serves the client rather than the  interests of the agent himself or herself?   And the Founders understood that, and they were afraid that the  people who we elected might go to Washington and be corrupted by  foreign money, by all of the diplomats and spies running around  offering gifts, and gold, and snuffboxes, and diamonds, and so on. And  so what they said was that no official in our government, no official  could accept any gifts, or emolument, any payment of any kind at all  from a foreign government, a king, a prince, or a foreign government.  No foreign payments.   And that is something that has been observed scrupulously for more  than two centuries by our Presidents. Nobody has even come close to the  line of violating that.   When Benjamin Franklin was Ambassador to France, he received a  snuffbox from the people of France. He came back, and he brought it to  Congress and asked Congress to approve, because it is up to this body  to decide whether or not a foreign payment is acceptable or not.    And Congress said: Mr. Franklin, because of your extraordinary  reputation for integrity, for decency, and for honesty, we understand  you have not been compromised by that snuffbox, and it is just a  snuffbox, and you can keep it.   But today, what we have got now is a President who has hundreds of  millions of dollars of interest all over the world--in Russia, in the  Philippines--millions of dollars of loans from the Government of China,  the Trump Hotel, which is renting out banquet rooms, dining halls,  floors, hotel rooms, to foreign governments and embassies from all over  the world who come here to try to influence our government.   And what do we hear about the emoluments clause? Has the President  come to ask us whether or not we approve of these arrangements?  Nothing. Nothing has happened. Is it affecting policy? Every single  day.   And I come back--before I turn it over to my colleague--to what we  are talking about, which is these executive orders which have this very  bizarre quality, my fellow Americans.                                time  1700    They apply to poor Muslim countries where Donald Trump has no  business interests. These executive orders don't apply to Saudi Arabia,  they don't apply to Egypt, they don't apply to the United Arab  Emirates, they don't apply to any of the countries where Trump  Industries has business. That is precisely why the Founders put in the  emoluments clause. I know it is a bit of a mouthful, but every American  has got to learn to say it. All it means is payments. This is the  foreign bribery clause in our Constitution.   These terrible immigration orders, which have created chaos and  pandemonium across the land, are a perfect demonstration of why we need  to enforce the emoluments clause and why this President needs to divest  himself immediately of all these foreign concerns, or this Congress  must hear the appeals that are coming from our side of the aisle and  must listen to the fact that these payments that are being received on  a daily basis by the President are a threat to the American  constitutional order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal), my good friend and colleague from Seattle, Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Barragan).    I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished Congresswoman from New  York, Yvette Clarke.    I thank the Congresswoman for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished Congressman from Minnesota  (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief here because a number  of our colleagues from around the country are waiting to weigh in.   Let me just say that this executive order is like a bad issue spotter  on a constitutional law final exam. It  [[Page H927]]       is riddled with so many constitutional errors and violations, starting  with the ban on religious free exercise, equal protection of the laws.     The way it has been implemented has been draconian and Kafkaesque    around the country, violating due process and the right to counsel,    which has been the source of a lot of the successful constitutional                  litigation that has already taken place.    It hasn't even been out on the street for a week, and I think five or  six Federal district courts have struck down different aspects of it.  So it is a Pandora's box, and it is going to be the gift that keeps  giving to constitutional lawyers across the country.   Again, we are urging the President just to withdraw it at this point.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, we have four more speakers. We have had an  overwhelming response to the Progressive Caucus' Special Order on the  executive orders here.   I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms.  Jayapal) and I thank all of the Members who have come pouring out in  response for this Progressive Caucus Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Garamendi).    Could we allow the gentleman to complete his statement  just with 1 minute?    I ask unanimous consent for just 1 minute to complete----    I thank the gentleman. That is very gracious of the  Congressman.                            ____________________     If the gentleman has a few seconds left, I would just say  I know the distinguished Congressman King is going to go, and then we  have a couple more people who were left over from the Progressive  Caucus Special Order who will stay for 1-minutes after.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    I thank you for your thoughtful comments tonight, and I  think you made some good points. I think you effectively made the point  that this is not, strictly speaking, a Muslim ban. It is not a ban on  all Muslims entering the country. In the popular vernacular, the public  has taken up basically what was the current President's language that  he used during the campaign. So people are using it for kind of a  shorthand.   But I want to ask you about the ban. It is not the case that there is  no religious reference in the executive order because it does say that  the religious minorities from those countries are given preference, and  that would be the Christians in those countries.   One thing I think that does need to be corrected is thousands of  Christians were admitted from the Muslim world under the Obama  administration, and there was no discrimination. In fact, I think there  were almost as many Christians admitted as Muslims.   But here is my real question for you. The 9/11 hijackers--which was  the worst terrorist atrocity ever committed on our shores, thousands of  Americans were killed, the country plunged into chaos--came from three  countries: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. All three  of those countries where Trump Industries does business were exempted  from the ban on the seven countries. Why? What is the policy  justification for not including that?   None of the countries that are included in the ban produced any of  the terrorist attacks that we saw in Orlando, in San Bernardino County,  or any of the other ones. So how were those chosen and the source  countries for the 9/11 attack exempted?    Again, that is very gracious of you, and I appreciate the  spirit with which you engage in this dialogue. I think it is something  we really do need to get to the bottom of. To my knowledge, Trump  Industries is not doing business in the poor Muslim countries that were  targeted like Somalia, Libya, and so on, but perhaps I can be  corrected.    In any event, the fact that he has done business in Saudi Arabia, in  Egypt, and United Arab Emirates--in the wealthier Muslim countries--it  may be logical as a matter of business practice, but I don't think that  can become the basis for American foreign policy. I think that is the  reason why this policy has created such outrage in America and around  the world because it doesn't seem to have any national security logic  to it. It is not about terrorism unless you can convince me that those  seven countries actually generated terrorism.
