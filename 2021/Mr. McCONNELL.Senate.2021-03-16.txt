 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I would like to begin with a few  quotations.         The legislative filibuster . . . is the most important       distinction between the Senate and the House. Without the 60-      vote threshold for legislation, the Senate becomes a       majoritarian institution like the House, much more subject to       the whims of short-term electoral change. No Senator would       like to see that happen. So let's find a way to further       protect the 60-vote rule for legislation.   [[Page S1533]]     That was the current Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, in April of  2017, less than 4 years ago.   Now, here is another quote, Mr. President:         What about [the] nuclear option doing away with the       filibuster?        I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it       was originally devised and created going back to our Founding       Fathers. We have to acknowledge our respect for the minority,       and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition       and in its procedure.    That was the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Durbin, in 2018,  about 3 years ago.   A few years ago, 33 Members of the Democratic side signed a letter  insisting that ``we preserve existing rules, practices, and  traditions'' regarding legislation. Now, under pressure from the  outside, many of our Democratic colleagues are abandoning their stated  principles as fast as possible.   Yesterday, Senator Durbin said the filibuster is not a core principle  but ``an offhanded clerical suggestion.'' An offhanded clerical  suggestion.   A number of Senate Democrats are trying to pressure the senior  Senators from West Virginia and Arizona to abandon their own very  recent commitments to honor this central rule of the Senate.   The Framers designed the Senate to require deliberation, to force  cooperation, and to ensure that Federal laws in our big, diverse  country earn broad enough buy-in to receive the lasting consent of the  government. James Madison said the Senate should be a ``complicated  check'' against ``improper acts of legislation.'' Thomas Jefferson said  that ``great innovations should not be forced on slender majorities.''   Senate Democrats parroted all these arguments when they were the ones  benefiting from minority protection. When President Trump pressed  Republicans to kill the filibuster, our Democratic colleagues cried  foul. When our Republican majority stood on principle and refused to  wreck the rules, our Democratic colleagues happily used the filibuster  themselves. In some cases, they flat-out blocked legislation, like  Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill. In many other cases, Democrats  did what minority parties always do and leveraged the existence of the  filibuster to influence must-pass legislation long before it got to the  floor.   There is so much emphasis on the most extreme bills that either party  might pass with a simple majority. People forget that the Senate's 60- vote threshold is the only reason--the only reason--that any routine,  must-pass legislation is bipartisan except during divided government.  Big funding deals, appropriations bills, farm bills, highway bills, the  NDAA--the Senate's 60-vote threshold backstops all of it. It is not  just about controversial items; it is about everything we do.   The Senate Democrats who are pressuring our colleagues from Arizona  and West Virginia to reverse themselves are not just arguing for some  procedural tweak, not a procedural tweak; they are arguing for a  radically less stable and less consensus-driven system of government.  Forget about enduring laws with broad support; nothing in Federal law  would ever be settled.   Does anyone really believe the American people were voting for an  entirely new system of government by electing Joe Biden to the White  House and a 50-50 Senate? This is a 50-50 Senate. There was no mandate  to completely transform America by the American people on November 3.  That may be what a few liberal activists want, but does anyone believe  that millions of Americans thought that is what they were electing? Of  course not.   There is an ironic element to this whole conversation. Some  Democratic Senators seem to imagine this would be a tidy tradeoff. If  they could just break the rules on a razor-thin majority, sure, it  might damage the institution, but then nothing would stand between them  and their entire agenda--a new era of fast-track policymaking. But  anyone who really knows the Senate knows that is not what would happen.   So let me say this very clearly for all 99 of my colleagues: Nobody  serving in this Chamber can even begin--can even begin--to imagine what  a completely scorched-earth Senate would look like.   None of us have served 1 minute in the Senate that was completely  drained of comity and consent. This is an institution that requires  unanimous consent to turn the lights on before noon, to proceed with a  garden-variety floor speech, to dispense with the reading of lengthy  legislative text, to schedule committee business, and to move even  noncontroversial nominees at anything besides a snail's pace.   So I want our colleagues to imagine a world where every single task-- every one of them--requires a physical quorum, which, by the way, the  Vice President does not count in determining a quorum. Everything that  Democratic Senates did to Presidents Bush and Trump and everything the  Republican Senate did to President Obama would be child's play compared  to the disaster that Democrats would create for their own priorities  if--if--they break the Senate.   So this is not a tradeoff between trampling etiquette but then  getting to quickly transform the country. That is a false choice. Even  the most basic aspects of our colleagues' agenda, the most mundane  tasks of the Biden Presidency, would actually be harder--harder--not  easier for Democrats in a post-nuclear Senate that is 50-50, dead even.   If the Democrats break the rules to kill rule XXII on a 50-50 basis,  then we will use every other rule to make tens of millions of  Americans' voices heard. Perhaps the majority would come after the  other rules next. Perhaps rule XXII would just be the first domino of  many, until the Senate ceases to be distinct from the House in any  respect. This chaos would not open up an express lane to liberal  change. It would not open up an express lane for the Biden Presidency  to speed into the history books. The Senate would be more like a 100- car pileup--nothing moving.   And then there is the small matter that majorities are actually never  permanent. The last time a Democratic leader was trying to start a  nuclear exchange, I remember offering a warning. I said my colleagues  would regret it a lot sooner than they thought. In just a few years and  a few Supreme Court vacancies later, many of my Democratic colleagues  said publicly that they did. Touching the hot stove again would yield  the same result but even more dramatic.   As soon as Republicans wound up back in the saddle, we wouldn't just  erase every liberal change that hurt the country. We would strengthen  America with all kinds of conservative policies, with zero--zero--input  from the other side. How about this: nationwide right-to-work for  working Americans; defunding Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities on  day one; a whole new era of domestic energy production; sweeping new  protections for conscience and the right to life of the unborn;  concealed-carry reciprocity in all 50 States and the District of  Columbia; and massive hardening of the security on our southern border.   We saw during amendment votes, just days ago, that some commonsense  Republican positions actually enjoy more support right now than some of  the Democratic committee chairs' priorities, and this is with them in  the majority. So the pendulum would swing both ways, and it would swing  hard.   My colleagues and I have refused to kill the Senate for instant  gratification. In 2017 and in 2018, I was lobbied to do exactly what  Democrats want to do now. A sitting President leaned on me to do it. He  tweeted about it. What did I do? I said to the President at that time:  No. I said ``no'' repeatedly, because being a U.S. Senator comes with  higher duties than steamrolling any obstacle to short-term power. I  meant it. Republicans meant it.   Less than 2 months ago, two of our Democratic colleagues said they  mean it too. If they keep their word, we have a bipartisan majority  that can put principle first and keep the Senate safe.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
