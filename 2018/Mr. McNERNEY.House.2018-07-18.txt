 Mr. Chair, I understand my colleague's position on  this. Water is a scarce commodity. You want to have access to water.  You want to plant your trees. You want to feed your stocks and all  that.   But what you are not saying is what is going to happen if you  continue to take more water from the delta. The delta is a finite water  supply. The more you take water from the delta, the more saltwater from  the ocean comes in and poisons our facilities, our docks, our fishing,  it changes the whole environment. And we are going to cost jobs if you  do that, so it is really a balance.   Now, I think it is okay to work together to find a proper amount of  water to ship out and a proper amount of water to stay in the delta.  When we have bigger rain events, the water pushes the saltwater back  out toward the ocean. It clears out water a little bit.   So, I mean, it is not like we are just trying to save water to hurt  you guys. That is not what is going on here. We have our own interests  to take care of.   This is always a fight. What we need to do is sit down and compromise  and find some way to get through this so that we don't end up hurting  one another, which is what happens.   Again, I understand the position you are in. I understand the need  for water. California is a dry State. We have years and years of  drought. But continuing to demand access to water when there is only a  finite supply, every year you want more, that is not going to work. It  is just not going to work.
