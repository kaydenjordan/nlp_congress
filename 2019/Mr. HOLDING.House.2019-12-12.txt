 Madam Chair, H.R. 3 is a shortsighted proposal and a bad  deal for our constituents.   It will compromise the strong legacy of innovation that our Nation is  proud of. It will be a grave mistake to fundamentally change the market  structure that makes America a viable market for cutting-edge  innovation in biopharmaceuticals.   Government price setting will kill innovation in clinical areas where  it is most needed. The pricing scheme outlined in H.R. 3 would  disincentivize research and development for drugs that are first in  their class, such as the future cure for Alzheimer's or ASL.   Government price controls will not only kill innovation but will also  fundamentally change the doctor-patient relationship in this country.  This bill would allow bureaucrats to make the most personal of choices  about the course of treatment for our constituents. Treatment decisions  in this country should be made between a patient and their physician  and should not be based on the rationing of treatments by bureaucrats  in foreign nations.   In North Carolina, H.R. 3's pricing scheme would shatter the  biopharmaceutical ecosystem that supports 40,000 jobs directly, 200,000  jobs indirectly, and generates $13 billion in economic output annually.  That is just in North Carolina.   H.R. 3 would put small and midsized biotech firms out of business and  threaten hundreds of thousands of our constituents' jobs. We should  reject H.R. 3 and, instead, advance meaningful legislation that lowers  patients' out-of-pocket costs, that protects innovation, and that would  actually be signed into law.
