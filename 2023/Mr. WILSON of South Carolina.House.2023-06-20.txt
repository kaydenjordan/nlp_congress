 Mr. Speaker, this summer marks the 60th  anniversary of the historic National Draft Goldwater for President  Rally in Washington.   According to The New York Times, supporters of U.S. Senator Barry  Goldwater of Arizona assembled on July 4, 1963, with ``more than 6,000  Goldwater backers from across the country filled the National Guard  Armory here for a rally of the National Draft Goldwater Committee. They  were predominantly a young crowd.''   As a Teen Age Republican at the High School of Charleston, I was  grateful to participate with 30 activists by bus from Columbia, South  Carolina, led by Republican State Chairman Drake Edens, with former  Democrat State Representative Floyd Spence.   Senator Goldwater's visionary call for ``Why Not Victory'' to promote  democracy to defeat communism has been achieved with the liberation of  dozens of countries across the world. Actor Ronald Reagan delivered the  Goldwater campaign challenge of ``A Time for Choosing,'' ultimately  leading to his Presidency.   Mr. Speaker, this summer marks the 60th anniversary of the historic  `National Draft of Goldwater for President Rally' in Washington.   According to The New York Times, supporters of U.S. Senator Barry  Goldwater of Arizona assembled on July 4, 1963, with ``more than 6,000  Goldwater backers from across the country filled the National Guard  Armory here for a rally of the National Draft Goldwater Committee. They  were predominantly a young crowd.'' ``The principal addresses were  given by Republican Senators John G. Tower of Texas and Carl T. Curtis  of Nebraska.''   As a Teen Age Republican at the High School of Charleston, I was  grateful to participate with 30 activists by bus from Columbia, South  Carolina led by Republican State Chairman Drake Edens with former  Democrat State Representative Floyd Spence, who was the first Democrat  to switch parties and ultimately elected Chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.   Another Teen Age Republican was Rusty DePass of Rock Hill who helped  an all-Democrat York County become virtually all Republican today.   On that day there were no Republican elected officials in South  Carolina, but the Goldwater victory in South Carolina in 1964 began a  political revolution. Now, Republicans have a super majority in the  legislature, including all statewide officials such as Governor Henry  McMaster, Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette, Attorney General Alan  Wilson, State Superintendent of Education Ellen Weaver, State Treasurer  Curtis Loftis, and Secretary of State Mark Hammond, and six of seven  members of Congress, along with very credible candidates for President,  Ambassador Nikki Haley and Senator Tim Scott. His philosophy of limited  government, expanded freedom, individual responsibility, and Peace  Through Strength, has triumphed.   Senator Goldwater's visionary call for ``Why Not Victory'' to promote  democracy to defeat communism has been achieved with the liberation of  dozens of countries across the world. Actor Ronald Reagan delivered the  Goldwater campaign challenge of a ``Time for Choosing'' ultimately  leading to his presidency.   In conclusion, God Bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
