 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this  moment hardly seems the time for the Senate to engage in debating  rhetorical phrases of praise for the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement agency when that agency--better known as ICE--is deeply  mired in the scandal of separating children from their parents. It is  ICE that partnered with Border Patrol and Health and Human Services in  this diabolical situation. It is ICE that holds the parents in  detention camps. It is ICE that has failed to arrange for the knowledge  within the system of which parents go with which children. It is ICE  that often has prevented individuals from having access to counsel,  from being able to even phone their children, and charged them for  using the phone.   In this situation, some 2,500-plus kids have been torn out of the  arms of their parents, and this particular resolution would engage in  nice phrases of praise instead of addressing itself to solving the  problem.   We should right now be considering Senator Harris's act, the REUNITE  Act, which would accelerate the reunification of the children, would  ensure that family separation never happens again, would coordinate  actions between ICE and the Border Patrol and Health and Human  Services, and would set up a family case management system that worked,  according to the IG of Homeland Security, to deliver 100 percent of the  time when individuals had a date for a hearing--100 percent of the  time.   That is why I ask my colleague to modify his request so that the  Committee on the Judiciary, instead, be discharged from further  consideration of S. 3227, the REUNITE Act, and the Senate proceed to  its immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I strongly object.
