 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening  Standards Act.   Before coming to Congress, I was a practicing physician for over 31  years. I also served in the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea in the 2nd  Medical Battalion where, at that time, we trained, we spent a lot of  time in the field training for mass casualties and big events.   I went to the border; I spent four days down there on two separate  occasions. The last time was in June of this year, with the Medical  Director of the Department of Homeland Security, as chief medical  adviser, and five other members of the Doctors Caucus at the McAllen,  Texas, Rio Grande Valley sector to see for myself what was going on.   At that time, Mr. Speaker, there were 1,000 to 1,500 or more people a  day who came across. As we stood there by the Rio Grande River, 15  people walked up and turned themselves in while we weren't there more  than 15 or 20 minutes.   And we looked at the facilities they had; about how they tried to  screen those folks; and then how they tried to sort them afterwards.  And, Congress, it was a shame on us for not providing ICE more beds so  you could move those folks off of the border more quickly.   With these folks, they have made--many of them have made long and  terrible journeys to get to where they are.   There is some good news, and I want to share this with you now. We  just had a meeting today that the ranking member on the committee was  there with the Acting Director of Homeland Security; and daily arrivals  are now down 64 percent. Attainee numbers are way down, from 20,000 in  custody at the border, to an average of 3,500 to 4,500 per day. And the  best news, I think, are unaccompanied children have been reduced from  over 2,700 to fewer than 150.   So there have been great improvements, which will actually improve  the health outcomes when you have time enough to go through and screen  those folks.   Can you imagine in a facility that is set for 1,000 people, and you  have 1,500 or 1,800 people, you have nowhere to send them, and a flu  epidemic breaks out? It is a very difficult thing to deal with.   So the folks at Customs and Border Patrol I think were doing a  yeoman's job based on the situation they were put in.   The problem we face isn't the lack of adequate care or screening. It  is due to the previously lax enforcement of our immigration laws, and  our Border Patrol agents just really being overrun with people  illegally crossing the border.   Really, without adding new and impossible-to-meet guidelines for our  Border Patrol agents, we should look for other ways to intervene with  illegal crossings, and I have mentioned that.   These people are often, as I said, escaping unimaginable problems in  their home country. But once they reach our border, the CBP is doing  the absolute best they can to help them.   Now, the bill would accomplish very little but overburdening our  already-taxed DHS staff with their limited resources. This bill would  require the DHS to purchase and implement an electronic health record  within 30 days in order to coordinate care for illegal border crossers.   Mr. Speaker, I think I may be one of the only people in the U.S.  Congress that has actually implemented an electronic health record in  my own practice. It took us a year to do it in our medical practice, to  put 80,000 charts in.   Can you imagine putting over a million? And the U.S. military, the  Department of Defense, right now is spending about $5-plus-billion for  a million and a half soldiers.   The Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I am very aware of, and I will  be going to Seattle, Washington, Madigan Army Medical Center on Sunday  night and Monday of next week to evaluate their system. We are spending  $16 billion to implement this.    Let me say this: The DOD and VA spent a billion dollars trying to  implement a system where the electronic health record at DOD and VA  could talk to each other, and they failed. So it is a very difficult,  complex situation to put an electronic health record in.   I think it is a noble goal, and it should be looked at. But it is  just something not doable in 30 days. I absolutely guarantee you it  will fail. These are labor-intensive, and many of them fail.   I know, as I was saying a little bit ago, that the Department of  Defense and VA are currently implementing this program which will--the  total cost of that will be $25 billion.   And this legislation gives DHS a colossal, unfunded mandate and it  has no expertise or capacity to handle this, and would consume all of  the supplemental that we have sent them.   Further, implementing a new health record at a hospital takes a year  or more, not 30 days. So it is absolute folly to think that DHS could  do this, contract it, figure it out, train the people at all these  ports of entry, and do that in 30 days. It can't be done.   The Coast Guard, a DHS component, had a disastrous experience trying  to implement an EHR in about 40 clinics between 2010 and 2015, and they  spent $67 million and gave up.   So if we can't deliver a modern healthcare record system to our men  and women who put their lives on the line without spending billions of  dollars and the better part of a decade,  [[Page H8036]]  why would we rush to develop one that is doomed to failure for people  who are knowingly breaking our laws?   Until the VA and DOD have secured a fully interoperable record for  our servicemembers, we should not divert scarce resources and time  creating one for illegal immigrants.   I do want to say that I am willing to work with the other side in any  way, in all ways, to improve the health care of the people who come  here. We are Americans. That is what we do, and we are the best in the  world at it.   So if you want to sit down and work out an issue and a problem with  me, I am more than happy to do that.                                time  1545     ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the life of Sergeant Mike McInturff who passed away September 10. I was  honored to have known Mike, and I want to extend my deepest condolences  to his family, especially his wife of 34 years, Debbie Nelson  McInturff.   From the time he was a child, Mike dreamed of being a fireman. It  takes a selfless determination to take on the challenges first  responders face every day, and Mike served faithfully as a volunteer  and a professional firefighter for 39 years. I am grateful for Mike's  work in this role, where he touched countless lives in Northeast  Tennessee.  [[Page H8043]]    I am especially thankful for him being one of the heroic boots-on- the-ground firefighters in my hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee, when  it experienced its worst-ever disaster on Christmas Eve 1989. For 5  hours, fire crews worked tirelessly as the fire spread throughout the  city's tallest building, the John Sevier apartment building.   Our community mourned the 16 lives claimed by that tragedy. And my  church, Munsey Memorial United Methodist Church, served as a morgue  that Christmas Eve night.   It is my honor to recognize the life of Sergeant Mike McInturff and  commend him for his 39 faithful years of service. My prayers are with  his family and friends during this difficult time.                            ____________________     ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding.   It was, indeed, a privilege to be on the trip with the group. It was  a great group.   I also thank our leader, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, for keeping a stiff  upper lip when her clothes didn't get there for a few days.   I was in Israel 10 years ago, so this was my first trip back in 10  years. I saw a dramatic change in that country.   I grew up on a farm, so I am very, very interested in the agriculture  in that country. One of the things that I saw that had changed in that  country was they had developed the ability to desalinate seawater.  Sixty percent of the water that they get in that country now is  desalinated seawater. They are able to take a desert and actually  sustain a fairly substantial population on it.   When we visited the Sea of Galilee in Tiberias, I also noticed that  the Sea of Galilee was up since the last time I was there. It had  actually come up. It had a wet winter.   Up on the Golan, which overlooks the Sea of Galilee, which the  Israelis captured in the 1967 war, that is one of the best agricultural  areas in the Middle East, probably. Let us not forget that it is still  a very dangerous piece of real estate.   Most people don't realize how small that country actually is. There  are places in Israel from the Green Line. That is the fence separating  the Palestinian Authority and Israel. It is 9 miles. One of the  officials there laughingly said that when President George Bush was  there, he said: We have driveways in Texas longer than that.   He is almost right. You don't appreciate how small that country is  and what they have been able to accomplish.   From an economic standpoint, I am a former mayor, and one of the  things as  [[Page H8048]]  a mayor that you do is try to develop and sell your city and develop  businesses in that city. What I saw was the Judea and Samaria Chamber  of Commerce did not exist when I was there 10 years ago. It is very  new, 18 months old. I am going to introduce them to our Chamber of  Commerce in the U.S. so that they can get together.   You saw people--not nations, but people--working together to make  life better for their community. This is their home, and they want  their home to be as safe and good as it can be.   I want to say this about Mr. Jaber. He is a very brave man. I told  him that not everybody agrees with what he is doing in this, and he did  not care. He represented a large family in that region, in Hebron,  where he is and where his family resides.   What they want is they want freedom. They want the ability to work.  They want the ability to worship like anybody else wants. They want the  same things you and I do.   In this piece of real estate, there are a lot of bad actors there. If  you go down to the Gaza Strip, it is the poverty that is there.   By the way, we know that in southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah and  Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups live, Iran is funding those.  Israel has to deal with that.   We made a trip to Golan Heights. We looked and could see a very green  Israel where it had been farmed and irrigated, and we saw a very  desolate looking Syria, where there has been a war for over 10 years.  Five hundred thousand people, the population of Washington, D.C., had  been killed there during that civil war. It is really incredibly sad.   I think one of the things I looked at was how you defend them. I am  an old second infantry guy in the Army, so how do you defend this real  estate?   We had an opportunity to meet with some of the Israeli officials, and  they showed us their defense systems. Every new home in that country  built since 1998, I believe, has to have a safe room, so a room that  has reinforced concrete, rebar, that you can get your family in almost  immediately.   We take these liberties and freedoms that we have for granted in this  country, where we are safe to go wherever we want to go and drive where  we want to. We saw roads in areas that are marked A, B, and C. In A  area, a Jew cannot go there. You are not allowed to go there.   We have, in this country, been free for a third century, and we don't  appreciate that as much as when you go to a place like that and realize  you can't go exactly where you want to. There is always a worry when  you are on the beach or out at dinner or at a restaurant with your  family: Is this going to be the night that a terrorist attack occurs?   There was much improvement from 10 years ago.   With the gentlewoman from Missouri, who I hope to get to see next  week in Missouri when I visit there, we visited with her family and got  to see some of the most amazing sights. From my standpoint as a  Christian, it was incredibly uplifting to me to walk on the steps where  Jesus walked, to be able to see where Abraham, perhaps, almost  sacrificed Jacob.   We saw a lot of those areas that we read about but had never really  seen them. It really brought the Bible to life for me. That was really  good.   Meeting with the Prime Minister, he spent an enormous amount of time,  considering what was on his plate--an election. He had that on his  plate, but he was very generous with his time.                                time  1830    He spent a lot of time considering what was on his plate: an  election. He had that on his plate, but he was very generous with his  time. I remember asking him, I said: What keeps you up at night? What  wakes you up?   And it didn't take him 2 seconds. He said: The red phone, because  there is almost not a night that he is not dealing with something  incredibly serious in that small country.   So I wish them well, and I certainly would encourage others to study  this part of the country. It is an amazing country.   I will say this: There for thousands of years. And we saw artifacts  and buildings that were thousands of years old. We think of our country  being 300 years old or 400 years old, and this area is thousands of  years old. So anything that you dig in Jerusalem, especially, you are  going to find something when you dig under the ground that has been  there for many years.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, just to continue with Mr.  Jabari, to put this in perspective for people. He worked for the  Palestinian Authority for over 10 years as one of their security  people. He saw it was not working.   He pointed out, when we were in his home: We had a 4-year election 15  years ago. This term of the leadership was supposed to be for 4 years,  and that was 15 years ago.   So they knew they had no power. They had elected these folks, and he  saw his people were not improving; their plight was not improving. So  he thought: I am going to do something different.   And that is exactly what he struck out. And as I said, this gentleman  right here on this photo is a very brave man, and I wish him nothing  but the absolute best.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I think he had his people  at heart and his family at heart and the Palestinians at heart, and I  see nothing but good things if peace can break out.   Another thing we did that I think was extremely important was go to  the training center and visit there. This is a leadership training  center. Some 60,000 people have been through it in Israel.   The day we were there, there were a group of Palestinian Girl Scouts  there team building, and it was fun to kind of watch them.   I was actually much happier watching them on the ground. They were  climbing up on these ropes and everything.   But they were there with their Scout leader going through the  leadership training. This is building bonds and friendship that will,  hopefully, last for generations.   I think the other thing that the Palestinian Authority, that Mr.  Jabari pointed out, he said that, of all the money that the United  States has given the Palestinian Authority, they have not built one  school or one hospital for the people.   So where did the money go?   We heard that day when we were there that there is actually a bounty  from the Palestine Authority if you kill a Jew, if you kill another  human being, that your family that is left is given money each month.                                time  1845    That is very difficult to get to a peaceful situation, and that is  why I am so respectful of Mr. Jabari, because he put himself in harm's  way to try to make the plight of his people better. And he is doing it.   A couple of other things that I think we learned on this trip was how  many  [[Page H8050]]  businesses are thriving in Israel. So the next time you get in your  car, Mr. Speaker, and you start driving down the road, and your car  automatically brakes, your steering wheel shakes when you get out of  the lane as you look at your cellphone--and you shouldn't--this  driverless car technology was developed in Israel. I think Intel has  now bought the company. So when you see a car driving without anybody  in it, that technology began in Israel.   Another thing that really surprised me that is a difference, it is a  game changer in that country, was the fact that they discovered natural  gas. They are now a net exporter of energy. They actually export to  Egypt. So it really stabilized them from an energy standpoint where  they are not so dependent. America's independence also contributes to  their safety.   Let me go over why that is important. Forty-plus years ago, we had an  oil embargo by OPEC in this country. We had lines. Every other day we  had to get in a line to get gas. I happened to be a young Army officer  11 miles south of the DMZ in Korea during the winter. We got heat 3  hours a day because of this embargo. We had to use our fuel for our  tanks, Cobra gunships, Huey helicopters, and other equipment that we  had. So we didn't have any to heat the place we were in, and it was  incredibly miserable there.   I saw oil used as a political weapon back then. The fact is that this  country is now energy independent. We had three huge tankers get  diverted by Iran. We had an attack that took out almost 6 million  barrels of oil a day. Because of the energy policies in this country,  there was hardly a hiccup. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, if we had been  in the same situation 40 years ago, gas would have been two or three  times what it is. It would have created great hardships in this  country.   So the fact is that Israel is there helping. They are making friends.  They have a great partnership. I give President Carter a shout-out.  Anwar Sadat died because of that partnership that occurred, and peace  has broken out between the Israelis, the Egyptians, and the Jordanians.   Do they still have differences?   Yes. But they are civil to each other, and they are working those  differences out. Saudi Arabia--who would have ever thought--I remember  Prime Minister Netanyahu said: Who would have ever thought Israeli  airplanes would be flying over Saudi Arabia?   They are now. So you can see a change that has occurred in the last  10 years that I found astonishing.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, one of the young ladies  took a lot of encouragement. I do remember that. She was having a hard  time, but she made it across finally.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Wagner mentioned  that I hope that the Palestinians find peace and prosperity. They have  long suffered, and many in Gaza still do. In Hebron where Mr. Jabari  was, peace and prosperity is breaking out there.   I wish them nothing but the best, and I hope they are successful in  their endeavor.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I say God bless the  Palestinians and Israelis. We wish them nothing but the best.
