 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the conferees to strike  this truly abhorrent provision from the National Defense Authorization  Act.   As several of my colleagues have pointed out, when this bill went out  of committee, out of the Armed Services Committee, it passed with a  very strong bipartisan 58-1 vote. Then extremists within the Republican  Party got ahold of it and made floor amendments and put in poison  pills, including this one, in the bill.   A couple of facts: Number one, no taxpayer money is going to provide  abortions for servicemembers. The longstanding policy of the Department  of Defense is we allow servicemembers to travel for necessary medical  procedures and care when they can't get that care on a base or locally.  That is longstanding policy. That is what we are talking about here  today.   You have also heard a bunch of my colleagues get up today and say  this has nothing to do with national defense, that this is superfluous;  nothing to do with the national defense of our country. Really?   We can spend money and buy all the best tanks and aircraft carriers  and missiles that money can buy, but what actually makes us strong? It  is our people. Our people are behind all of that. What undergirds  people is the trust within a unit.   I served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I can tell you,  if you don't trust the person you are going to war with, it is all  meaningless.   Are we really going to set up a system where our women servicemembers  are second-class citizens within our units and undermine the very trust  and integrity of those units? No, we should not and will not. I will  stand against that.   Number two, we are suffering historic recruiting shortages in our  military. Are we really going to send a message to our young women who  want to stand up and serve our country and maybe give their lives, that  they can't access the same care as their male counterparts?                                time  1245     Is that the message we want to send? No. You can't say you  are for our national security and also support this measure. More than  anything else, this is a moral argument.   I don't want to see yellow ribbons tied around trees, I don't want to  see people thank people for their service, I don't want to see 10  percent discounts on coffee or meals if they are willing to support a  policy that undermines the morality of this country and the ability of  our young men and women to get the care they need and for our young  servicewomen, in particular, to be treated equally.
