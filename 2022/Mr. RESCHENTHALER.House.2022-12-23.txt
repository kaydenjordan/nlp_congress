 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Rules Committee for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, when I joined the Rules Committee, Chairman McGovern was  incredibly welcoming and has been totally aboveboard. It has been a  pleasure to work with Mr. McGovern, and it is a pleasure that he and I  get to debate the last rule here for the 117th Congress. It is an  honor, and I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I look forward to  continuing to work with him on the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of a  4,000-page omnibus package that puts America last. This bill was  crafted behind closed doors, it was released in the middle of the  night, and it received absolutely no input from House Republicans.   So, instead of responsibly governing, House Democrats are trying to  ram through trillions of dollars in new spending in the final days of  this lameduck session. No Congress in recent history has passed an  omnibus appropriations bill during a lameduck session following a shift  of power in the House.   To do so this year would be a violation of congressional precedent  and a flagrant disregard for the American people who voted in new  leadership in the House. This omnibus package will not unleash American  energy. It won't reign in out-of-control inflation, which is caused by  reckless spending.   Here we are just 3 days away from Christmas, and more than one- quarter of Americans are expected to go into debt over Christmas costs,  and about half are saying that they are going to cut back on holiday  shopping altogether.   Sadly, this comes as the majority of Americans have already reported  an increase in personal debt this year as inflation outpaces their  income.   So instead of working on providing Americans with relief, this  legislation is a last-ditch effort by Democrats to force their far left  radical agenda on the American people before the clock runs out on the  one-party rule that we have come to know in Washington.   Further, despite the ongoing border crisis and Democrats' eagerness  to let title 42 expire, this package effectively reduces funding for  border enforcement and fails to include tougher policies that would  actually address issues at the border.   Specifically, this bill increases nondefense spending by $57 billion,  yet there is no increase in funding for ICE enforcement and removal  operations,  [[Page H10065]]  and there is no increase for Border Patrol agent hiring, which is  already grossly underfunded.   Yet, in this bill the TSA received a drastic increase to give TSA  officers a raise.   So the men and women at the southern border that are stopping  fentanyl from coming across the border, stopping terrorists,  apprehending terrorists at the southern border, they are underfunded,  yet the person that is wanding down your grandmother at the airport and  taking your toothpaste, they get the raise. That is how backward this  omnibus is.   Almost 5 million illegal immigrants have been apprehended at the  southern border since Joe Biden took office. That is not including the  1 million got-aways that have not been apprehended at all. That is 1  million people that are in this country that we have no control over,  we don't know where they are, and they crossed illegally.   Illegal immigrants who entered this country under Biden's border  crisis will now cost U.S. taxpayers $20 billion a year on top of the  trillions in spending Democrats are trying to pass just today.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let's just talk briefly about all the junk that is in this omnibus.  This omnibus increases funding for nondefense programs by 8 percent in  addition to the trillions of dollars that have been spent over the  last 2 years.    There is over $12 billion for the IRS on top of the nearly $80  billion provided to the IRS with the Inflation Reduction Act.   There is a 12 percent increase for climate research for the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   You have got over $3 billion for pie-in-the-sky renewable energy  programs with the Department of Energy. That is a historic high, by the  way.   You have a 22 percent increase for Climate Adaptation Science Centers  in the U.S. Geological Survey.   You have a 20 percent increase for the Biden White House.   You have a 125 percent increase in loan authority for The Presidio  Trust, which is a parochial priority of Speaker Pelosi's that has  already received $70 million in loan authority since fiscal year 2020.   So think about that when we go to vote on this trillion dollar  omnibus, all the junk and wasteful spending that is in here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Bucshon), my good friend and a good doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   To my knowledge, this is a lameduck session. I am not sure if  Democrats have changed the definition of ``lameduck.'' I know they  tried to change the definition of ``recession'' this year, too. So I  guess the language is constantly changing under this one-party rule  here in Washington, D.C.   When we on this side of the aisle talk about inflation and the harm  to American families, this isn't something that is just theoretical.  [[Page H10066]]    Let's put this in context. Since January of 2021, Democrats have  spent $3 trillion on partisan spending bills. Again, this is a key  driver of inflation. Bidenflation is America's unwanted guest at a  Christmas dinner table for the second year in a row.   With inflation remaining high, families across the country will pay  16.4 percent more for Christmas dinner compared to last year. The  majority of Americans reported an increase in personal debt this year,  and the top reason given was rising inflation and declining real wages.   As of December, the share of Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck in  Joe Biden's economy has risen to 63 percent. Let that sink in. Sixty- three percent of Americans in Biden's economy are living paycheck-to- paycheck.   Families across the country are still paying more for just about  everything. Fuel. Fuel is up 65.7 percent. Eggs are up about 50  percent. Air fares are up 36 percent. Butter and margarine, they are up  34 percent. Bread is up 15.7 percent. Milk is up by about 15 percent.  Electricity is up by about 14 percent. Energy altogether is up over 30  percent.    So that is what you expect in Joe Biden's economy, and this $1.7  trillion spending bill will do nothing more but drive up inflation even  more and reduce real wages down further.   For more on this, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from the great  State of Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Massachusetts was talking about  priorities. So let's look at some of the national security priorities  in this omnibus.   There is a $65 million increase for the United Nations Relief and  Works Agency which, for those of you who don't know, produces materials  promoting terrorism and anti-Semitism.   While we are talking about anti-Semitism, let's talk about the U.N.'s  Commission of Inquiry. I had an amendment in the State and Foreign  Operations Subcommittee to make sure that no U.S. taxpayer dollars went  to the Commission of Inquiry on Israel, which does nothing more than  harass our Israeli allies and harasses the only Jewish majority state  in the world. Yet, that amendment that I had was stripped out of this  omnibus.   This also allows the U.S. to continue to cooperate with the  International Criminal Court, which is deeply flawed. As a former JAG,  I can tell you that that court is incredibly unfair to U.S.  servicemembers as well as Israel.   This also underfunds foreign military financing requests from Egypt  and Taiwan. So we give billions of dollars to Ukraine with zero  accountability as to where those funds are going. There is no SIGAR- style oversight on that. Yet our allies in Taiwan and our allies in  Egypt are underfunded.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett) to talk more on this omnibus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this omnibus underfunds border security. Let's just give  a few stats.   This year, 98 suspected terrorists have been apprehended attempting  to cross the southern border.   There were more than 14,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl seized in  fiscal year 2022. That is just what was seized. But we know that we  only seize 5 to 10 percent of the fentanyl coming across our border,  and that has deadly consequences for Americans. There has been a 94  percent increase in fentanyl deaths since 2019.   To put that in context, that is one fentanyl overdose every 7 minutes  in the U.S. For more context on that, that would be the equivalent of  one commercial airliner going down every single day in this country. It  is an unmitigated disaster, and it is being caused because we have such  a porous southern border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Texas (Mr. Sessions), who is a former chairman of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), my good friend and the next Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my good friend.  [[Page H10071]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from the great State of Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Garcia) my good friend and fellow Naval officer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), my good friend, and also fellow  Naval officer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I say again that in modern American history, a lameduck  omnibus package has never been passed before the new majority takes  over.   Where is the claim that there is a threat to democracy? Where is the  talk about institutional integrity when we are doing this unprecedented  step?   This package is designed to sideline the incoming Republican House  majority, to sideline incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy by extending many  programs in this bill for multiple years and providing large funding  increases for Democrat priorities. This is on top of the out-of-control  spending that has led to historic inflation rates this year.   Why are we not curbing wasteful government spending? Why are we not  funding border security and border enforcement? Why are we not  unleashing American energy dominance? Why are we not investing in our  law enforcement officers?   This omnibus does nothing to effectively address any of the crises  that we are currently facing.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 215,  nays 206, not voting 10, as follows:                               [Roll No. 547]                                 YEAS--215       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
