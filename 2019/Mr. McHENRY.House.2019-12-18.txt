 Mr. Speaker, in 2016, 63 million Americans went to the  polls and elected Donald Trump President of the United States. House  Democrats have been trying to overturn the election ever since. In  fact, they have tried five additional times to the one that is before  us to impeach the President, including the vote in May 2017, just 5  months into his term.   In January of this year, House Democrats took control of this  Chamber, and they were faced with a choice. They could use the tools of  the majority to pursue legitimate priorities of the American people,  policies that can impact their lives, or they could use the tools to  undo the 2016 election. They made their choice.   Since then, House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than bills  have been signed into law. That tells us all we need to know about this  Congress and that party.   Rather than launch a legitimate investigation, Democrats turn to  focus groups to workshop their language, to see if they could sell this  to the American people, and the American people have rejected it.   Instead of negotiating with the executive branch, for instance, and  allowing the courts to resolve any legitimate disputes, House Democrats  rushed toward an impeachment vote.   So here we are, 12 weeks later, voting whether to impeach the  President based off the thinnest record in modern history. It is no  surprise that the Senate is already asking for additional witnesses,  more documents, and real evidence. The body of evidence is weak and  woefully insufficient for impeachment.
