 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Rubio, Peters, and I be allowed to complete our remarks before the  scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, I am here today to talk about those things  that unite us as Americans, and I am here to talk about those things  that divide us.   For centuries, public service has been something that unites  Americans, drawing us together. Citizens from all walks of life serve  in our military. They serve in Federal and State and local governments.  They serve in police units and in fire departments across our country.  They serve as teachers and coaches. And we as a nation are better off  for their service and for their sacrifice.   Those who serve our Nation do it not because they have to but because  they want to. They do it because they believe this Nation is worth  serving. They do it because they believe this Nation is worth  defending. They believe it is worth celebrating. And they are right to  think all of those things. Service to this country is an act of  selflessness that affirms our Nation is a place worth believing in.   But I am concerned that the present administration and this  President, President Joe Biden, do not share this point of view. I am  worried that President Biden is nominating for Federal office  individuals who do not share a view of America as a good and decent  place, who do not believe that the history of this Nation is worth  celebrating; nominating, instead, people who believe that this is a  country founded in racism and shot through with corruption.   Many of these nominees are partisans of a viewpoint that goes by  different names but shares several features in common--a view that  America is a systemically racist place and systemically unjust; a view  of America as corrupt; a view of American society as one that needs to  be deconstructed, that needs to be pulled apart, torn down, and then  rebuilt in a fundamentally different way.   Now, this broad ideology has become known in public as critical race  theory or sometimes just critical theory. And let me tell you, as  someone who has taught in our Nation's universities, someone who has  seen our institutions of higher learning up close, I would say to those  in the media and elsewhere who now deny that there is any such thing as  critical theory, that critical theory is, in fact, very real, it is  very influential, and it appears to have become the animating ideology  of this administration. That is cause for great concern.   Critical theory is an ideology that says the United States is rotten  to its core. The leaders of this movement think our society is defined  by White supremacy. They think our leaders are complicit, at best.   They think that all Americans are either oppressors or oppressed. In  our world-class military, these critics see a vehicle for  discrimination. In our American flag, they see propaganda. In our  family businesses, they see White supremacy. In our police officers,  they see agents of racial oppression.   These critics allow no room for merit, for experience, or for grace  in our life together. They pit Whiteness and Blackness against each  other in a manner that reduces every American, no matter their  character or their creed, to their racial identity alone.   One of these critics, Dr. Ibram Kendi wrote this:         The only remedy to past discrimination is present       discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is       future discrimination.    That is right. That is what he said. Think about that for a moment.  He is saying he is opposed to equality under the law. He is opposing  our merit-based system for Federal employment. Dr. Kendi and his  followers are in no uncertain terms advocating for State-sanctioned  racism in the United States of America.   Now, it is a free country. Dr. Kendi and these other authors can  write their books and debate their views and put them out in public. It  is absolutely their right to do so. They are welcome to do so. But what  we cannot allow--what we must not allow--is our Federal Government to  affirm and sanction and advocate this critical race theory. We cannot  allow the United States of America, the greatest Nation on Earth, to  legitimize a new era of racial engineering.   In the past few years, critical race theory has gained new prominence  in the giant corporations, in the media, in the military, and even in  our children's schools. We are seeing this across the country. We have  seen too many of our children exposed to a curriculum like the 1619  Project and its derivatives that encourage division rather than unity,  that rewrites our history in the service of an ideological agenda  rather than in the service of truth.   Young children set off to school with eyes full of hope and hearts,  full of pride in our country, only to be taught that White privilege  defines the Nation, that subjects like mathematics are inherently  racist, that the Christian faith is oppressive. They are taught that  the nuclear family perpetuates racism.   Now, imagine for a moment if you were taught the same. Imagine if you  were taught that your dreams were unjust or unfair, that your family  were oppressors, that you were at fault for the problems of our society  today. These are just children. We should be nurturing their dreams. We  should be nurturing their hopes. We should be giving them a great hope  for the future, for the future of this great Nation known as the United  States of America, a hope for the future of the greatest Nation in the  history of the world, rather than teaching them to mistrust their  classmates and to distrust their own history.   It doesn't end there. Last year, we discovered that Federal agencies  and other organizations funded by taxpayers were holding workplace  training sessions where Federal employees were told that ``virtually  all White people contribute to racism''--that is a quote--or where  civil servants were required to say that they ``benefit from racism.''   Now, President Trump put an end to this divisive curriculum, and he  was right to do so. Workplace diversity training should focus on  bringing people together, not on driving them apart. But under this new  administration, I fear that critical theory is making a comeback.   In March, President Biden rescinded the former President's ban on  this divisive curriculum, and now, he has nominated Kiran Ahuja to be  Director of the Office of Personnel Management. That is a key position  that runs human resources for the entire Federal Government and  millions of its employees. Ms. Ahuja's nomination is before the Senate  today. I am concerned that Ms. Ahuja is a disciple of radical  theorists. She has frequently promoted Dr. Kendi. She called him a  ``thought leader'' at her confirmation hearing back in April. Just last  year, Ms. Ahuja wrote that we must free the Nation from the ``daily  trials of White supremacy.'' Those are her words.   She appeared to endorse Dr. Kendi's claim that the election of  President  [[Page S4670]]  Trump in 2016 was an example of ``racist progress'' in this country,  and she declared that we must do everything in our collective power to  realize Dr. Kendi's vision for America.   I am concerned that, as the Federal Government's HR director, Ms.  Ahuja could use her platform to promote radical ideologies that seek to  divide rather than unite people. She could bring critical race theory  back into Federal Government training and to every level of Federal  personnel, stronger than ever. And I am not alone in this concern. All  of my Republican colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee opposed  Ms. Ahuja in a vote back in April   Two weeks ago, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association--they  represent 100,000 Federal police officers that protect and defend our  Nation every day--they announced that they were also concerned about  Ms. Ahuja's nomination because of her advocacy of critical theory.   I have to say, I agree with Federal law enforcement. I agree with  what they said in their letter. We should nominate candidates for  public office that are committed to ideological neutrality, to  fairness, and to impartiality under the law. I want to be clear, I do  not for a moment question Ms. Ahuja's sincerity or integrity. In fact,  I thank her for her willingness to serve the Nation; but I cannot agree  with what appears to be her fundamental ideology. At the end of the  day, this is not about politics or personalities; this is about  ensuring that the Federal Government stands for unity, not division,  harmony, not hate.   As the Reverend Dr. King famously said, and he was right, we should  judge our fellow citizens by the content of their character, not by the  color of their skin. We need a strong nation with strong citizens who  see each other as Americans, not as oppressors or oppressed.   Now, I have heard a lot of criticism about my position here today. I  have heard the corporate media and those on the left say that I  misunderstand critical theory or that it is not real or that it is not  a real problem. I have heard many say the United States is indeed built  on oppression and remains a systemically racist place.   All I can say is that is not the America I see, that is not the  America I know. The working people of this country who have rallied to  this Nation's flag in every hour of danger, who are the first to help a  neighbor in need, who coach our Little Leagues and volunteer at our  churches, who go to work day in and day out to provide for their  families and protect the place they call home, these are not  oppressors; these are liberators. These are not oppressors; these are  great people. They live with a spirit of liberty that has made this  country the greatest country in the history of the world, and they want  to see that liberty extended to every member of the American family.  That is who the American people are. That is what makes them great.  That is what they believe--because they are a great people. Our future  is a cause for hope and not despair.   The advocates of critical theory tell us we have to dismantle our  culture, our history, our families, our Jewish and Christian heritage  and beliefs because they are all oppressive. They say the future of  this Nation will be defined by racial division and racial strife. I  reject that prophecy of our future, and I take my stand on the goodness  of the American people and the God who guides us. I take my stand on  hope.   It is not oppression that defines the American story. It is hope.  From the minutemen at Lexington and Concord, to the pioneers who found  a new life in the West, to the heroes of the Underground Railroad, to  the Union soldiers at Little Round Top, to the workers who fought the  old monopolies for fair pay, to the women who fought for suffrage, to  the young men who twice liberated Europe, to the civil rights  demonstrators likes of Bull Connor, to the firemen and police officers  who rebuilt New York and gave this country confidence again in the  years after 9/11, it is love for one another and love for our country  that we call home that has defined our story and given us hope; and  that love and that hope will define our future once again. I am  confident of it.   In this Nation, we are not united by ethnic creed or race or  religion--and proudly so. We are united by our shared history. We are  united by what we love together. We are united by the radical belief  that those who liberate others, those who practice grace and mercy,  those who call forth the best in those around them, they are the ones  who changed the world; and that principle, that truth, that hope, is  what drives our history. And we are not done building that history yet.  The greatest Nation in the history of the world is not done yet.   Critical theory in all of its guises distorts our history, it  destroys our common love, and it would leave us hopelessly divided, at  enmity with one another and alone. To this dark vision, we must say no.  To radical hope, we must say yes.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote no on Ms. Ahuja's  nomination.   I yield the floor.
