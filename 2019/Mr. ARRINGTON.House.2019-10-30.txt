 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, there is a Navajo saying that a rocky  vineyard does not need a prayer but a pickax.   We don't need protectionist prayers from elites in Washington who  think they have all the answers; we need a pickax for prosperity and  opportunity for folks living in rural America and the Navajo people in  New Mexico.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 2181, the  Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act.   My amendment would prevent the proposed ban on future oil and gas  development from going into effect in an area that already has adequate  protections, protections that are there to ensure that these operations  won't have any adverse impact on historic and sacred lands in the Chaco  Canyon Historic Park.   The reality is there are already a litany of State and Federal laws  in place to ensure environmental protection and to prevent mineral  development from affecting sensitive infrastructure and sacred  artifacts within this exclusion zone.   Energy companies have had a positive track record when it comes to  working with the Federal Government to comply with these laws for  necessary permits and approvals. And, since producers already meet the  standards set in several comprehensive environmental laws, this  proposed ban on new oil and gas development in this area, in my  opinion, is unnecessary, is misguided, and is overreaching.   In fact, drilling for minerals already prohibited within the Chaco  Canyon Historic Park, keeping the culturally sensitive artifacts safe  from any sort of potential disturbance caused by oil and gas  development, this bill is nothing more than a buffer zone on top of an  already existing buffer zone that has protected cultural artifacts  effectively for 100 years, Mr. Chairman.                                time  1600    Unfortunately, if enacted, this bill would create significant access  and extraction complications for the Navajos. This adverse impact would  be a result of the checkerboard nature of the mineral rights and how  Federal, State, Tribal, and private lands are intersecting.   Even though the area is proven to house abundant oil and gas  reserves, the restrictions on accessing Federal land would make doing  business in that area almost impossible, leading to a de facto  extraction ban on the Navajo's privately-owned mineral rights. The so- called buffer zone imposed by the bill is arbitrary and completely  unnecessary, again, in my opinion.   The whole purpose of establishing the Chaco Culture National  Historical Park was to protect every area of historic significance and,  again, it has worked for a century now. That goal has already been  achieved. The protection is already ensured. Extending the boundaries  and adding acreage to the heritage area will not enhance protection of  areas of historical significance, but instead, will limit the potential  of private landowners to steward and reap the rewards of their  privately held land passed down to them from their ancestors.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Private property rights are a cornerstone of our democracy and our  free society. That doesn't just extend to folks in Texas, New Mexico,  Oklahoma. It extends to all Americans and our Tribal brothers and  sisters. One of them who testified at one of the hearings, who is a  member of the Navajo Nation, said that this is a steadfast personal  property right that sustains our livelihoods and our way of life. This  is a much-needed source of income to feed, shelter, clothe, and protect  our families.   Mr. Chairman, this is unnecessary. This is one of those times where  Washington thinks it has the solution, where we sit in our ivory tower  and dictate the terms to folks living in rural communities in New  Mexico and throughout the country, folks that depend on these energy  jobs for their livelihoods, and I just trust that the local community  and the great State of New Mexico knows best how to manage their  resources.   This is not disturbing any sacred land or historic artifacts. That is  not what this is about. This is about a protectionist, activist view to  ban drilling, in my opinion. And the State of New  [[Page H8636]]  Mexico is incredibly dependent on the oil and gas revenues, Mr.  Chairman. A third of their budget, Mr. Chairman, is reliant on oil and  gas royalties.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is  critical to make sure that our colleagues know that Washington doesn't  have the solutions.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Yes, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, at the heart of America's economic  prosperity and unrivaled security is an abundant, affordable, and  reliable supply of domestic energy. American energy independence is,  undoubtedly, a matter of national security, but it is also a question  of life and death to many rural economies.   In west Texas, and for my neighbors in eastern New Mexico, energy  producers are as crucial to our communities as educators, healthcare  providers, and agricultural producers. Traditional sources of energy  make up 90 percent of our Nation's energy supply and support over 10  million jobs in this great country.   In New Mexico alone, Mr. Speaker, more than 100,000 jobs are oil and  gas related. A whopping one-third of the State's budget comes from oil  and gas revenues. That is over $2 billion, half of which supports  funding public education.   Thousands of Navajo landowners receive millions of dollars every year  from oil and gas royalties. Putting a permanent ban on any future  mineral development outside the National Park would be devastating for  local economies, the Navajo people, and the entire State of New Mexico.   Therefore, my motion to recommit will prevent this legislation from  taking effect until it is confirmed that New Mexico will not suffer  this severe economic harm resulting in a loss of revenue. That is  revenue used to fund schools, roads, hospitals, and other important  public services.   Mr. Speaker, while this bill claims not to infringe on the private  property rights of the Navajo people, the reality is that many of their  lands are surrounded by Federal lands, making it virtually impossible  to develop if this legislation were to pass.   H.R. 2181, let's be clear, would eliminate key revenue sources used  for public services. It would destroy jobs and economic activity there  in New Mexico and, ultimately, threaten the livelihood of the Navajo  people.   This, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, would be an absolute travesty for  the Navajo people because the poverty rate in the Navajo Nation is more  than three times the national average, about 38 percent. The  unemployment rate is more than five times the national average, 20-plus  percent. Almost half of all Navajo children live in poverty.   Oil- and gas-related employment is critical to jobs and income in  these isolated areas where the Navajo people live. It is  unconscionable, Mr. Speaker, that a handful of activists should be able  to deprive the Navajo Nation of opportunities to find work,  opportunities to lease their own mineral rights, and opportunities to  lift themselves up out of poverty by reaping the benefits of their own  land.   Mr. Speaker, there is an old Navajo saying: ``A rocky vineyard does  not need a prayer, but a pickax.''   The Navajo people don't need more protectionists' prayers from  Washington elite and environmental activists. They need the pickax of  prosperity and opportunity that comes from freedom, and the ability to  manage their own private property rights and their own private mineral  rights.   The Navajo people are a proud people, just like all Americans, and  they just want an opportunity for a better life for themselves and  their families.   Mr. Speaker, this is a classic case of a solution looking for a  problem. I ask my colleagues to support this motion to recommit and  vote ``no'' on H.R. 2181.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H8640]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.
