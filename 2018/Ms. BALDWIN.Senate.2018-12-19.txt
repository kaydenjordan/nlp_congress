 Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to come  together and do the right thing for our veterans by passing the blue  water Navy legislation. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his  leadership, and I join him in appreciating the remarks of the Senator  from Georgia in support of advancing this legislation in the final days  of this session.   As a result of the VA changing its policy, Vietnam blue water Navy  veterans have to meet higher burdens of proof to receive healthcare and  disability benefits that they earned due to their exposure to Agent  Orange.   I have heard from many veterans and their families from across  Wisconsin asking that the Senate pass this bill because they don't have  any more time to wait.   A veteran's family from Reedsburg, WI, wrote to me. They wrote:         Senator Baldwin, my brother-in-law did three tours off the       coast of Vietnam on an ammunition ship. He has contracted       brain cancer, lung cancer, diabetes and hearing loss. We have       submitted a request for compensation for these ailments. All       requests have been denied and we are still appealing. This       House bill passed unanimously and now languishes in the       Senate. My brother-in-law is in hospice with limited time       remaining. Please pass this legislation.    I heard from a veteran from Stetsonville, WI. He said:         I served in the U.S. Navy and spent 1966 aboard the USS       Intrepid as a gun fire controlman. I have been diagnosed with       stage 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and large hairy cell leukemia.       The lymphoma is currently in remission, but the leukemia is       untreatable.        On August 10, 2018, I had open-heart quintuple-bypass       surgery as well. My children and grandchildren are suffering       from my exposure to the dioxins found in Agent Orange which       polluted the waters of the Tonkin Gulf. Please get the VA to       do its job of caring for, treating, and recognizing the       service-connected disability of the many Navy vets now       suffering.        The money for this care was originally provided for, prior       to 1991, when the VA arbitrarily disallowed the gulf sailors.       It is time to correct this breach of promise to care for our       veterans, and I am asking for your help in getting the Blue       Water Navy bill passed in the Senate, as it was unanimously       passed in the House.   [[Page S7837]]     I am disappointed that Senator Blumenthal's request to pass this bill  was just objected to by my colleague from Utah. Some of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have argued that we can't afford the  cost of this legislation, but I heard no such objections when those  same colleagues voted for a very partisan tax bill that gave huge tax  breaks to the largest corporations and added $1.9 trillion to our  Nation's debt. Now, when it comes to doing right by our Vietnam  veterans who served this country and are now dying from their  illnesses, we don't have the money to spend to help get them better or  to help give their families a little more time with them. That is  simply wrong.   How much is it costing blue water Navy veterans who are trying to  beat cancer? How much is it costing their caregivers who quit their  jobs in order to take care of them? We have a moral obligation to fix  this, and we have the opportunity to get this done right now.   These veterans fought for us and are dying from their service- connected illnesses. It is past time to do the right thing and pass  this bill. We need to do it now, and we should not leave town until it  is done.   Thank you.   I yield back to Senator Blumenthal.
