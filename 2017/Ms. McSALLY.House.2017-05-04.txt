 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  2192, a measure that eliminates double standards by preventing Members  of Congress from being exempt from the State waiver provisions of the  American Health Care Act, as amended.   Due to very arcane Senate procedural rules within the budget  reconciliation process, the MacArthur amendment to the American Health  Care Act does not and cannot apply to Members of Congress. To address  this, I have introduced this simple, standalone, two-page bill that  would appeal the exemption for Members of Congress should the American  Health Care Act become law.   In the military, the same code of conduct and standards apply to the  entire chain of command. Now, in my role as a lawmaker, I believe that  any law we pass that applies to our constituents must also apply  equally to Members of Congress. Individuals who are stewards of the  public trust must abide by the rules that they make. My bill, H.R.  2192, will ensure that Congress abides by the laws they pass and is  treated no differently than other hardworking Americans.   Regardless of your vote on the AHCA, this is a bill that each and  every single Member of Congress should support.
