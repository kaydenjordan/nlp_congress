 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2881,  which is critical to protecting the security of our Nation and for the  advancement of 5G.   H.R. 2881, or the Secure 5G and Beyond Act, tasks the Federal  Government with developing strategies to protect against some of the  vulnerabilities with cutting-edge five generation, or 5G, wireless  communications systems.   The rapid development of 5G cellular technologies is another example  of the resolve and innovative spirit unique to the United States  economy.   Madam Speaker, 5G will pave the way for first-of-their-kind products  and services and will more reliably give consumers quick and easy  access to information necessary to live and work in the digital age;  but the potential threats these advancements pose to our national  security, to that of our allies, and to consumer privacy cannot be  overstated, which is why I am urging my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote for this important legislation.
