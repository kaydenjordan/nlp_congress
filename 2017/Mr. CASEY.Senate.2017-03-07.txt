Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few comments about  the House Republican bill that was just unveiled yesterday. Those who  have been promoting it or those who have been working on this issue for  a couple of weeks are claiming it is a new healthcare plan or a new  comprehensive healthcare proposal--in essence, by their argument, a  replacement if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. I disagree. I  don't believe in any way it is a plan. It might be a bill, but I think  a better description of it in terms of its impact would be that it is a  scheme, not a plan. It is a scheme that will roll back coverage gains  from the Affordable Care Act, which is better known by a longer name:  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   Kaiser--one of the great institutions that track healthcare data and  healthcare policy--told us that there are 156 million Americans with  employer-sponsored coverage. Those Americans didn't have much  protection before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with  regard to preexisting conditions or annual lifetime limits--a whole  series of protections for people that were not there before that.   This scheme, as I am calling it, will not only roll back coverage  gains in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in the process  it will also devastate the Medicaid Program, leaving many of the most  vulnerable Americans behind.   Another impact of this scheme will be to increase costs for middle- class families while cutting taxes for millionaires or  multimillionaires as well as big corporations. It will raise the cost  of care for older Americans and substantially cut funding for hospitals  in rural communities.   How did we get there, and where are we going based upon the House  Republican proposal? Last night the Republicans released their bill to  ``replace'' the Affordable Care Act, and the House Energy and Commerce  Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee will be marking up the  bill tomorrow. I guess it doesn't require much reading to get to a  markup tomorrow.   Usually when you introduce a bill, the bill is reviewed by Members of  Congress. There is some public debate on it. There is some back-and- forth. And then a period of time later, maybe weeks, there is a markup.  The committee engages in a thorough review of the bill, and the markup  means they make changes. They add amendments or try to alter the bill  in one way or another. That is a serious approach when you do this work  of legislating on a serious issue.   Healthcare is about as serious and difficult an issue as there is. I  think it should be accorded the serious review that the complexity and  the consequence of this issue demand. This is not a serious proposal.  It is a scheme, but it is also not a serious process that the House  seems to be focused on right now. This process means the House will  mark up this bill within I guess about 48 hours of it being unveiled,  maybe less than 48 hours. That means there will not be a single hearing  on the bill or getting the bill scored, which is a fancy Washington  word for having someone tell us what it costs. There will be no  thorough review, no serious review on such a monumental issue called  healthcare and what happens to hundreds of millions of Americans.   At the same time, the markup will proceed with lightning speed, and  there will not be any information on the record about an analysis of  the bill that is thorough and serious, and of course we will not know  how to pay for it and we will not have the score that will tell us how  it will be paid for and what the cost will be.   It is hard to come up with the words, but the impact of this bill  would be a disaster. If you are a millionaire and up, you are doing  quite well under this bill. You are going to get a bonanza from this  bill. You are going to have a great payday. If you are a child or you  happen to be a senior or if you are a woman or if you are an individual  with a disability or a chronic disease, you are out of luck. You are in  big trouble. I would hope that those Americans would have the benefit  of a serious review of a serious issue. If the bill is not serious, I  guess they are going to ram it through. We will see what happens in the  next couple of days.   There is one analysis that should be on the record. There are some  that are hot off the presses. This is a report released today that I am  looking at. It is about 2\1/2\ pages. They know the vote will take  place soon in the committee--two committees, maybe in the House. This  report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is moving quickly  to keep up with the fast pace at which the bill is proceeding. I won't  read the whole report, and I won't enter the whole report into the  Record; I am sure people can go online and look at it. Here is the  title of the report: ``House GOP Medicaid Provisions Would Shift $370  billion in costs to states over a decade.'' It is written by Edwin  Park, who has been writing about Medicaid for a long time. Few  Americans know more about Medicaid than Edwin Park and people like him  who study it. I will read the first sentence, which gives you the  basics of it: ``The new House Republican health plan would shift an  estimated $370 billion in Medicaid costs to states over the next ten  years, effectively ending the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid  expansion for 11 million people while also harming tens of millions of  additional seniors, people with disabilities, and children and parents  who rely upon Medicaid today.''   That is the opening line of this proposal, which I believe is a  scheme. What does that mean for Medicaid?   One of the basic debates we will have here is what happens to  Medicaid itself, and we will have a lot of debates about other aspects  of the implications for the Affordable Care Act.   Here is what it means. It means that 70 million Americans who rely  upon Medicaid--again, they are children in urban areas, children in  rural areas, children in small towns who get their healthcare from  Medicaid. It is a lot of individuals with disabilities, a lot of  children with disabilities who benefit from Medicaid. It is also, of  course, pregnant women, as well as seniors trying to get into nursing  homes, because we know that a lot of seniors can't get into a nursing  home unless they have the benefits of Medicaid. The idea in the bill on  Medicaid that is objectionable, among other objections I have, is a so- called per capita cap. This idea limits Federal contributions to a  fixed amount. If the caps are not tied to overall increases in  healthcare spending, the net effect is fewer healthcare dollars over  time so they can afford the tax cuts they want to have as part of this  scheme.    We have heard a lot around here about flexibility, that States want  more flexibility when it comes to Medicaid. I will tell you what they  don't want. They don't want a flexibility argument to be a scheme that  results in cuts to those States, where the Federal Government says:  Here is a block grant that may increase or may not, but good luck,  States, as you balance your budgets.   Of course, Governors and State legislators balance their budgets, and  they have very difficult choices to make--sometimes choices the Federal  Government never makes. That is why some Republican Governors took  advantage of the Medicaid expansion and expanded healthcare to a lot of  people in their States. That is one of the reasons they are worried  about--and some will oppose this idea of so-called per capita caps or  block-granting of Medicaid or the like.   If we have a proposal to cut $370 billion from the House, what does  that mean for some of those groups that I just mentioned earlier? Well,  we know that more than 45 percent of all the births in the United  States of America are paid for by Medicaid, so that is a consequence  for pregnant women and their children. One in five seniors receives  Medicaid assistance by way of the benefit to someone trying to get into  a nursing home. Medicaid also pays for home-based care for seniors and,  of course, long-term care as well. What if you have a disability? Over  one-third of the Nation's adults with disabilities who require  extensive services and support are covered by Medicaid.   We know that in a State like mine--because we had a Republican  Governor  [[Page S1629]]  embrace the Medicaid expansion, and then we had a Democratic Governor  embrace it and really develop it and bring it to where it is today--we  have expansion of Medicaid that resulted in some 700,000--that is not  an exact number, but it is approaching 700,000 Pennsylvanians gaining  coverage through the Medicaid expansion. And 62 percent of Americans  who gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion are working. So we  are talking about a lot of families and a lot of individuals who are  working and getting their healthcare through Medicaid. That opportunity  presented itself because, in the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid was  expanded.   There are lots of numbers we could talk about. I will give maybe two  more. Medicaid is the primary payer for mental health and substance  abuse treatment. Medicaid expansion enabled 180,000 Pennsylvanians to  receive these lifesaving services. If you are a Member of Congress and  you have been going home and talking about the opioid crisis--and to  say it is a crisis is a terrible understatement. It has devastated  small towns and rural areas. It has devastated cities. It has destroyed  families. We know how bad it is. Some of the numbers indicate it is  getting worse, not leveling off. If you say you care about that and you  supported the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act as a Member of  Congress and you supported the funding that was in the 21st Century  Cures Act at the end of the year, and you say you are working toward  help for communities devastated by the opioid crisis, it is OK to say  that, but you can't then say: But I want to support the House  Republican proposal on Medicaid, when Medicaid is the primary payer for  these substance abuse treatment programs.   I mentioned before adults and children with disabilities. Medicaid  covers 60 percent of children with disabilities. We know the range of  that--ranging from autism to Down syndrome, to traumatic brain injury,  and many other disabilities or circumstances that I have not mentioned.  For a lot of people, this is real life. It is not some theory that gets  kicked around Washington, often by people who have good healthcare  coverage as they are talking about cutting healthcare for others. We  have a lot of testimony from what we might want to call the real world.   One of the most compelling pieces of correspondence I received in my  time in the Senate was from a mom about her son. Her name is Pam. She  is from Coatesville, PA. That is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, within  the range of suburban Philadelphia. She wrote to tell me how important  Medicaid is to her family and to tell me about her 5-year-old son  Rowan. She sent me a picture of Rowan with a firefighter's hat on. Of  course, he is fascinated, as we all are, by the heroic work of  firefighters. Her story--I will not go through her whole letter, but  she got news a couple of years ago that many parents get in the course  of the lives of their children. She got news in March of 2015 that her  son Rowan was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis  was made by a psychologist who worked for the Intermediate Unit-- meaning the institution that works for the school districts and helps  to provide special education. Rowan continued in the preschool program  and daycare program before and after school, but then Pam goes on to  say:         I was never able to find a daycare suitable for all of       Rowan's needs. In late January of 2016, I applied for       [Medical Assistance].    I will stop there for a moment to explain. Medical Assistance is the  State share of the State end of the Medicare Program. We call it  Medical Assistance. Other States have a different name for it.   Pam said she applied for Medical Assistance:         After Rowan was awarded this assistance we were able to       obtain wrap-around services, which included a Behavioral       Specialist Consultant . . . and a Therapeutic Staff Support       worker.    Pam goes on to say, and I am quoting her again:         Without Medical Assistance, I am confident that I could not       work full time to support our family. . . . [We] would be       bankrupt and my son would go without the therapies he needs.    These are the therapies I just mentioned. Then Pam goes on to say,  urging me as one of her two Senators to focus on her son, focus on her  family when we are casting votes and having debates about policies that  relate to healthcare and Medicaid. Here is what Pam asked me to do as  her Senator:         Please think of Rowan. . . . My 9-month-old Luna, who       smiles and laughs at her brother, she will have to care for       Rowan late in her life after we are gone. We are desperately       in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would be devastated       if we lost these benefits.    So said Pam about her son and about the importance of the Medical  Assistance Program, which is known on the national level as Medicaid. I  would hope that those in the House, as they are quickly marking up  legislation that would have a huge impact on families like Pam's and  many more--I would hope they would think of Rowan, think of his little  sister Luna and what her challenges might be years from now when she  would likely have to care for Rowan and answer some of Pam's questions.   There are a lot of questions that we have about policy and numbers  and budget impacts, and they are all appropriate. But some of the most  important questions we have to answer for those who are asking them are  questions that our constituents are asking. And one of those is Pam. We  have to be responsive to her concerns about her son and the challenges  her son faces.   I hope, in the midst of debate, in the midst of very rapid  consideration of a complicated subject on a bill that has been slapped  together--in my judgment, too quickly--that Pam's concerns would be an  uppermost priority in the minds of those who are working on this  legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
