 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, each and every one of us has a  moral obligation to challenge ourselves to make this little piece of  real estate that we call Earth better for generations yet unborn.   USIP does good and great work by teaching people around the world to  strive to create a society at peace with itself and its neighbors.   We spend millions and billions of dollars on guns, bombs, and  missiles. Can we spend just a few pennies, a few dimes, a few dollars  on peace?   This world, this planet is, not ours to hoard, waste, and destroy.  Mr. Chairman, I ask you: What is wrong with supporting the way of  peace, the way of love, the way of nonviolence? What is wrong with  teaching communities to respect the dignity and the worth of every  human being? What is wrong with preventing conflict and keeping our  military personnel safe and out of harm's way?   Mr. Chairman, on the question of preventing war and on the challenge  of keeping peace, there should be no price tag, but USIP does good and  great work on a shoestring budget. It is a small agency which teaches  the way of peace, the way of love. Their small staff help communities  solve problems through dialogue rather than weapons.   Mr. Chairman, this is not the first time that we consider an  amendment to abolish the U.S. Institute of Peace, but I hope this will  be the last. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote against  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the State,  Foreign Operations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter  [[Page H7127]]  from many of our colleagues supporting the U.S. Institute of Peace.                                  Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.      Hon. Hal Rogers,      Chair, Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related           Programs, House Committee on Appropriations, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nita Lowey,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations,           and Related Programs, House Committee on Appropriations,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey: We write in       strong support of the valuable contribution made by United       States Institute of Peace (USIP) to our country's strategic       interests abroad and encourage you to support $37,884,000 to       USIP for fiscal year 2018. This is the same level requested       by USIP in FY 2017.        Founded by Congress in 1984, USIP applies cost-effective,       practical solutions in conflict zones around the world with       the mission of preventing, mitigating and resolving violent       conflict. USIP's work is grounded in its commitment to       education and training while honing best practices in       challenging environments.        For example, in Iraq USIP has brokered peace agreements in       Tikrit and Kirkuk among tribal leaders in areas liberated       from ISIS. After ISIS' 2014 massacre of as many as 1,700 Shia       military personnel at former Camp Speicher near the city of       Tikrit, USIP and its grassroots Iraqi partners facilitated       dialogues among local tribal and religious leaders resulting       in an inter-tribal agreement that formed the critical basis       for the return by mid-2016 of more than 360,000 displaced       residents.        At a time when current estimates place the cost of violent       conflict globally at more than $13 trillion, USIP serves as       an important element of the national security toolbox. The       U.S. government must have a full range of options for       preventing and resolving violent international conflicts. It       is critically important that Congress continue to support       USIP and its proven, successful record of reducing conflict       while advancing U.S. interests.        We believe you share our understanding that USIP's work       helps reduce the impact of violent conflict in places where       American security interest are top priorities. As always, we       appreciate your previous support for USIP, and we look       forward to working with you during the FY 2018 appropriations       process.            Sincerely,          John Lewis, Joseph Crowley, Eliot L. Engel, G.K.             Butterfield, Alcee L. Hastings, Lucille Roybal-Allard,             Joe Courtney, Janice D.
