 Mr. Speaker, last year, the CARES Act delivered relief  checks to millions, but families were disappointed to learn that their  dependent adult children weren't eligible to receive support, including  the Harris family in Eagan, Minnesota.   Debbie and Victor Harris are proud parents to their wonderful son,  Josh, who has complex medical needs. Expenses are constant for the  Harris family. Home-care nurses and their two grown sons provide 24- hour care for Josh. Despite that, as an adult-disabled dependent, Josh  didn't qualify for relief.   It was because of stories like these that I introduced the All  Dependent Children Count Act and pushed to ensure that Josh and  millions of other dependent adult children could receive the relief  they deserve.   I am so proud we were finally able to get this in the American Rescue  Plan and give families like the Harrises an additional $1,400, allowing  them the freedom and support to enjoy some well-deserved time in  Minnesota's great outdoors.                            ____________________
