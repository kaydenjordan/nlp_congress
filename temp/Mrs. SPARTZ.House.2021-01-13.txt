 Madam Speaker, I appreciate a variety of opinions, but  any accusations must go through the proper due process, whether it is  election fraud or an impeachable offense.   As someone who did not support the objection to certification last  week, I will not support this political charade today.   The rule of law and due process is vital to what our constitutional  Republic stands for. Congress should stop playing divisive politics and  start working on delivering real, good policies for the American  people.
