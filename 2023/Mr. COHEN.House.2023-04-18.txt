 Madam Speaker, I am the only Democrat Congressperson from  Tennessee, so in some ways I represent the entire State on issues of  concern to Democrats and people of progress.   Tennessee and New York, unfortunately, have been shameful in their  conduct recently in the way they relate to government and in the lack  of the way they relate to meaningful gun reform to protect our citizens  from mass shootings.   In Tennessee there was the Tennessee Three. Three legislators who  went to  [[Page H1769]]  the well to protest the fact that after a murder, a terrorist act  killing six citizens at the Covenant Presbyterian Church, there was no  response from the supermajority Republicans in the general assembly,  nor at the time from the Republican Governor.   They went to the well, while the galleries were full of people  protesting the lax gun reform laws or gun laws in Tennessee, to protest  and say, we should have some gun laws to protect our children and to  protect people all over our country who are victims of mass shootings.   They expelled two of the members and tried to expel three for simply  raising an issue that otherwise would not be raised by a supermajority  and that was favored by a majority of the people in Tennessee by far-- red flag laws.   No more weapons of war should be sold, the weapons that people used  to do mass shootings at Covenant Presbyterian Church; in Louisville, at  the bank; and almost everywhere where there are mass shootings in this  country.   That was shameful for the Tennessee General Assembly to try to expel  three and to expel two, and not to take up gun reform.   Governor Lee later took up gun reform and said he was for red flag  laws, but a red flag law was proposed this week, and it didn't even get  a motion or a second.   In New York, the House Judiciary Committee adjourned to New York, a  recess there, to have a hearing yesterday allegedly concerning a State  official, the DA, Mr. Bragg, and his record that they call pro-crime  and anti-victim.   What they really went to New York to do was to act as Donald Trump's  public relations firm and defense firm, something the United States  Congress is not empowered to do for any individual. They are not  empowered to go into another jurisdiction where federalization laws say  that the States have their own prosecutors, and the Federal Government  is not supposed to go in and ask for information that they can then  give to the defense, and attack Mr. Bragg.   The facts were well-pointed out that New York is a safe city, and  safer than most of the major cities in Mr. Jordan's State of Ohio. They  attacked Mr. Bragg and said he was supported by George Soros.   What does that have in common with Tennessee?   The people they went after were minorities.   Mr. Bragg, the first African-American-elected DA in the borough of  Manhattan and in Tennessee the two youngest members of the general  assembly who happened to be African American, a minority group by far  in Tennessee and the Tennessee General Assembly.   They accused Mr. Bragg of being supported by George Soros, which he  was. We know that is a trope for anti-Semitism. They go after a  minority religion, a minority DA, and try to appeal to their base and  try to help Donald Trump. That is shameful, as well.   Shame on the Judiciary Committee of this House. Shame on the General  Assembly of Tennessee.   Do your job. Protect your citizens. Pass meaningful laws to restrict  weapons of war and impose red flag laws, so we can stop people from  committing crimes--mass murders in this country, which have become too  commonplace. Let's uplift our political dialogue to where we don't  attack minorities to get away with obfuscating our real purpose, which  is supporting Donald Trump, who committed two of the worst crimes in  this country: one, trying to steal the 2020 election and telling people  it was a steal, fraudulently, and getting campaign contributions; and,  two, in 2016--if Mr. Bragg is right--covering up payments to a porn  star to win the 2016 election illegally.   Madam Speaker, the worst crime in New York was 9/11. Then there was  the Central Park Five. Five Black youths who were alleged and convicted  of killing a jogger in Central Park. This was back, I think, in the  20th century.   Mr. Trump took out full-page newspaper ads in three papers and said  all of those five should get the death penalty. They got sentences,  they didn't get the death penalty. Later they were exonerated, and it  was shown that somebody else committed the crimes--but not after they  spent 41 years in prison, an average of 8 years a piece, and not after  the State had to pay $41 million for their time in prison.   Did Donald Trump apologize?   No, he doesn't apologize. Shameful.                            ____________________
