 Madam Speaker, the energy economy of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District is booming, creating good-paying jobs and  providing low-cost energy to thousands of families across the  Commonwealth and our Nation.   As evidence of this, our district is happy to welcome Thailand-based  natural gas company BKV to Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.  Next week, BKV will be opening an office in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania.  They will join other natural gas companies in Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District that are creating jobs, giving back to the  community, and helping our rural district thrive with the resources  right under our feet.   Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District plays an important role in  our national energy portfolio, producing between one-tenth and one- twentieth of the country's entire natural gas supply on any given day.   Energy produced in PA-12 lowers energy costs, creates an energy- independent United States, and allows our allies to no longer be  reliant on energy resources from countries that do not share our  values.   Natural gas companies have helped with community revitalization and  in creating a robust economy of downstream jobs. The present and future  of PA-12 is bright because of the natural gas industry, and, for the  benefit of my community, our State, and our Nation, I will continue to  support its growth and expansion in Congress.                            ____________________
