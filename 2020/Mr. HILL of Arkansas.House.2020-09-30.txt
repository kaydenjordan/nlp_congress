 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Darrell Wood and his patriotic contributions to the city of Benton,  Arkansas.   Earlier this summer, Benton's mayor, Tom Farmer, noticed a street  adorned with American flags. Over the coming weeks, Mayor Farmer  noticed that more and more flags were appearing around the city until  nearly every street in Benton was decorated. After asking citizens,  Mayor Farmer determined that Mr. Wood was responsible for this  patriotic display.   To show their appreciation, Mayor Farmer and the City Council  formally honored Mr. Wood for his contributions to the community with a  commemorative plaque. The beautiful sight of these flags has inspired  others in the community to add more of their own.   Mr. Woods' actions have served as a bright light in these trying  times, and we thank him for his selfless service to his city.                    Recognizing James ``Skip'' Rutherford     Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize James  ``Skip'' Rutherford, who announced plans to retire as dean of the  University of Arkansas, Clinton School of Public Service in Little  Rock.   Mr. Rutherford has served in this role since 2006 and planned to  retire earlier this year but stayed longer than expected to help the  school, students, faculty, and staff weather the storm of COVID-19,  which shows his dedication to the lives of those with whom he works.   Skip had a passion for public service at a young age as he watched  the election returns on the courthouse lawn in Batesville, Arkansas. He  believed in order to make a real difference, you need to roll up your  sleeves and get in the arena. He was instrumental in the building of  the Clinton Presidential Library, the development of the River Market  District, and coordinating the 40th anniversary commemoration of the  1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School, which in turn led  to the school being named a national historic site.   Martha and I wish Skip a fulfilling and active retirement.                                time  1915                           Recognizing Grady Spann     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Grady  Spann, the director of Arkansas State Parks, who was recently named  president of the National Association of State Park Directors.   Mr. Spann is a 27-year employee of Arkansas State Parks, having  previously served as superintendent of the Ozark Folk Center, Historic  Washington, and the Parkin Archaeological State Park. In 2012, he was  named supervisor of Region 5, a newly created region of State parks.   Mr. Spann's passion and dedication earned him not only the position  of director of Arkansas State Parks in 2016, but now as president of  the National Association of State Park Directors. The association aims  to promote and advance State park systems throughout the United States.   Grady's commitment to the preservation of the Natural State and  beyond is evident in his leadership. I congratulate Grady Spann and  wish him well in this new leadership assignment.            Recognizing the VFW Department of Arkansas' Post 4453     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the VFW  Department of Arkansas' Post 4453 in  [[Page H5099]]  Morrilton, Arkansas, on the occasion of their 75th year of service.   Post 4453, also known as the Martin-Bradley Post, has been given  their Diamond Jubilee Award for their exceptionally long and dedicated  service to veterans in the Morrilton area.   Our Veterans of Foreign Wars posts in Arkansas do so much to support  our heroes, once they return home from service, by providing access to  resources and a sense of community. The VFW posts also honor veterans  once they pass, keeping their memories alive in the hearts of central  Arkansans.   Every year for the Fourth of July, VFW Post 4453 lines up American  flags for the Morrilton Walk of Flags. Each of these flags is a visual  reminder of the brave men and women from Conway County who defended our  freedom at home and abroad.   Thank you to our central Arkansas veterans who have laid their lives  on the line for country, and congratulations to the Martin-Bradley Post  of the American Veterans of Foreign Wars for their 75 years of service.  May they serve many more in the years ahead.                            Honoring Dale English     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of a great Arkansas public servant, Mr. Dale English. He was 80 years  old.   Before passing, Dale served the city of Searcy for 33 years as city  councilman, and he served the fire department for 20 years, retiring as  captain.   Throughout his years of public service, Mr. English developed a  reputation as a thoughtful, intelligent leader who earned the respect  of his peers.   As a constant presence on the Searcy City Council for the past 33  years, Mr. English's knowledge and experience were only matched by his  love and commitment to youth sports.   His memory will serve the community as a model of an effective,  dedicated public servant for years to come.   I join the citizens of Searcy and all Arkansans in honoring the  remarkable life of Dale English. He will be missed. May he rest in  peace.                        Recognizing Ryan Christiansen     Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the  accomplishments and service of Ryan Christiansen of Bald Knob,  Arkansas.   Ryan is a member of Troop 157 of the Boy Scouts of America. His goal  was always to become an Eagle Scout, which he accomplished on April 25,  2019, after earning 51 Scouting badges, 30 more than the number  required.   For his Eagle Scout project, Ryan built a mobile drop box for the  proper retirement of American flags. He is additionally working to  place Purple Heart parking signs at businesses in his area.   The Arkansas Veterans of Foreign Wars named Ryan the 2020 Eagle Scout  of the Year. He was additionally honored with a challenge coin from the  White County Sheriff's Office, and County Judge Mike Lincoln named  August 7 Ryan Christiansen Appreciation Day coinciding with Purple  Heart Day.   Now a freshman at Arkansas State University, Mr. Christiansen has  worked tirelessly in the service of others, and I am proud to honor his  hard work and perseverance today.                           Recognizing Barry McKuin     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barry  McKuin. Barry is stepping down from his responsibilities after 15 years  of service to the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute as an original board  member and advocate for this important nonprofit organization.   Mr. McKuin first served as the CFO of Winrock Farms after Governor  Winthrop Rockefeller passed away in 1973, and his involvement only grew  from there. He was heavily involved in the Conway County Economic  Development Corporation and served as its president.   Barry has always put his community, the town of Morrilton, on the map  by involving the town in the Uncommon Communities Program, which  promotes local community and economic development.   Lisenne Rockefeller, Institute board member, said, ``Barry saw the  big picture, focused on the future, and kept others on track.''   Mr. McKuin's service to the nonprofit and community are greatly  appreciated. Congratulations on his successful tenure at the Winthrop  Rockefeller Institute, and we wish Barry McKuin success in years to  come.                           Recognizing Mary Newsome     Madam Speaker, today, I recognize the career  and contributions of Mary Newsome to the University of Arkansas  Community College at Morrilton and to Conway County, Arkansas.   Mary is the longest-serving employee of the college, beginning in  1981 as extra help and, now, currently serving as the assistant to the  chancellor. Yet after 39 years, her dedication to others goes far  beyond the campus in Morrilton.    Her list of community involvement is long, including her service as a  board member of the Morrilton Area Chamber of Commerce, CHI St. Vincent  Morrilton, Conway County Senior Adult Center, and the Conway County  School Counts. She additionally serves as secretary of the Conway  County branch of the NAACP and as a Sunday school teacher at her  church.   Mary always makes you feel so welcome. She is a neighbor that  everybody wants and a citizen that every community needs. She has  dedicated her life to the betterment of others, and I thank her for her  years of service to UA Community College Morrilton and central  Arkansas.                          Recognizing Dionne Jackson     Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Dionne  Jackson, the executive director of AR Kids Read, for striving to  improve the literacy of Arkansas children.   Ms. Jackson recognized the importance of literacy very young, after  realizing that a family member could not read or write when they signed  a document with an X rather than sign their name. This experience  inspires her work daily at AR Kids Read.   Dionne grew up in the Western Hills neighborhood of Little Rock and  attended Hendrix College in Conway. After earning her degree, she  became a science teacher at her alma mater, Horace Mann High School.   She earned her master's from the University of Central Arkansas and  went on to earn a Doctorate in Education from Baylor University, then  becoming a tenured professor at Hendrix.   As the executive director of AR Kids Read, she works every day to  further their mission to advance the literacy education of Arkansas  children and families with the aim of having students read proficiently  by the third grade.   Our community is so grateful to her dedication for this essential  need in our area.                          Recognizing Darrell Walker     Madam Speaker, as we start a new school year, I  rise today to recognize the University of Arkansas at Little Rock's  men's basketball coach, my friend, Darrell Walker, who was named last  year's Sun Belt Coach of the Year.   Coach Walker became the third UA Little Rock coach ever to win the  award, leading the Trojans to one of the Nation's best turnarounds,  going from a 10-21 record the previous year to 21-10 this past season.   That includes a 15-5 record in the Sun Belt Conference, on the way to  UA Little Rock's first outright league title since 2015-2016.   The spring of pandemic cut short the passion of March Madness. The  Trojans were one of just two teams in Division I that finished in 1st  place in their conference after being picked 11th or lower in the  conference preseason.   Coach Walker's passion for excellence in leadership and hard work are  always evident, and he can now add Sun Belt Coach of the Year to his  long list of accolades and career accomplishments.   Good luck to Coach Walker, and good luck to the 2020-2021 team. Go  Trojans.                          Recognizing Derrick Clark     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Derrick Clark, who has made Arkansas proud with his resilience and his  determination.   For years, Derrick wrestled with drug abuse and homelessness on the  streets in Little Rock, looking somehow for a fresh start. He spent  time at Jericho Way, our Little Rock shelter, where he was able to meet  people who saw his potential.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Clark made that slow march to sobriety and self-  [[Page H5100]]  sufficiency by working minimum-wage jobs until he landed a position  with a trucking company. Armed with a commercial driver's license and  gainful employment under his belt, Derrick established the Paul Philia  Scholarship to give others the opportunity to attend trucking school.   Mr. Clark put up the first $1,000 of his own money to launch the  scholarship, and the fund was quickly put with the Arkansas Community  Foundation. The J.C. Thompson Trust has agreed to match every dollar  donated up to $10,000. Mr. Clark is now enrolled in college classes and  dreams of writing a book.   Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. Clark and wish him the best of luck in  his journey, that journey of the pursuit of happiness.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
