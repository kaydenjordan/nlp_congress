 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairmen Hultgren and Hensarling,  Ranking Member Waters, and Congressman Hollingsworth for working with  me on this bipartisan legislation to improve our capital markets and  help more small companies succeed.   As part of the JOBS Act, Congress directed the Securities and  Exchange Commission to amend Regulation A to allow small companies to  raise up to $50 million in offerings exempt from full SEC registration.  These amendments, known as Regulation A-Plus, exclude certain potential  issuers, including Exchange Act reporting companies.   As a result, thousands of companies that already meet the SEC's high  disclosure requirements are ineligible to use Regulation A-Plus to  cost-effectively raise the funds they need to grow and hire employees.   That is why I have introduced this legislation with Congressman  Hollingsworth to allow SEC reporting companies access to Regulation A- Plus. It is a valuable pathway for small businesses to raise money in  an efficient, public, and transparent manner.   I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to ensure that Arizona's innovative small businesses have every  opportunity to thrive, and I hope that Members will join us today in  support of this bipartisan legislation.   Again, I thank Congressman Hollingsworth for working with me on this  commonsense, bipartisan bill.
