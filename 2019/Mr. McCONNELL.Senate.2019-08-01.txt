 Mr. President, my office and I are closely monitoring  a significant explosion of a natural gas transmission pipeline early  this morning near Danville, in my home State of Kentucky.   As of this morning, one fatality and five more injuries have been  reported, and others may be unaccounted for. We hope and pray that  these figures do not increase. Several structures have been damaged or  destroyed.   The Lincoln County emergency manager reported: ``The part of the area  that has been compromised, there is just nothing left.'' The fiery  explosion was so large that it was picked up by weather satellites, and  witnesses report the smoke can be seen from my hometown of Louisville,  almost 70 miles away.   Obviously, the investigation is just beginning. My staff and I will  continue to stay on top of this and be a resource for everyone  affected.   This morning, our prayers are with the families whom this disaster  has touched, and our gratitude is with all the first responders who  rushed toward the towering flames to protect their neighbors and  communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on a completely different matter,  the Senate has accomplished a significant amount of business this week  for the American people.   We have made a big dent in the backlog of President Trump's well- qualified nominees for Federal office. With respect to the judiciary,  we have confirmed 13 impressive individuals to lifetime seats on the  Federal bench. We have also ensured that two more key components of the  President's foreign policy team will be on the job before the Senate  adjourns for the August work period.   We confirmed the Deputy Secretary of Defense and a new ambassador to  [[Page S5280]]  the United Nations--both with bipartisan support, just as it should be  for nominees who are so fully prepared for jobs that are so important.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Senate will turn our  attention to legislation. We need to address the debt limit and secure  the full faith and credit of the United States. We need to continue to  secure the funding our national defense demands. Fortunately, the  pending legislation will accomplish precisely that.   In recent weeks, key officials on President Trump's team engaged in  extensive negotiations with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic House.  Given the exigencies of a divided government, we knew that any  bipartisan agreement on funding levels would not appear perfect to  either side, but the administration negotiated a strong deal.   First and foremost, it ensures our Federal Government will not  approach any kind of short-term debt crisis in the coming weeks or  months. It secures our Nation's full faith and credit and ensures that  Congress will not throw this kind of unnecessary wrench into the gears  of job growth and a thriving economy.   What is more, despite the desires of the Democratic House, the  administration has successfully kept far-left poison pills and policy  riders entirely out of the process.   We had heard that our Democratic colleagues across the Capitol were  clamoring to take us backward on the issue of life, perhaps even  targeting the Hyde Amendment or forcing more taxpayer dollars back  toward Planned Parenthood. We had heard they were clamoring to try to  handcuff the administration's important work on border security, but on  those fronts, and many others, the far left was denied any such  victories. There are no poison pills--a big win for the White House.   I ask unanimous consent that the terms of this agreement and the  specific prohibition of poison pills be printed in the Record.    Now, perhaps more importantly--particularly to my  Republican colleagues and to me--this legislation sets a sufficient  funding level for our national defense.   Over the past few months, as we have worked through important  legislation like the NDAA, we have been reminded of one glaring  reality: The forces that seek to harm the United States and our  interests are ever-changing, and they demand the full attention of a  fully equipped, modern, and ready military.   Since President Trump took office, Republicans in Congress have made  remarkable progress. Working together, we have begun rolling back the  damage caused by the previous administration's neglect, atrophy, and  misguided approach. We have begun to rebuild and restore our military.  We have taken important steps toward modernization, so we aren't just  rebuilding the capabilities we need today but investing in those we  will sorely need tomorrow.   I trust none of my colleagues are under the illusion that our work is  finished. As our adversaries grow stronger, critical gaps remain in our  ability to counter expansion, influence campaigns, and direct acts of  violence toward America and our allies around the world.   The bipartisan funding deal is the opportunity--the only opportunity  on the table--to continue filling in these gaps before it is too late.  So make no mistake, Russia is not waiting idly by as we sort out  whether to deliver full funding to missile defense or uphold our  support of partner forces in Europe. China will not scale back its own  aggressive ambitions and military investments if Americans decide to  take a breather ourselves. Iran's financing of terrorist organizations  and regional troublemaking is not going to stop if we stop investing in  our own ability to check their efforts and project power.   So if we say we are serious about countering threats to our homeland,  our allies, and our men and women deployed overseas, then we have to  actually deliver on our promise to equip our forces for the job.   We have to invest in improved readiness to help our military  commanders plan for emerging challenges--in research and development to  support the U.S. military of the future--and in rock-solid support for  our alliance commitments, which help preserve the peace and extend the  reach of our values.   This deal is an opportunity to do exactly that. This is the agreement  the administration has negotiated. This is the deal the House has  passed. This is the deal President Trump is waiting and eager to sign  into law. This is the deal that every Member of this body should  support when we vote later this morning.                            ____________________     I send a cloture motion to the desk.
