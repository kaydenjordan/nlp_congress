 Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge that we are all  fortunate in this House and in this country to have the chairman of the  Armed Services Committee that we do, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Thornberry).   He identified a problem. When we are operating by continuing  resolutions, no one has any certainty or stability, particularly the  military. This is the fourth continuing resolution in the fourth month  of the budget year.    Give us a budget, a year budget. That is what we need and that is  what the military needs.   Secondly, to the majority leader, my friend, if we are going to have  Democrats involved, they have to be at the table. And there has been a  decision made that to get to 218 votes, it is going to be the Tea Party  that has the final say, not Democratic participation. Let's change  that.   Third, the budget issues are not all that difficult. They have been  mentioned: DACA, to be sure. It is the opioid crisis. It is veterans  funding. It is community health centers.   Then, finally, on DACA, let's have an open rule. Let's bring to the  floor the Goodlatte bill. Many favor it on your side. Let's bring to  the floor the Hurd-Aguilar bill. It is bipartisan. Let's promise to put  on the floor whatever bill may be passed in the Senate. That is called  an open process. It is called taking accountability.   We are in a situation of our own making. None of us want to be here.  We all know it is wrong for the American people and it is bad for the  reputation of the government.   Let us have an open process, an open rule, and we will set America  free.
