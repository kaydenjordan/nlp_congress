 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an  unsung hero in Florida's history.   In 1858, James Dean was born into slavery in Ocala, Florida. In  pursuit of his dream to enter public office, Dean entered Howard  University School of Law working part time as a clerk to put himself  through school.   He earned a bachelor's and master's of law, graduating as the  valedictorian in both degrees. After graduating, Dean returned home to  Florida in 1887, taking a position as a school principal and  establishing a law practice in Key West.   His practice grew so quick that he had to resign from the school  within a year to care for his clients. As his business grew, so did his  standing in the community. In 1888, just a year after moving to Key  West, he was nominated to serve as a county judge.   This didn't sit well with many White political leaders in Key West  who conspired to have him removed from the bench. They fabricated a  story that Judge Dean illegally married an interracial couple and the  Governor of Florida removed him from office.   As Black History Month comes to a close today, it is important to not  shy away from uncomfortable moments in our history. And while Governor  Bush posthumously reinstating his judgeship in 2002 can never make up  for the harm suffered, remembering his story makes us all more  sensitive to current injustices suffered by our friends in the Black  community.                            ____________________
