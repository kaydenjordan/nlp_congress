 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and  celebrate the continued accomplishments of Young Harris College Men's  Soccer team.   On November 14, the team rallied together to defeat Clayton State,  securing their sixth Peach Belt Conference title in program history.   Furthermore, this victory advanced the team to the NCAA Division II  National Tournament. Entering the tournament with a 17-0-1 record, the  Mountain Lions continued to dominate with a 2-1 win over the Clayton  State Lakers for the title.   The team is now set to face off against Auburn University at  Montgomery on December 2 in the quarterfinals of the Division II  tournament.   These student athletes are to be celebrated for their spirit of  unrelenting perseverance. Their hard work, dedication, and  determination will be an example future teams will strive to emulate.   I extend my congratulations to the entire YHC Men's Soccer program  for their remarkable season and am proud of my alma mater. Go Mountain  Lions.                            ____________________
