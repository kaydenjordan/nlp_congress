 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Michigan's First  Congressional District in memory of a friend, devoted father and  husband, and dedicated public servant, Senator Tom Casperson, who  passed away on Sunday, November 29, after a hard-fought and courageous  battle with cancer.   Senator Casperson served in the Michigan Legislature for 14 years and  [[Page H6058]]  was a fierce advocate in Lansing for our Upper Peninsula way of life.   Tom was a strong and universally respected voice, confronting  challenging issues head-on and working across the aisle for the benefit  of his constituents. His unwavering commitment to his family, his  faith, and his community is unquestionable. The entire State of  Michigan is a better place because of him.   To Tom's family and friends, Isaiah 41:10 says:         Do not fear, for I am with you. Do not be dismayed, for I       am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will       uphold you with My righteous right hand.    Please join me in honoring the extraordinary life of Senator Tom  Casperson.                            ____________________
