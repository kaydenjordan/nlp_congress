 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Peterson for  yielding, also Chairman Conaway for all of his support.   I am proud today to speak on behalf of the 2018 farm bill. This bill  is a strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. It works for families,  for farmers, and for all communities.   The farm bill now avoids disastrous cuts to SNAP, a program which  helps put food on the table for 44,000 people in Mecklenburg County  alone, many of whom are children.   Additionally, the bill now avoids the mean-hearted, unreasonable work  requirements that had been in the previous version of the House farm  bill.   As founder and cochair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I am  particularly proud to have helped secure key resources for 1890 land- grant universities in this bill. The farm bill authorizes $50 million  to create three centers of excellence at 1890s and it ensures equity  between land grants by removing provisions that strip away unspent  extension funds for 1890 schools, and mandating a report that outlines  research and extension funds for all land-grant institutions. This is a  major legislative win for our land-grant HBCUs.    These are the reasons why I founded the HBCU Caucus, to bring  together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to fight together for  greater funding and equity for all of our schools.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues on the conference  committee, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill  later today.
