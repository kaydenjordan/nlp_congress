 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Alpha Fire Company of Centre County.   Recently, the Alpha Fire Company made history when an all-women crew  took on the initial attack line in a three-alarm fire. Lieutenant  Claudia Rudisill, firefighter Talia Cholach, and firefighter Kara  Stover answered the call to protect and serve.   Claudia is a recent Penn State graduate, and Talia and Kara are  current students at the university. All three come from a long line of  firefighters.   Madam Speaker, they made history and they made a difference. They  have put in the time and dedication to train, so when the call for help  comes, they are able to respond and perform professionally. I know  firsthand the dedication and passion volunteer firefighters have when  it comes to protecting their communities.   Madam Speaker, I thank Claudia, Talia, and Kara for their bravery and  dedication to the State College community.  [[Page H4962]]                                ____________________
