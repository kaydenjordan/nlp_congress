 Madam Speaker, today, I vote to impeach President Donald  Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. I don't hate the  President, but I love my country, and I have no other choice.   Voting for these Articles of Impeachment is the only moral course of  action, the only way to honor our oath of office.   I have no doubt that the votes I cast today will stand the test of  time. This has nothing to do with the 2016 elections.   I am so disappointed that my Republican friends approve of the  President's abuses of power and solicitation of foreign interference in  our elections. This is the very definition of the willful suspension of  disbelief. They know in their hearts that what the President has done  is deeply wrong. They know that they would vote without hesitation to  impeach a Democratic President who had done these things.   I remind all Americans, the President did not rebut the facts--the  many, many facts--which have led to these Articles of Impeachment  today.   For the sake of our democracy, our Constitution, and our country, we  must do the right thing and vote to impeach President Trump.
