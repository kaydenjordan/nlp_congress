 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Scott Winters, the readjustment counselor at the DuBois Veterans Center  in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   Mr. Winters provides a wide range of psychosocial services offered to  eligible veterans, servicemembers, and their families. His efforts  assist our veterans in making a successful transition from the military  to civilian life.   Recently, Mr. Winters was recognized by the Spring Creek Chapter of  Trout Unlimited for presenting a listening skills course to their  Veterans Service  [[Page H8]]  Partnership streamside mentors and other interested members to support  veterans in crisis situations.   The VSP program is a Trout Unlimited initiative to serve veterans,  Active-Duty military, and their families by engaging them through the  recreational benefits of angling, with the support of the Trout  Unlimited community.   Mr. Winters' service that he provided in training has been utilized  by at least one volunteer to save a veteran's life who was in crisis.   Mr. Speaker, Scott Winters has gone above and beyond to be available  at a moment's notice to support veterans in his community, and his  service is greatly appreciated.                            ____________________
