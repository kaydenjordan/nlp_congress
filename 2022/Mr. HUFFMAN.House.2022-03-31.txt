 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a  dangerous ideology threatening our democracy: White Christian  nationalism.   Most Members of Congress don't even know what it means, but experts  from the Freedom From Religion Foundation and the Baptist Joint  Committee for Religious Liberty have studied it for years, and their  new report shows this movement was at the heart of the January 6  insurrection.   White Christian nationalism fuses Christianity with a rigid view of  civic life, a view that true Americans are White, native-born, and  conservative. On January 6, it was the connective tissue that tied  disparate groups together and propelled them to action.   It is infecting our government, from Members of Congress and top  officials in the previous administration to the wife of a Supreme Court  Justice, whose messages to the President's Chief of Staff leading up to  the insurrection smacked of White Christian nationalism.   Thankfully, good Americans, people of faith and nonbelievers, are  standing up to this violent ideology.   Mr. Speaker, I call on Members of Congress to educate themselves  about White Christian nationalism and reaffirm the separation of church  and State.                            ____________________
