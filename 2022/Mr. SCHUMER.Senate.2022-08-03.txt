 Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, two sets of numbers show the winds  blowing in the Democratic direction: first, the numbers revealed by the  vote last night in the State of Kansas and, second, new polling data  that shows how overwhelmingly popular the Inflation Reduction Act is in  the minds of the American people. These numbers show winds blowing in  Democrats' direction on the issue of choice and on the issue of the  Inflation Reduction Act.   Today, I want to talk about both. So let me begin with last night's  election in Kansas. Last night, in the American heartland, the people  of Kansas sent an unmistakable message to MAGA Republican extremists:  Back off women's fundamental rights. In the first vote on abortion  rights since the MAGA Supreme Court's reprehensible decision to take  away constitutional rights protected by Roe v. Wade--and which was  cheered by many Republicans here in the Senate--voters in Kansas  decided by a double-digit margin to preserve the freedom of choice in  their State Constitution.  [[Page S3874]]    What happened in red Kansas last night is a reflection of what is  happening across the country and what will continue to occur through  the November elections. Voters are revolting against the extreme MAGA  Republican policies that ban abortions with no exceptions for rape or  incest and send women and doctors to jail.   Last night's election was also a dark reminder that MAGA Republicans  are running the show within the GOP. Their views are spreading through  the party like a cancer--views that are repugnant not only to most  Americans but, as we saw last night, even to many Republican voters.   And Kansas was just the start. If it is going to happen in Kansas, it  is going to happen in a whole lot of States. The strong pro choice  turnout we saw last night in Kansas will continue well into the fall,  and Republicans who side with these extremist MAGA policies that attack  women's rights do so at their own political risk.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on NATO, today the Senate will be  voting on the resolution of ratification for the Finnish and Swedish  applications to join NATO. This is a very important vote. The NATO vote  is a very important vote for American security around the world.   Finland's and Sweden's membership will strengthen NATO even further  and is all the more urgent given Russian aggression, given Putin's  immoral and unjustified war in Ukraine. Putin is strengthening the  NATO alliance, and nothing shows it better than the vote we will have  this afternoon. With the vote, the Senate will come together in a  bipartisan manner and bolster the Western alliance in the face of  growing authoritarianism.    When Leader McConnell and I met with the Finnish President and the  Swedish Prime Minister back in May, we made a commitment to get this  done as quickly as possible before the August recess, and today we are  keeping that commitment by working together.   Despite the differences between both sides, I have always said that  when the opportunity arises, Democrats would be willing to work with  Republicans in a bipartisan way to get things done. In the past few  weeks, we have seen an amazing string of bipartisan achievements--a  bipartisanship that hasn't been seen--with the passage of so many  important bipartisan bills in such a short time.   Together, we secured a historic investment in American science and  industry. We just passed the largest expansion of veterans' benefits in  decades. We passed significant gun legislation. And, today, we will  work together to bolster the NATO alliance.   So, again, under Democratic leadership, we want to work in a  bipartisan way whenever we can, but when we can't, we will move forward  on issues like climate and prescription drugs that we feel are very  important, which I will talk about in a minute.   Finally, as I mentioned yesterday, I invited the Ambassadors and  other diplomats from Finland and Sweden to join us in the Gallery  during our debate and votes today. So let's get this done by this  afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on the Inflation Reduction Act, this  is the second place where the numbers that we read this morning show  that the Democrats are on the move and that Republicans are in retreat.   Today's news provides another bevy of reminders of why the Inflation  Reduction Act is not only bold and commonsense but is extremely popular  with the American people.   This morning, five former Treasury Secretaries--including former  Secretary Hank Paulson, who served under President George W. Bush-- released a statement praising the Inflation Reduction Act and urging  Congress to move quickly to secure its passage. The bipartisan group  wrote that the Inflation Reduction Act ``will help increase American  competitiveness, address our climate crisis, lower costs for families,  and fight inflation--and should be passed immediately by Congress.''   The bipartisan group of Treasury Secretaries also affirmed what  Democrats have been saying for days: The Inflation Reduction Act will  not--no matter how much our Republican colleagues argue to the  contrary--increase taxes for any family making less than $400,000 a  year.   Again, our proposals call for closing loopholes that have long  enabled the biggest companies in America to avoid paying their fair  share. And even former Republican Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is  now calling on Congress to pass the Democratic agenda. He is in very  good company. This morning, a poll by Navigator also showed the  Inflation Reduction Act as overwhelmingly popular--overwhelmingly  popular--in the minds of the American people.   According to this poll, 65 percent of Americans support the proposals  in the bill, compared to only 24 percent who oppose. More than double  the people support the act than oppose it. It includes 60 percent of  Independent voters and even 40 percent of Republican voters. So America  is on our side. They want us to pass this bill.   Now, contrast the Democrats' agenda to what we have been hearing from  the other side. While Democrats want to make healthcare more  affordable, just yesterday the junior Senator from Wisconsin argued  that instead of strengthening Medicare and Social Security, we should  put them on the chopping block.   Hear that, citizens of Wisconsin, citizens of America? The junior  Senator from Wisconsin wants to put Medicare and Social Security on the  chopping block. He has argued that the benefits, which millions of  Americans rely on every day, shouldn't be guaranteed but should be  subject to partisan infighting here in Washington.   He would like to revoke the guarantee of Medicare and Social Security  and make them discretionary. Well, you know what happens when we make  things discretionary around here? All too often they get cut or even  eliminated. We don't want to do that. But the Senator from Wisconsin  said we should. So senior citizens of America, listen loud and clear:  Senator Johnson called for making these programs discretionary.   For decades, they have not been. They have been programs that when  you become 65, you get it. It is not up to the whims of one Congress or  another.   So we will fight as hard as we can to prevent the Republicans, led by  the Wisconsin junior Senator, from pulling out the rug from under  seniors. We will fight the MAGA Republican politicians who want to gut  these critical programs.   It is comments like these that show how out of touch the other side  has become. While Republicans were perfectly willing to blow a $2  trillion hole in our deficit in order to give tax cuts to the ultrarich  and to the big corporations, now some of them are saying Medicare and  Social Security should no longer be guaranteed.   Of course, our Democratic proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act, is  vastly different. We will protect healthcare. We will lower the price  of prescription drugs and make energy cheaper while making the largest  investment in clean energy ever.   These are things that Americans support. These are things that our  country needs. And these are things that we are going to get done when  we pass the Inflation Reduction Act in the coming days.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, since its creation over 70 years ago,  no alliance in human history has done more to advance the cause of  freedom and democracy than NATO.   Today, at a moment when democracy in Europe is under attack, as  belligerent autocrats, like Putin, clamor for European dominance, the  U.S. Senate is voting in overwhelming bipartisan fashion to approve  Finland's and Sweden's accession to the NATO alliance. This is  important substantively and as a signal to Russia that they cannot  intimidate America or Europe.   (Applause.)   Thank you, Roger.   Putin has tried to use his war in Ukraine to divide the West.  Instead, today's vote shows our alliance is stronger than ever.   I applaud the leaders of Sweden and Finland, who made a bold choice  to depart from their long-held position with respect to NATO. I am  confident they will be excellent partners in this alliance.   I thank Leader McConnell. Back in May, we met with the Finnish  President and the Swedish Prime Minister and promised to approve their  accession as quickly as possible. Today, we are keeping that promise.   I also want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  springing into action on this matter, especially Senator Menendez, the  chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who did such a good  job with his ranking member, Senator Risch, as well as Senators Shaheen  and Tillis, who have been our leaders in reaching out to NATO, for  their leadership roles. Senators Menendez and Risch ensured their  committee acted quickly.   On a broader note, in the past few months, we have seen an amazing  string of bipartisan achievements in this Chamber--achievements rarely  seen in such fast succession. We passed the first gun safety bill in 30  years, approved the largest investment in U.S. science and technology  in generations, gave veterans the largest expansion of benefits in  decades, and today, we are strengthening the NATO alliance. All of  this, every bit of this, was done on a bipartisan basis. I have always  said this Senate Democratic majority would be willing to work with the  other side whenever possible, and these past months have been some of  those moments.   Finally, to the Swedish and Finnish diplomats who have worked for  months to reach this moment, rest assured, you have many friends in  this Chamber. We promise to get this done, and we will always, always  stand by your side as allies defending each other.   I thank my colleagues for their work.   Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1100, Roopali H. Desai, of Arizona, to be U.S. Circuit  judge for the Ninth Circuit; that there be 10 minutes for debate,  equally divided in the usual form, on the nomination; that upon the use  or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that any  statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the  previous actions on S. 734.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration of S. 734 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn  amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to, the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 742, National Lobster Day,  submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  [[Page S3905]]  proceed to consideration of S. Res. 743, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon  on Thursday, August 4; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res.  55, and that at 1:45 p.m. the Senate vote on passage of the joint  resolution; further, that upon disposition of the joint resolution, the  Senate execute the previous order with respect to the Desai nomination;  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Thursday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of the Senate, there will be two  rollcall votes at 1:45 p.m., with additional rollcall votes possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order, following the remarks of Senator Sanders.
