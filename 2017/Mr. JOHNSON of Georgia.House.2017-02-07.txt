 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to voice my strong  opposition to H.J. Res. 57, which is another Republican proposal to  erode the oversight and enforcement authority of the Department of  Education.   In 2015, Congress responded to the voice of the American people by  passing the Every  [[Page H1055]]  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) with bipartisan and bicameral support. This  sweeping rewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act gave  states and local boards of education greater flexibility to implement  plans to ensure student achievement, resource equity and greater  accountability.   I was happy to support the ESSA after seeking the advice of  experienced educators and education stakeholders from Rockdale, DeKalb,  and Gwinnett Counties, as well as throughout Georgia.   H.J. Res 57, on the other hand, flies in the face of Congressional  intent by gutting a key ESSA rule developed with, and supported by  teachers, civil rights organizations, parents and states. H.J. Res 57  removes civil rights protections and blocks improvements to our  nation's public education system by dismantling data-reporting  requirements that ensure that the needs of underperforming groups in  all subgroups are adequately supported. This includes African  Americans, Latinos, and students with disabilities. The Administration  and my Republican colleagues are playing political games that will  ultimately harm taxpayers, teachers, and our nation's most  disadvantaged students.   During my time in Congress, I have worked to ensure that all students  have access to a world-class education regardless of their background  or zip code. I believe that all children deserve a quality education  and that no child should ever fall between the cracks. I will continue  fighting against republican attempts to divest funding from public  education and reduce equal opportunity for all students.
