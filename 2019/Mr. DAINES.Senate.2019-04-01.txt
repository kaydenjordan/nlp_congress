 Mr. President, Future Farmers of America, FFA, is  a noteworthy educational program that makes a difference in the lives  of young Montanans by helping members navigate their future careers and  enhancing their leadership skills and personal growth. FFA isn't only  for those who want to end up in production agriculture, but for those  who want to become teachers, businessowners, and leaders in their  communities. I have had the privilege of meeting many FFA members over  the last several years and have enjoyed hearing about their  experiences. It is my pleasure to honor the 205 members receiving their  State FFA Degree this year. The State Degree is the highest degree that  can be given and requires members to complete several critical  benchmarks, including 360 hours of agricultural education in high  school, 10 procedures of parliamentary law, more than 25 hours of  community service, and they must serve as a chapter officer or a  committee chair. Receiving the State Degree underscores a member's  dedication to learning to do, doing to learn, earning to live and  living to serve.   Congratulations to the 205 FFA Members receiving their State FFA  Degree this year: Wilson Paytyn of Bainville, Bradly Kallevig of Baker,  Sean Loutzenhiser of Baker, Brayden Hankinson of Beaverhead,
