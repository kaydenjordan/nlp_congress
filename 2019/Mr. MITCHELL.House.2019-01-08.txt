 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  birthday of Helen Barbara Livingston, who lives in Macomb County.   A person experiences a great deal in 100 years of life. In 1919, when  she was born, Prohibition went into effect, the pop-up toaster was  invented, unemployment was 1.4 percent--if you can believe that--and  the Grand Canyon became a national park. Helen experienced the Great  Depression.   She has seen over 40 percent of the history of this Nation. She has  experienced 18 U.S. Presidents, from Woodrow Wilson, when she was born  in 1919, to President Trump. Suffice it to say, she has seen a great  deal of change in national and local politics in her life.   She was born in Niagara, New York, and came to Michigan at age 6 when  her dad got a job, amazingly enough, in the auto industry at a Dodge  plant in Hamtramck, Michigan--the reason so many people move to  Michigan to build cars and trucks for America.   Helen attended Hamtramck High School and was an incredible athlete.  She was captain of the field hockey team and played tennis, where she  never lost a match in 4 years.   During Helen's senior year in high school, Eleanor Roosevelt visited  her school to promote women in sports, and Helen presented her with a  bouquet of roses. A short time later, she received a handwritten letter  from the First Lady.   She met her husband working at Parke-Davis labs, and for their first  date, they drove 5 hours to Hartwick Pines. Now, there is an effort.  That was the start of a 59-year marriage.   After being a stay-at-home mom for 12 years, when her kids were a  little older, Helen started working at Macomb County Youth Home for  juvenile delinquents. She worked there until she retired.   Helen has been an avid golfer. She has two holes-in-one, most  recently, when she was 80 years old. There are many golfers, including  many golfers in this Chamber, who are envious of that achievement.   Even as she got older, Helen continued to seek out fun. A few years  ago, she was in a grocery store and ended up starring in a national  Mike's Hard Lemonade commercial. To be honest, she didn't realize what  Mike's Hard Lemonade was.   I join her family, friends, and the entire community in celebrating  an incredible 100 years of life and wish her many more.                            ____________________
