 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my two amendments in this en bloc  package.   The alleged purpose of this bill is to ``protect our democracy by  preventing  [[Page H7606]]  abuses of Presidential power, restoring checks and balances and  accountability and transparency in government.''   My amendments, in fact, do exactly that and would create an office of  inspector general, IG, at the Office of Management and Budget, OMB.   Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, this independent,  nonpartisan inspector general would prevent and detect waste, fraud,  and abuse at OMB.   The underlying bill is a Democrat attempt to relitigate yesterday's  issues. But today, Americans are being assailed from all sides. They  are facing a Democrat President on a spending binge that is tearing  this country apart. Inflation sits at a 30-year high. Gas prices are  skyrocketing out of control, and now an even more reckless socialist  and amnesty agenda is in the works.   My two amendments will truly bring accountability and transparency to  the executive branch and protect the statutory authorities of Congress.   Last week, news broke that 40 percent or more of the $700 billion  spent on unemployment benefits for COVID-19 relief went to fraud. That  is nearly the size of the defense budget. An IG at OMB would be able to  root out this kind of fraud, waste, and abuse and save taxpayers'  dollars. The Biden administration should welcome having an OMB  inspector general with the same enthusiasm they talk about transparency  and accountability.   My second amendment will help protect the rights of the minority and  allow the Oversight and Reform Committee to easily acquire documents  from the executive branch so that we can uphold true oversight.   I look forward to working with the majority to obtain the information  required by law from the administration pursuant to these Rule of 7  requests. I appreciate that Democrats agree on some level that we need  rigorous oversight of the executive branch.   My only question is: Where have they been for the last 11 months?   I am also profoundly disappointed that Democrats chose to load up  this en bloc package with amendments that entrench bureaucracy,  hamstring Presidential appointments, and micromanage Presidential  powers. This bill is supposed to restore transparency and  accountability, but many of the amendments in this package move it in  the opposite direction.    Madam Speaker, the Federal Government cannot be given the  ability to police innovators who create lifesaving products. Top-down,  government-imposed drug pricing would eliminate consumer choices,  jeopardize future cures, and ultimately lead to socialized medicine.   The United States invents approximately two-thirds of the world's new  medicines. Our system encourages private investments which spur  innovation. This is something we should be proud of and encourage, not  curtail.   But under the Democrats' radical Build Back Better Act, new drugs and  cures for diseases like cancer and diabetes would be reduced. Price  controls will lead to reduced access for patients and will set a  dangerous precedent.   If the Federal Government has the authority to dictate the cost of  prescription drugs, what else will it decide to set prices for?                            ____________________
