 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  appropriations minibus that we will be voting on this afternoon.   Like the first appropriations package, this legislation is being  considered without reaching a budget agreement, and it would bust the  budget caps by over $350 billion in fiscal years `20 and `21.   Not only is the majority spending out of control on programs we  currently have, but they are creating new programs in these bills. This  circumvents the authorization process and compounds the debt problem.   Last week, I submitted an amendment to eliminate funding for one of  these new pilot programs that would use Americans' hard-earned tax  dollars to provide legal representation to those arriving at our  southern border. My amendment would have reallocated that funding to  assist victims of human trafficking and address school violence, both  issues growing at the local level in our communities.   Unfortunately, Democrats on the Rules Committee voted along party  lines to prevent my amendment from coming to the floor. I call on  Democrat leadership to stop silencing commonsense proposals and let us  debate those tough issues. It is what we were elected to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the immigration  supplemental that will be brought to the floor later tonight.   While I appreciate that the majority in this House has finally come  to the realization that there is, in fact, a crisis on our southern  border after spending the first 6 months denying that fact, they  continue to refuse to work with Republicans to address the real  problem.   The bill before us today was drafted with no Republican input. For  the past 2 days, its fate has seemed uncertain, as there are members of  the Democratic conference who don't believe we should have a border or  enforce our laws.   We are a nation of laws. Americans who selflessly choose to join the  law enforcement profession put their lives on the line every day to  protect Americans and care for those in their custody. They are working  overtime to deal with this crisis. What support do they get in this  supplemental?   It doesn't fund the pay or overtime shortage. Instead, members of the  majority party have spent the past week calling ICE and CBP criminal  agencies that are killing children.   I want everybody to think about that for just a moment. There are  members of the Democratic conference who are telling Americans that ICE  and CBP are killing children in their custody.   The Democratic leadership has been engaged in negotiations the past 2  days to win the support of these Members. One of the solutions  contained in the manager's amendment is an extra $2 million for the  continued operation of the Immigration Court Help Desk program.   The average wait time to have a case heard in the immigration court  is over 700 days. Does the bill include the $55 million that the Senate  bill does for additional immigration judges? No. Rather, it includes $2  million for a 1-800 number to check on the status of a case.   The wait is over 700 days.    The wait is 700 days. That is like putting a Band-Aid on a  gaping wound.   I look forward to addressing this crisis, but this bill is not the  solution. If they were serious about solving the problem, Democrats  would include additional funding to take care of our law enforcement,  which is working so hard to address the crisis, and they would include  additional funding to reduce the court backlog.   It is time to get serious about the crisis. It is time to offer real  solutions.
