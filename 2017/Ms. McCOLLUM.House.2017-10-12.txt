 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this funding package.  This bill is a downpayment on the recovery from the recent fires and  hurricanes.   I am pleased that it contains $576.5 million to fully repay the funds  that the U.S. Forest Service borrowed last fiscal year to pay for  wildfire suppression. We have all seen the devastation and the tragic  loss of life from large fires burning across our country.   Fiscal year 2017 was the most expensive year on record for wildfire  suppression, costing $2.4 billion. As the duration and severity of  wildfires grows, costs will continue to rise.   Unfortunately, once again we have missed the opportunity to fix the  way the Federal Government funds wildfire suppression.   Let me be clear: the next supplemental must include a legislative fix  for wildfire spending, and it must adequately support the Department of  the Interior and its vital efforts to help our country rebuild from the  recent fires and hurricanes.
