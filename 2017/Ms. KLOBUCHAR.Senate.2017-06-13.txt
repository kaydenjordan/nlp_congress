 Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Corker  and Senator Cardin, for their fine work on the Countering Iran's  Destabilizing Activities Act, of course, and then this Russia amendment  that so many of us have been pushing for so long. I especially thank  Senator Cardin for his leadership on that, as well as Senator Brown and  Senator Crapo--and the work that Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer  did, as well as a lot of members of the Foreign Relations Committee,  who care a lot about this.   As I look at this, I look first at the Iranian part of the underlying  bill. We have had many disagreements in the last few years on the  Iranian nuclear agreement, but it is now critical. This is the time for  those who opposed the agreement and those who supported it to come  together to ensure that all of the parties to the agreement are  upholding their obligations.   When the United States and our allies agreed to the Iranian nuclear  agreement, we made it clear that we will continue to hold Iran  accountable for its nefarious activities outside of the four corners of  the agreement. We must hold Iran accountable for missile tests, for  financing terrorism, and human rights violations. That is our job, and  that is why I was an early cosponsor of the legislation before the  Senate today.   The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017 imposes  mandatory sanctions on those involved with Iran's ballistic missile  program, as well as those who fund terrorist organizations and commit  human rights violations. Iran's ballistic missile program is a threat  to regional and global security, and United Nations Security Council  resolution 2231 makes it illegal for Iran to develop ballistic missiles  that could carry a nuclear weapon. Any person or business involved in  helping Iran obtain illegal weapons should be banned from doing  business with the United States, have their assets immediately frozen,  and their travel restricted.   Minimizing the threat Iran poses also means holding it accountable  for funding terrorist groups that threaten Israel and seek to  destabilize the region. We should be doing everything in our power to  better track terrorist financing so we can stop the flow of money that  funds suicide bombers and illicit weapons.   Our mission here is clear: We must protect our own citizens and our  allies by enacting strong legislation to ensure that Iran does not  cheat on its international commitment. Iran must know that if it  violates the rules, it will be held accountable.   Democrats and Republicans have come together to get this done, and it  is my hope that we can pass the legislation this week, including the  amendment imposing strong sanctions against Russia, which is essential  to protecting our democracy from foreign interference.   Seventeen United States intelligence agencies have confirmed that  Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election. That is not all. We  know Russia is using covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful  propaganda to try to undermine our democracy. They launched cyber  attacks against local election systems, a U.S. voting systems software  company, and the emails of more than 100 local election officials.  Russian-backed criminals hacked into Yahoo and stole data from 500  million accounts. They repeatedly harassed American diplomats in  Moscow.   The former Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, recently  testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our political  system. This is what he said:         I believe [Russia is] now emboldened to continue such       activities in the future both here and around the world and       to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.    Vigilance--that is what we need right now. That is why I joined a  bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce the Countering Russian  Hostilities Act, legislation that would impose strong sanctions against  Russia. These sanctions would address Russia's cyber attacks, its human  rights violations, and its illegal annexation of land in Ukraine and  Georgia.   I am also the cosponsor of the Russia Sanctions Review Act,  bipartisan legislation that would require congressional review if  sanctions against Russia are rolled back.   The Russia sanctions amendment offered today contains essential  portions of both of these pieces of legislation.   After those 17 intelligence agencies confirmed that Russia interfered  in our elections, President Obama enacted important sanctions against  officials in the Russian Government and hackers conducting malicious  cyber activity on behalf of the Russian Government. The amendment  before us today would codify those sanctions. The amendment also  strengthens sanctions against Russia's energy sector, corrupt Russian  officials, and those who supply weapons to the Assad regime.   The day the Obama administration was imposing these additional  sanctions on Russia, I was actually with Senators McCain and Graham in  Eastern Europe. The goal of our trip was to reinforce support for NATO  and our allies in the face of increased Russian aggression. On the  trip, we went to the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia, countries on the  frontlines of these fights. They know Russia's playbook well.   In our meetings with Presidents and Prime Ministers of these  countries, it was increasingly evident that if we don't stop Russia  now, cyber attacks against governments, political parties, newspapers,  and companies will only get worse. We heard about websites being shut  down and internet access  [[Page S3445]]  limited when one government--the Government of Estonia--simply had the  audacity to move a bronze statue from a public square to a cemetery. It  was of a Russian fighter. The Russian Government didn't like it, so  they cut down their internet access.   Also, there were members of the Ukrainian Parliament who were invited  to Lithuania. What happened to the Lithuanians in the Parliament? They  were hacked into. Ukraine itself was targeted by Russian hackers more  than 6,500 times over a 2-month period.   Most recently, Russia tried to undermine elections in France.   For years, our allies have been subjected to Russian aggression and  invasion. But they are undeterred, unwilling to give up on that which  they fought so hard for--independence, freedom, democracy.   So this is not just about defending our own democracy, as we look at  these Russia sanctions that are before us today, as we look at the  investigation that is ongoing and looking into the interference into  our election. It is about defending a democratic way of life and  democracies across the world. It is not just about the simple word  ``election'' or the simple word ``democracy.'' It is not just about one  candidate or one political party. As Senator Rubio has noted, the next  time it will be the other party.   No, this is about our Constitution. It is about our own independence  from foreign powers. It is about freedom and the rights guaranteed to  us in our own Constitution. If that is undermined, if foreign  governments are allowed to come in and handpick who their candidate is  based on either propaganda or cyber attacks, then we lose our  constitutional rights because we the people are no longer determining  who our representatives are. Other countries are.   The world continues to look to America for our steadfast leadership.  The United States--a beacon for freedom and democracy--must continue to  stand up against Russian aggression, not just in word but in deed. That  is why it is so important that the Senate is coming together today to  pass strong sanctions against the Russian Government. We want the  Russian people to be able to have a democracy. We want them to be able  to have a democracy that doesn't do things like bring down planes in  Ukraine, that doesn't do things like try to influence other countries'  elections. That is why these sanctions are so important.   We know that the Russian Government today is actively working to  undermine our democracy and hurt American businesses. This is part of  the cyber war. We know that this unprecedented interference has been  orchestrated by the Kremlin so that Americans actually lose faith in  our own political system. Over time, Russia has grown more determined  in its effort to weaken democracies in its expanded sphere of  influence. Now, more than ever, Americans are looking to the Senate for  leadership. We must stand strong and united so that Russia and other  nations know that attacks against our democracy must not go unchecked.  The amendment before us on the sanctions is an important step in doing  just that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
