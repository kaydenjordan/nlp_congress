 Madam President, I come to the floor for a few moments       with a friend and a colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham of South       Carolina, but speaking on behalf of a much broader group of Senators.        Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has been my partner in this. We       have 10 Senators who are cosponsors of an urgent bill, the Afghan       Adjustment Act, and the message behind it is simple: that we have to do       right by those who fought alongside us for 20 years.        Madam President, I have two letters with me that I will briefly       reference that Shawn VanDiver and the great folks of #AfghanEvac pulled       together and presented to us. They have been sent to the majority and       minority leaders of the House and the Senate--one signed by 44 flag       officers. And I will read one sentence:                   We are convinced the Afghan Adjustment Act furthers the            national security interests of the United States. It is also            a moral imperative.              And the other, from every former Ambassador from the United States to            [[Page S9736]]            Afghanistan, says that ``without the Afghan Adjustment Act, the task of       American diplomacy will be much more difficult.'' If we don't act to       support our allies by passing it in the future, allies will be less       likely to support us.        And before I hand over comments to my friend and colleague, I just       wanted to close by saying, I know this story all too well of an Afghan       family of five in Newark, DE: Cher and Shakira Alizai. He served and       fought alongside a Delawarean and saved his life. And today, after       having received death threats and fleeing the Taliban, he is working       day and night to support his family but without the legal status here       that this bill would provide.              For folks who are concerned about the alleged lack of vetting of the       70,000 Afghans who were brought here, this is the way we get that done:       in-person vetting that secures the United States and provides a       predictable path forward for these folks.        I want to thank Congressman Peter Meijer of Michigan, an Army veteran       of Iraq, who has been a tireless voice in support of this legislation,       and I want to invite my friend and colleague to speak about this       legislation and its urgency for our country.         Madam President, I just want to thank my colleagues who       have been such great and steadfast supporters. Senator Klobuchar has       been tireless in the Democratic Caucus, and we have been joined by       Senator Blumenthal, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Leahy.        Senator Shaheen has also fought tirelessly for the SIB program. There       is an expansion of that in the omnibus.        And, on the other side of the aisle, Senator Blunt, Senator       Murkowski, Senator Moran, and Senator Wicker have joined Senator Graham       as cosponsors.        We are so grateful for the American veterans who have brought these       cases and this issue to us over and over and have pressed for it. As my       colleague from South Carolina has just said, we will not stop fighting       for the men and women who served alongside us, who supported our       mission, who were a part of our evacuation, and who are now here.        I cannot imagine a worse moral outcome than for us to force them back       to Afghanistan, and this piece of legislation has crafted a solution       that allows for in-person vetting for every single Afghan in this       country, in exchange for which they would have a path toward legal       status.        After the Vietnam war, thousands of those who served in the military       of South Vietnam came to the United States, also as refugees, and they       were given legal status through a special adjustment act. That is what       we are seeking to do here.        Those who are here as Afghans temporarily on humanitarian parole face       uncertainty and difficulty. We should resolve this. The opposition of a       very small number of Senators has blocked this from moving forward, and       we want to focus on getting this done.        To those veterans, those Members of the House, those advocates who       have been a part of this effort, we want to thank you. To those who are       wondering when and how we are going to get this done, you heard the       pledge of my colleague. We are going to keep at this for the rest of       this Congress and, if necessary, into the next. We are grateful for       your voice, your service, and your support, and we look forward to       working with you on this urgent mission together.        With that, I yield the floor.
