 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as  National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month.   This year, an estimated 191,930 men in our Nation will be diagnosed  with prostate cancer.   As a survivor of this disease, I know firsthand the challenges  families face when they decide which testing, treatments, and coverage  options are right for them.   That is why I proudly support legislation like the Preexisting  Protections Act to ensure those with preexisting conditions have access  to affordable care.   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men, but the  good news is that as innovation and technology continue to evolve,  fewer men are dying after the diagnosis.  [[Page H4438]]    Identifying signs from the outset is critical so that it can be  treated and stopped before further spread. I am immensely grateful to  be alive today, thanks to early detection.   I encourage all men in the 25th District to talk with their  healthcare providers and participate in regular screenings.   I am committed to helping win the fight against cancer, and together,  we can beat this disease.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
