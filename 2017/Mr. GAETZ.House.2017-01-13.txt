 Mr. Chairman, lend me your ears. I come to bury ObamaCare,  not to praise it. The evil that men do lives after them.   This is the true legacy of the last 8 years: a doubling of the  national debt and $4 trillion in additional spending projected through  ObamaCare.   What have my constituents gotten from ObamaCare? Higher taxes, higher  premiums, unaffordable deductibles, crippling drug costs, fewer  choices, and more mandates.   This resolution shows what will happen if we do nothing. Inaction  will lead to $30 trillion in debt, the greatest generational theft the  world has ever known.   So it is past time to get the Federal Government out of the  healthcare mandate business. Let people buy insurance across State  lines; allow people to own their own healthcare decisions through  health savings accounts; block-grant Medicaid to our States, our  laboratories of democracy; and let's reinvigorate a Federal system that  is promised by our Founders.   The jobs data cited by the Democrats doesn't assume the positive  economic benefits that come from ObamaCare repeal, including, according  to the Congressional Budget Office, $200 billion in additional economic  activity, more jobs, more opportunity, and more freedom. This is a  flawed study that my friends across the aisle cite, and it is the  Republican resolution before this body that offers a better way.
