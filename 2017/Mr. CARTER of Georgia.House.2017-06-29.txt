 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah-Chatham Metro Police Department's construction of its newest  training facility, which memorializes long-time Sheriff Al St.  Lawrence.   After 21 years of service as an officer, St. Lawrence ran for Chatham  County Sheriff in 1992. Because of his outstanding service to our  community, his constituents reelected him five times. He held this  position until he passed away on November 25, 2015.   Sheriff St. Lawrence was also responsible for overseeing the  significant renovation of the county jail, which ultimately added an  additional 400,000 square feet to the facility and doubled inmate  occupancy.   Remembering Sheriff St. Lawrence's dedication to training personnel,  the Chatham County Police Department developed the Al St. Lawrence  Recruitment and Training Range. This range will not only provide  effective training resources to officers but will also house the  Sheriff's Office Internal Affairs Division and the U.S. Marshals  Service.   The facility is located on 10 acres of property at the Chatham County  Sheriff's Office and includes several training ranges, including cable  ranges, steel target ranges, and a Rogers Range, which improves an  officer's aim when discharging a firearm.   Twice a month, the facility will also host a civilian gun class,  which is open to the public. Educating the public on firearm safety  will reduce the risk of accidental deaths from the misuse of guns.   Sheriff St. Lawrence's enduring service will forever be etched in the  history of Chatham County, and his contributions will ensure that  Chatham County will remain a safe, thriving community for years to  come.                             Lineman Appreciation     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our  electric linemen, the men and women who ensure our lights stay shining  every day.   In Georgia, electric utility companies have started a movement to  recognize the hard work linemen do every day. Companies such as Georgia  Power and MEAG Power celebrate their workers, who make modern living  possible.   Without linemen, we would not have many of the things we have grown  accustomed to using. Air conditioning, refrigerators, warm showers,  entertainment devices, and plenty more, are all  [[Page H5305]]  things we would have to learn to live without. It is easy to take these  services for granted, but it is important to remember the people who  make it all possible.    Earlier this year, we witnessed the valuable and honorable service  these individuals provide when severe thunderstorms and tornadoes tore  through Georgia over 3 days. Homes and businesses were destroyed and  thousands of citizens were left in the dark. Crews of linemen all  across the State joined together and selflessly worked for 2 weeks  until every light was back on.   It is our duty not to overlook the workers and services that make our  lives easier. I want to take this time and sincerely thank not just  linemen in Georgia, but all linemen across the Nation, for powering the  life inside our homes.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my  name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 60.
