 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bost for  yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 366, the Korean American VALOR Act.  I thank Ranking Member Takano for his leadership on this very important  issue.   During his joint address to Congress, South Korean President Yoon Suk  Yeol highlighted that during the Korean war, ``Korean and American  soldiers stood shoulder to shoulder and fought bravely.''   However, the Korean war was not the last time Korean soldiers fought  alongside American troops. They fought side by side in the Vietnam war,  sharing the same physical and mental scars from that conflict.   Many of these Korean troops eventually immigrated to the United  States and became proud naturalized American citizens. I personally  know several of these individuals, and I am eternally grateful for  their service.   Unfortunately, because the United States does not currently have a  reciprocal veterans' healthcare agreement with the Republic of Korea,  these Korean Americans cannot access veterans' healthcare benefits. The  Korean American VALOR Act will create a pathway for an agreement to be  reached and for these veterans to receive access to VA healthcare. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
