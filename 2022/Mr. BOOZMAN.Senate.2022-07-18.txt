 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  thank the creators and staff at Entertainment Fort Smith magazine for  22 years of championing arts, entertainment, and the people of western  Arkansas.   Lynn Wasson and Linda Seubold launched Entertainment Fort Smith, more  commonly referred to as E-Fort Smith, in 2000 to showcase the area's  vibrant arts and entertainment scene and keep local residents informed  about upcoming events. Within its pages, they covered everything from  international mural art found through the Unexpected Project and the  annual Peacemaker Music Festival, to the Fort Smith Little Theatre's  latest productions and story-time schedules for the local library.   The magazine printed 30,000 issues every month that were distributed  at over 200 locations in Fort Smith, Van Buren, Greenwood, Alma,  Barling, Charleston, and throughout the region.   Not only was E-Fort Smith a calendar of events, but the magazine's  features also spotlighted the lives of local people that make western  Arkansas unique. In addition, Wasson and Seubold used their platform to  show their great love for the State of Arkansas.   Brandon Chase Goldsmith, executive director of the Fort Smith  International Film Festival, praised E-Fort Smith for its support and  for being a driving force behind the region's creative economy over the  years. Likewise, the magazine has been recognized as a critical partner  in helping secure Fort Smith as the site for the U.S. Marshals Museum,  which will honor the over 230-year history of the Marshals Service and  is expected to open in 2023.   E-Fort Smith published its final edition in July 2022 after more than  two decades of promoting local businesses and artists.   I would like to thank the founders and all the staff of E-Fort Smith  who inspired the community and highlighted Arkansas's rich culture.  Their efforts made a difference and the magazine's legacy will live  beyond its final printing.                            ____________________
