 Madam Speaker, I rise today horrified at the reports from  Iran that hundreds of schoolgirls appear to have been poisoned in the  suspected attack by the Iranian Government. I cannot stand by idly and  watch these women and children continue to be targeted simply because  they want to live free from persecution.   Last month, I called on the President to do more than merely sanction  the Ayatollah's illegal theocratic regime. The Biden administration  will not respond because they are still looking to resuscitate the 2015  nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.   Additionally, its weakness on the world stage has the administration  consumed by the war in Ukraine and recent airspace invasions from  China.   We have faced decades-long failed attempts to negotiate directly with  the Islamic Republic. If there is one thing that has become crystal  clear, it is that resuscitating the nuclear deal no longer offers a  realistic pathway for mitigating the threats posed by Tehran.    We need to stop virtue signaling and soft-pedaling with flimsy  symbolic support. I call on the Biden administration to publicly  disavow the prospect of a new nuclear deal with Iran.                            ____________________
