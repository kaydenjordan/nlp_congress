 Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my full-hearted support of  H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   As I spend time with parents and business owners, retirees and  millennials, Republicans and Democrats back home in Minnesota, one  thing is clear: People are losing faith in the integrity and fairness  of our political system, and for good reason.   When I arrived in Washington, I witnessed firsthand the corrupting  influence of money and politics: envelopes with PAC checks offered  after handshakes and a culture in which votes often seem to have price  tags attached.   We can do better, and we must do better. That is why I say, no matter  your number one issue, please make campaign finance reform your number  two because we cannot address our country's greatest challenges when we  place special interests over our common interests.   So let's pass H.R. 1 and begin the hard and principled work of  restoring our democracy for the people.                            ____________________
