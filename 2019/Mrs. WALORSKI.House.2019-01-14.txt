 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 430, the  TANF Extension Act of 2019, which extends the authorization of the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF,  [[Page H533]]  program through June 30, while we finish up our work on a long-term  extension.   Our safety net is essential to helping people who fall on hard times  get back up on their feet, but, too often, it becomes a web that traps  people in the cycle of poverty. One of the keys to breaking that cycle  is human interaction, rather than treating people and recipients like  another number on a government spreadsheet.   It takes people on the front lines of the fight against poverty to  make sure we are looking at the root causes of the problem and actually  doing something to help people across the country build out and up on  the economic ladder out of poverty. Those in the trenches fighting  poverty need the flexibility to develop innovative solutions tailored  to local needs that will empower individuals to move to work and to  achieve the American Dream.   Over these next couple of months, we have a great opportunity to work  together on a long-term extension of TANF that makes commonsense  reforms to the program to ensure no one gets left behind on the  sidelines.   Right now, the status quo is not working. But by focusing on  workforce development, measuring work outcomes, and requiring States to  engage with recipients at an individual level, we can and we will move  people out of poverty, off TANF, and onto the road to success.   I thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady for their work on this  issue. I look forward to working with them and my other colleagues on  the Ways and Means Committee on a multiyear TANF extension.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
