 Madam President, last evening the Senate voted  overwhelmingly to advance H.R. 2--the farm bill. The reason it has  reached the floor in its current form--ready for consideration,  amendments, and, ultimately, passage by the full Senate--is the  leadership of Chairman Pat Roberts and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow.  They have carried on the committee's proud tradition of focusing on  substance and putting partisanship aside.   As the senior Senator from Kentucky, I know exactly how important  this legislation is to agricultural communities in my home State and  around the Nation. Kentucky has 12.8 million acres dedicated to  agriculture. That includes about $1 billion in soybean production last  year alone, about three-quarters of a billion dollars in corn, and  hundreds of millions of dollars in the production of hay and tobacco,  just to name a few.   These crops are only part of the story. Our leading agricultural  commodity is poultry--a billion-dollar-plus industry that employs about  7,000 Kentuckians on its own. These are just a few examples of what  Kentucky farmers bring to the country and to the world.   Despite the impressive scale, we are a State that is dominated by  small farms. They form the backbone of rural communities throughout my  State. But our farm families and those across rural America face a lot  of uncertainty: natural disasters, from droughts to floods, unstable  world markets, and falling commodity prices.   Earlier this year, the USDA Economic Research Service forecasted that  net farm income is in the process of falling to a 12-year low--a 12- year low. The farmers who feed and support this country are counting on  us to provide the predictability and certainty of a long-term farm  bill.   My colleagues and I on the Agriculture Committee have produced a farm  bill that shows America's farmers that we understand their situation,  share their concerns, and are taking action to address them.   My colleagues from every corner of the country can be proud of this  legislation. First and foremost, the Agriculture Improvement Act of  2018 strengthens the safety measures that directly help commodity  producers as they confront low prices. It also seizes a number of  opportunities to invest in the future of American agriculture and rural  communities.   I am particularly excited about the provision that would empower  farmers to begin cultivating industrial hemp, a crop that could play a  key role going forward in Kentucky's economy and in the Nation's.   The bill also focuses on rural broadband, rural water infrastructure,  and the fight against the opioid epidemic that has hit rural America  very hard.   From top to bottom, this farm bill takes serious steps to ensure the  future of American agriculture--for the sake of our farmers, our rural  communities, and the entire country.  [[Page S4380]]    This week my colleagues will have ample opportunity to consider the  legislation before us. In a few days I hope they will join me in voting  to pass it.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, it has been a  little over 6 months since the passage of tax reform delivered  measurable relief to working families and job creators, 6 months since  Republicans implemented a simpler 21st century framework to help  unleash a new generation of success stories, and 6 months since updated  tax brackets and withholding tables provided for some 90 percent of  American wage earners to take home more pay.   Thanks to lower tax rates, the IRS is withholding less of workers'  paychecks. Because we doubled the standard deduction, married couples  will benefit from what amounts to a new zero-percent tax bracket for  the first $24,000 they earn. And parents are looking forward to the  bigger child tax credit they can claim going forward--up to $2,000 per  qualifying child.   These tax cuts are just the shot in the arm our economy needed, and  they are exactly what middle-class families and workers deserved. At  least that is what Republicans believe.   Our Democratic colleagues seem to see things quite differently. They  don't think that $2,000--that is the average estimated tax cut this  year for a family of four earning the median family income--seems like  very much money, as far as they are concerned.   After all, every single Democrat voted against giving American  families these tax cuts. They figured Washington knew how to spend the  money better than the taxpayers who earned it. Of course, the bill  became law without Democrats' help. Since then, they have set about  trying to persuade middle-class families that getting to keep more of  their own money is a terrible thing, so they should support Democrats'  efforts to repeal tax reform.   I am glad I don't have to try and make that case. It looks like more  take-home pay for workers is already beginning to have ripple effects  throughout the U.S. economy. Fueled in part by our Republican policies,  consumer confidence in 2018 reached its highest level since November of  2000.   Sure enough, just last month retail sales growth doubled the gains  that experts had forecast and shot up at the fastest pace in half a  year. Here is the L.A. Times headline: ``Retail sales post sharp gains  in May, signaling a surge in U.S. economic growth.'' That is the L.A.  Times.   That is more take-home pay for American taxpayers, more prosperity  for American retailers, more demand for American goods and services,  and thus, more demand for American workers.   This is what we call a virtuous circle, and Republicans' commonsense  agenda is helping to make it happen. Our Democratic colleagues may want  to put Washington's foot back on the brake by repealing tax reform and  piling up more regulations, but they aren't just arguing with those of  us across the aisle. They are arguing with the facts. They are arguing  with the data. They are arguing with American families who are keeping  more of their own money. They are arguing with the prosperity our  agenda is already helping to unleash.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.
