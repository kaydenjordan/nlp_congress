 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Idaho and the  chair of our subcommittee for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3697, the  Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act.   Transnational criminal gangs have declared war on the United States.  Their tactics of intimidation and unspeakable mutilation and killing  have permeated most every part of our country, including multiple  instances in my own district. Most recently in Bedford County,  Virginia, a young man was killed by alien members of MS-13.   The Department of Homeland Security reports an ever-growing number of  criminal aliens joining international gangs, such as MS-13, which alone  has over 10,000 members within our borders. Whether these criminals  came to this country illegally as unaccompanied minors, adults, or have  valid visas or even green cards, it is time to send the message that  this behavior will simply not be tolerated.   Yet current immigration law includes no provision allowing for the  removal of criminal gang members based on their membership in dangerous  gangs or participation in gang activities. The result is  unconscionable. ICE must sit on the sidelines and wait for known gang  members to be arrested and convicted of specific offenses before  removal proceedings may commence. Of course, with many victims and  witnesses too petrified of retaliation against them and their families  to cooperate with police, many gang members are never convicted of  their crimes.   This legislation provides a crucial tool so that ICE can seek to  remove alien gang members before they are able to extort businesses and  murder innocent Americans.   In addition, this bill allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to  designate organizations as criminal gangs utilizing the same  transparent procedures used by the Secretary of State to designate  foreign terrorist organizations. Finally, the bill ensures that  criminal alien gang members cannot receive asylum and be released back  onto our streets able to resume their criminal activities while being  eligible for a vast array of Federal benefits.   Eradicating the death grip that transnational criminal alien gangs  hold over many of our communities, especially immigrant communities, is  an important piece of immigration reform. I am pleased that this bill,  which stems from legislation that the House has approved in the past  and which has been approved by the Judiciary Committee in multiple  Congresses, is being considered today.   Now, I want to address the allegation that this bill targets priests,  nuns, and garage band members. It is preposterous. This bill  deliberately includes the longstanding Federal criminal offenses for  alien smuggling as predicates for criminal gang activity. Coyotes and  other criminal gangs make billions of dollars and put countless lives  at risk through their alien smuggling activities.   As former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias, who emigrated to the United  States from Latin America as a child, stated: ``Smuggling aliens across  our borders is a dangerous business. All too often, people entrust  their lives to smugglers, only to die in the broiling desert, or  suffocate in the back of locked, airless trucks while the smugglers  profit.''   ``These smuggling rings, which facilitate illegal entry into the  United States and mercilessly exploit human beings for money, are a  danger to immigrants and a threat to our national security. . . .''   The Democrats are engaging in a huge amount of obfuscation. In the  past, House Democrats claimed the House passed legislation that would  have strengthened Federal alien smuggling laws, would have had the  effect of putting priests and nuns at risk of prosecution. The  Democrats' clear implication was that these problems didn't exist under  then-current law which remains current law.   Let me quote. Democrat members of the House Judiciary Committee,  including John Conyers, Jerry Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, and Sheila Jackson  Lee, they stated that the bill then under consideration goes far beyond  increasing penalties for alien smuggling and jeopardizes the well-being  of millions of Americans, neighbors, family members, faith  institutions, and others who live and work with undocumented  immigrants.   Former Speaker Pelosi, the current minority leader, stated: ``Under  the guise of an expansive definition of smuggling,''--the bill--``it  could make criminals out of Catholic priests and nuns, ministers,  rabbis, and social service workers who provide assistance and acts of  charity to those in need.''   The Democrats can't have it both ways. They can't argue one day that  we can't change current law because that would result in putting  priests and nuns at risk and argue the next day that, without any  evidence, current law already puts them at risk. To add to the  hypocrisy, the House Democrats supported an amendment which passed by  voice vote.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    So to add to the controversy, the House Democrats  supported an amendment which passed by voice vote to add human  smuggling to the list of predicate acts under the Federal money  laundering statute.                                time  1000    The Department of Justice and Immigration and Customs Enforcement  simply do not target clergy and others who do not make distinctions  based on immigration status when serving those in spiritual or material  need.   The use of such laws against religious organizations and other  humanitarian groups has been practically nonexistent. Of course, as in  the sanctuary movement in the 1980s, when religious organizations  engage in the smuggling of illegal aliens into the United States, they  would be subject to prosecution, just as anyone else would be.   This bill is based upon the same precedent that has been passed  through this House by voice vote dealing with human smuggling. It is  time to apply the same standard to alien gang members who are  perpetrating violence not just on people traveling to the United  States, as in the case of human smuggling, but on the citizens of  virtually every State in the Union.   The murders that have been outlined by Mr. King of New York, Mrs.  Comstock of Virginia, Mr. Labrador of Idaho, and others are taking  place all across the country because we simply are not removing from  this country as expeditiously as possible members of gangs like MS-13.  It is time to get about doing that, and this bill does that.   I want to commend Representative Barbara Comstock; Representative  Peter King; and the chairman of our Immigration and Border Security  Subcommittee, Representative Raul Labrador, for their work on this  important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3697.
