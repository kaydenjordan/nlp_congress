 Mr. Speaker, every American who works hard and plays by  the rules should be able to retire in dignity, supported by the pension  that they have earned.   Instead of protecting these hardworking Americans, this Republican- led Congress prioritized tax cuts for the biggest corporations and the  wealthiest Americans. Now some of the largest pension plans for workers  are on the verge of collapse; 1.5 million Americans, including 43,000  in my home State of Michigan, are at risk.   These workers have earned their pensions. They worked a lifetime  contributing to them, and now they are having the rug pulled out from  under them?   Patricia from Michigan is one of those retirees. Here is what she  told my office: ``I was a single mother raising one child. I thought  putting money into the pension was my security. Now you want to take it  away. I was never on welfare--I worked. If I lose my pension, I will  not be able to pay for the basics: utilities, taxes, car insurance,  food.''   So unless Congress steps up, pensions for Americans like Patricia  will be cut. Let's vote on bipartisan legislation that I cosponsored,  the Butch Lewis Act, which addresses this pension crisis. This  legislation ensures that multiemployer pension plans remain solvent and  continue providing retirees and workers with the retirement benefits  that they have earned. It is long past time to take up this  legislation.                            ____________________
