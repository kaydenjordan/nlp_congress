 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate  overwhelmingly. Ten times more Senators voted for this bill than voted  against it. That is the essence of bipartisanship.   I ask that we make this House proud. I ask that we make our  colleagues proud. And I ask that we pass this bill and send it to the  President's desk for his signature today.     Madam Speaker, I, too, want to recognize my colleague from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for having the coolest scarf in the House  today, the American flag.   Bipartisanship has broken out in the Senate. They passed H.R. 3401,  as amended, 84-8.   I am now happy to report to the House that bipartisanship has broken  out on the floor of the House of Representatives, for I am announcing  that 23 Democrats and 23 Republicans from the Problem Solvers Caucus  have just issued the following statement: ``Given the humanitarian  crisis at the border, the Problem Solvers Caucus is asking for the  immediate consideration on the House floor today of H.R. 3401, as  amended by the Senate.''   We now are certain that H.R. 3401 will pass. I ask us to let the  bipartisanship spread to the rest of this House and put an end to this  now, once and for all, and get the help to the border that is so badly  needed.
