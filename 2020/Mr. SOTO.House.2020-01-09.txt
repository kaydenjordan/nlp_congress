 Mr. Chair, our constituents across America would be  surprised to know that so many of these districts have been poisoned by  a chemical they never even heard of, the PFOS and PFAS chemicals. But  they would be even more shocked to know that the very cookware that  they cook their meals to serve to their little kids and to their  families contain that very poison. So why wouldn't we want to let them  know, give them a heads-up?   And then, turning to Florida, we had a cancer cluster in Ocala,  Florida, that hurt countless firefighters. If we are not here to  protect little kids and firefighters, why are we here?   We don't need to wait for the Senate to tell us whether we can act or  not. We need to act now, and that is why I am supporting this bill.
