 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Dr. Roe. I wish the  gentleman a happy belated Veterans Day, and I hope he had a good  weekend. I certainly did back home in Lexington, Kentucky, at Veterans  Park with the Veterans Park Elementary School choir singing to our  great veterans back home.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3224, as amended,  the Deborah Sampson Act.   As my colleagues before me have already pointed out, women have  served our country since the very earliest days of the American  Revolution. But as the fastest growing segment of our veteran  population, they are only now starting to get the recognition that they  deserve.   I am proud to be here today to support this bill that will ensure  that the Department of Veterans Affairs provides them the care and  benefits that their service and their sacrifices have entitled them to.   And I commend the gentlewoman from New York for her leadership on  this important legislation.   I do have to say, Mr. Speaker, however, that any characterization  that my Republican colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and I  feel anything less than pride in the many women who have served and the  many women who continue to serve today, and a steadfast commitment to  support them and to meet their needs, is simply untrue. Had my  colleagues or I been allowed to speak on this bill in committee, that  would have been very evident to any Member of this House.   What my colleagues and I do object to are the overly partisan tactics  that were deployed by the majority when this important bill was being  considered.    I am new to the Veterans' Affairs Committee in this Congress, but I  know that the committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship, where  Members check their party affiliations at the door and do not shy away  from debates or disagreements in the spirit of living up to the very  democratic ideals that our veterans fought to defend. Unfortunately, we  seem to have lost sight of that great tradition this year.   As Dr. Roe referenced in his comments earlier, I have been trying  since February to address an unintended consequence of a House-passed  bill that could allow an accused child molester who is awaiting  prosecution to care for a veteran's child in a VA childcare program.   I do not know any parent in any political party who would want one of  their own children to be cared for by someone who has been charged with  a serious crime, like a sexual assault against a minor, before they  have been fully cleared. Yet, the majority has twice used parliamentary  procedures rarely if ever seen in the Veterans' Affairs Committee to  refuse to allow our committee to consider my legislation to prevent  that from happening to the child of one of our Nation's veterans.   Most recently, the majority did that when this bill, the Deborah  Sampson Act, was being considered. Their actions were so unexpected  that my colleagues and I left the markup when it became clear that the  chairman was not going to allow us, or any other Member, the  opportunity to speak, much less offer amendments, and declared that we  were done voting on the bill.   I resent the comment that this amendment was not offered in good  faith.    Mr. Speaker, I can assure you, as the former president of  Prevent Child Abuse Kentucky, this amendment was offered very much in  good faith.   It is disappointing, and it is deeply ironic, given that lack of  childcare, while certainly not solely a woman's issue, is a well-known  barrier to care for many women veterans, as my Democratic colleagues  have pointed out over this past year.                                time  1815    Given that, it continues to astound me that the chairman would not  allow us to even discuss my amendment--much less vote on it--and then  immediately send a press release out after the markup accusing me and  my fellow Republicans of walking out on the women veterans that my  amendment would have helped to better serve.
