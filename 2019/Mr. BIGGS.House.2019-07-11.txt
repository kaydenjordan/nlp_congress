 Mr. Speaker, two amendments I offered to the NDAA were  adopted.   The first addresses shared responsibility for the world's security.  The United States is the most powerful nation on the planet and so must  remain, but our allies must pull their weight on global security  efforts. It is not just Americans who benefit from peace, after all.   For instance, is it fair for economic powerhouse Germany to spend  only 1.35 percent of its overall GDP toward NATO defense in the coming  years? I don't think so. We should at least examine the contributions  of Germany and all of our other allies.   My amendment simply requires the Department of Defense to report the  annual defense spending of each of our NATO and non-NATO allies.   My second amendment affirms the critical importance of the U.S.- Israel relationship. Since its founding over 50 years ago, Israel has  been an important strategic partner. Given the significant challenges  our Nation currently faces in the Middle East, the U.S.-Israel  relationship remains vital.   I thank Armed Services Committee Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Thornberry for working with me on these amendments.                            ____________________
