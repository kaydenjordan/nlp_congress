 Mr. Speaker, I as well rise today to pay tribute to our  friend, the Honorable Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a longtime Republican who  served as a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, commissioner and served as a  Member of the United States House of Representatives, who, sadly,  passed away Monday, January 6.   Mike was the oldest son of eight children, born on June 28, 1963, in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up and resided in Bucks County.  Mike was an Eagle Scout, an Eagles fan, and a graduate of Dickinson Law  School.   Those who knew Mike said the same thing: He worked hard every day to  make his constituents' lives better.   First elected to Congress in 2004, he served four terms and then  stepped down, honoring his self-imposed pledge to term limits. Mike's  brother, Brian Fitzpatrick, succeeded his older brother and continues  to serve their home district honorably. Brian is a great Member and a  friend to us all.   Mike was described by a friend as a classic Bucks County Irishman and  a man whose family always came first.   Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the entire Fitzpatrick family  appreciate our prayers. Mike is survived by, in addition to his brother  Brian, his six other brothers and sisters; his parents, James and Mary;  a grandson; a granddaughter; his wife of 31 years, Kathleen; and their  six children.   I thank you for your work to make Pennsylvania and our country a  better place, Congressman Fitzpatrick.
