 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  important work Democrats are doing to strengthen our supply chains and  keep the U.S. economically competitive.   Last year, the Biden-Harris administration and their allies in  Congress achieved the best record of job creation in history. Let me  repeat that: The best record of job creation in history.   Texans continue to find jobs with higher pay or better benefits.   We are seeing the best economy for American workers in decades, with  people getting higher wages, better benefits, and better jobs thanks in  large part to President Biden's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  and the American Rescue Plan and an effective national vaccine rollout.   When I visited with leadership from the Port of Houston in my  district, they expressed their gratitude for Congress' strong  investment in the maritime infrastructure needed to keep America's  economy moving in the right direction.   But they also expressed concern that more workers were still needed  in technical training than our current system will provide.   Last week, the House took another great step forward to support the  job creation and the American workforce by passing the America COMPETES  Act.   Now it is critical for the Senate to move on the America COMPETES Act  to pass measures like my grant program for training at Domestic  Maritime Centers for Excellence.   The America COMPETES Act will also provide real solutions to the  problems of how we start making more of our Nation's critical products  right here at home. This will provide more job opportunities as jobs  return from abroad.   It will also make our futures more secure by shifting away from  reliance on foreign countries for the products that you and I and  everyday Americans rely on.   Finally, it will invest in critical infrastructure and development we  need in science and technology to encourage and support our next  generation of scholars, incentivize innovation, and keep the U.S.  competitive.   The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is that Americans are back to work  and getting their vaccines and boosters at a record pace.   The America COMPETES Act can continue this trend.   We must get this bill to the President's desk now.   I urge the Senate to pass it.                            ____________________
