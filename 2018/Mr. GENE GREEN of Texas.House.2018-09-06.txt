 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Texas Attorney  General Ken Paxton and more than a dozen Republican attorneys general  began their case in a Texas Federal court arguing that the Affordable  Care Act's preexisting protection is unconstitutional.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, nearly 130  million adults under age 65 have preexisting conditions. Prohibiting  health insurance providers from denying coverage to Americans with  preexisting conditions remains one of the most popular parts of the  Affordable Care Act.   If the court were to strike that part of the law, thousands of  American families would be denied coverage or go broke because of the  unaffordable health costs. We can't roll back the clock.   I am shocked it is my home State taking the lead on this divisive  issue when Texas still has the highest number of uninsured individuals  in the Nation. What is more frustrating is Mr. Paxton stated in court  briefs that States challenging the ACA should be able to eliminate  protections if the judge does not decide to strike the law entirely.   People need certainty in their healthcare, not politics.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I want to thank our ranking  member for yielding me the time.   I rise in support of H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG  Certainty and Access Act. This bill has been worked on in good faith  with Mr. Johnson--I thank him for his kind words--which would expedite  U.S. small-volume LNG exports, so long as they do not require an  environmental impact assessment under the National Environmental Policy  Act, or NEPA.   Natural gas production has dramatically increased all across the  country thanks to the energy revolution that we have seen in the last  10 years. We are now able to get gas out of shelves long thought  impossible.   The U.S. has enough natural gas to meet our own energy needs for over  a century. Soon, we also will be able to be a net exporter of these  petroleum products.   Despite being the world leader in production of natural gas, many  companies are unable to export the small quantities of LNG, or  liquefied natural gas, to neighboring countries in the Caribbean.                                time  1400    If the U.S. does not have a free trade agreement with another nation,  natural gas exports must go through a lengthy national determination at  the Department of Energy. Currently, the U.S. has only a free trade  agreement with the Dominican Republic in the region.   DOE recently recognized that this placed an undue burden on small  volume exports and issued a rule similar to this bill to address the  issue. The dominant fuel source in the region for these countries is  Venezuelan fuel oil, a source that is not geopolitically friendly or  environmentally sound.   What we would like to have is more natural gas being used for  electricity in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico instead of fuel oil, which  is an environmental disaster.   U.S. LNG in the region would drastically reduce emission rates from  burning fuel oil for power generation. The benefits of H.R. 4606 are  not limited to other countries. As I said, Puerto Rico continues to  rebuild with the devastation of Hurricane Maria.    Madam Chair, to rebuild from the devastation  of Hurricane Maria, this LNG has the potential to reshape the Puerto  Rican grid, making it safer and more reliable and more environmentally  safe.   This bill also protects the environment. No application for export  under the Natural Gas Act will be granted unless the applicant  qualifies for a categorical exclusion under NEPA, ensuring that there  won't be an adverse environmental impact.   Study after study has shown natural gas exports are a clear net  positive to our domestic economy. Moreover, energy ties develop  diplomatic ties with countries that they go to. This bill will  strengthen U.S. ties with countries throughout the region.   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
