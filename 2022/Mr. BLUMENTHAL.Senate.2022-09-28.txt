 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  Lebanon American Club of Danbury, CT, as they celebrate 100 years of  devoted cultural engagement and civic service in their community.   The Lebanon American Club--or ``the Club,'' as it is affectionately  known as by its members--was founded in 1922 as  [[Page S5221]]  the Syrian American Club. In its early days, this organization assisted  members in becoming American citizens, learning English, and served as  a vital social support system for Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. After  initially meeting at various locations across Danbury, the Club  established a permanent home in ``Little Lebanon'' on New Street in  Danbury in the 1930s, before moving to its current West Street location  in 1993.   Highly active in the civic and cultural life of the Arabic speaking  community in Danbury, the Lebanon American Club boasted many members  who were major contributors to the economic, professional, and social  fabric of the region. After the election of Chicory Buzaid as Danbury  City Sheriff in 1937--the first Lebanese American elected to public  office in the State of Connecticut--the Club's members became more  politically active as well.   From the 1940s through the 1960s, the Club's activities expanded with  regular dinners, scholarship programs for students, fundraisers to aid  members in need, and an annual Labor Day weekend ``Mahrajan'' festival  celebrating their Lebanese and Syrian heritage.   In the 1970s, a new wave of Lebanese immigrants sparked a  revitalization of the Lebanon American Club and their activities  expanded. New Club programs were established--and continue today-- including a children's Christmas party and a scholarship award dinner  which has grown tremendously over the years, providing tens of  thousands of dollars in college scholarships to high school graduates.  Additionally, the Lebanon American Club Ladies Auxiliary routinely  holds dinners and wine tastings and is a significant contributor to the  Club's overall activities.   In recent years, the Lebanon American Club has continued to expand  and flourish. The Lebanon American Teacher Exchange program was  established in 2002, and the annual Lebanon American Day flag raising  ceremony was first held the next year in 2003. In 2009, the Club  established a heritage monument committee to pay tribute to their  immigrant ancestors, and the monument was unveiled at city hall during  the 2010 Lebanon Day celebration. The Club has continued to thrive of  late, including hosting regular blood drives throughout the COVID-19  pandemic to provide lifesaving aid to the community.   For a century, the Lebanon American Club has provided cultural,  civic, and social support to its members, the Lebanese community, and  the Danbury community at large. I have attended many Club activities  and greatly appreciate and admire their long-standing commitment to  preserving and promoting their cultural heritage while selflessly  serving their community through their many activities and programs. I  hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Lebanon American  Club of Danbury, CT, on this momentous occasion of their 100th  anniversary.                            ____________________
