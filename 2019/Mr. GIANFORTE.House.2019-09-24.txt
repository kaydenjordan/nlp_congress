 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the House leaders to  give farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and businessowners the certainty  they need, and ratify the USMCA.   Nearly 1 year ago, the United States, Mexico, and Canada concluded  their negotiations and released the full text of a trade agreement.   But I stand here today nearly 1 year later, and the trade deal with  our top trading partners is stalled.   Why? Well, the Speaker objected to the trade deal. Those objections  were addressed, and yet the American people are still waiting.   Mr. Speaker, the USMCA will create 176,000 new American jobs. It will  secure open access to markets in Mexico and Canada, markets critical to  Montana farmers and ranchers.   Ratifying the USMCA should be a priority for this Congress, not  impeachment fever.   I again call on the Speaker to work with the White House to get this  trade deal with our top trading partners across the finish line.                            ____________________
