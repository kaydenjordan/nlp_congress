 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Bridging the Gap for  New Americans Act. This bill will help us understand how to give legal  immigrants with professional credentials more access to opportunities  in our country.   Immigrants and refugees who spent years earning college degrees and  professional credentials should not be relegated to low-wage jobs  because they were educated outside of the United States.   Those pursuing a better life and respecting our laws should be  commended, not punished. S. 3157 will shed light on the bureaucratic  hurdles and  [[Page H7914]]  unnecessary red tape these workers face and how we might remove these  obstacles.   It would be foolish of us to let good talent go to waste, especially  as our country continues to face a labor shortage, particularly in the  healthcare sector.   This legislation is common sense. It will help immigrants and  refugees who are in our country legally fulfill their potential, better  provide for their families, and become even more of an asset to our  economy. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
