 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about the devastating  effects of climate change in California, and obviously throughout the  country.   Following one of the driest years on record, the State is facing yet  another water crisis. This week, Governor Newsom declared a drought  state of emergency for the majority of California, a declaration which  has become, sadly, all too common in the last decade.   The availability of a clean, reliable water supply forms the  foundation of the economy of not only all of California, but home to  the San Joaquin Valley that I proudly represent. Our farmers feed the  world, and they can't do it without a reliable water supply. We like to  say, ``Where water flows, food grows.''   We must use every tool in the water toolbox to find new ways to store  water for agriculture and deliver water, clean drinking water for our  communities.   I have introduced legislation to help build on my previous efforts to  build additional water resiliency by providing funding needed to repair  our aging water infrastructure, and now this is the year.   I will continue to push for water resources necessary to help  California weather the severe impacts of this repeated drought. Climate  change is real, it is happening now. It is time to act. Our future  depends on it.                            ____________________
