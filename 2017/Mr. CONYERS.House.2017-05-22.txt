 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly in opposition to H.R. 1862, and I  regret this opposition because it would add a new offense--well, new  offenses--to the current provision in the criminal code providing for  mandatory life imprisonment for certain repeat sex offenders.   Now, under section 3559(e) of title 18 of the U.S. Code, a defendant  who has been previously convicted of a Federal felony or State sex  offense committed against a child, and who is guilty of a predicate  Federal sex offense against a child, must be sentenced to life in  prison. H.R. 1862 amends section 3559 to add more Federal predicate  offenses on which to base imposition of a life sentence; namely, sexual  contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual contact  with minors between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual conduct  with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen. The bill would also provide the  requirement that a Federal predicate offense relating to coercion or  enticement of a minor be related to prostitution.   Instead, H.R. 1862 would allow coercion or enticement of a minor into  any criminal sexual activity to serve as a basis for imposition of a  mandatory life sentence. Repeat offenders should, of course, be subject  to increased penalties, and, for some offenses, life imprisonment is  appropriate. Yet Congress should not mandate that life imprisonment be  the only sentencing option.   For far too long, the Federal criminal justice system has relied on  an unsustainable system of mass incarceration that is largely driven by  inflexible mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimums are not  necessary to impose appropriate sentences. The judge at sentencing has  all the information he or she needs to impose a sentence commensurate  with the crime committed and the culpability of the offender. Arrived  at this way, sentences may still be quite lengthy--perhaps, in some  cases, life in prison--but these penalties must be determined on a  case-by-case basis. Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join with  me and others in opposing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), a  [[Page H4401]]  distinguished former member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend from  Virginia, the chairman of the committee, that the acts are heinous. It  appears that there is no addition to the underlying aspect of section  3559(e) of title 18 that says, a defendant who has been previously  convicted of a felony Federal or State sex offense committed against a  child and who is guilty of a predicate Federal sex offense against a  child must be sentenced to life imprisonment.   But, again, the bill is not written that way. I agree with everything  my good friend, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Roby) said. I want to  congratulate her for her commitment, as so many of us, as women who  have come to the United States Congress who are mothers, have a special  interest in children, and, in particular, to avoid the horrific abuse  of children, and sexual abuse. That is an important cause, and the  underlying bill is important and crucial.    But I maintain that there is a lack of clarity into whether or not,  in fact, there are additional mandatory minimums because it is broken  down in these elements. The imposition of a life sentence, namely,  sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual  contact with a minor between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual  conduct with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen.   The question is: Is the discretion of the court and the prosecutor  there?   I am not in the court. I don't know what the facts are, except for  the heinousness of tainting and violating a child. I want that criminal  brought to justice, but I want that prosecutor and that judge and the  defense under this existing statute to be able to address that question  and to be able to address the vileness or the mitigating factors in  that instance.   I don't want repeat offenders. Some have alleged that there should be  a variety of responses to sex offenders. I am aware of international  sex trafficking and men that travel to international places to have sex  with a child. I can't imagine that that would not fall on deaf ears in  a courtroom under the existing statute of 3559(e). And that is the  imposition of life imprisonment.   But there is merit to the question of discretion and the assessment  of the court. Now, I might say, with a little aside, that there are  some populations that don't get fair treatment, no matter what the case  is, yet I am yielding to the court because I do think there is merit to  this idea of one mandatory sentence after another, and that that is the  only response that one must get the mandatory minimum.   In the backdrop of this Attorney General, who has expressed no  interest in rehabilitation, in treatment, or in real criminal justice  reform, I am frightened. I am frightened about what will happen in the  Nation's U.S. attorneys and Federal courts across America.   Will we again reinstitute the wave of incarcerated persons marching  in under mandatory minimums?  [[Page H4402]]                                     time  1645    Will the epidemic begin again?   It is a difficult posture to stand on the floor of the House when you  are discussing a baby, a child, a 12-year-old. There is no divide  between my belief and Congresswoman Roby's belief. It is heinous. They  should be punished.   We may have a disagreement of what may be a process that reenacts and  restores our pathway on mass incarceration. It is not clear in the  bill, plain and simple.   I heard the response of the chairman: There is nothing new. Then it  should have been tied to 3559(c) and just say, ``must be sentenced to  life in prison, as it is.'' But it seems that there is a refinement, so  more and more opportunities for mandatory minimums and no discretion  for the judge.   In a courtroom, the judge, at sentencing, has all the information he  or she needs to impose a sentence commensurate with the crime committed  and the culpability of the offender. At that time, lock them up, throw  the key away.   I am not sure what the Department of Justice is speaking about in  terms of loopholes. There are some very fine men and women who have  headed up U.S. Attorneys Offices over the years and decades, and they  have gotten their man or woman.   So the question is: With an Attorney General that we have, who stood  in the way of criminal justice reform in the last Congress as we were  on the precipice of doing great things, now I am supposed to be  convinced that he is in any way sympathetic to the mass incarceration  which disproportionately impacts African Americans.   No, this is not a case that is a bill that points or focuses on  African Americans. I am very clear about that. I don't suggest that at  all. But I know the ultimate result of mandatory minimums has a  disproportionate impact on African Americans, as evidenced by the  census population in the Federal Prison Bureau, in the Federal criminal  justice system, and in State prisons across America.   I want to work with my colleagues. I want to save children. All of us  are brought to tears when some heinous, vile human being wants to taint  a child. But if a judge can't understand that, shame on them. If a  prosecutor doesn't understand that, shame on them.   And they have got 3559(e) that expresses that, which would include  the illicit sexual conduct with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen and,  if not, that could be stated in there, and the language ``must be  sentenced to life in prison.''   I am not sure where we are going, but I would hope that we could  clarify that 3559(e) answers all the questions and that we don't find  added mandatory minimums which impact communities disproportionately as  the only solution to getting a dastardly person off the streets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would like everyone to think about this in a very general way, that  expanding the scope of offenses subject to mandatory minimums is just  as harmful as enacting new ones. It is the same thing. And so,  accordingly, I oppose this legislation.   Those who commit crimes against children deserve to be punished, and  repeat offenders most certainly deserve to face increased penalties.  There is no one that, I don't think, in this House, disagrees with  that.   But nevertheless, I oppose mandatory minimum sentencing and,  therefore, I must oppose this legislation. I believe that judges are  the best suited to determine the just and appropriate punishment in  each case.   So for the foregoing reasons, I urge each and every one of my  colleagues here to oppose H.R. 1862.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1842, a bill that is  intended to address gaps in our child protection laws.   Now, this bill makes a number of changes to the Federal criminal code  that, unfortunately, makes the same error that was previously made. It  results in the expanded imposition of mandatory minimum sentences. I  don't know where we get this notion that mandatory minimum sentences  are a solution.   H.R. 1842 amends section 2250(d) of the criminal code, which provides  for an enhanced penalty for sex offenders who commit a crime of  violence while in noncompliance of sex offender registration and  reporting requirements.   In addition to the Federal crimes of violence already included in  that statute, this bill would add State crimes of violence as predicate  offenses that, in turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory 5- year prison sentence to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed  for failing to register or comply with sex offender registration and  reporting requirements.   H.R. 1842 would also add prior military child sex offenses to several  recidivist sentencing provisions, most of which carry mandatory minimum  penalties of at least 15 years or life, itself.   Perhaps we should expand coverage of enhanced sentences for the  offenses added by this bill, but we should do so without expanding the  number of mandatory minimums. The judges, not the Congress--not us--are  in the best position to impose sentences for even the most offensive  criminal violations because they know the facts and circumstances of  each case.                                time  1700    There is an increasing bipartisan, national recognition that  mandatory minimum sentences are not only unfair, but they are also  counterproductive. Instead of expanding the coverage of mandatory  minimums, we should be eliminating them. Individuals convicted of  serious offenses will still receive appropriately lengthy sentences,  but they will not be set on a one-size-fits-all basis.   We want to examine the facts, the circumstances in each case, and the  judge is in the best position to do that. We should not be assuming  that we can sit here and pass these national laws that will not help  and will make it difficult for judges to do their work.   Unfortunately, this bill takes the opposite course, and that is why I  must oppose it. I encourage my colleagues to think about what we are  doing here and oppose H.R. 1842. I urge your support against this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, we are indebted to the gentleman  from Virginia, who, for years, was the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations in the  Judiciary Committee and still carries with him the understanding and  the experience that leads him to be on the floor with us today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott) in support of his position.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is  the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations in the House Judiciary Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman  from Michigan for his leadership and, as well, the gentleman who is a  proponent of this legislation which, on its face, provides for an  enhanced penalty for sex offenders who commit a crime of violence while  in noncompliance of sex offender registration and reporting  requirements. That offense can apply to that in the Military Code of  Justice, Tribal law, State law, and Federal law.   It also adds State crimes of violence as a predicate offense that, in  turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory or an enhanced  sentencing to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed for  failing to register or comply with the sex offender registration  reporting requirements.   I believe, as my colleagues have said, that the underlying premise of  this bill will join us together in linking arms, there is no doubt. It  should be the rule of this Congress and the rule of elected  [[Page H4405]]  officials from State to local government, the U.S. Military Code of  Justice, and Tribal law to protect our children; and certainly, the  idea of noncompliance with sex registration should be addressed in any  court proceeding dealing with these offenders.   The issue, I believe, is the question, again, of: What do we gain by  the implementing of a mandatory minimum? In this instance, it is an  enhanced 5-year sentence. But there may be a number of reasons in terms  of an individual moving from State to State where the person is not  registered.   Again, I have to turn my attention to where we are and where we stand  on this day, May 22, 2017. It makes a difference. It makes a difference  if we have an Attorney General that does not seem to have any interest  in rehabilitation, any interest in ensuring that the mass incarceration  ends, the disparate treatment of different races and ethnic groups in  the criminal justice system ends.   As has been noted already, the previous policies of Attorney General  Holder that were fair and did not add to the enhancement of crime,  which allowed discretion by prosecutors of not adding up on the  particular defendant any number of offenses that would create 200- and  300-year sentencing and, therefore, having people languish in prisons  across this country, building up the record of private prisons, and  seeing teeming numbers in our Federal prison system, that is what we  are facing now.                                time  1715    There is no doubt that the present law, I believe, does, in fact,  cover the efforts of the proponent of this legislation. Obviously,  there will be a difference of opinion, but I believe that there is  sufficient coverage in the underlying legislation without adding this  particular enhancement.   I would hope that our colleagues who are in support of this bill,  just as I respect their commitment to fighting against sexual violence,  sexual contact, and sexual criminal acts against children, would  recognize that a discussion about mandatory minimums does not, in any  way, diminish one's commitment to the underlying premise of this  legislation.   There are too many unknown variables with the leadership of the  Attorney General and his indication as to what kind of treatment there  should be for underlying crimes and his wish to have newly appointed  U.S. Attorneys, many of whom are not appointed, not confirmed, so that  we can, again, overcriminalize America, overcriminalize the acts of  individuals, and create another siege of mass incarceration.   We will have a number of other bills that will be on the floor with  the same concerns that will be expressed. Again, let me say that I  support the idea of fighting against child sex trafficking and violent  sexual crimes perpetrated against children. I support the opposition to  such and the incarceration of those and bringing those individuals to  justice. I do believe, however, that there are many ways of dealing  with this, including incarceration without a continuous either  enhancement or continued increase of the number of mandatory minimums  that are continuing to be added to individuals who are recidivists and  who are convicted of Federal, State, or military crimes, in this  instance.    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    I commend the gentlewoman for her consistent  understanding and explaining why mass incarceration is at the base of  all of the debate that is going on.   I am hoping that more and more people who listen to these discussions  that we have here in the House of Representatives will begin to  understand that mass incarceration is not the answer to our problems.  As a matter of fact, they compound the problems.   I salute the gentlewoman for her tenacity and understanding and  explaining this situation to everyone who can listen to our discussions  here.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman for that very thoughtful  addition and his kind words.   I think what I want to say to Mr. Conyers, in concluding, is that  mass incarceration is real. We have lived with this for decades. We  finally have gotten to the point that judges recognize that there are  many different ways to deal with individuals who are recidivists at  sentencing, regardless of whether or not the previous conviction, as I  said earlier, was Federal, State, or military court, and now Tribal.  That is the only point that we are making here.   Next week, we will have 10 more bills with mandatory minimums. We  will all agree with the underlying premise, which is to lock the bad  guys up, but we do believe that there is some value to the discretion  of judges and courts. I don't believe anyone on this floor--none of us,  Republicans or Democrats--would have any argument--none--on the  underlying premise of our absolute responsibility, without question, of  defending and protecting children from these vile individuals. But I  don't have the facts inside the courtroom, and there is not a one-size- fits-all answer. That is what mandatory minimums are. All it does is  load our prison systems with bodies, one after another.   I conclude with this. The courts have asked for discretion. I would  hope that in the Federal system those who are appointed have, in fact,  both the wherewithal, the knowledge, the sense of justice, and the  right to make the decision based upon the laws and based upon the  vileness of what has been engaged in.   This is not an opposition. This is a plea for collaboration.   If I may say one thing personally. There are neighbors that I know in  my community who have been accused of certain things. They are  dignified citizens--not with regard to this particular underlying act-- but dignified citizens, former military persons, and they are  languishing under a mandatory minimum. It is disgraceful. Let me be  very clear: It is not a sex offense, not an offense of violence. It is  minimal, at best. But they are operating under a mandatory. It  literally is disgraceful how this has destroyed their lives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1842 is a well-intentioned bill meant to ensure  that repeat sex offenders are punished for their crimes, whether their  prior offenses are State, Federal, or military.   While I believe that repeat sex offenders of any kind should receive  appropriately lengthy sentences, I disagree with the imposition of  mandatory minimums. We are not the court. We are not the judge. We do  not hear the facts and circumstances in each case.   I appeal to good common sense and good legal analysis that we oppose  this legislation that would amplify the difficulties that we already  know exist. I hope that we will oppose this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to H.R. 883, the  Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017.   You see, child sexual exploitation and abuse are reprehensible crimes  committed against the most vulnerable members of our society.  Unfortunately, these offenses have been increasingly facilitated by the  use of the internet in recent years. H.R. 883 would change the  administrative subpoena statute to facilitate the prosecution of  criminals who commit these terrible crimes against children.   Without question, I support the goal of pursuing these criminals,  but, nevertheless, I am concerned that this bill would eliminate  judicial oversight of nondisclosure orders currently required prior to  the issuance of the administrative subpoenas.   Section 3486 of title 18 of the United States Code authorizes  investigators to request a 90-day order of nondisclosure from a  district court judge. The order of nondisclosure forbids the recipient,  such as an internet service provider, from alerting the target of the  investigation of the law enforcement's inquiry. H.R. 883 would extend  the nondisclosure period from 90 days to 180 days to allow  investigators more time to complete their investigations before the  target is informed of the inquiry.   Although I would like to have more information about why it is  necessary to extend this time period, it is particularly problematic  combined with the other significant change to the law made by this very  legislation. H.R. 883 would allow investigators to require  nondisclosure of internet service providers without the approval of a  judge, thereby eliminating any judicial oversight prior to issuance of  the subpoena.   The administrative subpoena authority is an extraordinary power given  to certain agencies by Congress under its limited circumstances. While  the legislation would allow a recipient to challenge a nondisclosure  order in court, I am concerned about the bill's elimination of judicial  approval on the front end.   I understand the desire to do more to facilitate the investigation of  these crimes and that the online context for them has raised issues  that we should continue to examine, but I do not believe we have been  given enough information justifying this bill, at least in its current  form.   Elimination of prior judicial approval of nondisclosure orders is a  step we should undertake only based on evidence and careful  deliberation. A bill such as the one before us warrants at least a  legislative hearing to consider its potential ramifications. I don't  think that is asking too much that we have a hearing on this matter  before we decide what to do with the proposal rather than not have one  at all. Our committee has not had the benefit of any such hearing on  this legislation, and I think this is not the proper way the members of  the House Judiciary Committee, who are mostly lawyers, should proceed.   Mr. Speaker, accordingly, I oppose H.R. 883, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is one of the consistent  leaders for a good criminal justice system.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member very much,  and I thank him for his work.   I think the work that we are doing in Judiciary certainly has far- reaching impact. It is important to try to make more efficient the way  that we address these very heinous acts against our children.    As a strong advocate for children throughout my career, I agree that  we in Congress must do everything within our power and authority to  prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse. The Targeting Child  Predators Act of 2017 is intended to assist investigators in their  pursuit of online predators.  [[Page H4408]]    I fully support efforts to locate and prosecute individuals who  commit such heinous crimes. However, I believe we should discuss the  proposal before us with more information from all who would be impacted  prior to approving the changes to the law this bill proposes.   This has a lot of moving parts and participants, particularly in  relation to online internet and the variety of providers that are  stakeholders in all of this.   This bill would modify a powerful yet historically controversial  investigatory tool: the administrative subpoena. Administrative  subpoenas allow certain investigators investigating specified crimes to  obtain private records without judicial approval. I can account for the  fact, Mr. Speaker, that there are many instances where this may be a  vital approach.   We know that we live in a very difficult time, and a number of  incidents dealing with national security and others may certainly be  impacted by such; but, obviously, there are other subpoenas that are  attendant to those particular acts. But the administrative subpoenas,  as indicated, allow Federal investigators investigating specified  crimes to obtain private records, as indicated, without judicial  approval.   Although investigators do not need sign-off from a judge before  issuing such a subpoena, there is one layer of judicial review that  prevents them from abusing their subpoena power. That is the judicial  consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the issuance of  subpoenas.   At present, a district court judge must determine if circumstances  exist to justify issuance of a 90-day nondisclosure order in connection  with administrative subpoenas. Under the terms that I understand are in  this proposed bill, investigators could require nondisclosure by  subpoena recipients for a longer period--180 days--and without first  receiving the approval of a district judge, effectively eliminating  judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the issuance of  subpoenas. Subpoena recipients would have the ability to seek judicial  review of the nondisclosure requirement only after receiving the  subpoena. I believe that this provision raises concerns that remove the  wisdom of district judges from this process at the time the gag orders  are imposed.   Congress authorized the use of these subpoenas to allow investigators  to obtain information quickly and expeditiously, and I think they work  that way. The intervention of judicial review has not proven to be an  obstruction so much so that you might remove it and the wisdom of the  court. Congress also expressly required that investigators seek the  approval of a district judge for nondisclosure orders connected to  these subpoenas.   I share my colleagues' desire to locate and prosecute those who  commit child exploitation and abuse crimes, and, in essence, let's get  them, but I do think that the willingness to remove judicial review is  one of question.   Those individuals who hide behind computer screens committing  abhorrent acts against children on the internet must be apprehended and  made to answer for their crimes. I would think that the judge would be  well aware of how sensitive this is and use their best impression to  get moving and to allow the process to proceed.   I think this Nation is a land of laws. We abide by the rule of law,  and Congress has a right to draft laws. But I do think, in this  instance, the rule of law, abiding by the rule of law, allowing for the  active participation of the court and the wisdom of the court is not  too much to ask in a nation that believes in democracy, believes in the  rights of the offenders and, as well, the victims.   So I am very concerned about this bill, and I would hope that we  would have the opportunity to have this addressed or the issues  addressed, or addressed in the Senate; and I look forward to those  issues being addressed in the Senate so that we can, together, handle  the concerns that are being expressed and have a bill that does not  remove judicial oversight and the wisdom of the court.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 883, the ``Targeting Child  Predators Act of 2017.'' As a strong advocate for children throughout  my career, I agree that we in Congress must do everything within our  power and authority to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse.   The ``Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017'' is intended to assist  investigators in their pursuit of online child predators.   I fully support efforts to locate and prosecute individuals who  commit such heinous crimes. However, I believe we should discuss the  proposal before us--with more information from all who would be  impacted--prior to approving the changes to the law this bill proposes.   This bill would modify a powerful, yet historically controversial,  investigatory tool--the administrative subpoena.   Administrative subpoenas allow certain Federal investigators,  investigating specified crimes, to obtain private records without  judicial approval.   Although investigators do not need sign-off from a judge before  issuing such a subpoena, there is one layer of judicial review that  prevents them from abusing their subpoena power.   That is the judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to  the issuance of subpoenas.   At present, a district court judge must determine if circumstances  exist to justify issuance of a 90-day nondisclosure order in connection  with administrative subpoenas.   Under the terms proposed in this bill, investigators could require  nondisclosure by subpoena recipients for a longer period--180 days--and  without first receiving the approval of a district judge, effectively  eliminating judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the  issuance of subpoenas.   Subpoena recipients would have the ability to seek judicial review of  the nondisclosure requirement only after receiving the subpoena.   I am deeply concerned with the provision that would remove the wisdom  of district judges from this process at the time the gag orders are  imposed.   Congress authorized the use of these subpoenas to allow investigators  to obtain information quickly and expeditiously.   But, Congress also expressly required that investigators seek the  approval of a district judge for nondisclosure orders connected to  these subpoenas.   I share my colleagues' desire to locate and prosecute those who  commit child exploitation and abuse crimes.   Those individuals, who hide behind computer screens, committing  abhorrent acts against children on the internet, must be apprehended  and made to answer for their crimes.   I am not convinced that this bill is the best way to go about doing  so.   I hope we can find a way to address this issue, with more information  from all concerned.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the most problematic aspect of H.R. 883 is that it would  eliminate prior judicial approval of nondisclosure orders. I am firmly  opposed to that. And while I fully support efforts to investigate  crime, particularly those perpetrated against children, I cannot  support this bill without knowing more about how it will affect an  already extraordinary investigative power.   Let's have a hearing. That is what our committee is for. The  Judiciary Committee should inquire into this very carefully, and, in  the absence of such evidence, I must urge, at this time, our colleagues  join me in opposing H.R. 883.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 695, the Child  Protection Improvements Act, and tip my hat to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), the author of the bill, who we  will hear from shortly.   We have a special responsibility to protect our young people and  vulnerable adults. For that reason, I am pleased that we are  considering this measure which would provide a robust, easily  accessible, cost-effective background check system for organizations  that work with youth and vulnerable adults. I support it for a number  of reasons.   To begin with, it will facilitate more comprehensive criminal  background checks which provide a critical layer of protection. These  checks help identify individuals who could potentially harm  participants in programs for children, young people, and vulnerable  adults as well.   Background checks also serve to ensure the integrity and  accountability of the organizations that sponsor these programs by  reducing potential threats. Results from background checks that search  criminal histories nationwide are more reliable than background checks  that only search criminal histories in a few States. I think that is  obvious.   Secondly, the State background checks are no substitute whatsoever  for the FBI's fingerprint-based system, which is the only nationwide  database that allows a search of criminal histories in every single  State.   Currently, this database can only be accessed through the State law  enforcement agencies, and many States limit the ability of  organizations to access the system, with some States completely even  forbidding access--no access whatsoever. As a result, organizations  must navigate a labyrinth of State laws or rely on private companies to  perform background checks of employees and volunteers.   H.R. 695, on the other hand, would provide organizations with the  ability to access the FBI's superior system without impacting the  autonomy of States or the organizations. States would be able to  continue or establish their own background check systems, and  organizations would not be required to perform FBI background checks of  potential applicants or volunteers.   Finally, the need for this legislation is clearly justified by the  Child Safety Pilot Program, which we implemented over a decade ago.  This program documented the effectiveness of nationwide background  checks for youth-serving organizations. Based on a comprehensive review  of thousands of criminal history records spanning an 8-year period, the  program demonstrated that people who might pose a risk to the safety of  children, nevertheless, attempted to work with children.    For example, the program identified applicants who, to avoid  detection, used aliases, incorrect dates of birth, or wrong Social  Security numbers. Some of these applicants had serious criminal  histories, including even homicides, sexual assaults, child  endangerment, and even rape.   More than a third of criminal history hits were from out-of-state,  and more than half of the people with criminal history hits failed to  disclose them on their application.   H.R. 695 would give organizations access to the FBI's comprehensive  background check system and thereby help ensure the safety of our youth  and others.   Accordingly, I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in  supporting this important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Michigan  (Mr. Bishop) for his contribution.   I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member of the Intelligence  Committee and the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me also congratulate Mr. Schiff and  Mr. Bishop. And as was indicated on the floor, thank you very much, Mr.  Conyers.   This is the kind of bill that is corrective and effective. This bill  would allow a more effective and comprehensive criminal background  check, which will help identify the integrity and accountability of the  organizations that sponsor these programs.   Many of us have worked with the Boys and Girls Clubs, Boys and Girls  Scouts, and many other organizations that really work to help children.  These nationwide criminal background checks are more reliable than  background checks that only search criminal histories in a few States.   Many States currently limit the ability of organizations to access  their database and, thus, force organizations to depend on private  companies to perform background checks of employees and volunteers. If  anybody has been on the board of a nonprofit dealing with children, you  realize that you want to put most of your resources investing in the  programs to help these children. H.R. 695, however, would alleviate  this burden of expense and allow organizations to access the FBI's more  robust system.   In the Child Safety Pilot Program, which we implemented over 10 years  ago, it demonstrates the effectiveness of nationwide background checks  for youth-serving organizations. The program has effectively exposed  applicants who use aliases, incorrect dates of birth, and other  identifiers, some of whom have serious criminal backgrounds. That is  the preventative way to protect our children, by ensuring a very  healthy, robust vetting of individuals who want to engage with our  children.   H.R. 695 would allow organizations to access the FBI's comprehensive  background check system and to create a more accurate determination of  individuals who want to work with children. Volunteers we welcome, but  we want to ensure that those volunteers are there to take care of our  children, to help our children, and improve the lives of our children.  H.R. 695 is a very important contributor to that effort.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  am pleased to make my closing remarks.   Mr. Speaker, the Child Protection Improvements Act is a reasonable,  bipartisan piece of legislation intended to protect our children and  vulnerable adults from harm and give those who love them peace of mind.   Although we still have work to do to address the accuracy and  reliability of some criminal history records and give individuals an  opportunity to challenge incomplete or inaccurate records, this is a  good bill. For those reasons, I urge everyone in this Chamber to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
