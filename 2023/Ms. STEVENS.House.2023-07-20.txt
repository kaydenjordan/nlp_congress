 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill I  authored that is included in the FAA package to research severe  turbulence and the impact of climate change on the flight forecasts.   Turbulence is the top cause of injuries to both passengers and crew.  My bill improves the FAA's understanding of turbulence to better inform  safety measures for flight crews and the flying public.   Last month, a scientific study analyzed 40 years of high-quality  atmospheric data. The researchers found severe clear-air turbulence  increased 55 percent from 1979 due to climate change.   Further, other recent studies have shown that turbulence will  increase significantly as the climate changes, with the most severe  turbulence increasing by 149 percent over the next several decades.   We should all be concerned about the rise of turbulence and the  projected increase in the years ahead.   Unfortunately, scientists and researchers have reported their  difficulty in calculating turbulence due to limited data coverage.   That is why the FAA needs better tools and research to address  passenger safety amid this threat to air travel. The FAA research we  support today means that tomorrow, Americans will fly safer.                            ____________________
