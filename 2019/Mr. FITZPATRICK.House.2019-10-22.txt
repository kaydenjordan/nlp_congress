 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I join with my bipartisan colleagues here to proclaim  that animal abuse is unacceptable and must end, which is why we are all  proud to be supporters, and many of us, original cosponsors of the PACT  Act because it strengthens Federal law regarding animal cruelty.                                time  1645    As was previously mentioned, the Animal Crush Video Act of 2010  banned the creation and distribution of these despicable videos.  However, it did not make the actual animal abuse itself a crime.  [[Page H8357]]    The bipartisan PACT Act goes a step further and outlaws this  malicious animal cruelty, regardless of the presence of video evidence.   Mr. Speaker, as a former FBI agent, my agency's profiling studies  demonstrated how violence against animals is a precursor to human  violence. That is why we are fighting aggressively against egregious  animal cruelty and why it is so important.   Law enforcement, including the FOP, strongly supports this  legislation because it provides another tool for them to use for animal  abuse cases that might otherwise go unprosecuted.   More than 100 law enforcement agencies and organizations across our  country have endorsed the PACT Act. We must come together and stand up  for innocent, defenseless animals, which is why there are over 300--in  fact, 301, to be exact--cosponsors, both Democrats and Republicans, on  this bill.   I commend Senator Toomey, our colleague from Pennsylvania, for  introducing the companion bill in the Senate. We must pass the PACT Act  as soon as possible so that it can be signed into law, and we must make  sure that this type of animal abuse no longer happens.   Together, we will end all types of animal cruelty and will continue  to be a voice for the voiceless.
