 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible work of three students from my district. Evan McKinney,  Ayden Greer, and David Bell from Elizabeth Davis Middle School in  Chester, Virginia, were recently selected as winners of C-SPAN's 2023  national StudentCam Competition.   This year, students addressed the theme of, ``If you were a newly  elected Member of Congress, which issue would be your first priority  and why?''   It is a topic I am particularly interested in.   Evan, Ayden, and David created a documentary titled, ``Do the Twist:  The Startling Truth About Opioid Abuse in America.''   Their work looked into some of the root causes of the opioid crisis  and its devastating impacts.   I thank Evan, Ayden, and David for helping shine a light on such a  pervasive issue in our district and our Nation. I congratulate them on  winning the prize out of nearly 3,000 participants. They made their  school, their community, our district, and their Congresswoman proud.                            ____________________
