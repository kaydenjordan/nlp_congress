 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I congratulate her on her historic leadership position.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation and our national security have always been  tied to our ability to utilize the resources that we have right here in  America to remain free.   The energy resources that are underneath the feet of my constituents  were vital to the production and fueling of the tanks, the planes, and  the ships that gave Americans the advantages that we needed to win  World War II.   And now, the Chinese Communist Party threatens free nations with  oppression.   The Biden administration has allowed our Strategic Petroleum Reserve  to be sold to Chinese companies for political purposes. Instead of  approving new leasing permits, Biden delayed new drilling projects and  canceled on day one the Keystone XL pipeline.   Instead of incentivizing companies to use the resources that we have  in Pennsylvania, Biden targeted American energy producers with new  regulations that made natural gas and oil more expensive for American  families.   Selling away our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for political gain has  left our Nation less safe and our economy less secure.   Mr. Speaker, 950,000 barrels of American strategic petroleum to the  Chinese Communist Party?   This boggles the American mind.   It is time to refill our strategic reserves. It is time to stop  risking our national security to score cheap political points.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.
