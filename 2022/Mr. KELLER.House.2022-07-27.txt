 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Dr. Foxx, of  North Carolina for yielding.   Unlike the multi-employer pension program, which was recently  injected with billions of taxpayer dollars, the single-employer  insurance program is self-sufficient. It is funded by premiums paid by  employer sponsors to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. By most  accounts, PBGC's single-employer insurance system is healthy and not in  need of bailouts. Yet a bailout is exactly what H.R. 6929 is. You  cannot give public money out to one person without first taking it from  another.   This bill does not help Pennsylvanians without a pension plan or with  losses in their personal retirement accounts. On the contrary, this  bill is an irresponsible giveaway that sets a dangerous precedent for  the Federal Government's involvement in pension plans going forward.                                time  1600    The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bailout will cost  taxpayers nearly $800 million over 10 years; not including the lifetime  cost of the bill, which could reach $1.3 billion. I wonder how the  people that have to pay that in the next generation are going to pay  their rent, afford their college, and afford their groceries.   Congressional Democrats and the Biden administration have already  spent tens of billions on insolvent and failing multi-employer plans,  without holding trustees accountable for failing workers or retirees,  or meaningfully reforming the pension system to prevent future  insolvency.   Once again, the Federal Government is offering a pension bailout.   Hardworking taxpayers who have their own retirements to worry about  cannot continue to shoulder this burden. We cannot set this kind of  precedent for a single-employer system. If Congress gives special  treatment to this plan covered by today's bill, the other 5,000 single- employer plans also managed by PBGC will pressure Congress to do the  same for all.   Is Congress then expected to top up or provide a lump sum to every  future terminated plan? These are serious implications that cannot be  ignored.   The vast majority of participants in terminated plans receive their  full benefits. The Delphi plans are no exception. Nearly three-fourths  of participants were not subject to the PBGC's statutory guarantee  limits.   This body must remember it works for the taxpayers, not political  interest groups. Americans don't work hard each and every day to fund  irresponsible pet projects. We need more fiscal sanity, not more  pension bailouts.   On top of all these issues, the manager's amendment is simply a  budget gimmick to make the bill appear to cost nothing.   In reality, it accelerates the time period in which single-employer  plans are required to pay their variable rate premiums to the PBGC to  fit within the budget window, and it adds nothing to the PBGC's bottom  line.    PBGC is going to receive the same amount of money with or  without the manager's amendment.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this legislation and the  dangerous, fiscally irresponsible precedent it sets.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana.   Madam Speaker, I am Fred Keller. My pronouns are he and him, and I am  a man standing at the podium wearing a blue suit, demanding that border  czar, Kamala Harris, get serious about securing our southern border,  rather than playing identity politics.   The number of illegal aliens crossing at our southern border has  already surpassed last year's record of 1.7 million encounters. The  U.S. Border Patrol confirmed in its latest report that there were over  200,000 encounters in June alone, the fourth consecutive month that  encounters have been this high.   Border Patrol's report also revealed that 15,000 unaccompanied  children were apprehended and released to sponsors without verification  or documentation to ensure those sponsors are legal residents or U.S.  citizens.   This loophole in the Biden administration's sponsor assessment  process puts these children in danger by exposing them to illegal  activity, human trafficking, and other dangers.   Yet, in the same month that this report was released, Secretary  Mayorkas said that the border was secure. Meanwhile in Congress,  Democrats refuse to hold a hearing on securing the southern border. In  fact, Republicans on the Oversight Committee have requested a hearing  on this issue, not just once, not just twice, but six times. Every  request has been ignored by the Democrat majority on the committee.   Beyond their blatant detachment from reality, the Biden  administration and House Democrats have made it clear they are  unwilling to take action to secure our border and protect Americans.   With a new majority after the November elections, Republicans in  Congress will tackle this issue head-on.
