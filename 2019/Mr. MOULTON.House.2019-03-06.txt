 Mr. Speaker, amidst the tragedies of the Iraq war, I  witnessed one of the proudest demonstrations of democracy in modern  times. When Iraqis voted for the first time, they dipped their fingers  in ink and, rather than hiding those fingers for fear of reprisal, they  held them high walking through the streets.   What they were saying was that, for the first time in their lives,  their opinion mattered. Their vote counted. It is the most fundamental  requirement of a democracy. Yet, today, we know that this basic right  has never been truly guaranteed here at home.   Our elections are not free when Americans must choose between  providing for their families and casting a vote; our elections are not  fair when gerrymandering predetermines them or dark money makes some  votes count more than others; and our people do not have a voice when  they are turned away by voter ID laws that make it easier to buy a gun  than cast a vote.   H.R. 1 changes that, taking a stand against Citizens United,  resolving to end gerrymandering, and making it far easier for Americans  to vote.   I believe that America, however imperfect, is the greatest democracy  on Earth. H.R. 1 finally makes us act that way.                            ____________________
