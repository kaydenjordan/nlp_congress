Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3697.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Idaho?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member  Removal Act. I introduced this bill with Chairman Goodlatte and  Representatives Comstock and King for a very simple reason: the United  States is facing an ever-growing danger from transnational gangs, and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, needs  more tools to deal with this danger.   The Federal Government's most important responsibility is the safety  and security of the American people. However, we are not fulfilling  that responsibility when we allow gangs to illegally enter our country  with the express purpose of victimizing innocent Americans.   In communities across our country, transnational gangs are using  violence and the threat of violence to create a climate of fear that  allows them to operate with near impunity. They regularly target local  business owners and law enforcement officials. Innocent bystanders,  those unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, are  also paying a price.   According to ICE, these gangs ``have grown to become a serious threat  in American communities across the Nation--not only in cities, but  increasingly in suburban and even rural areas. Entire neighborhoods and  sometimes whole communities are held hostage by and subjected to their  violence.''   Furthermore, ICE has found that, ``membership of these violent  transnational gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals.''   The most infamous transnational gang, of course, is MS-13, which  entered the U.S. in the 1980s. Today, it has over 10,000 gang members  operating inside the United States alone. At every level, our  enforcement officials are working to curb this growing threat with  large-scale enforcement actions. These include Operation New Dawn,  which netted almost 1,100 arrests over a 6-week period.   However, we all know that prosecution of criminal gang members is  notoriously difficult. This is because victims and witnesses of gang  crime are often reluctant to testify because of the quite reasonable  fear of retaliation against them or their families, thus many gang  members are never convicted of the crimes they have committed.   The question is often asked: Why should law-abiding Americans have to  wait until an alien gang member has committed a deportable offense? Why  not deport the gang member before he has a chance to victimize more  innocent people? The answer is that current immigration law contains  dangerous loopholes that alien gang members are exploiting.   Currently, an alien may not be deported, even if he is known to be a  member of a criminal gang or participating in gang activities. ICE must  wait for the gang member to be first convicted of a deportable offense.   H.R. 3697 changes that. For the first time, ICE will be permitted to  place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of  being criminal gang members. Our bill sets out clear specifications for  what crimes are considered to be gang related, relying on longstanding  Federal criminal law to determine what a gang or group consists of.   In addition, our bill permits the Secretary of Homeland Security,  using procedures already used by the Secretary of State, to designate a  gang as a criminal gang. This would be done in a transparent way  through notification to Congress and publication in the Federal  Register and with meaningful judicial review.   The conclusive decision as to whether to place an alien in removal  proceedings would rest with the Department of Homeland Security. When  an alien is charged, the charge must be proven by evidence on the  record in immigration court.   I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to  charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not  allow that. As a former immigration attorney, I know the importance of  due process and know how important it is for illegal immigrants and for  Americans and everyone within the jurisdictions of the immigration  court to receive due process. I can tell you that our bill is  consistent with due process.   Under H.R. 3697, ICE has the burden of proof when charging an alien  with a deportable offense. While the alien has the burden of proof when  they are inadmissible, a denial of gang membership should be sufficient  to shift the burden back to the government. The government must  convince an immigration judge of its case. Of course, an alien ordered  removed as a gang member has every right to appeal that order to the  Board of Immigration Appeals and then to the Federal courts.   Ultimately, H.R. 3697 is about providing law enforcement with the  necessary tools to combat gang activity in every community in our  country. This is essential if we, as elected officials, are committed  to our responsibility to keep the American people safe and secure. That  is the purpose of H.R. 3697.   This is the third time this year the House is holding a floor vote on  portions of the Davis-Oliver Act, which I introduced back in May, to  make our country safer through stronger immigration enforcement.   I am proud that the House passed the first two bills that came from  Davis-Oliver, Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and I  encourage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3697 as well.   We must take action now or watch crime rates rise in our Nation.  There is no place in our country for criminal alien gang members, and  any legislation which makes it easier to deport them deserves the  support of every Member of this body.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I know we spent a lot of time in committee  talking about a lot of different issues, but maybe the gentleman  forgets that we had 3 whole days of hearings on the Davis-Oliver Act,  which this bill was included in, and many arguments were made against  the Davis-Oliver Act. Most of the arguments that are being made today  were not made against this portion of the act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  King).                                time  0945    Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Idaho  for yielding. I certainly commend Mrs. Comstock for the outstanding job  she has done on this.   I stand here in strong support of this bill. It is absolutely  essential that this Congress does everything it can to eradicate and  destroy MS-13. It would be shameful not to.   MS-13 has turned my district into killing fields. In the last year  and a half, 17 innocent young people have been slaughtered with  machetes and knives by MS-13. These are all young people, and these are  children of legal and illegal immigrants documented and undocumented.  It is the immigrant community that is being turned into a chamber of  horrors by MS-13. Children are afraid to go to school; their parents  are afraid to allow their kids to go out at night.   There have been 270 arrests in the last year alone. MS-13 is  terrorizing communities in my district within 15 to 20 minutes of my  home.   I am proud that this bill has been endorsed by the Sergeants  Benevolent Association of the NYPD.   Also, when I talk about 17 murders, it is exactly 1 year ago this  week that two young teenage girls, Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, both  constituents of mine, were found slaughtered, their bodies desecrated,  mutilated, and torn apart by MS-13 because they happened to be in the  wrong place at the wrong time--no gang connections, nothing whatsoever.   So this is something which has required extensive coordination  between the Suffolk County Police Department, ICE, Homeland Security  Investigations, Homeland Security, FBI task forces, and the U.S.  Attorney's Office all working around the clock to try to eradicate this  evil.   But more has to be done, and that is what this bill is about. We  cannot allow gang members to be taking advantage of loopholes in the  immigration laws. To me, nothing could be more shameful than for us not  to do our job. Nothing would be more violative of our role under the  Constitution to protect people from all enemies foreign and domestic  than for us not to pass legislation such as this. This is absolutely  essential. This isn't theoretical, and this is not hypothetical.   For those who are concerned about immigrants and those who are  concerned about DACA--and I support DACA--and those who are supportive  of the helpless in our society, how can you take any action which would  prevent us from going after MS-13? MS-13 is a violent and vicious gang,  and if we don't stand together as one, if we continue to make  hypothetical arguments or a parade of horribles, we are subjecting and  putting more young people--innocent young people--documented and  undocumented, in the line of fire and putting them into the killing  fields.   I applaud the President, I applaud the Attorney General, and I also  support the Democratic leaders in Suffolk County, all of whom have come  together in a bipartisan effort to stamp out MS-13. But we must do  more. This bill is a major step in that direction. I am proud to  support it. I am proud to stand with Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Labrador, and  Mrs. Comstock in doing this.   This is reality. This isn't make-believe. This isn't something we can  dream about, something that may go bad. This is going bad day after day  after day in my district and districts throughout the country. These  are animals. They need to be eradicated from our society, and this bill  is a major step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the bill and urge its  adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I agree. We should save our children. We  need to start deporting some criminal gang members.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Goodlatte), who is the chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Virginia an  additional 2 minutes.  [[Page H7396]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Virginia an  additional 2 minutes.  [[Page H7396]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I keep hearing again and again and again that there is  no dispute about ongoing violence or gang violence in the United  States, but what has been clear from today's argument is that our  friends on the other side just don't want to do anything about it. They  are willing to talk about the gang violence, but they don't want to  actually craft and pass legislation that does something about it.                                time  1015    I hope it is something that the American people are listening to,  because as we have debates over the next few months about what we  should be doing with regard to immigration, I hope everyone understands  that every time we try to do something about enforcement of immigration  laws, about stopping gang violation, about stopping illegal immigration  into the United States, it is very difficult to get agreement on the  other side.   Criminal alien gang members are wreaking havoc in this country.  Without stronger tools to specifically target those aliens that  terrorize our streets, gangs will continue to grow in numbers and in  strength.   The time has come to take action and to provide a path to deportation  to those that so unabashedly seek to destroy our society.   ICE has found that ``membership of these violent transnational gangs  is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals.'' Often bearing the  brunt of these gangs' violence are these very immigrant communities  that the other side claims that they want to protect.   The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes a tough approach. I  agree with that. Those gang members who have successfully evaded  prosecution through witness intimidation, employing the tactics of fear  and violence, will now be within ICE's reach. The new grounds of  removability provided by H.R. 3697 will get criminal gang members off  of our streets.   ICE's recent Operation New Dawn resulted in almost 1,100 arrests of  gang  [[Page H7399]]  members. Had H.R. 3697 been enacted prior, that number would have  almost certainly increased.   This bill is only starting the removal process, however. Make no  mistake--and there was a lot of obfuscation today about this-- immigration proceedings do not equate to deportation. The government  must prove its case and provide evidence to convince an immigration  judge that gang-related activity occurred.   As a former private immigration attorney, I have seen this process in  action, and it does work. ICE will not use this new charge as pretext,  as this ground will never be sustained by an immigration judge without  sufficient evidence.   The time for this bill is long overdue, and we cannot afford to be  distracted by extreme hypotheticals and issues not germane to what we  are discussing today.   This bill was introduced to target criminal gangs, as that term is  commonly understood, and that is what it will do once enacted. There is  no place in our country for criminal alien gang members. By removing  them from our streets, H.R. 3697 will help make our communities safer.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
