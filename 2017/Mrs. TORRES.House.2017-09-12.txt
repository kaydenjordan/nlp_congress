 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 258, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.        Page 258, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.        Page 269, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to this  appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, since I have been in Congress, I have been working with  manufacturers in my congressional district to ensure that we are doing  all we can in Congress to support them in creating good-paying, high- skilled jobs right here at home.   Last month, I took a ``Made in the 35th'' tour and traveled across my  district, meeting with manufacturers who are creating jobs here in the  U.S. They told me about how they are competing with importers from Asia  and an unfair playing field created by how our trading partners support  their manufacturers.   I continued my tour to the Port of Los Angeles, where it became  clearer where this unfair playing field has left us. Ships from Asia  come in full and leave empty.   Mr. Chairman, the ships that leave Los Angeles should be full of  American-made goods. This is the goal of the Manufacturing Extension  Partnership, or MEP: supporting American businesses through expanding  markets and supporting innovation.   Two of the nine MEP success stories in California have happened in my  congressional district. Insulfoam in Chino used the MEP to increase  production by 20 percent, while reducing their energy costs by more  than 5 percent.  [[Page H7257]]    Diamond Wipes, a very impressive company that I visited on my Made in  the 35th tour, used the MEP to expand their wet wipes business to  markets around the world.   A small investment in MEP meant real wins and expansions for these  real American businesses.                                time  1430    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense. For every dollar of MEP  investment, we can generate nearly $20 million in new sales growth and  $20 in new client investment. That is a $100 million return on my  amendment.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because that  investment could end up in one of our communities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the congresswoman from Connecticut  (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the  subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Chairman, this is a $5 million investment for manufacturers in  the U.S., and I strongly ask for the support of my colleagues in  passing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 91 Offered by Mr. McKinley    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 91  printed in House Report 115-297.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 260, line 1, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $10,000,000) (reduced by $10,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, the Environmental Security Computing  Center within NOAA--the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration--utilizes high-performance computing technology to  quickly process information from weather satellites and to predict the  path of a hurricane or the extent of damage a wildfire can create. As  recent events have shown, weather events can have a devastating impact  on the lives of our fellow Americans.   In late July, northern West Virginia experienced unexpected flooding  that placed eight counties under a state of emergency. Nearly 1,000  homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, and, tragically, two  individuals lost their lives. This was an unexpected flow of water.   Recently, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have destroyed thousands of  homes and communities, which will require a massive influx of Federal  resources to rebuild. This Congress has the responsibility to ensure  the accuracy and viability of the weather and climate monitoring work  performed by the security center.   One of the most important systems NOAA uses to process this data is  its high-performance computing assets, such as NOAA's Environmental  Security Computer Center. My amendment provides funding to complete the  build-out for that facility that NOAA has initiated. Completing the  build-out will support the supercomputer systems that NOAA uses to  process and report this important and critical weather model data.   What we are witnessing during this hurricane season, Mr. Chairman,  demonstrates just how important passage of this amendment is to our  Nation, and we are going to have reliable information provided to us.  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 94 Offered by Ms. Rosen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 94  printed in House Report 115-297.
