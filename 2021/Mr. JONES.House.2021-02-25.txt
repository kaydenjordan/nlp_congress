 Mr. Speaker, it is not often that this Chamber does  remarkable things. Today, we pass the Equality Act, which includes my  bill, the Juror Non-Discrimination Act.   This has been a long time coming and it represents progress that, for  me, was unbelievable when I was growing up. You see, to grow up poor,  Black, and gay is to not see yourself anywhere. It is also to feel  completely unseen, as so many people around you invalidate your very  existence. Growing up, I watched helplessly as opportunistic, straight  politicians--mostly White, mostly male--used my basic human rights as a  political football to further their careers.   Had this legislation been enacted when I was growing up, it would  have been direct evidence of the fact that things really do get better,  that I didn't have to hide or cry so much.   Thankfully, since childhood, things have gotten better, but that  hasn't been because of the mere passage of time. It has been because  LGBTQ advocates made life better.   Today, we send a powerful message to millions of LGBTQ people around  the country and, indeed, around the world that they are seen, that they  are valued, that their lives are worthy of being protected.   How remarkable that is, Mr. Speaker.
