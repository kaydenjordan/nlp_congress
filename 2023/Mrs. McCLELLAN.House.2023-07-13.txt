 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on amendment No. 31, which is an attempt to sanitize the  American history taught by the Department of Defense Education  Activities.   I rise as the first Black woman elected to this body from Virginia,  who grew up listening to my parents and grandparents tell stories of  their lives in the Jim Crow South and its impact on their lives,  families, and communities.   I rise as someone born and raised in the birthplace of American  democracy and the birthplace of American slavery; the home of the  father of our country, the first Commander in Chief of the Army, the  first President of the United States, who is watching this debate right  now on the wall, who owned and enslaved human beings; the home of  Thomas Jefferson, who also owned enslaved human beings, but wrote the  resounding words of the Declaration of Independence 247 years ago that  we celebrated last week: Ideals that all men are created equal and  endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness.   Unfortunately, he did not mean me.   I am from the home of the architect of the Constitution, which 13  years later, starts with the words: ``We the people.''   It did not include me.   Instead, the Constitution counted my enslaved ancestors as three- fifths of a person and did not grant us American citizenship until  ratification of the 14th Amendment.   For nearly 350 years, slavery and Jim Crow created inequity in our  communities that still exists today, and the laws that struck down Jim  Crow were not a magic wand that erased those impacts.   As more and more people who lived during Jim Crow are dying, we need  to tell their stories. We need to teach the good, the bad, and the ugly  of our history to show how it shaped us as a nation so that we can heal  from it.   This amendment teaches a delusional and irresponsible history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  First, let me just say, our diversity is our strength. The diversity of  this country is our strength. The diversity of our military is our  strength.   I keep hearing the other side of the aisle say that DEI and critical  race theory is about assigning characteristics to people based on the  color of their skin.   That is not what DEI or critical race theory are. What they are, are  a recognition that for 350 years, from the founding of this country in  Jamestown through the civil rights movement, that our laws, our social  mores assumed different characteristics based on the color of your skin  and made Black people second-class citizens.   DEI is designed to address that and to ensure that our military,  which kept my uncles from serving in combat because of the color of  their skin, to make sure their children and grandchildren want to serve  in that military because it is a welcoming and inclusive place.                                time  1830     Mr. Chairman, I want to personalize the remarks  alluded to by our ranking member because I was born Black in Virginia,  and I was raised there.   I represent the former capital of the Confederacy. My entire family  was raised in the former Confederacy. For my entire life I have lived  in the shadow of Robert E. Lee and his fellow Confederate generals. He  was a looming presence in my hometown of Petersburg where the former  Fort Lee sits.   He was a looming presence in my neighborhood. I want to talk about  the monument that the gentleman from Virginia alluded to. One of the  largest monuments to General Lee stood for 130 years around the corner  from my house, which is ironic because General Lee himself did not  believe monuments to Confederate generals should be erected because he  recognized that countries where there is a civil war, monuments to the  losing side help to foster wounds that haven't healed. That is exactly  what happened in this country.    That monument, and many others, were put up as part of a backlash for  the social, political, and economic gains of formerly enslaved people  during Reconstruction. Another wave of monuments were put up as  backlash to Brown v. Board of Education and the gains of the civil  rights movement.   When that monument came down, I felt a weight off of my shoulders  that I didn't know I was carrying. It was the burden of having to drive  past a man who fought against the country he swore to serve to keep my  ancestors enslaved. He owned people who could have been my ancestors  and was documented to be horrifically cruel to them.   We are trying to recruit a diverse armed services. We need to recruit  the sons and daughters and granddaughters of the descendants of slaves.  Having them walk into a building on a base named for their former  oppressors is not going to create a welcoming environment.    Mr. Chairman I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Tokuda).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I think this debate today demonstrates  exactly why diversity, equity, and inclusion are necessary, not only in  the military, but we probably need some training here in this body.   I am going to limit my remarks to the armed services. I want to break  down what DEI training actually is because most of the comments I have  heard today are not an accurate definition of what DEI is. I am going  to take those words one at a time.   Diversity training and diversity efforts recognize that we need to  have a military, servicemembers, and an officer corps that reflects the  diversity of  [[Page H3552]]  the country that they protect. For a wide variety of reasons, it  doesn't.   We need to recognize that our diversity is our strength and that our  unity is our power, but we can only have unity when we recognize and  respect the diversity of this country and the people who serve.   Equity recognizes that despite the fact the first casualty of the  Revolutionary War was a Black man, Black men weren't allowed to serve  in the military until the Civil War. Until 1948, the service was  segregated and Black men like my uncles were not allowed combat duty.  My uncles were only allowed to cook when they served during World War  II.   My uncles brought back home stories of the names they were called, of  the threats they received, not from the enemy but from their fellow  servicemembers. Their children and grandchildren, who heard those  stories, didn't want to serve in a military that was unwelcoming to  them.   Inclusion means we are creating an atmosphere and a workplace that is  inclusive of the full diversity of everyone who serves.   Mr. Chair, whether we like it or not, the history of this country is  complicated. The history of this country is rooted in the original sin  of slavery and 100 years of Jim Crow when Black Americans were treated  as second citizens, if they were treated as citizens at all.   We have to teach that history, and most of the amendments we have  seen today have either tried to whitewash that history or ignore that  it ever happened. We cannot do it. I urge the body to reject this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
