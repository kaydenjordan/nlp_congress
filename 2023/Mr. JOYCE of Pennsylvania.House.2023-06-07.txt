 Mr. Speaker, when President Obama said  that he would govern with a telephone and a pen, he was setting an  example for his then-Vice President. Now, the Biden administration has  attempted to enact a radical agenda through agency rulemaking.   During his first year in office, President Biden finalized  regulations that cost taxpayers more than $200 billion. This wasteful  spending cannot be allowed to continue unchecked.   It is essential that we pass the REINS Act and ensure that President  Biden is forced to account for every wasteful dollar. This legislation  would, once again, assert that Congress and not the far-left Biden  administration has the power to create law.   It is time to put a stop to the runaway spending. It is time to end  the backroom rulemaking that has been a trademark of the Biden  administration.                            ____________________
