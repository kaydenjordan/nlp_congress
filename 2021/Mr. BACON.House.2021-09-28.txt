 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize two Hispanic  trailblazers in Omaha--Robert, known as Bob, Campos and Dr. James,  known as Jim, Ramirez--for their generous contributions to our  community.   After growing up together in the same working-class South Omaha  neighborhood, Bob and Jim each went on to lead extraordinary,  successful lives, and they have made a huge difference in our  community.   Bob Campos was born in 1938 to Mexican immigrant parents in South  Omaha, a neighborhood long regarded as a melting pot of multicultural  immigrant families. Growing up, his large family shared only a one- bedroom home. So when Bob was only 8 years old, he went to work at the  neighborhood grocery store to earn some extra income for his family.   At 16 years old, Campos dropped out of high school and attempted to  enlist in the United States Marines but was unsuccessful after  falsifying his age in his application. Shortly after that, he fulfilled  his desire to serve his country by joining the U.S. Coast Guard.   After his military service, Bob moved back to Omaha and worked at the  Kiewit Construction Company. After 15 years at Kiewit, he started his  own business, Campos Construction, on January 1, 1977. Starting his  business with only $500 and a pickup truck, Campos grew his company to  become the largest minority-owned construction company in Nebraska.   Bob's reputation for excellence led him to take on high-profile  projects, to include painting the home of President Abraham Lincoln in  Illinois and building the Gerald R. Ford Conservation Center in Omaha.   In 2003, Bob leased the land to build community soccer fields in  South Omaha, personally mowing and tending to the property now known as  the Bob Campos Soccer Complex.   Bob also fosters educational leadership opportunities for Hispanic  high school students through the Grassroots Leadership Development  Program.   Dr. Jim Ramirez was born in 1934 to Mexican immigrant parents who  worked in the meatpacking plants of South Omaha.   During high school, Dr. Ramirez faced repeated discrimination and was  told by guidance counselors and peers that Latinos such as himself did  not belong in college. So after graduation, Jim joined his father at  the Nebraska Beef packing plant, where arduous work motivated him to  pursue higher education and a better life.   For 18 years, Ramirez worked the slaughterhouse in the day and took  classes at night; graduating in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in  sociology from the University of Nebraska Omaha. He went on to earn his  master's degree in guidance and counseling from UNO in 1974 and,  ultimately, a Ph.D. in adult continuing education in 1984.   Having witnessed discrimination throughout his years as a student,  Dr. Ramirez made it his life's mission to promote pathways to higher  education for Omaha's Hispanic community.   In 1972 Dr. Ramirez was selected to chair UNO's Committee on Mexican- American Affairs, upon whose recommendation the University hired more  Hispanic faculty, administrators, and staff.   After earning his doctorate, Dr. Ramirez was hired by UNO as a  professor and counselor, where he spent decades mentoring countless  Hispanic and minority students.   Dr. Ramirez went on to work as a human relations specialist at Omaha  Public Schools, where he recruited Hispanic teachers from across the  country to teach and mentor Omaha's Latino students.    Additionally, today I would like to recognize the Latino Center of  the Midlands for celebrating 50 years of serving Omaha's Hispanic  community.   The Latino Center is an education and social service nonprofit  located in South Omaha, the heart of Omaha's Latino community.   Founded officially in 1971 as the Chicano Awareness Center, their  work is rooted in advocacy for and service to Omaha's Latino community.  Their three major programs, Family and Community Well-Being, Pathways  to Success, and Workforce Education and Innovation impact over 2,500  individuals and families a year. Currently it is led by Albert Varas.   During Hispanic Heritage Month, no other two individuals and  organization are deserving for our recognition than Bob Campos, Dr. Jim  Ramirez, and the Latino Center. Together they demonstrate for all  Americans, especially Latino Americans, that through hard work,  perseverance, and faith, anything is possible.   I am pleased to announce that Bob Campos, Dr. Jim Ramirez, and the  Latino Center of the Midlands have been selected as the inaugural  inductees to the Nebraska Hispanic Hall of Fame, established this year  by the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with my  office, where their stories and many others will be shared for  centuries to come.   Thank you, Bob and Jim, and the Latino Center, for making a  difference in our great community.                            ____________________
