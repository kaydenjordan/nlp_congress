 Mr. Speaker, I think it is laughable for anybody in this  House to say that the government is going to raise your wages. The  government doesn't raise wages. What the government does is provide an  environment for businesses to raise wages, and that is where the  decision should be.   And it is laughable to me that Members of Congress actually believe  that they are going to raise the wages of people in this country by  this legislation. The Congressional Budget Office recently released a  report saying that almost 4 million jobs could be lost if this  legislation were implemented.   I remind my colleagues that we had an 8-year war on business, and,  guess what. In 2016, we said that war is over. America is open for  business.                                time  1000    With Georgia being the number one State to do business in for the  past 6 years, this damaging Federal mandate would reverse all of the  great work our State has done to grow jobs and the economy.   And I am telling you, we are getting it done in Georgia, but I don't  want Maryland to determine what Georgia is going to do and I don't want  Seattle to determine what Georgia is going to do.   As a businessman, I know that our economy is all about supply and  demand, and with more job openings, then job seekers' wages are going  to go up. You have to pay more to keep talent. It is supply and demand,  folks.   In fact, in 2018, wages and salaries saw the largest increase in more  than a decade, thanks to the economic environment led by a Republican- led Congress and President Trump that has spurred economic growth and  prosperity.   The last thing we need are more one-size-fits-all Washington mandates  that lead to job cuts, cut workers' hours for automation, and  ultimately shut the doors of our Nation's small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.
