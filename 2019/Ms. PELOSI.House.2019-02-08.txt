 I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his beautiful  statement of our beloved Mr. Dingell, Mr. Chairman.   Mr. Chair, again, as he mentioned last night, our Nation lost a  beloved pillar of this Congress and one of the greatest legislators in  American history.   Every chapter of Chairman John Dingell's life was lived in service to  our country, from his time as a House page, as a teenager, to his  service in the Army during World War II, to his almost six decades  serving the people of Michigan in the U.S. Congress.   John Dingell leaves a towering legacy of unshakeable strength,  boundless energy, and transformative leadership. Chairman Dingell had a  hand in crafting many major legislative accomplishments over the past  half century,  [[Page H1478]]  yet among the vast array of historic legislative achievements, few hold  greater meaning than his tireless commitment to the health of the  American people.   During every Congress since 1955, Chairman Dingell introduced  legislation to secure affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans.   Because of his father's legacy, which our distinguished leader has  referenced, and his own leadership, in 1965, he gaveled Medicare into  law. In 2010, it was my privilege to hold that same gavel as we passed  the Affordable Care Act.   Chairman Dingell was our distinguished dean and chairman, our  legendary colleague, and a beloved friend. His memory will stand as an  inspiration to all who worked with him or for him or had the pleasure  of knowing him.   His leadership will endure in the lives of the millions of American  families he touched. We hope it is a comfort to Chairman Dingell's  beloved wife, dear Deborah, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and their  entire family that so many people mourn their loss and pray for them at  this sad time.   I am pleased to mention that the flag is flying half-staff over the  Capitol in his memory and invite Members to sign the condolence book in  the Speaker's lobby.
