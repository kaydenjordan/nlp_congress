 Mr. President, as I come to the floor today, we have  just seen incredible record-setting job numbers. It is wonderful news  for American workers, for families all across the country. It is a  stellar June jobs report.   The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs, shattering all expectations.  It is the largest monthly jobs gain in our Nation's history.   So if you flip through the channels this morning, Mr. President--and  I did see you on one of the morning shows, doing a wonderful job, as  you always do, talking about your home State, talking about our  Nation--but these were some of the comments today about the jobs  numbers:   CNBC's Jim Cramer said: ``There's an optimism in the country . . .  people are hiring.''   Ed Lawrence at FOX Business said: ``This is amazing. A good report  anywhere you look at it.''   Becky Quick, CNBC, said it was a ``trend from across the board of  pretty strong numbers.''   Stephanie Ruhle of NBC said it was a ``big positive.''   Charles Payne, FOX Business, said: ``Even though the economists keep  saying it's impossible,'' the numbers are terrific.   Steve Liesman, CNBC, said: ``Bringing a lot of folks back.''   Christine Romans of CNN: ``Big hiring.''   Rick Santelli of CNBC: ``Really solid numbers.''   So good news. Americans are getting back to work, and we need to make  sure that we reopen responsibly, smartly, safely--the sorts of things  you were talking about--knowing what to do, how to do it, how to do it  right because the health and safety, as you mentioned, of our families  is important, and it includes economic health as well, and we have that  report today with a stellar jobs report    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Brooke  Hornberger, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  day.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Macy  Tipton, an intern in Senator Paul's office, be granted privileges for  the day.
