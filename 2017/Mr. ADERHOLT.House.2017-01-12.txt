 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I present to you an amendment, as the chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee for Agriculture, that provides funding  oversight for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, known as the  CFTC.   This amendment that is before us this afternoon is a simple, yet a  very necessary solution to issues identified at the CFTC regarding its  leasing practices by its own inspector general and the Government  Accountability Office.   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would allow the CFTC to manage its  leases through a third party, such as the General Services  Administration.   Up until now, the CFTC has demonstrated they have not responsibly  managed their own leases, and such missteps have created a number of  problems for the agency itself. These include poor management and  oversight of the agency's leasing practices, resulting in millions of  dollars in excess space and leasing costs.   The GAO legal division has identified instances of the CFTC violating  the appropriations law with regard to its leasing payments and  contracts.   GAO is further reviewing four additional legal issues that are  related to the CFTC's leasing contracts, and we expect the issuance of  opinions in the near future that will justify the need for this very  amendment that we are talking about this afternoon.   Let me add that at the CFTC, they are experts at their oversight of  the commodity and the futures and the swap markets. However, the CFTC  is not expert in leasing practices, and they should be relieved from  the burden of doing this as we move forward.   I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment at the desk.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment has been vetted by the  House Legislative Counsel and the staff at the CFTC.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my  time.    The amendment has been vetted by the House Legislative  Counsel and the staff at the CFTC. I understand and I can appreciate  any concerns that the ranking member would have.   Let me say, as we move forward, we will take any of this into account  as we move forward on this process, any technical changes that are  necessary before this bill becomes law, and we will be happy to work  with the ranking member as we move forward with this amendment.                                time  1330     I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.    Reclaiming my time, I would just add that, for this  amendment, we will work with any concerns that they may have and try to  fix anything that may be, but this is something that needs to be  addressed, as there are real problems at the CFTC regarding the leasing  issue.   I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
