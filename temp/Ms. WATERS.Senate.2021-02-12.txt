 I do not wish to debate. I wish to ask, Is       there one United States Senator who will join me in this       letter of objection?        Vice President BIDEN. There is no debate. There is no       debate.         Just one.        Vice President BIDEN. The gentlewoman will suspend.    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. In 2000, the dispute over the outcome was  taken all the way to the Supreme Court, which ultimately rendered a  decision.   To litigate questions of an election integrity within this system is  not incitement to insurrection. It is the democratic system working as  the Founders and lawmakers have designed. To claim that the President,  in any way, wished, desired, or encouraged lawless or violent behavior  is a preposterous and monstrous lie.   In fact, the first two messages the President sent via Twitter, once  the incursion of the Capitol began, were:         Stay peaceful and no violence because we are the party of       law and order.    The gathering on January 6 was supposed to be a peaceful event. Make  no mistake about that. And the overwhelming majority of those in  attendance remained peaceful.   As everyone knows, the President had spoken at hundreds of large  rallies across the country over the past 5 years. There had never been  any mob-like or riotous behaviors, and, in fact, a significant portion  of each event was devoted to celebrating the rule of law, protecting  our Constitution, and honoring the men and women of law enforcement.   Contrast the President's repeated combinations of violence with the  rhetoric from his opponents.   (Text of Video presentation.)         President TRUMP. I am your President of law and order and       an ally of all peaceful protesters.        Vice President BIDEN. The vast majority of the protests       have been peaceful.        President TRUMP. Republicans stand for law and order, and       we stand for justice.         And you push back on them, and you tell them       they are not welcome anymore anywhere.        President TRUMP. We will never defund our police. Together,       we will ensure that America is a nation of law and order.        Vice President BIDEN. If we were in high school, I'd take       him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.         I don't respect this President, and I will       fight every day until he is impeached.         I continue to say: Impeach him. Impeach 45.        (People chanting: ``Impeach 45.'')        Impeach 45.         I will go and take Trump out tonight.         You push back on them, and you tell them       they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.        Madonna. I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the       White House.         You push back on them, and you tell them       they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.         The objection is in writing, and I don't care       that it is not signed by a Member of the Senate.
