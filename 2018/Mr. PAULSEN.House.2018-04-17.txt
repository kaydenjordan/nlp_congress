 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5437) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to establish  a program for the issuance of identity protection personal  identification numbers, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5437         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. IDENTITY PROTECTION PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION                     NUMBERS.         Not later than 5 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's       delegate (hereafter referred to in this section as the       ``Secretary'') shall establish a program to issue, upon the       request of any individual, a number which may be used in       connection with such individual's social security number (or       other identifying information with respect to such individual       as determined by the Secretary) to assist the Secretary in       verifying such individual's identity.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5437, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5437, legislation that I am  coauthoring with my colleague, Congresswoman DelBene from Washington  State, that will tackle identity theft.   Each year the IRS processes over 240 million tax returns and issues  more than $400 billion in refunds. This makes tax season a prime target  for identity thieves who steal billions of dollars from hardworking  taxpayers by filing false returns. It is all too common.   More than 1.8 million people, including more than 13,000 Minnesotans  were victims of tax identify theft in 2015, and in just the first 2  months of 2016, the filing season, the IRS identified more than 31,000  fraudulent returns with thousands more surely slipping through the  cracks.   A Government Accountability Office report last year found that  scammers attempted to claim $14.5 billion in fraudulent tax returns in  the 2015 tax season alone. For a criminal, the scam is simple and  straightforward. You steal a taxpayer's Social Security number; you  file a fraudulent return in their name; and then you collect the  refund.   While this is a tremendous theft of taxpayer dollars, it is also a  nightmare for victims who then have to work to clear their name with  multiple government agencies and wait longer to receive their own tax  refund.   Our seniors, in particular, are very vulnerable to identity theft, as  they then have to struggle to navigate a bureaucratic maze to clear  their name and then file an authentic return. There is one tool  available though to some taxpayers that makes this scam a lot harder to  pull this off. It is called an identity protection PIN, or an IP PIN.  It is a 6-digit number that is issued by the IRS to help the IRS then  authenticate a tax return and validate the identity of the person who  is filing it.                                time  1415    Today, IP PINs are available only in a couple of States and the  District of Columbia, as well as to certain taxpayers who might be at  high risk of identity theft.   This legislation today which we are taking up would expand this  program by giving all taxpayers access and the option of signing up for  an IP PIN over the course of the next 5 years as they phase this in.  This will give all taxpayers peace of mind by allowing them to  proactively protect their own identity from tax scammers, and it will  save taxpayer dollars by preventing fraud that puts refunds into the  wrong hands.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join us in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as a reminder, next year, taxpayers will enjoy a very  simplified and streamlined tax filing process that allows all  hardworking Americans to keep more of their own hard-earned dollars.  However, there is still a lot that needs to be done to help protect  taxpayers by cracking down on identity theft, which is becoming more  and more prevalent. This is a very commonsense, straightforward bill  that will help tackle identity theft.   I want to thank not only Chairman Brady for his leadership on some of  the IRS reform efforts, but also my colleague Congresswoman DelBene for  partnering up on this issue as well.   It is very common sense; it is bipartisan. By giving taxpayers who  are at risk of identity theft the opportunity to request that PIN  number, it will allow them to make sure that their tax return is safe,  secure, and authentic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
