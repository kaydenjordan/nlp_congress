 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the significance of investing in education. Education is widely seen as  a key determinant of social mobility within a person's lifetime.   As the father of two school-age children, Justin and Kyler, my job is  to love them, share with them about the importance of faith, provide  for them, and ensure they receive a quality education. That is why  education is so personal to me.   Mr. Speaker, there are 246 schools in the First Congressional  District of North Carolina. Of those, 48 percent, nearly half, are  fully funded by title I; and schools within 13 of the 19 counties I  represent, 100 percent rely upon title I funding.   Mr. Speaker, we must invest in our public education system to set our  kids up for a lifetime of success, while laying the groundwork for  generations of prosperity across eastern North Carolina and America.   As part of my Live the Dream Down East tour, I will continue visiting  schools in every county of my district.                            ____________________
