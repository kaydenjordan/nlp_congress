 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 199,  legislation that rights a historic wrong made against a Tribe in my  district, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.   Right after I took office, Chairman Jackson and other leaders from  the Leech Lake Band approached me with a longstanding issue. In the  1950s, the Secretary of Agriculture claimed land owned by Leech Lake  under a dubious administrative transfer, ignoring pleas from the Tribe  and upending the Tribal tradition of land ownership.   Landholdings such as these are the foundation of Tribal sovereignty.  Therefore, this wrong had to be righted with an act of Congress that  transfers the roughly 11,000 acres back from the Agriculture Department  to the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.   From the first conversation I had with the band, I supported this  land exchange. This acreage was taken from Leech Lake and needed to be  returned. Unfortunately, the legislation itself was flawed. It lacked  any language allowing rural utilities access to longstanding rights of  ways and easements to ensure maintenance for power and other services  can be performed. It is crucial this transfer is done the right way,  meaning electric cooperatives delivering power have the access they  need for maintenance.   Therefore, I worked with the band and the rural electric cooperatives  to achieve a win-win solution. Through a years-long negotiation, I am  happy to see a signed memorandum of understanding between Leech Lake  and the cooperatives delivering service in the area, which include  Beltrami Electric, Lake Country Power, and Crow Wing Power.   After receiving and reviewing the memorandum to accompany the bill, I  supported its passage through the  [[Page H6098]]  House Natural Resources Committee. With it now on the House floor, I  look forward to its passage and the President signing the Leech Lake  Band of Ojibwe Reservation Restoration Act into law.
