 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate my friend, Ken Leonard, head coach of the Sacred Heart- Griffin Cyclones, for being nominated by the Chicago Bears for the 2018  Don Shula NFL High School Coach of the Year Award. This year, he  follows his son, Derek, who was nominated last year.   Coach Leonard was nominated for this prestigious award because of his  leadership, dedication to the community, and his commitment to the  health and safety of his players and their on-field success. This past  year, Coach Leonard became the all-time leader for victories in  Illinois high school coaching history--ironically, beating his son's  very good Rochester team to get that record.   As the head coach since 1984, Coach Leonard has an outstanding 379  win and 74 career loss record, including five State championships in  eight title game appearances. He has spent countless hours on the  field, in classrooms, and in chapels teaching players about character  and helping prepare them for a very successful future.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ken for his service to the Springfield  community over the years and congratulate him, his family, and his team  on this great honor.                            ____________________
