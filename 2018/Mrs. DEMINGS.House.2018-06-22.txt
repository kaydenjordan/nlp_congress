 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Ron  Plummer, Manager of Orange County, Florida, Office of Emergency  Management, who passed away last week.   Ron was a dedicated public servant, husband, and father. Ron served  in the Army and the Marine Corps for 27 years.   Since 2002, he has helped our community through countless storms and  disasters. As every Floridian knows, getting through hurricanes and  other emergencies requires calm leadership and deep compassion.   Ron lifted the spirit of storm-stricken neighbors, brought kindness  to those with special needs, and made hope a tangible presence.   Ron united peers and partners to keep us safe, and shared his vast  expertise throughout the State and the Nation.   Ron Plummer will be greatly missed by all who knew him, and we owe  him a debt of gratitude for a life well lived.                            ____________________
