 Mr. President, we have been in session now for about 11  hours, and we have taken up a handful of noncontroversial nominees.   The reason?   The abuse by the Republicans of the rules of the Senate--filibuster  after filibuster that require cloture votes--so we spend several hours  on each of these nominations.   Even worse, the Republicans have abused the rules of the Senate to  deny us in the Senate the ability to consider critical legislation that  we should be taking up and acting on. There are many, many examples. I  will just cite a few.   Justice in Policing: We are all committed to reforming our criminal  justice system and our police system in order to deal with the values  of our Nation. I know that Senator Booker has worked tirelessly on this  issue. We should be able to debate that bill on the floor of the U.S.  Senate, but, no, the Republicans will require a cloture vote and will  not give us the votes even to consider that legislation.   Or consider gun safety, which we have been debating in the public now  for decades, and the Republicans are continuing to use the rules of the  Senate to deny the Senate the opportunity to take up issues and debate  issues and see whether we can come together.   Or take immigration reform, where we see the tragedies that are  occurring where we need to take action as a Senate, but, no, the  Republicans won't give us the votes so we can get on a bill and debate  issues and take up amendments and see whether we can't get something  done on immigration.   And now they are threatening to use the filibuster on the legislation  that would extend the debt ceiling so that we don't default on our debt  in regard to moneys that have been spent with the initiation and  support of our Republican colleagues. They are threatening to deny us  the opportunity to take up that bill and vote on it by the use of the  filibuster, even though they were the ones who created the spending and  debt.   Or take the continuation of our government.   But top on my list is safeguarding our election system, the bedrock  of our democracy. On two occasions, Senate Democrats voted unanimously  to simply begin debate on protecting the right to vote in our  democracy, which has come under sustained assault in the aftermath of  the 2020 elections. Both times, all Senate Republicans blocked even  beginning the debate on this critical legislation. Senate Republicans  put gridlock and partisanship before the rights of voters.   The Senate is being blocked from having the chance to consider  options and amendments and do what the Founding Fathers intended us to  do--legislate.   So my Senate Republican colleagues will have another chance to do the  right thing, thanks to Leader Schumer and Senator Klobuchar. Over the  August recess, they worked diligently to come up with compromise  legislation that still preserves the essential elements of S. 1, the  For the People Act, that has already passed the House of  Representatives.   President Biden was absolutely correct that we need to enact voting  rights legislation to repair the damage done by the Supreme Court to  the Voting Rights Act. President Biden rightly called efforts to limit  ballot access across the country as the 21st century Jim Crow assault.  He warned Americans that the Republicans' efforts to restrict voting  rights as a result of their selfish challenge of the 2020 election  results were the most significant tests of our democracy since the  Civil War.   Indeed, my colleagues witnessed firsthand the violent insurrection at  [[Page S6658]]  the Capitol when the mob attacked, injured, and killed our brave  Capitol Police officers, who put their lives on the line to preserve  our very democracy and Union.   In many States, legislatures and Governors have responded to the  falsehoods of the 2020 elections by restricting voting accessibility.  The Big Lie, repeated by President Trump, has directly led to the  disenfranchisement and suppression of the right to vote for millions of  Americans.   I urge my colleagues and my fellow American citizens to reflect on  the state of our democracy and the rights we hold dear. A blatant  attempt to falsify an election and a persistent effort to deny the  American people access to the ballot box has undermined the freedom and  liberty that so many Americans have fought to defend and advance.   Voting rights is a fundamental issue of importance to a democratic  country. After elections are over and we win, we celebrate. We  celebrate the fact that we have gotten the support of the majority of  voters, and that is what democracy is all about. If we don't win--and I  think many of us have been involved in campaigns where our candidates  were not successful--we go to work to try to attract more voters in the  next election so we can celebrate a victory.   That is what participation in a free society is all about. That is  what democracies are about. In repressive, autocratic regimes, they  never accept the will of the people, so they look at ways in which they  can undermine the voting record--what the voters want to do and the  voters' will.   In the 2020 elections, we should all celebrate the record number of  people who cast their ballot. It was a record and the most ever  Americans casting their votes for the Presidency of the United States.   There were repeated reviews done by both Democrats and Republicans at  the Federal, State, and local level. It all verified the simple fact  that there was no widespread corruption or election fraud. The will of  the people prevailed, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were duly  elected.   Congress and Vice President Pence counted the electoral votes for  President and Vice President and did their duty under the Constitution  on January 6, notwithstanding the armed insurrection in the Capitol.   But that did not stop former President Trump from promoting the Big  Lie. As a result of that, several States have now taken action to make  it harder for people to cast their votes. The Brennan Center has  pointed out that we have seen the worst assault on voting rights since  Jim Crow.   So what have these laws done? Made it more difficult for voters to  vote by mail, recognizing that for many voters they prefer to vote by  mail. We have States that have had 100 percent voting by mail. There  have been no indications of fraud in voting by mail. States have  shortened the time for requesting mail-in ballots for voting, making it  more difficult for individuals to be able to vote by mail, requiring  certain requirements to vote by mail, making it more difficult to  deliver their mail ballots, limiting the availability of ballot drop  boxes.   Why did States take these actions? Because it makes it more difficult  for people who are likely to vote for their political opponents to  vote. That is what these State legislatures were doing. Stricter  signature requirements, making in-person voting more difficult, purging  voter rolls simply because a person did not vote, and, again, making it  more difficult for people to vote. That should have no place in a  democracy.   And it goes on and on in terms of the types of legislation that have  already passed or is currently being considered by many State  legislatures around our country. Making it more difficult to register  to vote, making it more difficult to vote, targeting potential voters  more likely to vote for their opponents, targeting minorities, young  voters, and older minority voters is a disturbing trend we see across  this country and has no place in our democracy.   The Freedom to Vote Act provides a basic Federal floor on protection  of the right to vote. This legislation includes commonsense items such  as automatic and online voter registration, uniform early voting, same- day voter registration, vote-by-mail and drop box standards and uniform  national standards for voter identification.   These are simple voter protection measures against the actions being  taken by State legislatures that are aimed at certain demographic  groups and set a Federal floor.   The Freedom to Vote Act ends political gerrymandering. I don't know  how many of my colleagues can defend the way that legislative and  congressional lines are drawn today. Congressional districts should  represent the communities' interests, not an individual Congressman's  interests.   The Freedom to Vote Act takes a major step forward in ending  political gerrymandering by creating nonpartisan redistricting reform  and banning partisan gerrymandering and allowing States to choose how  to develop redistricting plans, including having an independent  redistricting commission.   In terms of election integrity, the Freedom to Vote Act requires  voter-verified paper ballots, reliable audits, and voting system  upgrades. I think we all would agree that we want to be able to verify  votes. The only way we can is if there is a paper trail, and it  provides for that paper trail.   The measure takes steps to prevent State election subversion to  better insulate State and local officials who administer Federal  elections, after the attempts by both domestic and foreign interference  in the 2020 election results.   This legislation reduces the dominance of Big Money in the political  system. It does this in a couple ways. One, disclosure. How can anyone  be against the disclosure of who is putting money into our political  system? And, secondly, by providing a way in which we can weaken the  dependence on large special interest dollars.   The legislation requires super PACs, 501(c)(4) groups, and other  organizations spending money on elections to disclose donors and shuts  down the use of transfers between organizations to cloak the identity  of contributors.   It ensures that political ads sold online have the same transparency  and disclosure requirements as ads sold on TV, radio, and satellite.   S. 2747 includes two provisions I authored. First, it includes the  Democracy Restoration Act, which deals with laws passed after the end  of slavery in an effort to prevent African Americans from voting. There  are States that passed laws back then that are still on the books that  disqualify for a lifetime a person convicted of a felony. The  definition of a felony is pretty general in many States, so we have  States where one out of five African Americans have been disqualified  from voting because of their conviction of a felony, even though they  are fully part of our society today. They don't have the right to vote.  We need to remove that disqualification on voting.   I am pleased that my Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation  Prevention Act is included as a provision in the legislation. The  spreading of false or misleading information intended to suppress  voting and intimidate the electorate remains one of the most regularly  employed and effective methods used to keep individuals, particularly  Black Americans and other racial minorities, from voting.   Advancement in communications, including the rise of social media  platforms, have made it easier for bad actors to use these strategies.  For example, the targeting of Latino voters in Florida with  disinformation was widely documented. This provision prohibits  individuals from knowingly deceiving others about the time, place,  eligibility, or procedures of participating in a Federal election.   It criminalizes efforts to intentionally hinder, interfere with, or  prevent any person from voting, registering to vote, or aiding a person  to vote or register to vote.   My friend and former colleague was the late John Lewis of Georgia.  The two of us were elected to the House of Representatives on the same  day. In an editorial published after his death, Representative Lewis  called an important lesson taught--recalled an important lesson taught  by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And I quote our former colleague when he  said:         Each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up,       and speak out. When you see something that is not right, you       must say something. You must do something. Democracy is not a       state. It is an act. And each generation must do its part.   [[Page S6659]]     Well, we cannot take action if we don't start. And we cannot start  unless my colleagues allow us to proceed to this issue on the floor of  the U.S. Senate.   I urge my colleagues not to filibuster the right of the U.S. Senate  to start the debate on protecting voter integrity, where each Member  will have the opportunity to debate the issue and, collectively, we can  come together.   Many of my colleagues have offered suggestions about how we can  further improve S. 2747, how we can make it even a broader consensus.   Let's build on the work done by Senator Klobuchar and her colleagues  over the August recess. But we cannot do that unless we have the right  to proceed to a debate.   I urge my colleagues to support taking up the Freedom to Vote Act,  which is a critical issue to the preservation of our democracy and the  integrity of our right to vote.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators  Collins, Baldwin, Blumenthal, Brown, Casey, Hassan, Kaine, King,  Klobuchar, Markey, Menendez, Rosen, Smith, Van Hollen, and Warren to  recognize the week beginning September 12, 2021, as National Direct  Support Professionals Recognition Week. Direct support professionals  are an invaluable part of our Nation's healthcare system, caring for  the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors,  and those living with a disability. Direct support professionals  include, among others, those whose titles include home caregiver,  personal care assistant, home care worker, or home health aide. These  varying titles speaks to the broad areas of support that are integral  to the work of direct support professionals. With the assistance of  direct support professionals, these individuals can perform daily  activities that many people take for granted, such as eating, bathing,  dressing, and leaving the house. The work of direct support  professionals ensures that these individuals can be active participants  in their communities.   The work of direct support professionals, like all of us, has changed  due to the ongoing novel coronavirus--COVID-19--pandemic. In supporting  their clients in performing activities of daily living, direct support  professionals are essential and must continue to work in close  proximity to their clients during the pandemic. Recognizing the work of  direct support professionals is important, but all the more so as the  pandemic continues, given their dedication to supporting the health and  well-being of their clients.   Let me share with you the experience of Tommy Sharrow. Tommy is a  direct support professional who was recognized this year for his  dedicated and selfless work when he was given Maryland's Direct Support  Professional of the Year Award by the American Network of Community  Options and Resources, ANCOR.  [[Page S6667]]    I am sure there are countless examples I could share about Tommy's  work, but I will describe one extraordinary example where he went above  and beyond for his clients as he continued to care for them in the  midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. During a particularly challenging  period of the pandemic, Tommy's tireless dedication was on full display  as he quarantined with his clients in their home to continue caring for  them when others in their home were diagnosed with COVID-19. In order  to maintain the care he provided for them, Tommy incredibly slept on an  air mattress in their basement for 2 weeks to effectively quarantine.  As day programs and other care options closed around his clients due to  the pandemic, Tommy stepped in to provide creative activities like  music and playing games in outdoor spaces. Throughout a challenging  year for us all, Tommy was steadfast and truly considerate in his care  for his clients.   Tommy's story describes a career that is fulfilling, but one that  oftentimes is not easy for direct support professionals like him. The  hours are often long, and the wages are low. The job can be physically  laborious, as well as emotionally draining. The reward for direct  support professionals, however, is that they are able to improve the  lives of individuals with disabilities and help fulfill the promise of  the Americans with Disabilities Act by making it possible for these  Americans to participate in their communities to the fullest extent  possible.   In our country, we are incredibly fortunate to have millions of  service-oriented individuals who are willing to rise to the task of  becoming a direct support professional. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the employment of direct support professionals is  projected to grow by an average of 33 percent from 2020 to 2030,  compared to an 8-percent average growth rate for all occupations during  that period. The demand will only continue to increase over time; the  Baby Boomer generation will result in the doubling of the population of  adults ages 65 and older by 2050. The increased demand for direct  support professionals has created shortages in some areas, which can  place strains on patients and their families or result in medical  issues that could have been avoided.   Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave  the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult work  hours. Many direct support professionals rely on public benefits, and  some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and  their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to  ensure that these hard-working individuals have the income and  emotional support they need and deserve as we all struggle with the  health and economic implications of the ongoing pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Collins, Baldwin,  Blumenthal, Brown, Casey, Hassan, Kaine, King, Klobuchar, Markey,  Menendez, Rosen, Smith, Van Hollen, and Warren in expressing our  appreciation for the critically important work of our country's direct  support professionals, in thanking them for their commitment and  dedication, and in supporting the resolution designating the week  beginning September 12, 2021, as National Direct Support Professionals  Recognition Week.
