 Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues as  we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the date Congress sent to the  States this question: the ratification of a constitutional amendment  granting women the right to vote.   Our ancestors have long sought the promise of a better life for  themselves and their children. Many of our forebearers came to this  country seeking religious liberty, economic security, or personal  freedom.   Since 1788, they were drawn to the promise of these words: ``We the  People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,  establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common  defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of  Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''   Today, most in this body and across the country would agree that a  woman's full participation in the life of her community and Nation are  crucial if the promise laid out in our Constitution's preamble is ever  to be fully realized.   But in 1788 and for many years thereafter, women could not own  property, could not open a bank account on their own, or even control  the money that they earned through their own work. They could not  control their destiny or, indeed, their own bodies. Justice,  tranquility, the general welfare, and the blessings of liberty were,  for women, what men said they were.   That all began to change on June 4, 1919, the date when finally,  after so many years of struggle and failure, the required number of  Senators voted aye for House Joint Resolution 1, ``proposing an  amendment to the Constitution extending the right of suffrage to  women.'' It was very simple yet intensely powerful, a resolution with  just one article that read:         The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall       not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any       State on account of sex. Congress shall have the power to       enforce this article by appropriate legislation.    That remarkable moment, we know, did not come easily. For decades,  women across America sought the promise of our Nation for themselves  and their daughters. They were subjected to insults and ridicule and,  sometimes, even imprisonment and violence.   In 1906, an editorial in the New York Times defined the word  ``suffragette'' as a ``demanding screecher'' and ``a woman who ought to  have more sense.'' Walking in parades in support of the right to vote,  women had insults and worse hurled at them. Suffragists were physically  attacked.   Beginning in June of 1917, it got much worse. Here in Washington, DC,  police began arresting women who were picketing the White House in  support of suffrage for ``obstructing sidewalk traffic.'' Throughout  the summer and into the fall, women who refused to pay the fine were  sent to the Women's Workhouse in Lorton, VA, or the district jail,  where conditions were deplorable. Rats ran free in the prison. The food  was infested with maggots. Alice Paul, a leader of the National Woman's  Party, and about 71 other women began a hunger strike while in jail and  for months suffered force-feeding of raw eggs in milk through nasal  gastric tubes. In November, 33 of the imprisoned suffragists were  beaten by guards by order of the prison superintendent. One woman's  hands were handcuffed high above her head on the prison door for an  entire night. Some were left unconscious.   Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, Ida B. Wells, Mary  Church Terrell, Alice Paul, and others are widely known as suffragist  leaders. There were millions of others across the country doing what  they could in their own families, in their own communities and States,  to advance women's rights. They marched, protested, sewed flags and  banners, and spoke up at home and in their hometowns.   In the following 100 years since the Senate sent the women's right to  vote to the States for ratification, the right to vote gave women the  power to change their lives and to impact our Nation in so many  positive and profound ways. As a result, our Nation has made incredible  strides.   Today, in 2019, it may be difficult for some to imagine an America  without women leaders in every conceivable endeavor. Amazing women have  contributed to our Nation in countless ways, both large and small. We  have moved from the horse and buggy era to putting a man on the moon,  but man would not have gotten there and back without women  mathematicians and engineers.   While few colleges admitted women a century ago, by 1980 more women  than men earned bachelor's degrees. Since 1919, women are able to enter  any profession for which they are qualified, keep their own wages,  start and run corporations, lead scientific and medical advances, and  fly into space. Women have the right to be heard in  [[Page S3191]]  the Halls of Congress and in their children's schools. We are allowed  to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused and volunteer as poll  workers. We can inherit property, run the Iditarod, and become mayors  and Governors. And we can not only run for office, but we can vote for  ourselves.    Women can do anything we put our minds to, but if it had not been for  the right to vote--the basic, legal right to be recognized--would we be  where we are today? Would we have women like Sandra Day O'Connor,  Condoleezza Rice, Christiane Amanpour, or Sally Ride? Would we have the  benefit of the voices of countless American women who share their views  with Congress because they know that their opinions--backed up by their  votes--matter on issues as varied as childcare, climate change, and  national security? Would the young women of today have the faith that  they really can do anything they set their minds to? Maybe not.   I rise today to call on all Americans to commemorate this day, to  remember all those who made it possible, and to honor them by  recognizing that the right to vote, to be heard, and to be valued is a  precious right. It has not always been implemented fairly, and it must  be guarded and defended.   As we look to honor the past, we must also acknowledge that, like our  ancestors, we have more progress to make. Gaining the right to vote was  the first step toward full equality. Despite the passage of the Civil  Rights Act, which makes discrimination on the basis of sex illegal, and  despite the Equal Pay Act and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, our  Constitution gives us the right to vote but does not protect us from  discrimination.   So in the spirit of women who fought for the rights of women who  would come after them, I hope the Senate will pass S.J. Res. 6 to  remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  That will be something we will bring up at another point in time. But  today, I am able to stand with my friends and my colleagues here in the  Senate as we recognize and honor those who paved the way and have  allowed for this right to vote, that right and value to be heard.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anthony  Spanos and Edith Spear, interns from my office, be granted privileges  of the floor for the remainder of the year.
