 Madam Speaker, this week, liberals will  attempt to ram through the most egregious spending package since the  New Deal. By adding $3.5 trillion in new spending, their plan would not  lift families up; it would keep families down.   By imposing liberals' hidden tax by inflation, by pumping billions of  dollars into an economy that is already saturated from failed stimulus  packages, my colleagues' actions will directly harm working Americans.   Raising taxes on middle-class families and small businesses is not  the answer to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing businesses to  conform to new regulations won't get Americans back to work.   Now is the time to support our families. It is not the time to spend  more money than it cost to win World War II. We need to put a stop to  this reckless tax-and-spend spree, and we need  [[Page H5180]]  to get back to serving the American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, we are here tonight as  members of the House Energy Action Team to discuss the Biden  administration's assault on American energy.   His policies have hurt our constituents, and tonight, members of the  HEAT team will talk about how these actions continue to harm their  districts. The last 9 months have painted a portrait of what the Biden  administration's energy policies mean for our country.   Madam Speaker, it is not a pretty picture. As we speak, Biden's  allies in Congress intend to pass their $3.5 trillion budget  reconciliation package, only making this situation worse.   Let's take the natural gas tax, for example. It will increase  everyday Americans' bills by hundreds of dollars and destroy hundreds  of thousands of American family-sustaining jobs. This will rob  opportunity from the very communities that I represent in Pennsylvania  and hundreds of towns just like this. And we will hear more about that  this evening.   This tax is a solution in search of a problem, and it is creating  that problem. The United States has led the world in reducing  greenhouse emissions in the last two decades, and the energy industry  is voluntarily reducing methane emissions.   Innovation is the ultimate answer to cutting emissions, and we cannot  afford to stifle advancement. As a Nation, we cannot tax our way to a  cleaner environment. And Americans are fed up with taxes. The biggest  tax that our citizens are now facing is inflation. Across the board,  prices are rising.   The energy sector is particularly worrisome with gas prices climbing  63 percent in my home State of Pennsylvania. This cost falls  disproportionately on low-income Americans. It is not fair for them to  foot the bill for the policy preferences of liberal coastal elites.   Let's take another example of the Biden administration's war on  American industry. In their attempts to enact provisions of the Green  New Deal, they have smothered American innovation. For years, our  Nation has been at the cutting edge in nearly every sector of the  economy. From cyberspace to advances in manufacturing, America has  always stayed one step ahead of its competition. But that is starting  to change.   American researchers and developers have always been able to count on  the access to the resources needed to manufacture new pioneering  products. But a rising China threatens that access.   Of the 35 essential minerals listed for the U.S. economic and  national security, China is the top producer or top supplier of 23 of  them. China controls the production of 80 percent of rare earth  elements, 70 percent of graphite, almost 60 percent of lithium, and  almost 60 percent of vanadium, and 36 percent of cobalt.   Products like batteries and semiconductors that are needed in the  liberals' remaking of America require large amounts of these rare earth  elements.   The good news is we have them, right here within our borders. The bad  news is that under the Biden administration's burdensome regulations,  companies are unable to mine these very elements that are under the  ground that we stand on. We need to unshackle the American worker and  allow businesses to extract these minerals so that we can make the  products of the future right here at home instead of relying on foreign  rivals.   As the last 9 months have clearly shown, these policies are not the  right way forward. Congress must continue to embrace the bottom-up  innovation that will result in leaps in efficiency far greater than any  mandate--instead of expensive taxes that will take money out of working  Americans' pockets.   We have a great group of colleagues here tonight from the House  Energy Action Team to talk about how their communities are being  affected by this administration.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Balderson).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Balderson.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his candor.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Tennessee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia, especially for raising the important point of the all-of-the- above approach to energy. But above all, we need to maintain the great  jobs that comes from the fuels that are under our feet.  [[Page H5456]]    Madam Speaker, I would yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from  the State of Washington and chairman of the Congressional Western  Caucus for his insights and for taking the time this evening to present  those.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Georgia (Mr. Allen), who is my friend and who is, more importantly,  going to discuss the impacts in his State of Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I would like to point out  how essential coal, oil, and natural gas pipelines are to my district  in Pennsylvania. These are valuable resources that enhance our ability  to provide low-cost energy to the American people. Yet President  Biden's decision to cancel the Keystone XL project while allowing  Russia to continue to export more and more natural gas puts our  national security at risk.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his words specifically addressing the dismantling of  energy independence.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Madam Speaker, I think the gentleman from  Arkansas has made incredible points we all should be listening to. He  highlighted the important role that coal continues to play in supplying  power to our electric grid. In Congress we need to remain committed to  addressing the needs of the American people and ensure that they have  safe, reliable, and affordable energy.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Kansas for his comments.   The energy needs and the resources available throughout our country  are very significant, and as we move forward it is essential that  government bureaucrats are not choosing the winners and the losers. The  best energy producers should rise to the top.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Commonwealth of  Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Madam Speaker, could you please clarify  how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the whip of the minority team.    Madam Speaker, I thank the whip for his  concise discussion about the assault on American energy and how that  affects the working class communities throughout the United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from North Carolina (Mr.  Cawthorn).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for his concise and inspiring words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for his remarks.   I want to thank all of the members of the House Energy Action Team  for their work tonight and their commitment to the American people.   We have heard examples of how President Biden's disastrous policies  are harmful to energy producers and to the consumers. We have seen  examples of how these policies create overburdensome regulations that  harm small businesses and stifle innovation.   I am proud to be working with my HEAT colleagues to push back against  these disastrous policies.   Right now, the United States must embrace an all-of-the-above energy  solution that will combine the needs of the consumers with the  strengths of our producers.   What does that mean? It means embracing baseload power creators,  including coal and natural gas produced from Marcellus Shale. These are  critical components of Pennsylvania's energy industry.   On the first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order  that suspended work on the needed Keystone XL pipeline.   In Pennsylvania, the natural gas and oil industry supports over  300,000 jobs, provides over $20 billion in wages, and contributes  nearly $44.5 billion to our economy.   Between 2018 and 2019 alone, natural gas brought in over $450 million  in revenue in our Commonwealth.   We have learned a lot tonight. We have learned the strong energy  sector cannot and should not be negotiable. We recognize that energy  security is clearly national security.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for allowing my colleagues and me to  present this important information tonight to the United States  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.
