 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from south Florida  for, as was mentioned earlier, having the courage to stand up for our  State and protect it from the scourge of drilling.   I have to tell you, just last November, Mr. Chair, 69 percent of  Florida voters supported banning drilling in the State waters off of  Florida's coast.   It is no secret that our Florida beaches and our oceans drive our  economy. Drilling could affect not only our beautiful beaches and  thriving tourism but, also, our national security.   I have met with Department of Defense officials multiple times, and  they have continued to share serious concerns about how offshore  drilling activities could impact their operations.   The eastern Gulf is a vital training ground for our military, and on  Florida's Atlantic Coast that I share with my colleague, we are home to  Mayport, NAS Jax, and Kings Bay, just to name a few.   Mr. Chair, this important amendment will protect our coast, our  economies, and our national defense. For all these reasons, I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.
