 Mr. President, I rise to speak about a matter of  extraordinary importance to the future of American democracy and, in  fact, democracies all over the world. At the Helsinki summit on Monday,  President Trump embarrassed our country, undermined American values,  and openly sided with Russia's authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin,  against the U.S. intelligence community's unanimous assessment that  Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election.   Senator John McCain is right when he said: It was--         [It was] one of the most disgraceful performances by an       American president in memory. The damage inflicted by       President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and       sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is       clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.    That is not Bernie Sanders talking. That is former Republican  Presidential candidate Senator John McCain.   On Tuesday, after a strong international backlash, Trump, in a  bizarre statement, claimed he misspoke and, of course, blamed the media  for reporting what he said, even then he could not help but suggest  that the electoral interference ``could be other people also'' and not  just Russia.   In an interview last night, Trump changed his answer yet again and  acknowledged, in the meekest way possible, that, yes, Russia meddled in  our election, and, as the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin is  responsible.   This is a step forward, but it is not remotely sufficient. Who knows  what tweet the President will release tomorrow? He seems to come up  with a new response every few hours.  [[Page S5084]]    Today, we face an unprecedented situation of a President who, for  whatever reason, refuses to acknowledge the full scope of the threat to  American democracy. Either he really doesn't understand what is  happening--and that is possible--or he is under Russian influence  because of compromising information that they may have on him or  because he is ultimately more sympathetic to Russia's authoritarian  oligarchic form of government than he is to American democracy.   Whatever the reason, Congress must act now. Democrats must act and  Republicans must act if we are serious about preserving American  democracy. We must demand--and I know this is a radical idea--that the  President of the United States represent the interests of the American  people and not Russia.   Let us be as clear as we can be. Russia has been interfering not only  in U.S. elections but in the elections of other democracies--the United  Kingdom, France, Germany.   I yield to the Democratic leader.    I thank the Democratic leader for his strong efforts on  this enormously important issue. I want to reiterate that this really  is not a Democratic resolution. If there is any resolution that should  be bipartisan, this is it. My Republican colleagues believe in  democracy. I know that. We believe in democracy. Together, we and the  American people must make it clear that we will not allow Russia or any  other country on Earth to undermine our democracy.    Let's be very clear that Russia has not just been interfering in U.S.  elections but in elections of other democracies around the world--the  United Kingdom, France, and Germany, to name just a few countries.   Russia's goal is to advance its own interests by weakening the  transatlantic alliance of democracies that arose after World War II,  while also inflaming internal divisions in our country and in other  countries. We should also be clear that this interference is directed  from the very highest levels of the Russian Government. Last week,  Special Counsel Mueller announced a set of indictments of 12 members of  Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU. There can be no doubt  that given the nature of the Russian Government, Vladimir Putin was  directly involved in this effort.   But our concern is not only what has already happened; more  importantly, it is what could happen in the future. What happened in  2016 was an outrage, but we have to make sure it does not happen in  2018 and future elections.   Last week, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, a former  Republican U.S. Senator, raised the alarm on growing cyber attacks and  threats against the United States in a range of areas--a range of  areas, not just elections--including Federal, State, and local  government agencies, the military, business, and academia, saying that  the situation is at a ``critical point.'' Coats said Russia is ``the  most aggressive foreign actor, no question, and they continue their  efforts to undermine our democracy.'' Coats compared the warning signs  to those the United States faced ahead of the September 11 terrorist  attacks. This is a clear and present threat to our democratic system  and those of our allies.   Ultimately, of course we want a peaceful relationship with Russia. We  do not want a return to the Cold War, and we surely do not seek any  type of military conflict. But at the same time, we must be very clear  that we oppose what Putin is doing, both in terms of his foreign policy  and his domestic policy.   On foreign policy, we will not accept Russia interfering in the  elections of democratic countries, stoking political tensions by  promoting hatred and suspicion of immigrants and minorities, and trying  to undermine longstanding alliances between democratic allies.   In 2014, in violation of international law, Russia invaded  neighboring Ukraine and annexed the Crimea region.   Russia has assassinated political opponents abroad, most recently  through the use of poison in Salisbury, England. The British Government  concluded in that attack that it was most likely carried out by  Russia's military intelligence service.   Domestically, Putin has undermined democracy in Russia, crushing free  speech, jailing political opponents, harassing and assassinating  journalists who criticize him, and increasing persecution of ethnic and  religious minorities.   On Monday in Helsinki, President Trump had an opportunity to speak  out on all of these things and more, to confront Putin about these  destabilizing and inhumane policies. He chose not to.   Well, here is the main point: If for whatever reason the President of  the United States is not going to do what is right, Congress must do  it. Democrats must do it. Republicans must do it.   The Congress must make it clear--and this is the resolution I am  introducing and asking for unanimous consent--the Congress must make it  clear that we accept the assessment of our intelligence community with  regard to Russian election interfering in our country and in other  democracies. Does anybody doubt the truth of that?   The Congress must move aggressively to protect our election system  from interference by Russia or any foreign power. Does anybody deny the  importance of that?   The Congress must demand that the sanctions against Russia, as the  Democratic leader mentioned, which passed with 98 votes, be fully  implemented--98 votes on that issue.   The Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any  interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller,  such as the offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and that the President must cooperate  with this investigation. Time and again, I have heard Republicans,  including leaders, make it clear that there should not be an  interference in that investigation. There is nothing new here on that  point.   Finally--nothing new here, either--the Congress must make it clear to  President Trump that his job is to protect the values that millions of  Americans struggled, fought, and died to defend: justice, democracy,  and equality; that he is the President of the United States and his job  is to protect the interests of the American people, not Russia.   Tweets, comments, and press conferences--and I know many of my  Republican colleagues have been involved in those activities. They are  fine. They are constructive. But we need more from Republican Senators  now. It is time for the Senate to rein in the President's dangerous  behavior.   If their leadership--Senator McConnell--will not allow votes on this  extraordinarily important matter, then my Republican colleagues must  join with Democrats to make it happen, or all of their fine-sounding  words of concern will become meaningless.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 582    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, as in legislative  session, the  [[Page S5085]]  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 582, submitted  earlier today. I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky just told us  that he wants dialogue with Russia, he wants diplomacy with Russia, and  that he thinks it is important that we communicate with Russia. I  agree. Who disagrees with that? There is not one word in this  resolution that suggests that the United States of America should not  aggressively engage in diplomacy with Russia to ease the tensions that  exist between the two countries. What the Senator said is totally  irrelevant to what is in this resolution.   What this resolution says is that we are going to tell Russia: Stop  interfering in our elections.   What this resolution is about is telling Russia to stop interfering  with the elections in democratic countries all over the world.   What this resolution is about is saying that we should implement the  sanctions overwhelmingly voted for by Congress.   What this resolution is about is that we will not accept interference  with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.   What this resolution says is that the President must cooperate with  the investigation of Mr. Mueller.   That is what this resolution is about. It has nothing to do with  ending diplomacy with Russia at all. That is inaccurate.   I would hope that, if not today, in the very near future, Republicans  will join Democrats and do the right thing in our effort to preserve  American democracy.
