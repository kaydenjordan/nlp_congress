 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the world  celebrated Autism Awareness Day.   Each year, Autism Speaks asks people across the Nation and around the  globe to ``Light It Up Blue'' in an effort to increase understanding  and acceptance.   Last night, right here in our Nation's Capital, the White House  joined hundreds of iconic landmarks as it illuminated the exterior  blue. Individuals wore blue clothing or turned their online profile  photos blue.   Autism spectrum disorders affect an estimated 1 out of every 68  children in the United States. These families face enormous challenges  in assisting their loved ones over the course of their lifetimes. Each  year, an estimated 50,000 youth will turn 18 in the United States, and  many face a services cliff when school-based programs end.   Men and women living on the autism spectrum have made incredible  contributions to our society. We must continue to research the causes  of autism and work to strengthen opportunities for individuals with  autism to live full lives.   Together, we can increase understanding and acceptance as we  celebrate and support so many Americans who live with autism.                            ____________________
