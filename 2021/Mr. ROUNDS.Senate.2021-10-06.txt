 Madam President, tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of  the day the United States entered Afghanistan--the beginning of  Operation Enduring Freedom.   On October 7, 2001, the U.S. military conducted its first strike on  the terrorists responsible for attacking our Nation on 9/11.   As President Bush said on that day: It was not a mission we asked for  but a mission that we would fulfill.   For the past two decades, brave men and women have answered the call  and put on the uniform of our country to fight terrorists in the name  of freedom. We were a beacon of hope in a region of chaos. Our presence  made a difference.   As I travel my home State of South Dakota, I have heard from many  people who were disturbed by the events that unfolded during our final  days in Afghanistan. I share their frustrations.   Together, we watched the Taliban forcefully regain control of an  entire country that we worked so hard to keep free from terrorist  groups. We watched the credibility of the United States on the world's  stage diminish as we carelessly left our friends and allies behind. We  watched civilians hopelessly cling to the wings of aircraft in  desperate hope of escape. And we watched 13 brave men and women in  uniform lose their lives while helping others seek freedom. As we mourn  the loss of their lives, we recognize and appreciate their service to  our Nation.   We also remember all those who fought by our side for 20 years, many  of whom remain trapped in Afghanistan.   A citizen of South Dakota, Brandy Roseland, a veteran from Belle  Fourche, worked as a contractor in Afghanistan. That is where she met  her interpreter. According to Brandy, her interpreter served with the  highest distinction and faced great personal risk, often putting  himself in harm's way to aid and protect Americans and his fellow  Afghans.   On one such occasion, Brandy's interpreter discovered an American  contractor who died in an accident outside of Kabul. The interpreter  singlehandedly returned the contractor's body, as well as sensitive  equipment and documents, to the U.S. Embassy. That took courage. Brandy  returned to the United States, but she stayed in contact with her  interpreter.   When Afghanistan began to fall to the Taliban, she knew that she  needed to do all she could to help him get out safely. That is when  Brandy called us and asked if we could help him escape the clutches of  the Taliban.   For weeks, our office worked relentlessly to maneuver his application  for a special immigrant visa throughout the bureaucratic process at the  State Department. Our work was ultimately successful from an  administrative standpoint, but the overall mission was a failure.   While we had done all we could to help the interpreter receive his  visa, our forces had exited before he could get on a plane to safety  because of the President's date certain which he set for withdrawal.    Today, this interpreter remains in hiding in Afghanistan. If he is  found by the Taliban, his fate will certainly be sealed.   We all know that there are no easy answers when it comes to  Afghanistan, but there was clearly a wrong one.   For months, we had warned of the perils of making an arbitrary  decision based on the calendar as opposed to an assessment of the  conditions on the ground. And we weren't alone.  [[Page S6938]]    As the only Republican member of both the Armed Services and Foreign  Relations Committees, I have had the opportunity these past few weeks  to hear from the senior military officers who advised President Biden:  General Milley, Secretary Austin, and General McKenzie. Their message  to the President was clear: a withdrawal on a date certain, without  conditions, would lead to the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban.   Despite receiving the best military advice in the world, President  Biden decided to use his own judgment, and he made the wrong decision.  His directive to withdraw on a date certain, without regard for the  conditions on the ground, needlessly put American soldiers in harm's  way and forced our military to undertake an assignment which they  simply could not totally complete.   Our military simply ran out of time. They could not get all of our  Americans out, and they could not get all of our Afghan allies out,  including Brandy's interpreter.   But it didn't have to end this way. Our military leaders offered the  President the correct path forward. Their Commander in Chief failed  them.   Lately, the President has blamed a lot of people for his failure.  This includes the Afghan security forces and his own generals, who he  falsely claimed advised him to make this decision. But this does not  fall on any of them.   President Biden owns this debacle, and history will not judge him  kindly. Because of his error, al-Qaida now has a breeding ground.  America is less safe. The world is less safe.   I will close with a message for our veterans. While I was Governor, I  attended 31 funerals in South Dakota for South Dakotans who died  fighting the War on Terror. We will not forget their sacrifice nor  their family's loss.   While freedom may not endure in Afghanistan today, for 20 years,  you--you veterans--you protected our Nation and kept the fight away  from our doorstep. Your service was not in vain. Your sacrifice made a  difference. You represent the best of our country, and your Nation is  grateful.   Please always remember it is not the politician who protects our  right to vote; it is not the journalist who protects our freedom of  speech; and it is not the preacher who protects our freedom of  religion. All of our freedoms are defended and protected, generation  after generation, by the men and women who put on the uniform of the  United States of America.   We are grateful to you for your sacrifice and your service. May God  continue to bless all of you veterans, and may the Good Lord continue  to bless these United States of America.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                      Nomination of Sarah A. L. Merriam
