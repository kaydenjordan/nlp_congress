 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Luetkemeyer might have had a good idea,  but what we have really seen is an arbitrary FSOC and a Republican- controlled Federal Reserve Board that operates without quorums. This  may be a good idea, but until we have a financial regulatory framework  where we can trust the people in charge, I think that we should not  support this bill.
