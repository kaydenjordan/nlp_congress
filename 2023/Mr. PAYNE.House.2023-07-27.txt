 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Biden for  helping me provide $7 billion for the Hudson River tunnel project. The  Hudson River tunnel project is the most important infrastructure  project in the country.   Every day, more than 200,000 people travel through the Hudson River  tunnel between New Jersey and New York. If it were to suffer a safety  shutdown, it could cost America $100 million in lost economic activity.   The current tunnel is 113 years old, and it needs to be upgraded to  avoid future shutdowns. The Hudson River tunnel project will repair the  current tunnel, and it would build a new tunnel next to it to improve  travel throughout the Northeast corridor.   I worked diligently to get the funds for the Hudson River tunnel and  the entire Gateway Program. The $7 billion grant is the largest Federal  transportation grant in American history.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work with a President that understands the  importance of the Hudson River tunnel project and what it will do for  American prosperity.                            ____________________
