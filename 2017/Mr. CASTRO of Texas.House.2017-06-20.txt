 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   I want to thank the bill's authors, Representative Schakowsky and  Representative Noem, for their years' worth of work on this measure. I  also want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for helping  move it forward.   Wherever there are conflicts around the world, women and girls face  particular vulnerabilities, but they also possess unique abilities to  bring peace and prosperity to their communities.   Research has shown that getting women involved in conflict resolution  and peace building leads to better outcomes. That is why the Obama  administration launched its executive order on Women, Peace, and  Security in 2011 to make sure women had a seat at the table when it  came to conflict prevention and resolution.   Thanks to the Obama administration's efforts, the United States has  worked to include women in conflict prevention, negotiation, and  resolution. We have promoted efforts to enhance the physical and  economic security of women around the world, and we have sought to  break through the barriers that have stopped women from being full  participants in peace processes.                                time  1800    The bill we are considering will make these policies permanent. It  would build on what the Obama administration has accomplished by making  sure agency personnel across our government are fully trained on the  unique strengths women bring to conflict prevention and resolution. It  would also require annual reporting so Congress can stay apprised of  these efforts.   Making this strategy permanent is absolutely imperative. It is  important that we fully recognize and appreciate how women's  participation can help make our foreign policy stronger.   I am pleased to support this measure, and I urge all my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 5  minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the coauthor  of this bill, a true advocate for women, and my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, seeing no other speakers on my  side, I am prepared to close as long as there are no other speakers on  the majority side.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, once again, Chairman Ed Royce, Ranking  Member Engel, and Representatives Schakowsky and Noem for their hard  work.   I again urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.
