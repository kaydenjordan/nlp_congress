 Mr. Speaker, this morning President Joseph Biden was  brilliant. He gathered together the members of the Democratic Caucus,  and he spoke to the American people about the brilliance of a seismic,  monumental effort to change the lives of generations of Americans.   We as Democrats stood united behind the framework of Build Back  Better, realizing that we will change the lives of kindergartners and  children across the land and change the world. With universal preschool  for 3- and 4-year-olds; affordable, high-quality childcare; affordable,  high-quality care for hundreds of thousands of those older Americans in  the latter part of their lives, allowing them to live at home in  dignity--expanded child tax cut, is what I would like to call it--we  stood unified.   For all the chattering about friends on the other side of the aisle,  name one good deed that they have done to change generations of  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with Joe Biden, the President of the  United States. When he leaves and goes to the G20, he will be able to  say that he has a united Caucus that believes in climate change, that  believes in humanity and the human infrastructure that Build Back  Better is.   We are on the move. We are on the road. We are going to pass both  bills. And we are going to change Americans' lives forever and ever and  ever. I am proud to be a Democrat and to stand in this monumental era  of our time.   Mr. Speaker, tell the American people we are on the move.                            ____________________
