 Mr President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  confirm Pamela Patenaude as Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development.   Ms. Patenaude was advanced by voice vote out of the Senate Banking  Committee on June 14, and continues to receive nearly unanimous  bipartisan support from affordable housing advocates, public housing  agencies, and industry leaders.   This month, Senate leadership received a joint letter signed by over  60 independent housing trade groups, urging that this nomination  finally be brought to the floor for a vote.   Over her distinguished career, Ms. Patenaude has touched nearly every  corner of housing policy and has held leadership roles at both the  local and Federal level.   This is not the first time Ms. Patenaude has been considered for  confirmation by this body. Twelve years ago, the Senate confirmed her  by voice vote to become Assistant Secretary of Community Planning and  Development at HUD.   The Senate recognized her back then for what she remains today: an  experienced industry veteran who will provide steadfast leadership to  HUD.   This vote is particularly important given the recent hurricanes in  Texas and in Florida. HUD's Deputy Secretary chairs the Department's  Disaster Management Group and coordinates the long-term recovery  efforts of various program offices within HUD.   Ms. Patenaude would make an immediate contribution in this critical  leadership role, drawing from her experience responding to Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita during her time as Assistant Secretary in the Bush  administration.   I am eager to work with Ms. Patenaude on that response, as well as  other key issues within HUD's jurisdiction.   I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Ms. Patenaude today, and I  also urge the Senate to take up votes on other HUD nominees, so that  HUD can have the key leadership in place that it needs to best serve  its important mission.   Thank you.
