 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on this matter of repealing the  Affordable Care Act, soon the Senate is going to vote on just whether  or not to repeal the Affordable Care Act. I think it is important to  note that this would walk back months and months of Republican promises  to directly link repealing the Affordable Care Act with a replacement-- a replacement that would improve coverage, lower premiums, and be  better for the American people. In fact, the President of the United  States said repeatedly over the last few months that these would be  inextricably linked, that repeal and replace would go hand-in-hand.  That is not what is on offer right now. What is on offer are specific  changes that would actually harm Americans.   For example, no more middle-class tax credits for healthcare--that is  something that is critically important to the millions of middle-class  folks who are walking on an economic tightrope every month, balancing  their food costs against their fuel costs, their fuel costs against  their medical costs.   I was struck this morning when I heard that, under this repeal  approach, there is not going to be any real pain, that everything is  just put off. Make no mistake about it. The pain for our families under  this repeal measure is going to start right away. Nobody says they are  going to be part of a marketplace if they believe it is not going to  exist in a few years. Seventeen million fewer Americans are going to  have healthcare 1 year from now. An analysis from the Congressional  Budget Office--and this is only a week old--said that half of the  country will have zero insurance choices in the private marketplace  under this scheme.   I would like to repeat that so people understand that, as to this  idea that there is really no pain here and that nothing starts for a  long time, the Congressional Budget Office--our nonpartisan, impartial  umpire--doesn't agree with that. They said just last week that half of  the country will have zero insurance choices in the private marketplace  under this scheme. That goes up to 75 percent of Americans with no  options in later years.   So my view is that this is just legislative malpractice, first  because of the pain and harm it is going to cause so many Americans.  The Congressional Budget Office says that kind of misery is going to  kick in quickly.   Second--and I don't think this has been discussed on the floor--this  walks back months and months of Republican promises. The American  people were told again and again that repeal and replace were going to  be directly linked. The President said it multiple times. Then he went  over the top and told people that they were going to have lower costs  and better coverage.    I am happy to yield to my friend.    I would say to my colleague, the ranking member of the  Budget Committee, that we are talking about one-sixth of the American  economy.    My colleague is being logical, and heaven forbid that  logic should be introduced into this, because we would automatically  assume that on a matter like this--we are talking about one-sixth of  the American economy--the Senate Finance Committee would have hearings.  There have been no hearings.    None.    I can tell my colleagues that Senator Murray and I, the  two of us--the ranking member on the Budget Committee and I--have  actually made public the overwhelming opposition from providers on  this. So, in effect, providers and patients are standing together in  opposition to this.    They are opposed, as I have indicated. I think it is  particularly important to see this provider-patient partnership that  this time is saying the patients come first and this bill hurts  patients.    That is correct.    What I can tell my colleagues is that, again, those  hospitals have not been in front of the Finance Committee.   One of the things I appreciate about so many colleagues on this side  of the aisle is that they said: Well, if we are not going to hear from  these providers, like the hospitals, in the committee, we are going to  go out to the country and listen to them. I have had townhall meetings  throughout rural Oregon, as my colleague Senator Merkley has had. The  rural hospitals, which are the economic engines of so many rural  communities, are opposed to this legislation.    The AARP has also not been in front of the Senate Finance  Committee. I want to say again that Senators have said: If they are not  going to be in front of the Senate Finance Committee, where we ought to  actually hear testimony in line with the regular order, we are going to  go out to the country and listen to AARP members and organizations.  They are overwhelmingly opposed to this because people between 55 and  64 would pay five times as much as younger people, and they would get  fewer tax credits.    It is hundreds and hundreds of dollars and, in a number of  instances, more. The reality is that I think they are going to have a  lot of trouble getting coverage at all. The reality is, when you pour  gasoline on the fires of uncertainty--and this is particularly  important right now as plans are thinking about signing up--that makes  it more likely you aren't going to have plans at all. The Congressional  Budget Office has also found that the Paul legislation makes that  worse.    While the senior groups have not been able to come before  the Finance Committee to discuss this issue, I can say--and I have been  working with a number of these organizations since my days with the  Gray Panthers--that they are overwhelmingly opposed to this. I think,  in particular, this idea that we heard from the Congressional Budget  Office last week--that half of the country will have zero insurance  choices in the private marketplace under this repeal scheme, and that  it goes up--will just cause even more seniors to be against it.    Under this legislation, you would have a massive rollback  of the Medicaid Program. So for all of those older people who scrimped  and saved all of their lives--they didn't take that vacation; they  tried to make sure they could educate their kids--Medicaid picks up the  costs of two out of three nursing home beds in America. This  legislation would produce a massive rollback of the Medicaid Program,  and I believe so many older people are going to find long-term care  unaffordable--millions.    That is correct.    That is correct. It would be accompanied with further  misery because it would leave the millions suffering from opioid  addiction with nowhere to turn for coverage as a result of this massive  rollback in Medicaid coverage under this amendment.    Yes, the fortunate few would benefit under the House bill.  There is no question about it.   To give my colleagues an idea of how regressive those efforts are,  they would actually be retroactive. So this idea that these tax cuts  for the well-to-do were in some way going to create jobs is just  absurd. They are made retroactive. So they aren't going to be creating  jobs going forward.  [[Page S4239]]         A few hundred families benefit so greatly that it could  actually cover Medicaid expansion in several States.    That is correct. The special interests get very, very  substantial tax breaks. Those working-class people lose tax credits, so  they actually lose, and, in effect, those dollars can be used for the  tax cuts for the fortunate.    There is nothing that would give Medicare bargaining power  to make sure seniors get a better deal. There is nothing for the kind  of effort our colleague from Vermont and Senator Klobuchar have  pursued, which would allow, under circumstances where there were safety  precautions, for pharmaceuticals to come from other countries. There is  nothing to go after pharmaceutical middlemen. So, yes, there is nothing  in these bills to hold down the cost of pharmaceuticals.    My colleague is right. There is a very regressive effort  going forward in the House, the House Budget Committee, and, clearly,  this is to try to set up tax cuts for the fortunate few.   I was struck by the fact that the President has talked about a 15- percent corporate rate. You lose $100 billion for every point you lower  the corporate rate. The corporate rate is now 35 percent. If you move  it to 15, that is $2 trillion that goes out the door.   Yes, I am very troubled that the House effort plus this legislation  is really an effort to begin the unraveling of America's social safety  net, and the funds that provide for those very vulnerable people would  be used for these additional tax breaks.    I think my colleague is making an important point, as well  as my friend from Vermont.   Part of the reason that many Republicans want these tax cuts for the  fortunate few is arcane to people, pretty complicated. What they really  want to do is get them now, to put them in the budget baseline in order  to open up the opportunity when tax reform comes along to have even  more tax breaks for the fortunate few. So, yes, Medicare and Medicaid  are going to face real challenges.   In fact, as my colleagues know, the Affordable Care Act had a modest  additional tax on people who earn over $250,000 a year, and it was to  go just to Medicare. You see your paycheck--everyone gets a paycheck-- and the Medicare tax is right on it. The only people under these  Republican plans who would get the Medicare tax cut would be couples  who make over $250,000 a year.   When my colleague from Vermont asks ``What does this mean for  Medicare?'' it isn't necessarily about some bill far off in the future.  It is about right now. By the way, taking that money away--the money  that comes just from the modest additional tax on couples over  $250,000--reduces Medicare solvency by several years. It actually  reduces Medicare solvency, which breaks yet another Trump promise not  to in any way injure Medicare.    Two points are raised by my colleague--very good points.  First, in the immediate, those people will go to the hospital emergency  room, which means that, once again, we are turning back the clock  toward approaches that don't provide better care at lower costs.   I wish to also mention, when we are listening to folks at home-- because they don't get to testify here in the Senate--people appreciate  the part of the Affordable Care Act that ensures their lifetime limits  on what they can be charged by insurers. Almost all of these Republican  bills create an arrangement where a State could waive that protection.  Not only would people who are facing cancer and serious illnesses and  probably have to go to the hospital emergency room a fair amount be  hurt now, but people who have employer-based coverage are going to be  hurt in the future. So 160 million people don't even know what is  coming out.  [[Page S4240]]         My colleague has described how the Senate works best when  she says: Look, bipartisanship is not about taking each other's lousy  ideas. Bipartisanship is about both sides getting together, having  hearings, listening to all alternatives and ideas, and often coming up  with something no one has thought of.   My colleague knows a lot about bipartisanship in healthcare because  my colleague was part of our effort in 2008 when we put together the  first bipartisan universal coverage bill in the history of the Senate-- seven Democrats, seven Republicans. By the way, a number of those  Republicans are still serving in the Senate today. We know that is a  better path.   To wrap up this portion of the debate, I wish to say to my colleagues  that the best way to proceed is with a kind of two-part effort. The  first is to say that we all agree the Affordable Care Act is not  perfect. We are going to take steps immediately to stabilize the  private insurance market.   We have a number of our colleagues--Senator Shaheen, with her effort  to make sure people can get some help when they have deductibles and  copayments; our colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine, with  reinsurance; Senator McCaskill with a fine idea to help areas that are  bare in terms of no coverage. We have to move to stabilize the private  market quickly because at the end of August, the plans are essentially  signing contracts for premiums for 2018.   My colleague is absolutely right. We ought to knock off this partisan  our-way-or-the-highway approach, move on a bipartisan basis to take  steps to improve the Affordable Care Act now after we have hearings,  input, and the opportunity to have people in front of the committees of  jurisdiction. After that, we then move to the broader array of issues,  starting with the immediate challenge my colleague has led on, which is  clamping down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. You take steps to  stabilize the market immediately, and then you move again in a  bipartisan way on what our constituents are talking about at every  community meeting, which is that their Social Security checks, the  benefits they get, aren't coming close to keeping up with the rise in  the cost of prescriptions.   I thank my colleague for her very helpful questions and our colleague  from Vermont, Senator Sanders.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague for an excellent  statement and for appealing to the better angels.   Mr. President, I am rising to speak about the Donnelly amendment,  which is very much needed because the President--and now Republicans-- are walking back a clear commitment.   The President said in the campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, he  wouldn't touch it, but even before the inauguration, the Trump team  eagerly signed on to a Republican plan to slash it by more than $700  billion. They stared into television cameras, looked American voters in  the eyes, and said that somehow these massive cuts to Medicaid wouldn't  in any way harm the seniors. Medicaid picks up 2 out of 3 dollars with  respect to seniors in nursing home beds and special needs kids and  disabled youngsters.   When we hear that Medicaid picks up the cost of two out of three  nursing home beds and compare that to the President's statement that he  wouldn't cut Medicaid--wouldn't cut it--when we are now faced with a  plan to cut it by more than $700 billion, one, that is walking back the  President's solemn pledge in the campaign, and, two, it is going to  make it harder for older people in this country to be able to afford  long-term care.   The majority has brought the TrumpCare debate and the extreme  Medicaid cuts that I just described directly to the floor of this  Senate without a single committee hearing to justify this ill-advised  policy.   Our colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, has put forward an  important amendment to stop this ideological crusade to unravel the  Medicaid safety net. Senator Donnelly's proposal would send this  partisan attack on Medicaid back to the Senate Finance Committee, where  it should have been raised and struck down in the first place.   Mr. President, I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance  Committee. My focus in public life has always been to try to find  common ground with people of common sense. And I wrote with  colleagues--many of whom still serve on the Republican side and on the  Democratic side--a universal coverage bill that pulled together both  sides of the political spectrum.   So unless you provide an opportunity to have a discussion about the  Medicaid safety net in the Senate Finance Committee, you are not going  to be able to have policies that get to common ground on this vital  issue. What you are going to have is what is really on offer now--an  anti-Medicaid crusade that is a grave threat to the health and well- being of tens of millions of Americans.   Over the last few months, I have heard Republican colleagues say that  Medicaid is a disincentive to work and that there are too many able- bodied adults enrolled. If you look at the facts, that is not what the  program is all about. Medicaid is a vital source of coverage for our  neighbors and friends who live in poverty. It tells those families that  healthcare is covered while they work to climb the economic ladder in  the private sector.   In addition to that, for the older people I have mentioned--these are  the folks who have done everything right in life. They went to school,  they found jobs, they worked hard in their careers, they raised  families, and they scrimped and saved all through their lives. Growing  old in America is pretty costly. So what happens is that millions of  seniors who have done everything right spend down their savings, and  that is when Medicaid steps in to help. It covers two out of three  seniors living in nursing homes. It is a major source of funding for  community-based care, and people generally don't know that. Now they  may have heard about nursing homes, but it also picks up the costs for  community-based care, where older people are more comfortable, and it  often costs less than institutional care.   Seniors who lose those benefits due to TrumpCare Medicaid cuts are  going to have to find somewhere else to live. A lot of families want to  be able to help elderly parents and grandparents. It is going to be  pretty hard because a lot of them are walking on an economic tightrope,  and if they go looking  [[Page S4248]]  for nursing home care, it is going to cost on average more than  $90,000.   So it is seniors, and it is disabled folks who count on Medicaid to  have a chance to be productive. With the Medicaid benefits under  threat, people with disabilities are going to find it hard to be able  to attain the productive role in our society that they so fervently  want to have. Our communities are so much better off when folks with  disabilities can contribute, and Medicaid makes that possible. It  covers services that many private insurers don't. It helps people make  it out of bed and provides safe transportation to jobs. It helps them  avoid unnecessary illnesses. It is not a disincentive for people with  disabilities to work; having the support of Medicaid is what makes it  possible for disabled folks to work.   Across the country, there are millions of kids with special needs who  rely on Medicaid every day for services--behavioral care services,  mental health services. Mom or dad might have good insurance through  work, but private plans don't always cover the care those vulnerable  kids need.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional  minute.    Mr. President, I have commented on the secret process that  went on in this discussion, but I will close with this: One version of  TrumpCare has already been voted down here in the last day. Nobody  knows where this debate will wind up, but what is important now is that  Senators support the Donnelly motion. The Donnelly motion is going to  ensure that the Finance Committee, where Senator Enzi serves so  admirably, and all of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, is  going to be able to look at this issue in a way that is going to bring  the Senate together, not divide it, as we would be without the Donnelly  motion.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, Team Wyden will shortly lose one of its  stalwarts, but before John Michels of my Portland office takes his  well-deserved retirement after two decades of service to the people of  Oregon, I want to take just a few minutes to recognize his many, many  contributions.   John joined my office in the late 1990s through a work-study program  run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He had previously worked in  construction, and he served as a jet engine mechanic in the U.S. Navy  before coming to my office, so suffice it to say that he was no  stranger to long hours and tough assignments.   As a member of Team Wyden, John put his shoulder to the wheel to help  other veterans when backlogs, bureaucracy, or red tape held up the care  or the recognition they had earned. In his years of service, John has  managed thousands of cases for Oregon constituents struggling with one  Federal agency or another.   John has also always been a practical soul and has a passion for  tinkering and fixing things. He brought these skills to bear as our  resident IT expert and computer whisperer in Oregon.   Anybody who has worked in the government can tell you it can be  tough. The pace can be grueling, the cynicism can be frustrating, and  the bureaucracy can be maddening, but as John will attest, there are  few more rewarding experiences than helping a veteran receive overdue  recognition or bringing a new VA facility to a rural community or  ensuring seniors and people with disabilities receive the Social  Security benefits they so richly deserve.   John is not the type of person to trumpet his service from the  rooftops, but he has an enormous heart and a passion for public  service. The bottom line is that John has found ways to help me help  countless people across Oregon.   Now, as John knows, we never really let anybody leave Team Wyden, so  I am sure we will still call upon his wealth of knowledge and  experience. In the meantime, I want to thank him for all the help he  has provided over these past two decades. I have been fortunate to have  him on my team, and we will all miss him greatly.                            ____________________
