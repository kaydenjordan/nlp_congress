 Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to  thank U.S. Army CPT Demetrius Keishun Morris, an extraordinary man who  has contributed to my office through the Army Congressional Fellowship  Program. Captain Morris, known as  [[Page S7581]]  ``D.K.'', has been exceptional to work with over the last year. My  staff and I have benefited enormously from D.K.'s knowledge and  expertise on U.S. national security and Armed Services policy.   D.K. draws upon nearly two decades of service, which includes  deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Qatar. D.K. enlisted in the Army  in 2000 and was commissioned as an officer in 2010. As an officer, D.K.  distinguished himself by serving at the battalion, brigade, and  division levels while operating in combined, joint, and partnered  environments. Before D.K. joined my office, he served as the commander  of the Headquarters and Headquarters Battery of the 32nd Army Air and  Missile Defense Command at Fort Bliss, TX. At each post and here in the  Senate, D.K. has served with distinction.   D.K. has always been one to go above and beyond because it is just  part of his nature. He graduated from George Washington University in  2008 with a bachelor of science in health sciences while earning a  place on the dean's list. His education also includes a master of arts  in intelligence studies with honors from American Military University  and a master of professional studies degree in legislative affairs from  George Washington University. D.K. is also a graduate of the Military  Intelligence Captain's Career Course at Fort Huachuca, AZ, where he  achieved placement in the top 20 percent of his class.   CPT Demetrius Keishun Morris is the epitome of a dedicated public  servant. He has put himself in harm's way to defend our rights and  freedom and to help secure freedom for people in other countries. We  owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our servicemen and women,  especially those who make a career in the military. It is always  important to acknowledge their family members who share in the  sacrifice, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank D.K.'s  wife Lakisha and their three wonderful children, Cornelius, Samara, and  Roman, for their support and for allowing us to utilize the expertise  and experience of their husband and father this last year. My staff and  I will miss D.K.; at the same, however, we are also excited to see  what's in store next for this exceptional individual, who will always  be part of Team Cardin.                            ____________________
