 Mr. Speaker, our troops comprise the most professional,  highly trained, and dedicated military force that the world has ever  seen. They have pledged their lives, the well-being of their families,  and their sacred honor to serve and protect this Nation.   Yet here we are, over a month into 2018, and our military and  national security are being held hostage by our colleagues across the  aisle over unrelated issues.   It is time for the Senate to get its act together. The House has  passed the full defense funding three times this year. Tonight, we will  pass it a fourth time.   It is wrong for us to send our best young men and women into harm's  way without the resources they need, asking them to make up with their  efforts, and their risk, for our shortcomings.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this funding legislation  and to prove to our troops that we have their backs.
