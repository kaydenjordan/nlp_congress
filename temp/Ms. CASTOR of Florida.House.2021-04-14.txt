 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Florida for yielding.   It is with great sadness that I rise on behalf of the Florida  delegation, and you can see we have many new Floridians in our  delegation today because we had such great love, respect, and  admiration for our colleague Congressman Hastings.   Congressman Hastings was a towering figure who always stood up for  the little guy. He fought for civil rights. He fought for voting  rights. He fought for affordable healthcare. He was tireless.   Now, Alcee did not suffer fools or malarky, and he was unafraid to  point it out. And he did so with relish. And let that be a great  example to all of us who have this tremendous responsibility to stand  up every day for the people who send us here, especially the voiceless  and the vulnerable.   But Alcee served with great intellect, with passion, with flare. He  loved the House of Representatives. He loved the State of Florida. He  wanted it to be better, and he worked on that every single day. But I  think we are all better for his service and his example.   Madam Speaker, I think Alcee would have appreciated the fact that you  are in bright orange today, the color of his beloved Florida A&M  University. Go Rattlers.   On behalf of the great State of Florida, we also send our love,  prayers, and condolences to Lale, his chief of staff, his entire team,  his family, his devoted friends, and I would respectfully ask that we  recognize his life with a moment of silence, but ask and invite you  [[Page H1783]]  all to join us in a celebration of his life that we intend to hold next  week.                            ____________________
