 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 268) to provide for the boundary of the Palo Alto  Battlefield National Historic Park to be adjusted, to authorize the  donation of land to the United States for addition to that historic  park, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 268         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. BOUNDARY; LEGAL DESCRIPTION.         (a) Boundary.--Section 3(b)(2) of the Palo Alto Battlefield       National Historic Site Act of 1991 (16 U.S.C. 410nnn-1(b)(2))       is amended--        (1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows:        ``(A) In general.--        ``(i) In addition to the land described in paragraph (1),       the historical park shall consist of--         ``(I) the approximately 34 acres of land, as generally       depicted on the map entitled `Palo Alto Battlefield NHS       Proposed Boundary Expansion', numbered 469/80,012, and dated       May 21, 2008; and        ``(II) on the date that such land is donated to the United       States, the approximately 166.44 acres of land generally       depicted on the map entitled `PALO ALTO BATTLEFIELD NATIONAL       HISTORICAL PARK Proposed Boundary Addition, Fort Brown Unit',       numbered 469/143,589, and dated April 2018.         ``(ii) Before accepting any donated land described in this       subparagraph, the Secretary shall complete a boundary study       analyzing the feasibility of adding the land to the national       historical park.        ``(iii) If a boundary study completed under clause (ii)       finds that acceptance of the donated land is feasible and       appropriate, the Secretary may accept such land and       administer the land as part of the historical park after       providing notice of such finding to Congress.''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``map'' and inserting       ``maps''; and        (B) by striking ``map'' and inserting ``maps''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 268, the Palo Alto Battlefield  National Historic Park Boundary Adjustment Act, introduced by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela).   H.R. 268 expands the boundary of Palo Alto Battlefield National  Historic Park to include approximately 166 acres of land that is to be  donated to the Department of the Interior.   The donated land was the site of Fort Brown, a crucial outpost during  the Mexican-American War, which remains the last standing physical  structure associated with that war.   During its life, Fort Brown transformed from a site designed for a  confrontation into a post that served to protect the growing Mexican- American population of the region.   Palo Alto Battlefield was designated as a national historic landmark  in 1960, as a national historic site in 1978, and a national historic  park in 2009. Today, the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Park  is the only unit of the National Park Service focused on the Mexican- American War.   I congratulate Representative Vela for championing this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have one additional request to address  the legislation.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vicente Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I join with the ranking member to urge  adoption of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1908) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct  a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating  certain land as the Ka'ena Point National Heritage Area, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1908         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Requirements.--The study shall include analysis,       documentation, and determinations on whether the study area--        (1) has an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural       resources that--        (A) represents distinctive aspects of the heritage of the       United States;        (B) is worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation,       and continuing use; and        (C) would be best managed--        (i) through partnerships among public and private entities;       and        (ii) by linking diverse and sometimes noncontiguous       resources and active communities;        (2) reflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife       that are a valuable part of the story of the United States;        (3) provides outstanding opportunities--        (A) to conserve natural, historic, cultural, or scenic       features; and        (B) for recreation and education;        (4) contains resources that--        (A) are important to any identified themes of the study       area; and        (B) retain a degree of integrity capable of supporting       interpretation;        (5) includes residents, business interests, nonprofit       organizations, and State and local governments that--        (A) are involved in the planning of the Heritage Area;        (B) have developed a conceptual financial plan that       outlines the roles of all participants in the Heritage Area,       including the Federal Government; and        (C) have demonstrated support for the designation of the       Heritage Area;        (6) has a potential management entity to work in       partnership with the individuals and entities described in       paragraph (5) to develop the Heritage Area while encouraging       State and local economic activity; and        (7) has a conceptual boundary map that is supported by the       public.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         Not later than 3 years after the date on which funds are       first made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes--        (1) the findings of the study under section 3; and        (2) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1908, the Ka'ena Point  National Heritage Area Act, introduced by the gentleman from Hawaii  (Mr. Case), my Natural Resources Committee colleague.   This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study  to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating Ka'ena Point  National Heritage Area in the State of Hawaii.   The study focuses on the undeveloped area of the point on the west  end of the island of Oahu and home to some of the richest and most  well-preserved cultural aspects of Hawaii's history along with  invaluable and unique environmental and natural resources.                                time  1445    This area is the site of the last intact sand dune ecosystem in  Hawaii and an important cultural site that, according to some Hawaiian  tradition, is where the souls of the deceased leapt into the next plane  of existence.   Rich with wildlife and thriving biodiversity, the area is home to  various protected species, including laysan albatrosses, the wedge- tailed shearwaters, monk seals, and fragile native plants.   I congratulate my colleague, Representative Case, for championing  this bill on behalf of his constituents. I urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on the  legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we all know Hawaii is a beautiful State.  The bill will help protect and conserve that rich environmental and  cultural heritage. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   And I urge Representative Case to invite all of us to Hawaii when it  is time to see the site.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1931) to provide competitive grants for the promotion of  Japanese American confinement education as a means to understand the  importance of democratic principles, use and abuse of power, and to  raise awareness about the importance of cultural tolerance toward  Japanese Americans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1931         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Japanese American       Confinement Education Act''.       SEC. 2. JAPANESE AMERICAN CONFINEMENT EDUCATION GRANTS.         Public Law 109-441 (120 Stat. 3290) is amended--        (1) in section 2, by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Japanese american confinement education grants.--The       term `Japanese American Confinement Education Grants' means       competitive grants, awarded through the Japanese American       Confinement Sites Program, for Japanese American       organizations to educate individuals, including through the       use of digital resources, in the United States on the       historical importance of Japanese American confinement during       World War II, so that present and future generations may       learn from Japanese American confinement and the commitment       of the United States to equal justice under the law.        ``(5) Japanese american organization.--The term `Japanese       American organization' means a private nonprofit organization       within the United States established to promote the       understanding and appreciation of the ethnic and cultural       diversity of the United States by illustrating the Japanese       American experience throughout the history of the United       States.''; and        (2) in section 4--        (A) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``There are       authorized'';        (B) by striking ``$38,000,000'' and inserting       ``$80,000,000''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Japanese American Confinement Education Grants.--        ``(1) In general.--Of the amounts made available under this       section, not more than $10,000,000 shall be awarded as       Japanese American Confinement Education Grants to Japanese       American organizations. Such competitive grants shall be in       an amount not less than $750,000 and the Secretary shall give       priority consideration to Japanese American organizations       with fewer than 100 employees.        ``(2) Matching requirement.--        ``(A) Fifty percent.--Except as provided in subparagraph       (B), for funds awarded under this subsection, the Secretary       shall require a 50 percent match with non-Federal assets from       non-Federal sources, which may include cash or durable goods       and materials fairly valued, as determined by the Secretary.        ``(B) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive all or part of the       matching requirement  [[Page H3724]]       under subparagraph (A), if the Secretary determines that--        ``(i) no reasonable means are available through which an       applicant can meet the matching requirement; and        ``(ii) the probable benefit of the project funded outweighs       the public interest in such matching requirement.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1931, the Japanese American Confinement  Education Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative Doris Matsui.   In 2006, Congress established the Japanese American Confinement Sites  grant program for the preservation and interpretation of U.S.  confinement sites where Japanese Americans were detained during World  War II.   These grants are awarded through a competitive process to entities  working to preserve historic Japanese American incarceration sites.  They require a 2:1 Federal to non-Federal match.   H.R. 1931 would authorize increased and much-needed funding for the  program within the National Park Service, ensuring that the lessons and  history of the unjust incarceration of Japanese Americans is not  forgotten, and that we continue to learn from the transgression of the  past.   The bill will also establish a new competitive grant within the  program that would support nonprofits to create and share educational  materials about the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World  War II.   I congratulate my colleague, Representative Matsui, for championing  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), sponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Hawaii (Mr. Case).     Mr. Speaker, I urge approval of H.R. 1931. The sponsor  of the legislation, Representative Matsui, and also Representative Case  have made, I think, the profound argument for the legislation and its  support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2899) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a  study to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating areas  within the island of Guam as a National Heritage Area, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2899         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. THE GUAM NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDY.         (a) Study.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with       appropriate regional and local organizations or agencies,       shall conduct a study to assess the suitability and       feasibility of designating the study areas as National       Heritage Areas.        (2) Requirements.--The study shall include analysis,       documentation, and determinations on whether the study       areas--        (A) has an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural       resources that--        (i) represent distinctive aspects of the heritage of the       United States;        (ii) are worthy of recognition, conservation,       interpretation, and continuing use by residents and visitors;       and        (iii) would be best managed--         (I) through partnerships among public and private entities;       and        (II) by linking diverse and sometimes noncontiguous       resources and active communities that share a common       heritage;         (B) reflects traditions, customs, beliefs, and folklife       that are a valuable part of the story of the United States;        (C) provides--        (i) outstanding opportunities to conserve natural,       historic, cultural, or scenic features; and        (ii) outstanding recreational and educational and cultural       tourism opportunities;        (D) contains resources that--        (i) are important to any identified themes of the study       area; and        (ii) retain a degree of integrity capable of supporting       interpretation;        (E) includes residents, business interests, nonprofit       organizations, including museums and heritage organizations,       and State and local governments that--        (i) are involved in the planning of the National Heritage       Area;        (ii) have developed a conceptual financial plan that       outlines the roles of all participants in the Area, including       the Federal Government; and        (iii) have demonstrated support for the designation of the       Area;        (F) has a potential management entity to work in       partnership with the individuals and entities described in       subparagraph (E) to develop the Area while encouraging State       and local economic activity; and        (G) has a conceptual boundary map that is supported by the       public.        (b) Private Property Considerations.--In conducting the       study, the Secretary shall consider the potential impact that       designation of the study area as a national heritage area       would have on private property on Guam.        (c) Report.--Not later than the end of the third fiscal       year after the date on which funds are first made available       for this section, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee       on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a       report that describes--        (1) the findings of the study; and        (2) any conclusions and recommendations of the Secretary.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Area.--The term ``Area'' means a National Heritage Area       located in Guam.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (3) Study area.--The term ``study area'' means the island       of Guam.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2899, introduced by my  Committee on Natural Resources colleague, Delegate San Nicolas.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2899 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to  conduct a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of designated  areas within the island of Guam as national heritage areas. The study  would cover the entire island of Guam and identify areas of natural,  historic, and cultural importance that reflect the traditions, customs,  beliefs, and folklife that represent distinct and nationally  significant aspects of the American story.   I congratulate Delegate San Nicolas for his strong advocacy in  promoting this legislation on behalf of his constituents, and I urge  support from my colleagues on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H3726]]         Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Guam (Mr. San Nicolas), the sponsor of the  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON, LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2899, ``To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to  assess the suitability and feasibility of designating areas within the  island of Guam as a National Heritage Area, and for other purposes.''   Different from national parks, national heritage areas are community- based efforts that preserve and share stories about a region's history  and character. Heritage areas contain a mixture of public and private  property, including towns, historic sites, parks, trails, commercial  districts, and even working farms.   National Heritage Areas are a grassroots, community-driven approach  to heritage conservation and economic development. Through public- private partnerships, NHA entities support historic preservation,  natural resource conservation, recreation, heritage tourism, and  educational projects. Leveraging funds and long-term support for  projects, NHA partnerships foster pride of place and an enduring  stewardship ethic.   When an area is designated as an NHA, its inhabitants don't have to  leave. An important aspect of NHAs is that they are intended as a  celebration of a living environment, and they improve the local economy  around them.   The National Parks Service estimates NHAs average $5.50 for every  $1.00 of federal investment, bolstering the local economies through  their unique ``heritage tourism.''   Not only are NHAs economically friendly, but they are also climate  friendly. Many NHAs improve water and air quality in their regions  through restoration projects and encourage people to enjoy natural and  cultural sites by providing new recreational opportunities.   Guam is much more than sun, sea, and sand. The island is awash with a  history that dates back to the Latte Period of 2000BC, the period of  Ancient Chamorro life before a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese  explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived on March 6, 1521.   With 131 sites around the island listed on the National Register of  Historic Places, these historical landmarks weave a fascinating tale of  the island's struggles, resilience, and victories over thousands of  years. Though the island's colorful history spans the Spanish era, the  American period, and Japanese WWII occupation, today Guam is most  widely celebrated for its native Chamorro culture and pride.   Chamorros are the indigenous people of the Mariana Islands of which  Guam is the largest and southernmost on an island chain. Archeological  evidence identified civilization dating back 5,000 years.   Their vernacular, called the Chamorro language, is interestingly not  a Micronesian dialect but a distinct language with its own vocabulary  and grammar.   Therefore, considering the richness of Guam's land and its peoples,  it brings me much joy to rise in strong support of H.R. 2899. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3113) to require the Secretary of the Interior, the  Secretary of Agriculture, and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Civil Works to digitize and make publicly available geographic  information system mapping data relating to public access to Federal  land and waters for outdoor recreation, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3113         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 6. COOPERATION AND COORDINATION.         (a) Third-party Providers.--The Secretaries may enter into       an agreement with a third party to carry out any provision of       this Act.        (b) US Geological Survey.--The Secretaries may work with       the Director of the United States Geological Survey to       collect, aggregate, digitize, standardize, or publish data on       behalf of the Secretary of the Interior to meet the       requirements of this Act.       SEC. 7. REPORTS.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act and annually thereafter through March 30, 2031, the       Secretaries shall submit a report on the progress made by the       Secretaries with respect to meeting the requirements of this       Act to--        (1) the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the       Senate;        (2) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the       Senate;        (3) the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives; and        (4) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of       the House of Representatives.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3113, the Modernizing Access  to Our Public Land Act, or MAPLand Act, introduced by my Committee on  Natural Resources colleague, Representative Blake Moore.   Our committee has long focused on sportsmen's access to public lands.  I am pleased that shortly after I became chair, we were able to pass  the bipartisan John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act, which included an entire title on sportsmen's access.   The MAPLand Act would build on that law, as well as the investments  made by the Great American Outdoors Act, to help ensure that hunters,  anglers, and all Americans can more easily find information and  resources to help facilitate public lands access.   Representative Moore's bill would direct the Department of the  Interior, the Forest Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers to  jointly develop and adopt standards to ensure database compatibility  for the collection and sharing of outdoor recreation data related to  Federal lands.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Moore for championing this bill  on behalf of everyone who enjoys our public lands, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I concur with Ranking Member Westerman  and urge support of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3197) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey to  the City of Eunice, Louisiana, certain Federal land in Louisiana, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3197         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Save the Liberty Theatre Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) City.--The term ``City'' means the City of Eunice,       Louisiana.        (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Jean       Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, Proposed       Boundary Revision and Disposal'', numbered 467/168813, and       dated December 2020.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. LAND CONVEYANCE.         (a) Conveyance Authority.--The Secretary shall convey to       the City, by quitclaim deed and without consideration, all       right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the       parcels of land described in subsection (b).        (b) Description of Land.--The parcels of land referred to       in subsection (a) are Lots 5 and 6, less the North 27 feet of       Lot 5, Block 22, of the Original Townsite of Eunice,       generally depicted as ``Proposed Disposal Area'' on the map.        (c) Availability of Map.--The map shall be on file and       available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of       the National Park Service.       SEC. 4. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS.         Upon the conveyance to the City of the land described in       section 3(b), the boundary of the Jean Lafitte National       Historical Park and Preserve shall be adjusted to exclude--        (1) the conveyed land; and        (2) Lots 7 and 8 of the Original Townsite of Eunice       generally depicted as ``Non-NPS in Current Boundary'' on the       map.   [[Page H3729]]      Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3197, the Save the Liberty  Theatre Act introduced by my colleague Representative   Mike Johnson.   This bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey a  small piece of the historic Liberty Theatre to the city of Eunice,  Louisiana. Although the theater is owned and operated by the city, it  is adjacent to the Prairie Arcadian Cultural Center, which is owned by  the National Park Service as a unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical  Park.   In the 1980s, the Park Service ended up building an annex to the  theater in order to construct an ADA compliant ramp and to house an air  conditioning system for the two buildings. Now, the city of Eunice  plans to build its own HVAC system. Consolidation of the property is a  win-win: It will allow rehabilitation of the Liberty Theatre to move  forward and decrease operating costs for the National Park Service.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation, and I am pleased to  support it today. I thank Representative Johnson for bringing this bill  forward and bringing it to our attention, and I urge our colleagues to  support the passage today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4380) to designate the El Paso Community Healing Garden  National Memorial, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4380         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF EL PASO COMMUNITY HEALING GARDEN                     NATIONAL MEMORIAL.         (a) Designation.--The Healing Garden located at 6900 Delta       Drive, El Paso, Texas, is designated as the ``El Paso       Community Healing Garden National Memorial''.        (b) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial       designated by this section is not a unit of the National Park       System and the designation of the El Paso Community Healing       Garden National Memorial shall not require or authorize       Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to that       national memorial.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4380, a bill to designate  the El Paso Community Healing Garden National Memorial, introduced by  my colleague, Representative Veronica Escobar.   On August 3, 2019, El Paso, Texas, was the target of a horrific  domestic terrorist attack that took 23 lives, injured another 23  people, and devastated communities across the Nation.   The mass shooting occurred at a Walmart Supercenter on the east side  of El Paso and is arguably the deadliest targeted attack against  Latinos in modern American history.   Following the attack, the county of El Paso approved the construction  of the El Paso Community Healing Garden to provide the community with a  space to honor victims and survivors and to heal.   My heart goes out to all the victims of this horrific attack. While I  know there is nothing we can do to turn back the clock, I hope that our  efforts to recognize this site as a national memorial will help bring  some solace and healing to the community.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Escobar for championing this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar), the sponsor of the  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for helping bring this to the  floor.   Representative Escobar's particular piece of legislation is not  merely a reminder or a political statement. It is a memorial, an  acknowledgment of a tragedy, and an acknowledgment of the need for  reconciliation, the need for healing, the need for understanding, and  the need to have the conversations as communities that we need to have  so that if we do nothing else to prevent this kind of deranged  violence, we can at least begin to heal and talk about the issue in a  way that maybe reaches  [[Page H3731]]  part of that end to reduce this kind of violence and violence in  general.   I speak from limited experience but vital experience. Our former  colleague, Representative Giffords, was in an attempted assassination.  Six people died at the Congress on Your Corner where she would hold  events for people to come and talk to her about the issues facing our  Nation and facing the district, that unique ability of this democracy  of ours for their elected officials to be accessible to the public that  they represent.   She was shot, almost died, and survived, and we have a memorial to  that event in Tucson. It has proven to be a rallying point, it has  proven to be a great instrument for nonviolence, and it is a forum for  discussion and growth, the growth of tolerance and understanding in  Tucson, Arizona.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, I thank the ranking  member for his leadership, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5001) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to continue  to implement endangered fish recovery programs for the Upper Colorado  and San Juan River Basins, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5001         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Upper Colorado and San Juan       River Basins Recovery Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATIONS RELATED TO FISH RECOVERY                     PROGRAMS.         Section 3 of Public Law 106-392 (114 Stat. 1603 et seq.) is       amended--        (1) by striking ``2023'' each place it appears and       inserting ``2024'';        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``$179,000,000'' and       inserting ``$184,000,000'';        (3) in subsection (b)(2) by striking ``$30,000,000'' and       inserting ``$25,000,000'';        (4) in subsection (h), by striking ``, at least 1 year       prior to such expiration,''; and        (5) in subsection (j), by striking ``2021'' each place it       appears and inserting ``2022''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5001, introduced by my  Natural Resources Committee colleague, Representative   Joe Neguse of  Colorado. This bipartisan bill will reauthorize two programs that are  working to recover threatened and endangered fish in the Upper Colorado  River Basin.   This legislation will continue the collaboration work of Tribes,  water users, environmental groups, local utilities, and State and  Federal agencies that are partnering to recover four fish species  currently listed under the Endangered Species Act as either threatened  or endangered.   These programs provide Endangered Species Act compliance for projects  that use water resources from the San Juan River and Upper Colorado  River Basins, so that these rare native fish can be recovered while  human water use can continue.   With the conservation actions undertaken through the recovery  programs, one fish was downlisted from endangered to threatened last  year, and another fish is under consideration for downlisting to  threatened as well. This good work is important, and it should  continue.   I want to commend my colleague, the chair of the National Parks,  Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee, Representative Neguse, for his  leadership on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it is good to know that the ranking  member has a weakness, and so we are going to put razorback in every  piece of legislation from now on.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6434) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish,  within the National Park Service, the Japanese American World War II  History Network, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6434         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Japanese American World War       II History Network Act''.       SEC. 2. JAPANESE AMERICAN WORLD WAR II HISTORY NETWORK.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Interior       (hereinafter referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall       establish, within the National Park Service, a program to be       known as the ``Japanese American World War II History       Network'' (hereinafter referred to as the ``Network'').        (b) Duties of Secretary.--In carrying out the Network, the       Secretary shall--        (1) review studies and reports to complement and not       duplicate studies of Japanese American World War II history       and Japanese American experiences during World War II,       including studies related to relocation centers and       confinement sites, that are underway or completed;        (2) produce and disseminate appropriate educational       materials, such as handbooks, maps, interpretive guides, or       electronic information relating to Japanese American World       War II history and Japanese American experiences during the       war, including relocation centers and confinement sites;        (3) enter into appropriate cooperative agreements and       memoranda of understanding to provide technical assistance       under subsection (c); and        (4)(A) create and adopt an official, uniform symbol or       device for the Network; and        (B) issue regulations for the use of the symbol or device       adopted under subparagraph (A).        (c) Elements.--The Network shall encompass the following       elements:        (1) All units and programs of the National Park Service       that are determined by the Secretary to relate to Japanese       American World War II history and Japanese American       experiences during the war, including relocation centers and       confinement sites.        (2) With the consent of the property owner, other Federal,       State, local, Tribal, and privately owned properties that--        (A) relate to Japanese American World War II history and       Japanese experiences during the war, including relocation       centers and confinement sites;        (B) have a verifiable connection to Japanese American World       War II history and Japanese experiences during the war,       including relocation and confinement sites; and        (C) are included in, or determined by the Secretary to be       eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic       Places.        (3) Other governmental and nongovernmental facilities and       programs of an educational, research, or interpretive nature       that are directly related to Japanese American World War II       history and the experiences of Japanese Americans during the       war, including relocation centers and confinement sites.       SEC. 3. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS AND MEMORANDA OF                     UNDERSTANDING.         To achieve the purposes of this Act and to ensure effective       coordination of the Federal and non-Federal elements of the       Network described in section 2(c) with units of the National       Park System and programs of the National Park Service,       including the Japanese American Confinement Sites Program,       the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements and       memoranda of understanding with, and provide technical       assistance to the heads of other Federal agencies, States,       units of local government, Tribes, regional governmental       bodies, and private entities.       SEC. 4. SUNSET.         The authority of the Secretary under this Act shall expire       7 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material for the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6434, the Japanese American  World War II History Network Act, introduced by my Natural Resources  Committee colleague, Representative Jay Obernolte.   This bill will direct the Secretary of the Interior to establish the  Japanese American World War II History Network within the National Park  Service.   Between 1942 and 1945, the U.S. Government wrongfully imprisoned  approximately 120,000 Japanese Americans, most of whom were U.S.  citizens. Many of the U.S. Government's activities during World War II  were done in secrecy and were not accurately represented to the public  in the years after the war.   Designating this network will support education and awareness of the  people, places, and events that were associated with the wrongful  incarceration of Japanese Americans.   This effort will be a welcome complement to the existing Japanese  American Confinement Sites Grant Program, which we are looking to  reauthorize and strengthen today through Representative Matsui's  legislation, which we considered earlier this afternoon.   I thank Representative Obernolte for championing this legislation,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Obernolte, our colleague on  the committee, and Ms. Matsui, a former colleague on the committee, for  two pieces of very important legislation that look at the realism that  we need to look at in terms of our history as a Nation. They are  complementary and good pieces of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge approval, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
