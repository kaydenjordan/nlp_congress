 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  2543. This bill threat-      The online version has been corrected to read: Mrs. KIM of  California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2543. This  bill threat-    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The way the Fed can address socioeconomic disparities for all groups,  including our most vulnerable communities, is by focusing on the  existing  [[Page H5573]]  dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Instead of  letting the Fed use its existing tools, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle are attempting to politicize it.   Congress should be focusing on addressing real wages being down 4.2  percent and helping the Fed achieve a price stability mandate instead  of enacting partisan policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 2543.
