 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time, and I rise today not so much to oppose this legislation, as to  deride it as a sham, as a fraud, as a pretense of fiscal  responsibility. If you want to balance the budget, just do it.   I have served here for years and years and years when my Republican  colleagues have controlled the House, the Senate, and the Presidency.  Just do it. Don't talk about it.   Now, I come here as someone who has voted for balanced budget  amendments in the past, but I have become extraordinarily cynical at  people who vote to cut the cost of their product way below the price of  producing it. That is a formula for bankruptcy in any business any  place in the world.   For Republicans to bring a balanced budget amendment to the floor  just weeks after adding $1.8 trillion to deficits and tax breaks for  the wealthiest is the epitome of hypocrisy. Nobody--nobody believes  anymore that Republicans care about deficit reduction or balancing the  budget, let alone their own members.   Now, ladies and gentlemen on the Republican side of the aisle, let me  call to your attention the chair's remarks of your Freedom Caucus. Hear  me. I am going to quote Mark Meadows. The Freedom Caucus, the most  conservative element, supposedly, of Congress, Mark Meadows says this:  ``There is no one on Capitol Hill and certainly no one on Main Street  who takes this vote seriously.'' Mark Meadows.   Conservative Republican Tom Massie, a Republican, a very conservative  Republican, says this: ``Audacity, noun: Voting on a constitutional  balanced budget amendment only 4 legislative days after ramming through  massive deficit spending because you believe this stunt''--Massie's  word, not mine--``this stunt will convince constituents that you care  about balancing the budget.''   Not my words. Two of the most conservative Republicans in this House.   And Republican Senator Bob Corker said this: ``Republicans control  the House, the Senate, and the White House. If we were serious''--this  is the Republican Senator saying--``If we were serious about balancing  the budget, we would do it.''    We know what it takes to balance budgets, Mr. Speaker. We did it  during the Clinton administration 4 years in a row. Now, my Republican  colleagues may jump to their feet and say: Yes, but we were in charge  of Congress.   That is correct. And President Clinton would not let them cut the  price of our product because to do so would have led to bankruptcy. So  what did we do? We balanced the budget 4 years in a row--the only time  that has been done in the lifetime of any listener to these words.   But what happened? Our Republican colleagues took office, they took  the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and they cut the price of  the product, but they didn't cut the cost of the product. And what do  we have? We increase the debt by 87 percent in the Bush 8 years.   Democrats instituted paygo rules to pay for what we buy, and they  worked, and we balanced the budget. Republicans came into the majority  and scrapped those rules. Now we are mired in growing deficits.   The CBO baseline--Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan--released  on Monday shows that accounting for Republican policies passed since  President Trump took office just a few months ago, the deficit will  reach, this year----         Mr. Speaker, since President Trump took office, this year,  fiscal year 2018, $980 billion in deficits; next year, $1 trillion.  Every year thereafter, during the Trump administration, another $1  trillion of debt. It will total some $14 trillion.   After Republicans passed their tax law, they knew they would be on  the hook for its enormous deficit price tag, so immediately they said  they wanted to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and other  safety net programs to do it.   This amendment would essentially write those cuts into the  Constitution. Hear me. Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, write those  cuts into the Constitution. This is a backdoor effort to gut the  programs that help working Americans get ahead.   I said I rose to deride this amendment. It is a fraud, a sham, a  pretense, but it is also bad for our country, bad for our people. I  urge my colleagues to defeat this silly waste of time.
