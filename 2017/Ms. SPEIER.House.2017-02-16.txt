 I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, it is very hard for me to listen to the conversation  on the other side of the aisle because it is a conversation they are  having with themselves, and it is a conversation we are having with  ourselves.   Let me be really clear. This is not about Planned Parenthood and  abortion because we already know that Planned Parenthood gets no  funding for abortions in this country, pure and simple. Planned  Parenthood gets funding through title X to provide services for breast  cancer screenings, cancer screenings, STDs, and contraception.   What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to say  is: We just want to make sure Planned Parenthood doesn't get a dime.  Just squeeze every dime out of them that may be Federal dollars, even  though they provide a really important health service.   So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I guess  what you are saying is, to the 80,000 women last year who were  diagnosed with cancer because they went to a Planned Parenthood  facility and of the 800,000 that were screened for cancer, you would  rather see them die.
