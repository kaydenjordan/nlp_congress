 Mr. President, this week the Senate will consider more  of the President's choices to fill important positions in the Federal  Government. Too many important seats have continued to gather dust 2.5  years into this Presidency due to systematic Democratic obstruction.   The President deserves his team, and the American people deserve to  be governed by the government they actually elected back in 2016. So as  long as there continues to be resistance to processing uncontroversial  nominees in the typical fashion by voice vote, we will just continue to  vote on these impressive men and women.   Leading off this week are nominees to be Deputy Under Secretary of  the Treasury, Ambassador to the Republic of Fiji, Solicitor of the  Department of the Interior, and Deputy Commissioner of Social Security.  I hope our colleagues will join in supporting each of them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate also needs to remain focused  on  [[Page S5619]]  our important job of funding the Federal Government.   Last week brought an unfortunate spectacle: The vast majority of our  Democratic colleagues actually filibustered legislation to fund our  national defense--at a dollar figure they had previously agreed to--for  the sake of a political fight with the President.   The funding our commanders need to keep pace with China and Russia,  the funding our men and women in uniform need for their tools and  training, even a pay raise for our servicemembers--all of it was  blocked by our Democratic colleagues, blocked by Democrats in order to  pick a partisan fight with the White House. That is an interesting  statement of priorities, but I remain hopeful that we can get this  process back on track.   Back in July, both parties in both Houses of Congress and the White  House all agreed to a bipartisan, bicameral roadmap to guide  appropriations. We all agreed to rule out poison pill policy riders and  not to seek changes in Presidential authorities relative to current  law. So I hope we can rediscover that roadmap and make some progress.  In the meantime, before the end of the week, we will vote on a  continuing resolution to prevent a lapse in funding while the work  continues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a related matter, while Senate  Republicans continue to seek bipartisan solutions, the story on the  other side of the Capitol has been a little bit different.   Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic House continue to neglect  opportunities to find compromises that might actually become law and  instead churn out one leftwing messaging bill after another.   Two weeks ago, just days before Iran's coordinated attack on the  world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, House  Democrats took it upon themselves to send us several pieces of  legislation that would have reduced--reduced--American energy  independence.   Domestic energy is a driver of American prosperity and one of the big  success stories of recent years, but the House Democrats want us to  retreat. They send us go-nowhere legislation the Senate will not pass  and the President will not sign.   And then, lest a whole week go by without one of these exercises,  here is what happened last week: House Democrats began unveiling  Speaker Pelosi's handmade plan to have Washington, DC, bureaucrats  start micromanaging America's prescription drugs. It is the same old  one-size-fits-all, government-controlled philosophy we continue to see  from our Democratic colleagues. Forget about choice. Forget about  competition. Forget about free enterprise and finding ways to unleash  more market forces to help consumers. Just give Washington bureaucrats  more power to clumsily call the shots and manipulate markets from the  top down.   Predictably, what this plan amounts to is not an efficient, effective  way to help American families but an efficient, effective way to bring  even more of the economy under the bureaucracy's thumb and potentially  set us on a track toward nationalizing a major industry.   There are millions of Americans who benefit from our Nation's  incredible innovations and the R&D breakthroughs on new drug treatments  and cures. We really ought not to jeopardize that.   American families deserve more choice, more competition, more  affordability. The last thing we need is for the socialist delusions of  the Green New Deal and Medicare for All to be copied and pasted into  innovations and cures, putting them at risk.   Fortunately, this Republican Senate won't let the Speaker's dangerous  proposal hurt the country. We will stay focused on the American  people's business, and we will keep hoping our friends across the  building put aside the political performances and join us to work on  real solutions with a real chance of becoming real laws.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence has long worked on a bipartisan basis in  secure settings out of the public spotlight to conduct critically  important oversight of classified and sensitive matters. So I have been  disappointed to see our colleague, the Democratic leader, choose to  politicize the committee's ongoing efforts with respect to a recent  whistleblower allegation--the special subject of which is still  unknown.   As my friend Senator Schumer is aware, Chairman Burr and Vice  Chairman Warner have been working together to get the Acting Director  of Intelligence and the intelligence community's inspector general  before the committee this week to discuss the matter. As with most  matters before the committee, I believe it is extremely important that  their work be handled in a secure setting with adequate protections, in  a bipartisan fashion, and based on facts rather than leaks to the  press.   It is regrettable House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff and  Senator Schumer have chosen to politicize the issue, circumventing the  established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can  pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan  manner.   Although we don't know the substance of the allegations, there is  speculation that it relates to our relationship with Ukraine. For my  part, as I stated earlier this month, I was very glad to see the White  House release security assistance funds for Ukraine.    I championed U.S. security assistance to Ukraine over the objections  of the Obama administration in 2014 and have consistently believed in  the importance of helping our Ukrainian partners defend their territory  against Russian aggression. In fact, I had been personally pressing  them to release security assistance funding for several months to  ensure the United States did not walk back our important commitments to  Ukraine.   On two occasions I raised the need to keep our commitment to Ukraine  with the Secretary of Defense, expressing my interest in seeing this  money be released to help our Ukrainian partners. I raised it with the  Secretary of State. My staff also engaged senior officials at the  Pentagon, at the State Department, at the National Security Council,  and at the Office of Management and Budget. I also worked closely with  Senator Graham on the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations  Subcommittee and Chairman Shelby.   Throughout July, August, and early September, I worked hard to ensure  that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance. That is because,  going back years, I have urged administrations of both parties to be  completely clear-eyed about the dangerous intentions of Putin's Russia  and the importance of standing with Ukraine.   I sounded the alarm early and often when President Obama went soft on  Putin and missed opportunities to send arms to Ukraine, and during the  Trump administration, I have been a strong supporter of its efforts to  provide defensive lethal weapons to Ukraine and to Georgia.   As I have said repeatedly, Russia poses a significant threat to U.S.  interests. The best way to contest Putin and his hegemonic aspirations  is to rebuild our defenses, work closely with our allies and partners,  and improve the capacity of those threatened by Moscow to defend  themselves.   I am grateful that security assistance has finally been released to  help our friends in Ukraine defend themselves. Now the task falls on us  to pass a Defense bill and make the necessary investment in modernizing  our own military to ensure America's preeminent position in the world  and to deter challenge from adversaries like Russia and China.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills  at the desk due for a second reading, en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings en bloc.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
