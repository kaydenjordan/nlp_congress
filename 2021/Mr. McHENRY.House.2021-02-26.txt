 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri, the good  ranking member of the Budget Committee.   Mr. Speaker, we, as politicians, are talking down our economy  specifically to pass this spending package. To be clear, we know many  Americans are still suffering. Republicans want to provide targeted  relief to those in need--temporary, targeted relief related to COVID.  In fact, for a year now, we have been working to support families  impacted by COVID, and we have done so in an overwhelmingly bipartisan  way.   Mr. Speaker, now the Democrats have power and they are not interested  in bipartisanship--no matter what the campaign pledges were--or even  basic facts. The fact is that CBO projects that the unemployment rate,  which is lower right now than it was in the first  [[Page H840]]  5\1/2\ years of President Obama's Presidency, will continue to fall  even without congressional action and reach its pre-pandemic size by  next year.   Additionally, personal income increased at the end of last year, and  the report out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics today says personal  savings rates are now over 20 percent, a level not seen in four  decades. But these are facts that don't back up the Democrats'  preferred narrative, that the economy is horrible, and this big,  spending package is their solution.   Democrats are distorting the truth to push through a package that  dedicates only 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion price tag of this bill to  actually combating the virus.   Mr. Speaker, let's reject this package. Let's get American people  back to work. Let's get schools open. Let's get parents back at work.  Let's get women back in the workforce. And we can do that with  bipartisan solutions, not a big spending package.   Let's reject this. Let's start over and get to good terms so we can  actually fix the problems for the American people, get them working  again, get schools open, and beat the virus.
