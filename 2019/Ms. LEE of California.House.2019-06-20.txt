 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand that the  Trump administration stop its assault on immigrant communities and  abandon its plan on public charge.   Now let me be clear: No one should be denied a visa due to their  possible, potential need for public assistance, also known as public  charge. It is beyond appalling that the Department of Homeland Security  is using this criterion to prevent deserving families from coming to  the United States.   This heartless and un-American proposed rule also makes it extremely  difficult for individuals who are seeking a new life in the United  States to receive a green card if they are considered likely to use  public benefits in the future.   If this rule is implemented, the Trump administration would expand  the list of programs to include SNAP, Medicaid, and housing assistance  to determine permanent residency.   Madam Speaker, basic programs are there to help struggling families  put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads when they need  it. Denying immigrant families green card status with this criterion is  just plain wrong.   This anti-immigrant rhetoric is not new, Madam Speaker. For over 100  years, the Federal Government has used the argument of public charge in  immigration law for inadmissibility or deportation. Public charge was  first created when the 47th Congress passed the Immigration Act of  1882. This restricted certain individuals from migrating to the United  States.   This legislation specifically targeted unmarried women who were  presumed to be a so-called public charge because employers would not  employ them, leading the government to take care of them, which is  ridiculous.   But it wasn't just women that this law targeted. It was also  immigrants from Asia. As many of us are aware, fear of Chinese laborers  was part of the anti-immigrant rhetoric of the time. There was  widespread fear of the Chinese influence on the economy and the racist  perception that these immigrants would not contribute to American  society.   This fear was compounded when Chinese immigrants started to bring  their families to America and use public infrastructure, such as  schools and hospitals.   One of my constituents, Dr. Elaine Kim, who lives in Berkeley,  California, experienced this discrimination firsthand. In her own  words, she said: ``I am 76, and I am a child of immigrants who arrived  in this country in 1903 and 1926, respectively. My parents were not  allowed by law to become naturalized citizens and faced very serious  racial discrimination in their lifetimes. But they both worked hard,  harder than most native-born Americans, all their lives. They  contributed importantly to the United States and never, ever caused any  legal, social, or economic problems to anyone in this country.   ``At 76, I have also worked hard and consider myself a model U.S.  citizen. Putting myself through school at a time when most women, and  certainly most women of color, faced many obstacles, I finally finished  a Ph.D. degree. I served the public for 44 years until I recently  retired.   ``When I was an impoverished single mother, I received help from both  the Maternity and Infant Care Project and unemployment insurance. Now,  after working hard and raising a family of hardworking, well-educated  children, I receive a modest Social Security check each month as well  as Medicare, though I have kept myself in good enough health as to not  need much from this entitlement program.''   Dr. Kim and her family came to the United States and contributed  greatly to our Nation. They used public benefits when hardships  occurred, but they paid it back in many ways when they no longer needed  the benefits to help their family get by.   The Trump administration is trying to create discriminatory policies  that would restrict families such as Dr. Kim's from even entering the  country. This harmful, xenophobic argument evokes fear and scapegoats  immigrant communities.   Let's get straight to the facts. This country was built and continues  to stand on the strength of immigrants. We know that a little help for  our hardworking immigrant families reaps exponential returns to our  economy and society.   Immigrants contribute in taxes, and they should be able to use social  services when they need it, just like every other person in our Nation  who pays taxes. Our immigrant community should not be seen as a drain  on America but as an investment in our future. We are one Nation.   In closing, I want to reiterate that it is the constitutional duty of  Congress to write our immigration laws and ensure that they are  equitable to all individuals, regardless of race, age, or socioeconomic  status. That is why, last week, during the Homeland Security  appropriations markup, I offered an amendment along with Congressmen  Price, Pocan, and Aguilar that would make it clear that no Federal  funds can be used to expand public charge.   We must defeat this anti-immigrant and un-American public charge  rule. I hope that all of my colleagues will stand up and demand that  the administration abandon this plan once and for all.                            ____________________
