 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  and for her leadership on issues of public health, particularly this  bill.   I rise in support of the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.   I am proud of the long history in the San Francisco Bay Area, which I  have been privileged to represent and live in for many years, starting  in the 1980s with the amazing work by Stan Glantz, a researcher in San  Francisco who discovered the tobacco industry was pathologically lying  to the American public and hiding the effects of their products.   We responded to that by trying to pass laws here in Congress, but we  were unable to because of the tobacco lobby. We tried State legislative  opportunities but failed to do that. But in local government, we passed  hundreds of local ordinances banning secondhand smoke to protect  employees and to protect customers.   At the time, I was a member of the California Restaurant Association  and a restaurant owner. Many of my colleagues were part of the same  arguments we hear today, that you will put retailers out of business,  that this is all legal product.   We listened to those, and we enacted these laws, and we worked with  people who were affected by it. The economic impacts were positive, not  negative. Restaurants are more successful than they have ever been in  the bay area. We lead the country in many ways.   When we passed these ordinances, public health people came together  with labor and others to make sure that the truth came out.   In the early 1990s, as the mayor of a city of 130,000 people,  Concord, California, I authored one of the first efforts in the Nation  to curb secondhand smoke. In fact, it has been illegal to smoke in  bars, restaurants, and other public places in California entirely since  1998.   We worked together then to stop Big Tobacco's hold over millions of  addicted Americans, and we won.   Unfortunately, Big Tobacco has a new partner, the vaping industry.  Companies like Juul, unfortunately headquartered in San Francisco, in  my view, represent the very worst of the bay area business culture.  They don't ask for permission. They apologize  [[Page H1237]]  after they have addicted millions of Americans, particularly young  people. They deceptively and illegally marketed their poisonous  products to children, much like Big Tobacco did decades ago.   Our efforts led to an almost 70 percent decrease in the use of  tobacco products across the country, according to the Centers for  Disease Control.   In 2016 alone, on the other hand, 7 out of 10 U.S. middle and high  school students saw e-cigarette ads on TV, in stores, and online.   With marketing campaigns that make vaping look safe and fun, they use  flavors like cotton candy to attract young people to try vaping and get  hooked on nicotine.   But we know better. We have a long history of this. These products  are not safe. They are not smoking-cessation devices. And we need to  take action to protect our children, just as we did years ago.                                time  1245    In local government in the bay area, we have started to do what we  did in the 1990s: passing bans on these products. So, if we won't do it  here, we will do it at a local level; but we should do it here, and we  should pass this bill.   The longer we wait, millions are addicted, and millions more are  being targeted. The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act will help  save lives and keep widespread nicotine addiction in the past in the  United States.   We beat Big Tobacco once before, and we can do it again. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
