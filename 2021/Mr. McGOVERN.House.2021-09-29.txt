 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 688 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 688         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House bill (S. 1301) to provide       for the publication by the Secretary of Health and Human       Services of physical activity recommendations for Americans.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-16 shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to commit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 688, providing for consideration of  S. 1301 under a closed rule. The rule self-executes an amendment in the  nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print  117-16, temporarily extending the public debt limit.   The rule provides one hour of debate, equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and  Means or their respective designees. Finally, the rule provides one  motion to commit.   Madam Speaker, having just sat through a Rules Committee meeting, it  is a pleasant surprise that the Republicans have now rediscovered the  issue of the debt. Wow.   Where the hell were you for the past 4 years?   Where was your concern when you all passed the tax cut bill for the  wealthy and big corporations that CBO projected would add $1.9 trillion  to the deficit? That is trillion with a T. And that is even after  taking into account any effects from economic growth.   Give me a break.   Madam Speaker, the question before us today is this: Will the United  States of America pay its bills?   I wish that were hyperbole.   We always have. The United States has never defaulted. Never, ever  defaulted, not once.   But the actions of my friends on the other side have made the world  seriously wonder about the full faith and credit of this Nation.   Raising the debt ceiling has traditionally been something that both  parties have agreed to, no matter who controlled Congress or who sat in  the White House.   I have been in Congress more than 20 years now. I voted to raise the  debt ceiling when I was in the majority, and I voted to raise the debt  ceiling when I was in the minority. I voted to raise it under  Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents, and I cast those votes  even when I vehemently disagreed with our spending decisions.   I opposed the Republican tax cut for the wealthy and large  corporations that passed under the last administration. I still think  it is awful, awful, awful policy; but I still, nevertheless, voted to  raise the debt ceiling under the prior administration because  regardless whether we win or lose on policy here, defaulting on our  debt would lead to economic catastrophe on a global scale.                                time  1230    Unemployment would rise; the stock market would crater; interest  rates would skyrocket; imports would become more expensive; and  inflation would increase.   We are not talking about a scenario that only impacts wealthy  investors or large corporations. Every single American would be hurt,  everyone with a pension or a retirement account, everyone with a small  business, everyone with a car or home loan, and everyone who walks into  a store, whether they are buying groceries or the latest  [[Page H5519]]  smartphone. Our country would be thrown into a recession virtually  overnight.   This is the type of disaster that Republicans are flirting with here,  Madam Speaker. They are not refusing to raise the debt ceiling to try  to prevent President Biden's agenda in the future. This isn't about the  bipartisan transportation bill or reconciliation bill, which we have  yet to consider, because raising the debt ceiling only pays for the  prior debts that we have already racked up. We are talking about the  spending Republicans voted for under President Trump.   They ballooned the deficit, and now they are trying to wash their  hands of the consequences. It is like going to a restaurant, eating a  meal, and refusing to pay the tab when the waiter brings the bill. Only  here, they risk bringing down the entire global economy.   All because of what? They are upset that their party doesn't control  Congress. Give me a break. We are talking about people's livelihoods  here.   Earlier this week, Senate Republicans filibustered a continuing  resolution that would have lifted the debt ceiling. Every day  Republicans waste playing political games brings us one day closer to a  default, one day closer to catastrophe.   I have heard the Senate minority leader and others suggest that  reconciliation is some kind of panacea that will allow us to raise the  debt ceiling easily and in a partisan way. Well, let me remind them  that there are challenges with that, and it will take time, time that  we do not have.   Just yesterday, the Treasury Secretary said that we are likely to hit  the debt limit on October 18, just days from now.   We have had a lot of fights on this floor. Congress has been a little  dysfunctional from time to time. But let me repeat, the United States  of America has never defaulted in its more than 200-year history. Not  once.   Republicans are playing with fire here. We need cooler heads to  prevail. The underlying bill is that chance. It is an opportunity to  raise the debt ceiling in a clean way, the kind of approach that would  have passed overwhelmingly on suspension a few years ago.   We need to get this done, Madam Speaker. We don't have a moment to  spare. Economists estimate that defaulting on our debts even for just a  few hours could cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over the  next decade.   After all that we have done to bring our Nation through the COVID  pandemic, that is a hit that we can't afford, Madam Speaker.   So, to my friends on the other side, I get it. You are not going to  vote for this even though 97 percent of what is necessitating us to  raise the debt ceiling was accumulated before President Biden even took  office. Much of it was racked up under President Trump on your watch  when you controlled the Congress.   Still, you are not going to vote to do the responsible thing here.  That is crystal clear. But please get out of the way and tell all your  friends in the Senate to get out of the way, too.   Let us pass this. Let us do the responsible thing.   We will do it with a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate.  We are good at cleaning up your mess.   Let's pass this rule and the underlying legislation. Let's step back  from the brink. Let's prevent an avoidable economic meltdown. And let's  do what America has always done: pay its bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me say this, and let me preface my remarks by saying I love the  gentleman from Oklahoma. He is one of my favorite people here in the  Congress. But I would remind him that when the Republicans passed their  expensive tax cut for the rich, for the very wealthy, for big  corporations, they didn't work with us. They just shoved it through. As  I mentioned earlier, CBO tells us that the addition to our debt is  close to $2 trillion, and that is after taking into account any  potential benefits from growth.   I didn't like that policy. I still don't like that policy. I think  the rich already get enough, and I think big corporations get too much  in this country. But nonetheless, my view did not prevail.   Then, when we had to vote on the debt ceiling, the issue was: Do we  pay our bills?   Now, this is a quote from the distinguished Minority Leader Kevin  McCarthy. Let me read it. He says: ``When the United States makes  promises, it keeps them, which is why the House voted today to avoid  the threat of a debt default.''    That was several years ago, but he is right. When the United States  makes promises, it keeps them. I didn't think that was a partisan  issue. I didn't think that that was controversial.   But, look, here we are in Washington. Everything is a political  fight. I mean, that is the way this place seems to work nowadays. And I  get it. I am not even asking Republicans to vote with us to raise the  debt ceiling anymore. I mean, it is just a hopeless cause. They have  made a political decision. I get it. So, we are not asking for your  support. What we are asking for is for you to get out of the way.   In the Senate, Democrats are prepared to carry the burden and raise  the debt ceiling to make sure we pay bills, 97 percent of which were  accumulated before Joe Biden was President. We are still paying for the  Trump tax cuts.   We will do it. We will clean up the mess. What we are asking for is  for you to get out of the way. Yet, we have Senators now threatening to  use the filibuster to try to derail this, to put one hurdle after  another after another.   They said they wanted Democrats to bear the burden. Democrats will do  it. We always do. We are good at cleaning up messes that are left for  us by our Republican friends. But get out of the way. Get out of the  way, and let us do what the American people expect us to do, and that  is to pay our bills.   Let me say one other thing. Everybody keeps telling me--and I heard  this on the Rules Committee, too--the bipartisan infrastructure bill  and the reconciliation, unless I missed something, we haven't passed  either one of them yet. I mean, hopefully, we will, but those are  things we are going to do in the future.   By the way, on the reconciliation bill, we are doing something that  my Republican friends refused to do on their tax cut bill, and that is  we are paying for it. So, we understood the issue of the debt, I guess,  long before they did. At least we are more consistent than my  Republican friends are.   In any event, I would just again say to my friends, we are not even  asking you to vote for this anymore because that is a hopeless cause at  this point. We are just asking you to get out of the way so we can get  this done.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, we are talking about whether or not the  United States of America will pay its bills and not default. I mean,  that is what this is about. And we could talk about this, but with all  due respect to the gentlewoman from Iowa, if we want to solve this  pandemic, it begins at home.   She represents a State where just maybe a little more than 50 percent  are vaccinated.   Go home and tell your people to get vaccinated.   It is the unvaccinated in this country that are filling up our  emergency rooms, that are allowing this disease to be able to mutate.   So there's that old saying, ``physician, heal thyself,'' and to hear  this from a party that embraces the conspiracy theories that are out  there that are discouraging people from getting vaccinated. But I would  encourage the gentlewoman--we can talk about this at another time--but  in the meantime, Iowa needs to do better, as well as many other States  in this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we are on the edge of default, on the edge of  catastrophe, and this is the response from my Republican friends.   Madam Speaker, yes, I have nothing but the highest respect for the  gentlewoman from Iowa, but I just pointed out that a little over 50  percent of her State is vaccinated. That is not good. And the  gentlewoman from Tennessee who just spoke, her State is even worse-- something like 45 percent are fully vaccinated. That is dangerous for  not only the people of Iowa and Tennessee, but for the people of this  country.   Doctor after doctor after doctor have told us that this is spreading  because of the lack of attention to getting people vaccinated in this  country. So we need to do better.   What we are talking about here today is whether or not we are going  to default, whether we are going to court a catastrophe.   Madam Speaker, I will say to the gentleman from Oklahoma, he went  through a list of people who voted against raising the debt ceiling in  the past. I am willing to bet that many of those were attached to  policy items where there was an objection.   I don't recall Democrats threatening to filibuster--threatening to  filibuster--raising the debt ceiling. And yet, that is what Republicans  are doing, cheered on by Republicans in the House.   So, look, we are happy to clean up your mess. We are happy to do the  right thing. All Democrats will vote for it in the House. I am not  asking anymore for you to join us because it is a waste of my breath.   But what we are asking you to do is get out of the way so that  something really horrible doesn't happen in this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I just want to point out for the record  that in Texas only 51 percent of the population is fully vaccinated.  That is better than Tennessee, but still that means half the  population.   Madam Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I merely point out that we have a lot of  work to do in this country to be able to control the virus.   Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to Speaker  Pelosi from Janet Yellen, who is the Secretary of the Treasury.                                     Department of the Treasury,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker: I am writing to follow up on my       previous letters regarding the debt limit and to provide       additional information regarding the Department of the       Treasury's ability to continue to finance the operations of       the U.S. government.        In my September 8 letter, I explained that Treasury's cash       and extraordinary measures would most likely be exhausted       sometime during the month of October. Based on our most       recent information, including tax payments associated with       the September 15 deadline for third quarter estimated tax       payments for businesses and individuals, I am now able to       further refine that projection.        We now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its       extraordinary measures if Congress has not acted to raise or       suspend the debt limit by October 18. At that point, we       expect Treasury would be left with very limited resources       that would be depleted quickly. It is uncertain whether we       could continue to meet all the nation's commitments after       that date. While this is our best estimate, the federal       government's cash flows are subject to unavoidable       variability. For example, the government's daily gross cash       flow (excluding financing) over the past year averages nearly       $50 billion per day and has exceeded $300 billion. As a       result, it is important to remember that estimates regarding       how long our remaining extraordinary measures and cash may       last can unpredictably shift forward or backward. This       uncertainty underscores the critical importance of not       waiting to raise or suspend the debt limit. The full faith       and credit of the United States should not be put at risk.        Furthermore, we know from previous debt limit impasses that       waiting until the last minute can cause serious harm to       business and consumer confidence, raise borrowing costs for       taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the       United States for years to come. Failure to act promptly       could also result in substantial disruptions to financial       markets, as heightened uncertainty can exacerbate volatility       and erode investor confidence.        I am also writing to notify you, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.       8348(1)(2), of my determination  [[Page H5523]]       that, by reason of the statutory debt limit, I will continue       to be unable to fully invest the portion of the Civil Service       Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) not immediately       required to pay beneficiaries, and that a ``debt issuance       suspension period,'' previously determined to end on       September 30, 2021, will continue through October 18, 2021.       As a result, the Treasury Department will continue to suspend       additional investments of amounts credited to, and will       redeem an additional portion of the investment held by, the       CSRDF, as authorized by law.        In addition, because the Postal Accountability and       Enhancement Act of 2006 provides that investments in the       Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (PSRHBF) shall be       made in the same manner as investments for the CSRDF, the       Treasury Department will also continue to suspend additional       investments of amounts credited to, and will redeem an       additional portion of the investments held by, the PSRHBF. By       law, the CSRDF and PSRHBF will be made whole once the debt       limit is increased or suspended. Federal retirees and       employees will be unaffected by these actions.        Again, I respectfully urge Congress to protect the full       faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as       possible.            Sincerely,                                                   Janet L. Yellen.     Madam Speaker, let me quote from the letter. It says:  ``We know from previous debt limit impasses that waiting until the last  minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence,  raise borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit  rating of the United States for years to come. Failure to act promptly  could also result in substantial disruptions to financial markets, as  heightened uncertainly can exacerbate volatility and erode investor  confidence.''   We are not asking you to do anything more other than to just step out  of the way. We will do the serious business of making sure that we  don't default on our financial obligations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me remind my colleagues that Mitch McConnell led  three efforts to increase the debt limit under President Trump. He has  voted over 30 times to increase the debt limit by over $20 trillion  during his career.   He worked with President Obama in 2015, saying then: I made it very  clear that after the November election we are certainly not going to  shut down the government or default on the national debt. We will  figure some way to handle that. What is different now? Not a thing.  Nothing.   He did the right thing then. He is simply unwilling to do the right  thing today. Instead, he is making up new precedent out of whole cloth,  the impacts of which would be devastating.   So this is not just about Senator McConnell, every Republican in the  House and Senate should do the right thing and raise the debt ceiling.   It has never been the responsibility of just one party to ensure that  America pays its bills. And to pretend otherwise, is to blindly be  following a policy that will send our economy off a cliff.   Madam Speaker, I just have to say to my Republican friends, stop  doubling down on the insanity. At some point we all have to act like  grownups around here and get the people's business done. Too many of my  friends on the other side of the aisle continue to get on one knee and  genuflect in front of the altar of Donald Trump and all the stuff that  goes with that. Well, you know what, it is time that we all act like  serious legislators.   We have a discussion on immigration and COVID testing, we ought to  have that discussion in a different context, not on the debt ceiling  bill.   I will again say to my colleagues, I don't even know how many Members  of the Republican Conference are vaccinated. We have people who come  here and fight against efforts to get everybody vaccinated, who fight  against communities that want to encourage people to wear masks in  order to protect the citizens of that community.   We are here to legislate. This bill will fulfill one of the most  basic responsibilities Congress has; that is, to ensure that America  pays its bills. We always have, Madam Speaker.   And, you know, to try to make this debate into a debate about  reconciliation--by the way, which we want to pay for as much of it as  possible so it won't add to the deficit and the debt. That is a future  debate.   This is about paying all the bills that were accumulated; 97 percent  of which was accumulated, not under Joe Biden, but under his  predecessor. Stuff that my friends on the other side of the aisle voted  for. And to turn this into a political football about what might happen  down the road is really ridiculous. It is dangerous. It is reckless.   My friends have said that they want Democrats to basically carry  these bills. Happy to do it. On our side nobody wants to default. On  our side we all understand the consequences. Mark Zandi, an economist  for Moody's, said that it would be such a catastrophe if we defaulted  on our debt. He said it would impact generations and generations and  generations into the future.   Every economist, no matter what their political affiliation may be,  has said the same thing. So we have to do this.   And, again, to try to make this about something else is just trying  to avoid dealing with reality. I would say to my colleagues, all we are  asking for now--we are no longer asking for your vote--you know, that  is a waste of time at this particular point. I have seen all the press  releases. I have seen the talking points come out of the RCCC and the  RNC. It is maddening to see how this issue can be so distorted. We are  not asking for that anymore. You already decided to make this a  political issue.   We are just asking you to get the hell out of the way and to allow us  to keep this government running on track and not in default. That  should not be a controversial issue. It should not be an issue that  people walk away from. When you accumulate bills, you got to pay for  them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule so we can  prevent a completely avoidable economic meltdown.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:  [[Page H5524]]                          Amendment to House Resolution 688    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 1897) to require a diagnostic test for COVID-19       for an inadmissible alien released from the custody of the       United States Customs and Border Protection or the United       States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1897.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time to take from the Speaker's table the bill H.R. 5305,  with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,  without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the  chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee that the House  concur in the Senate amendment; that the Senate amendment and the  motion be considered as read; that the motion be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective designees; and  that the previous question be considered as ordered on the motion to  adoption without intervening motion.
