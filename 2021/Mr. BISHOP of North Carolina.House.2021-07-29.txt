 Madam Speaker, today I rise to  recognize former U.S. Representative Sue Myrick who has a landmark  birthday this Sunday.   Congresswoman Myrick served the people of North Carolina's Ninth  Congressional District from 1995 to 2013. Before that, Sue made history  in 1987 when she scored a major upset against a two-term Democrat to  become the first female mayor of Charlotte. Importantly, before  politics, Sue was known for her faith life as a Sunday school teacher  and private sector career as an advertising executive.   In Congress for the Ninth District, Sue was a notable and effective  conservative chairing the Republican Study Committee. Protecting  America from foreign threats and securing our border defined her  congressional career. As important, she was and is kind and caring, and  she provided legendary constituent service. I am honored to serve in  her place today and fondly remember her campaign slogan: We need Sue  Myrick in Congress because ``Sue Myrick gets things done.''   Happy birthday to Sue.                            ____________________
