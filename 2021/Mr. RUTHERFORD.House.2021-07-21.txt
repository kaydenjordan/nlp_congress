 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my concerns for  the crisis we are seeing at the southern border and the obvious  unwillingness of the Biden-Harris administration to provide solutions.   Illegal border crossings are at their highest level in two decades.  Yet, this administration not only won't address it; they actually  exacerbate it because they cut the CBP budget over $900 million.   In June alone, border agents actually encountered over 188,000 people  at our southern border. Madam Speaker, that is a 450 percent increase  over last June.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration created this invasion, this  border crisis. This year alone, over 80,000 kids have crossed the  border, with 15,000 remaining in government custody.   Fixing the crisis at the border requires an investment in manpower,  infrastructure, technology, and strong policy. That is why I asked this  body to plus-up $300 million in next year's budget for Operation  Stonegarden, to reimburse border States like Texas that are actually  stepping up at the State level to provide security for their  constituents.   We must finish the wall, reinstate the remain in Mexico policy, and  never bring back catch and release, which the Biden administration is  rumored to be bringing back in the coming months.   A strong America begins and ends with a strong, safe, and secure  border.
