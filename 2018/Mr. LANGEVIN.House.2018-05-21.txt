 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on  Foster Youth, I rise to recognize May as National Foster Care Month and  to acknowledge the 437,000 foster youth across the country.   On Wednesday, I will be joined by Yolanda Washburn, a former foster  youth from Providence, Rhode Island. Yolanda is a vocal advocate for  children in care. She is committed to making positive change, and she  is on track to become a counselor.   As someone who has aged out of foster care, Yolanda has overcome  immense odds to find such success. I look forward to hearing her  recommendations for improving the foster care system. No one  understands the system better than those who have lived in it.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my good friend, Congresswoman  Bass, for organizing Shadow Day again this year and for her tireless  work as the leader of our caucus. I am thrilled by this opportunity to  amplify her voice and the voices of foster youth everywhere.                            ____________________
