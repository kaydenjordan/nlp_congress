 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House, for the purpose of  inquiring as to the schedule for next week.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate  the update on the schedule.   Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman, we have been  getting a number of concerns expressed from Members on our side--and I  would imagine on the gentleman's side as well--about the erratic floor  schedule, the changes that have occurred. This week, we were supposed  to be here Tuesday to Friday. It was changed to Monday to Thursday.  Next week, initially, the calendar showed that it was a week for  Members to be in their districts.   Madam Speaker, we all have challenges in our districts. There are  small businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Many Members are  working with their local school boards to try to encourage schools to  reopen. And all the other challenges that people have, whether it is  trying to get water or spread distribution of the vaccine, as they set  those meetings in their districts, when the floor schedule changes  here, it disrupts their ability to properly represent their districts.   I know the schedule is laid out for the year for a reason, so that  Members can manage both the schedule here--and we all represent 750,000  people, roughly, back home--and the ability to properly meet with and  represent constituents who aren't even allowed to come to this Capitol  to meet with us, so we want to go meet with them back home. It is hard  to do that when the schedule continues to change.   If the gentleman would address the concerns that have been raised,  rightfully so, about those erratic changes, I yield to the gentleman  from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland.   I appreciate the acknowledgment about the concerns and the  disruptions of schedules as Members try to meet the needs of their  constituents back home, as well as doing the work up here. Clearly,  getting our work done is the first and most important priority to  addressing those needs.   Hopefully, as we look toward our return after we come back in April,  the appropriations process will begin. We would surely like to see us  get back to a more regular order for doing appropriations bills, where  we can have bills  [[Page H1335]]  go through committee, go through a markup process, with bipartisan  input, which we haven't seen, but, ultimately, be able to bring those  bills to the floor with a typical, traditional amendment process.   Madam Speaker, I know the gentleman is well aware of this.  Historically, when appropriations bills come to the floor, there are  many amendments. Sometimes, it is a completely wide-open amendment  process, which we would surely encourage.   I know many of those years when we were in the majority and bills  would come to the floor that were appropriations, a Member literally  could write their amendment on a piece of paper and turn it in and that  amendment would be debated and voted on, on the House floor. Sometimes,  you would see over 100 amendments on a single appropriations bill,  which are all important and should be debated, so we would go to 2- minute votes.   The question I would have is, now that we have seen--from reports I  have seen, and maybe you have too--that roughly 75 percent of all  Members in this House have had a vaccination for COVID-19, there is a  strong desire to get back to a regular floor schedule here on the  floor, where we are conducting our business and have the ability to  interact with each other as colleagues.   It is a much different experience than when people have to trickle  in, trickle out, limiting the number of people, the ability to debate  things, 45-minute votes for every bill. If you have 100 amendments on a  bill, this House can't function at 45 minutes per vote. To get back to  a 15-minute, 5-minute, and 2-minute voting schedule--again, CDC  guidance just came out this week, saying if someone is vaccinated, they  don't even have to have a mask to be around other people.   The Senate doesn't require masks on their floor. There is no reason  why we would have to have a mask to have this conversation. The  President of the United States doesn't wear a mask when he is giving  speeches, or his Press Secretary when she is meeting with the press.   Can we get back to a regular floor operating schedule where we can  meet as colleagues in person? If somebody doesn't want to be around  others, maybe a voting station can be set up. But for anybody else who  wants to interact following CDC guidance, recognizing the vaccination  rate, and getting back to the ability to have a voting schedule that  allows us to conduct business the way we are going to need to when we  start taking up those appropriations bills, I would ask the gentleman  if he has a plan for that, if he could lay that out.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I hope the gentleman is not suggesting  that it would take a 100 percent vaccination rate. I know with the rest  of the country, when States make decisions to reopen, when CDC issues  guidance, I have never seen any guidance that said 100 percent  vaccination is the standard for bringing something back.    Madam Speaker, I would yield because I would suggest  that if we are at 75 percent now, you also have Members who have  antibodies, who may have had COVID months ago and who have even taken  the test that shows they have antibodies. Whether they have taken the  vaccine or not, the antibodies can fight off COVID.                                time  1245    But at 75 percent, is there a number higher than that that the  gentleman is setting as a standard?   I would hope it wouldn't be 100, but I would also hope we could have  a conversation together to work through what that standard should be so  we can get to a place where we have a normal operating process both in  the House and in committees.   The committee work being done virtually is a true disservice to the  ability for us to collegially work on issues. Many of our committees  deal with not the high-profile issues that are the battleground issues  where we are on our own sides, but in many cases it is where one sees  the kind of collegiality where Congress can come together and work, and  that isn't happening either.   I would hope we could come up with a standard that is not 100  percent. If we are at 75, then it has got to be somewhere at a  different place to get back to a House floor functioning schedule, as  well as a committee structure.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I appreciate the gentleman's offer to work. Obviously,  when one looks at the way the Senate operates, they have said that to  speak, especially, you don't need to wear a mask.   I don't see the science that would say that the gentleman and I have  to wear masks to have this conversation.  [[Page H1336]]  Again, I would direct my friend to when the President is giving a  speech, he is not wearing a mask. If there are other people around,  then they might be wearing a mask; but when they speak, they take off  their mask. Just look at those protocols as well and just try to inject  some of those commonsense measures to try to get back to doing our job.   One final point, I hope, again, we would all want everyone who has  the interest in getting the vaccine to have access to the vaccine. But  if one Member out of 435 felt they didn't want to have the vaccine,  then I would hope that wouldn't be enough to prohibit the rest of us  from carrying out more normal functions on the House floor and in  committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    If maybe a requirement of a test once a week when we  come in or something like that would help get us to a better place  where we can have in-person, on the floor, and in-committee processes  and meetings--the testing capability is now there in the Attending  Physician's office. If it needs to be widened more, I know there are  other rooms that are doing some of the testing--then that would be a  suggestion, I think, worth us discussing if it helps us get back to a  more functioning Congress, especially a more functioning House on the  floor and in committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate that.   Again, hopefully, this is a discussion that we can all have, not just  the majority making this decision, but the majority working with the  minority.   We have an active group of Members who are medical doctors, the  Doctors Caucus, who have a lot of good suggestions. I think they are  going to try to meet with the House Attending Physician. Hopefully,  that can spur some additional ideas about how we can do this, and then  have us work together to achieve that.    Finally, on the House committee schedule especially, we have taken up  14 different rules bills this Congress so far, bills that have actually  come to the floor under a rule. Unfortunately, only one of those bills  actually went to committee. Meaning, 13 of the 14 bills never even went  to committee to have the debate in the openness and the transparency  that this Congress deserves.   I think that millions of people across the country would expect that  we would be having--as we are shaping policy, that it is not just a  one-sided approach. That if a socialist agenda is being pushed by one  side, then can't the other side at least have that discussion in a  committee process and offer amendments?   The amendment process is critically important, and that has been lost  too often--even the $1.9 trillion spending bill that over 90 percent of  which had nothing to do with health needs and not a dime of which was  dedicated to safely reopening schools, which is a huge cry amongst  millions of parents across the country.   Madam Speaker, not only on one side, but, frankly, nobody on the  majority side was even allowed to offer an amendment. A $1.9 trillion  spending bill, probably the largest bill that has come through Congress  in the history of our country, and not a single amendment, Democrat or  Republican, was allowed in the House on that bill to be brought  forward.   We were able to bring some amendments in committee. Every one of them  was voted down or removed. Not one Democrat that I saw was even allowed  to bring an amendment up in committee on a $1.9 trillion bill.   That is a major concern. It is a concern that denies the people's  House from being able to express the will of the people when we have  ideas and suggestions maybe, for example, as we wanted to in the House  to say: Should a felon who is in a prison be able to get a $1,400  check?   We weren't even able to bring that amendment up for debate.   Can we at least require that schools reopen?   If hundreds of billions of new dollars are going to go to schools,  shouldn't the requirement be that they use that following the CDC  guidance and following the science that is widespread that says the  schools should be open and that long-term damage is being done to kids  by not being in the classroom?   Millions and millions of kids--maybe over 60 percent of the children  in America--are not getting daily in-the-classroom learning. Unions are  more concerned, saying: You can go to spring break if you are a union  member, but just don't post pictures because we don't want anybody to  see it--when they should be in the classroom teaching our kids.   That debate never got to happen here on the House floor and, frankly,  in most of the committees. Because these bills aren't going through  committee. And that one bill went through committee with the order  clearly given not to allow a single amendment. Not a single amendment  in the House was added to a $1.9 trillion spending bill.   I am sure some people might think that was the perfect bill, that  there was not a single change. But sometimes the smallest bill has a  change made that makes it a better bill, but not that bill. That kind  of closed process is not who we should be as a House.   Madam Speaker, 13 out of 14 bills didn't even go through committee,  and the one that did--the $1.9 trillion bill--not a single amendment by  a Republican or Democrat in the House was allowed to be added. I hope  that is not the standard. It is surely not reflective of what this  House should be doing.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, when you look at the bill that passed  yesterday, the only bipartisan vote was against the bill. Every  Republican--in fact, a Democrat voted against it as well. You had two  Democrats who voted against it originally when it came through the  House the first time.   But the bottom line is, it was the majority party and President Biden  who chose to go it alone, who chose to have a closed process where  Republicans were shut out.   There were many efforts, including a number of Senators going to the  White House to meet with the President, who offered ideas, and every  one of those ideas was thrown in the trash can. That is not a unity  message. That is not trying to work with people from all parties and  all walks of life to come up with the best ideas.   It was a go-it-alone socialist agenda, very little focused on COVID;  $1.9 trillion, over 90 percent of which wasn't dedicated to healthcare.   You want to talk about schools. There was not a single dime in that  bill that requires schools to reopen. You look at the money for  schools, and hundreds of billions of dollars, by the way, are already  out there that aren't spent, hundreds of billions that we all worked on  together.   When President Trump said he wanted to work with Republicans and  Democrats, he actually followed through on that promise, as the  gentleman noted, and every CARES Act bill was a very bipartisan bill.  That was an effort made on both sides to work together and they were  targeted. It was targeted on helping families who were struggling or  helping small businesses who were struggling; on getting money into the  search for a vaccine.   Operation Warp Speed should be something we all celebrate, where  President Trump said he wants to put all the focus at FDA on not only  finding a vaccine, but prefunding the manufacturing of the vaccinations  even before FDA approves them so we don't have to wait an extra few  months that we don't have. That is why we are at a point where we can  have 100 million vaccinations. We tried to double that number in this  bill. That amendment was voted down.   But on schools, my colleague, Ashley Hinson, had a bill to say, let's  say if the schools are going to get new money--which they already have  enough money to fortify their schools to reopen safely. Many took us up  on that and are open in the classroom today. Some have chosen not to,  but not for a lack of money. Let's be very clear about that.   In fact, 95 percent of the money for schools in the bill that was  passed yesterday can't even be spent this year; 95 percent of it. Then  you have hundreds of billions of dollars still unspent that can be used  to reopen schools who want to get back in the classroom, that money is  already there. That money did not require--that need did not get met  yesterday. That need was already met by Congress.   Some chose to do it. Some have chosen not to reopen, even though not  only is the money there to reopen, but the science is there. The  science lays out not only how to safely reopen, but it points out the  devastating damage being done to children in this country by not  reopening.   So when the gentleman talks about polls and, well, the polling says  this bill is really popular. Hey, do you want a check for $3,500? I am  sure a lot of people would say yes, until they realize that $350  billion of this money goes to bail out failed States. And a State like  California, who has a $10-plus-billion surplus, is going to get over  $40 billion.   So I am sure if we asked a poll question to people across this  country: Do you think it is right to borrow $1.9 trillion from our  children? Because somebody is going to have to pay for this. This money  didn't fall out of the sky. Is it right to borrow $1.9 trillion from  our children to give California $41 billion when they currently have a  $10 billion surplus? I think we would get a different answer than the  70 percent saying yes.   If you said, in this bill, which we tried to correct, every felon in  prison today in America will get a $1,400 check from the taxpayers.  That is in the bill.   They tried to take it out in the Senate when they allowed them on the  floor to bring an amendment. Not a single amendment was allowed on this  House floor to fix those kinds of disparities.   Every Democrat in the Senate voted ``no.'' They said continue to give  $1,400 checks to prisoners, felons in prison, when we are already  paying for their food, for their lodging, for their healthcare. Now  they are going to get a $1,400 check from the taxpayers of this  country, borrowed from our children.  [[Page H1338]]    Do most Americans know that? I hope they do because when we then ask  them the question later: Now that you know what is really in the bill,  what do you think about it? When you recognize some of the other ideas  that were brought forward, not only to reopen schools, but to target  the money, to focus on helping small businesses, those were the things  that we wanted to do, trying to put some guardrails and limitations in  place, like the previous CARES Act bills did, which is why they were  all bipartisan.   But when you look at these expenditures, and then you recognize that  there is no money requiring schools to reopen. But our border is wide  open right now and if someone comes over legally, they will get a  check. That is a concern to a lot of people.   So, yes, look at the bill. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it did go  through committee. It did have markups and hearings. And, in fact, it  yielded a great benefit to every American. Every income group benefited  from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And, as the gentleman knows, the income  group level that benefited the most by us cutting taxes were the lowest  income, because we rebuilt our middle class because of that bill. We  made America competitive because of that bill.   And in this bill that passed yesterday, with a bipartisan vote  against it, there was tucked away language that prohibits States from  cutting taxes. Explain what that has to do with COVID.   If you are a State, every State will get money from that bill. Again,  California gets over $40 billion, even though they have a $10 billion  surplus. But if a State tries to cut taxes, they actually get penalized  in the bill. People are aghast when they hear that. It just came out  yesterday.   What does that have to do with COVID?   Why wasn't this a targeted relief bill? It was because one side  wanted to close the process out and just go it alone and push a  socialist agenda that has nothing to do, or little to do, with COVID  relief.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, it is worth doing. Again, that is why you  had a number of Republican Senators go to the White House to offer that  olive branch. They were turned down, and that is unfortunate.   On this bill, clearly it wasn't just Republicans who voted against  it. It was a bipartisan vote in opposition. I hope that is not the  model. And that was the point.   Thirteen of 14 bills have come to the floor under a rule so far;  didn't even go through committee. Let's get back to that collegiality.  Let's get back to bringing bills to committee, having the committees  actually work in person so Members can have the ability to have those  conversations and come and find common ground, which has happened in  the past, and it surely can happen again now. I hope we can get to that  point soon.   I yield to the gentleman to add anything else.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
