 Mr. Speaker, we already knew, from their daily  attacks, that the media disdained the President. What we didn't know  with a certainty, until last week, was that the media also disdained  the American family.   How else to explain their front-paging and televising, at all hours,  a four-letter expletive that would be seen by children across America?   CNN reportedly used the word 195 times in one day. Sad.   There was a time when the media would show some respect for family  values, but no more. Words that might have been omitted or not spelled  out are now broadcast in their entirety. That is the media's decision  to make, but it is a poor decision for the American family.                            ____________________
