 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the floor of the  House of Representatives to discuss the need for TRICARE beneficiaries  to have access to quality healthcare.   I thank Mr. Buddy Carter, my friend from Georgia, for his leadership  on this important issue.   The military population in my home district of Colorado Springs is  well over 100,000 people. It includes Active-Duty, National Guard,  Reserves, retirees, and veterans, including their families and  dependents, the number of TRICARE beneficiaries in my district is  substantial.   The impact of Express Scripts cutting the number of in-network  pharmacies and reducing reimbursements has been felt in Colorado  Springs.   I have heard from constituents who have had trouble finding quality  pharmacies for their prescriptions and who are faced with increasingly  long wait times, decreased hours of service, and unscheduled closures.   Additionally, beneficiaries in my district have had to change their  pharmacy numerous times as TRICARE rates continually fluctuate.   The process of finding a new pharmacy takes up a substantial amount  of time and beneficiaries ultimately cannot reliably depend on a  pharmacy to consistently deliver their necessary medicine.   The men and women serving in our military, retirees and their  families who serve alongside them, deserve more options for their  healthcare, not less.   Access to quality, accessible, reliable pharmacies should not be  something that our military families have to worry about.   I urge the Defense Health Agency and Express Scripts to carefully  consider the impact these recent changes have made on military families  and to make the changes necessary to facilitate increased pharmacy  access and availability to beneficiaries of the TRICARE network.
