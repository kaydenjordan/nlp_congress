 Thank you, Senator, and if I may congratulate the  junior Senator from South Carolina on the spectacular win that Clemson  had and also congratulate him about being so true to the spirit of  civility he discussed and not trash-talking the other team involved.   It was a truly splendid victory between two extraordinarily talented  and capable teams, and I congratulate the Senator.    Gladly.    Thank you, Mr. President, and happy new year. The new  116th Congress brings new hope for the Senate to face up to the clear  and present danger of climate change. The House of Representatives  being in Democratic hands augments that hope.   The Senate Republican majority has failed to address climate change.  This is no accident. This is the Senate in the Citizens United era. I  was here before Citizens United, and for years we saw Senate climate  bipartisanship, before Citizens United. After Citizens United, what we  see is immensely powerful climate-denying, dark-money front groups for  the fossil fuel industry, all likely funded by fossil fuel interests,  and we see no Republican Senator willing to cross them. The spending  they do in politics--and the more silent threat of spending--is a  blockade. It reeks.   Here is a case study on how dark and unlimited money play in Senate  elections. In 2016, in Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin, three Democratic  Senate candidates stood a good early chance of winning Republican-held  seats in 2016. All were solid, experienced candidates who had been  Senators before. All were ahead in early polling. Then the big  influencers came in hard, launching attack ads, in some cases, well  more than 1 year before the election. It is a little like strafing the  other side's planes while they are still on the airfield.   The pile-on of so-called outside group spending against these three  candidates came to almost $70 million. All three ultimately lost their  races, and their losses meant Republicans kept majority control of this  Chamber.   Let's look at that $70 million that acquired the continued Republican  majority control of this Chamber. Of that $70 million, only about $11  million came from donors and PACs that appear unconnected to the fossil  fuel industry. At least two-thirds of that outside spending--more than  $46 million--can be directly traced to groups that received significant  funding from fossil energy, and $12 million, the remainder of that 70,  came through dark money channels. In this day and age in America,  powerful influencers can obscure their identities by running their  political spending through these dark money channels so it is  impossible for us to know whether or how much of this remaining $12  million was from polluter dollars--fossil fuel dollars. I strongly  suspect all of it was. In any event, when one industry can deliver that  kind of political artillery, the vast majority of a $70 million barrage  against three specific candidates, that gives that industry remarkable  political power with the side that is advantaged--climate action  stopping political power, it would seem.   As the mounting effects of climate change have grown ever more dire  and the scientific understanding has grown ever more clear, what has  the Senate done? Nothing. Let's look at what we learned and what we  witnessed and what we failed to do in 2018.   Mr. President, 2018 saw the release of two landmark climate science  reports--one from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the  effects of warming 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and  the second, the Trump administration's own ``National Climate  Assessment.'' Together, these reports delivered the starkest warning on  climate change to date. Damage from climate change is already  occurring. Economies are now at risk, and we are almost out of time to  prevent the worst consequences.   The IPCC report told us that accounting for the costs of carbon  pollution by charging a price for carbon emissions is the ``central''  policy that will allow us to hold the global temperature increase to  1.5 degrees Celsius or less. Even this dire endorsement was not enough  to move a single Republican colleague to join a bill to establish a  carbon fee.   More telling was the spectacle of the Trump administration's  ``National Climate Assessment.'' This report, written by 13 Federal  Agencies, described the monumental damage the United States is facing  from climate change, flatly contradicting the climate denial assertions  of the President and his fossil fuel-flunky Cabinet. The administration  tried to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday during the  Thanksgiving holiday. That cynical move happily backfired, with more  than 140 newspapers around the country featuring the report's stark  findings on front pages and Google searches for ``climate change''  hitting their highest level for the year.   Tellingly, the fossil fuel industry and its bevy of stooges in the  Trump administration did not contest the science in the report--an  admission by inaction that they know their science denial campaign is  phony. They know the real science is irrefutable. It is better to hide  from it.   Unfortunately, we witnessed the irrefutable contribution of climate  change to the most devastating natural disasters of 2018.   ``Irrefutable,'' by the way, is one way to describe climate science.  Another way to describe it is ``incontrovertible.'' The description of  climate science as ``incontrovertible'' was published in a New York  Times full-page advertisement in 2009 that was signed by, among others,  Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, and the  Trump Organization. How things change.   Anyway, out West, wildfires in California broke records. The  Mendocino Complex Fire in July and August was the largest in the  State's recorded history. The Camp Fire--this photograph--was the  deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, killing  86 people. Scientists linked California's increasing wildfires to  climate change, estimating the area burned by wildfires across the  Western United States since 1984 at twice what would have burned  without the human-driven changes.   Michael Mann, the professor of atmospheric science at Penn State  University, told PBS recently:         It's not rocket science. . . . You warm the planet, you're       going to get more frequent and intense heat waves. You warm       the soils, you dry them out, you get worse drought. You bring       all that together, and those are all the ingredients for       unprecedented wildfires.    Mr. President, 2018 saw the east coast slammed by hurricanes that  were supercharged by warming oceans. Hurricanes gain strength from heat  energy in the oceans they pass over. Warmer oceans also evaporate more  water up into the storms, generating more storm rainfall. So stronger  and wetter storms then ride ashore on higher and warmer seas and push  larger storm surges ahead of them.   Hurricane Florence intensified over water 1 to 2 degrees Celsius  above average and dumped record rainfall and flooding on the Carolinas.  Preliminary analysis suggests that its rainfall was more than 50  percent higher due to climate change.   When Hurricane Michael hit Florida, it passed over water 2 to 3  degrees Celsius warmer than average. Passing over that heat, its winds  spun up by 80 miles per hour in just 48 hours, becoming the strongest  storm ever to make an October landfall in the United States and almost  completely flattening the town of Mexico Beach, FL.   Scientists are increasingly able to identify the role of climate  change in extreme weather. The American Meteorological Society reported  in December that 15 extreme weather events in 2017 were made more  likely due to human-caused climate change, including a devastating  marine heat wave off the coast of Australia that would have been  ``virtually impossible'' without human-induced warming. The report drew  attention to the role of oceans in many of these extreme events. Jeff  Rosenfeld, the Meteorological Society's editor-in-chief, said that  ``the ocean is actively playing a role in the extremes that we're  seeing'' and that ``we're seeing the oceans as a link in a chain of  causes that ultimately tie human causes to extreme weather events on  land.''    The changes occurring in the ocean are imposing an increasing threat  to our coastal communities, from gulf communities in Louisiana to  shoreline communities in Rhode Island.   The Union of Concerned Scientists released a report last year finding  that over 300,000 coastal homes, with a collective market value of over  $130 billion, are at risk of chronic flooding by 2045. By the end of  the century, 2.4 million homes, worth more than $1 trillion, are  expected to be at risk.   A 2018 report from Climate Central and Zillow found that thousands of  [[Page S131]]  homes continue to be built in risky coastal areas that are expected to  suffer annual floods by 2050.   Freddie Mac, the big U.S. housing corporation, has taken a look at  this and warned of a coastal property values crash as those houses  become uninsurable or unmortgageable to the next buyer.   A second economic crash we face is a ``carbon bubble'' in fossil fuel  companies. The ``carbon bubble'' collapse happens when fossil fuel  reserves now on the books of fossil fuel companies turn out to be  undevelopable ``stranded assets.'' Research published by economists in  the journal Nature Climate Change estimated that in a world where we  succeed in limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, $12 trillion of  financial value could vanish from balance sheets globally in the form  of stranded fossil fuel assets. That is over 15 percent of global GDP,  and that is why the Bank of England calls this a systemic risk--i.e., a  risk to the entire global economy.   Financial managers are waking up to these risks. At the recent U.N.  climate summit in December, a group of 415 global investors, managing  $32 trillion of investments--these are men and women who have been  trusted with managing $32 trillion worth of investments--came together  to warn that the world faces a financial crash worse than the 2008  crisis unless carbon emissions are urgently cut. The group called for  the end of fossil fuel subsidies and the introduction of substantial  prices on carbon emissions. They understand that to limit the worst  climate risks, including economic catastrophes, we must cut carbon  emissions immediately and substantially.   But back home, the Trump administration--clearly and completely  corrupted by the fossil fuel industry--has now taken more than 90  actions to weaken climate policies. Regrettably, after years of  decline, U.S. carbon emissions grew 3.4 percent in 2018. Global carbon  emissions also grew by 2.7 percent to reach a new carbon emissions  record.   If the Trump administration's 2018 regulatory actions read like a  fossil fuel industry wish list, it is because they are. Just one  example is the fuel economy rollback for automobiles. It is a perfect  example. The new, weaker standards were pushed by--guess who--the  largest oil refiner in the country, Marathon Petroleum. Marathon also  distinguished itself as a top donor to ethically challenged EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt during his time in political office in  Oklahoma. Marathon worked with the creepy Koch Brothers' network and  oil industry lobby groups to run a stealth campaign, including a  Facebook ad campaign using a phony front group called Energy4US that  hid its oil industry origin.   Fossil fuel energy companies claim to be cleaning up their act. They  issue statements voicing support for carbon pricing. Look at what they  do when the prospect of getting a carbon price on the books becomes  real, as it did in Washington State's carbon fee ballot initiative. The  campaign against the carbon fee outspent the campaign supporting it by  2 to 1, dumping more money into this ballot fight than any ballot  initiative campaign in the State's history. And who funded the campaign  against the initiative? Oil companies. BP, Phillips 66, and, of course,  our friends Marathon Petroleum were the top spenders by far.   Oil companies claim to support carbon pricing, but the giant trade  associations they fund to go out and do their political work--the  American Petroleum Institute, the so-called U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the National Association of Manufacturers--all oppose any proposals to  reduce carbon pollution. The CEOs say one thing, and their political  electioneering and lobbying apparatus is instructed to go out and do  the exact opposite.   Another telling aspect of the Washington State ballot initiative is  who did not show up. Conspicuously absent are any of the good-guy  corporations from the tech, financial, and food and beverage sectors  that talk such a good game on climate change. That is telling because  it matches what happens here in Congress. The good-guy corporations do  not lift a political finger to advance climate legislation here in the  Senate. In fact, these are the good guys. Set aside the fossil fuel  pirates and what they are all up to through their front groups and  their dark money and all the nonsense that they drive. These are the  supposed good guys. In fact, they have a net negative presence here in  the Senate on climate legislation because they do virtually nothing,  and the trade associations they help to fund, like the Chamber of  Commerce, lobby against climate action.    So you have American corporations with good climate policies taking  sustainability seriously within their corporate precincts. Then, those  companies come to the Senate, and their positions, as they appear here  in the Senate, are against the climate policies they claim to support  because they work through these intermediary groups that have been co- opted by fossil fuel interests and because they don't show up  themselves. In 2019, let's hope the good-guy American corporations get  off the bench, clean up the acts of their trade groups, and get onto  the field on the good side of the climate policy fight.   Let me wrap up, through all of that gloom, with the good news for the  new year and beyond.   Record low prices for wind and solar projects are now cheaper than  fossil fuels in many places. Battery costs are falling rapidly. Amazing  electric vehicles keep coming to market. New carbon capture  technologies emerge. Xcel Energy, a Colorado-based utility that serves  over 3 million customers, has announced a commitment to reduce carbon  emissions 80 percent by 2030 and to have zero carbon emissions by 2050,  which shows that players in the energy industry know to make this  transition.   Out of the States, California has passed a law requiring 100-percent  zero carbon electricity by 2045--100 percent. The Governors of New York  and Washington States recently announced 100 percent zero carbon  electricity goals. Hawaii has a law requiring 100 percent renewable  electricity by 2045. On the same day in late December, the District of  Columbia passed a bill requiring 100 percent renewable electricity by  2032, and nine Northeastern States--I am proud to say it includes my  Rhode Island--committed to cap emissions from the transportation  sector.   Here in the Senate, we can expect the new Democratic House to send  climate legislation our way. Whether my Republican colleagues like it  or not and whether the fossil fuel industry likes it or not, this will  be an issue in the 116th Congress.   My new year's wish is that my Republican Senate colleagues will  finally wake up to the damage that climate change is causing, to the  looming threat that climate change presents, and will help us to pass  bills addressing the huge climate risk that we face.   This is not impossible. This is the way the Senate behaved until  January of 2010. From when I was sworn in in 2007, through the rest of  that year and through 2008 and 2009, we had bipartisan climate bills.  We had bipartisan climate hearings. We had bipartisan climate  negotiations. We had bipartisan climate discussions. It was possible to  do that because the five Republican judges on the Supreme Court had not  yet given the fossil fuel industry the massive, new political artillery  they had given them in the Citizens United decision. Once the fossil  fuel industry had that new artillery, the game changed, and it brought  it to bear on our friends on the other side, and there has not been a  single Republican Senator on a single serious carbon emissions bill  since that moment. It shows what happens when you give a big special  interest a massive, new piece of political weaponry.   It doesn't mean it has to be this way. The good guys could show up  and counterbalance the political hydraulics here of the fossil fuel  industry's power. Our colleagues could say: Guys, we gave you a heck of  a good run. For years, we did nothing, but it is time now. We have  taken a look at where voters are. We have even taken a look at where  Republican voters are. We have taken a look at where the science is,  and we are going to do something.   There are a lot of ways that we can go back to the bipartisan  legislation, the bipartisan hearings, and the bipartisan conversations  that characterized this issue before Citizens United. It has been too  long that big polluter donors have had their way around here. They pay  the fee, but our Nation pays the price. We have a responsibility here  to  [[Page S132]]  protect future generations from an avoidable disaster of our own  making. It is time for us to wake up and do our job.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ryan  Edwards and Kim Binsted, AAAS fellows in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of this Congress.
