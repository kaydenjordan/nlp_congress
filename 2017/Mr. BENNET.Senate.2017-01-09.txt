 Mr. President, I would like to welcome the Presiding  Officer to the Senate and just say thank you very much for your  willingness to sit here this evening. To my colleagues, thank you for  being here. The hour is getting late so I am not going to take up a lot  of time with my own words, but I did want to come to the floor and read  the words of people who have written my office, Coloradans who took the  trouble to tell me what their concerns were with this suggested repeal  of the Affordable Care Act.   Given the fact that they took the time to write, I wanted to have the  opportunity to be here tonight to read their words into the Record. It  matters to a lot of people in my State because more than 600,000 people  are now insured in Colorado who were not insured before the Affordable  Care Act. We have had one of the largest drops of the uninsured rate in  the country. We have dropped from 14 percent to 7 percent, really  importantly from the point of view of saving money. The amount of  uncompensated care has gone down by 30 percent. So those are at the  hospital. Those are statistics, but the letters tell the human  dimension, the human story that so often is lost in the Chambers of  this Capitol.   A letter from Kathryn from Denver who wrote:         The Affordable Care Act has been crucial to my family the       last several years. . . . My sister, a Type 1 diabetic since       age 10, is now a Colorado business owner.        The Affordable Care Act allowed her to pursue business       ownership because--for the first time in her life--she could       get individual health insurance coverage without being denied       due to her preexisting condition. ACA allowed her to leave       her full-time job and start a part-time business and get       benefits through ACA.        I truly believe so much good has begun to come from this       legislation and repealing it will have catastrophic       consequences for my family and for so many others.    Terry from Denver writes:         I am writing concerning the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In       2010, I left my conventional job and took a risk, forming a       company to perform engineering consulting services. Since       that time, I have helped multiple organizations improve the       safety and reliability of their products and consider my       efforts to be quite successful.        However, I would not have taken the chance to go off on my       own if it had not been for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).        The ACA gave me options in health insurance that I would       not have had prior to its passage. There are millions of       people like me who count on the security of the ACA. These       people are entrepreneurs, freelancers, the self-employed,       early retirees, and the like who would not have health       insurance if not for the ACA.        Therefore, I am asking you to continue your support for the       ACA.    Catherine, a nurse from Aurora:         I want to tell you a personal story, in the hopes that you       will think about the people in your state who might be       affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.    That is whom we are here to talk about tonight. That is whom we are  here to think about tonight. Catherine wrote:         I have a daughter with Schizophrenia. . . .        When we had to bring her home from college, we were       terrified about what might happen to her and where she would       find treatment.        Because of the Affordable Care Act, she was able to stay on       our insurance for the next 3 years, even though she was no       longer a student.    That is one of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care  Act.         Although it was a long process and not easy, we were able       to help find quality mental health care providers and her       care was covered because of provisions in the law that       provided for mental health coverage.    Provisions that I know the Senator from Michigan worked on.         She is now doing very well. She is married and able to work       part time and function as an active member of society.        As a nurse, I have cared for many people over the years who       had chronic conditions through no fault of their own. Before       this law was passed, many would not get insurance, or if they       did, the cost was beyond their reach.    Nicholas from Denver:         My wife was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer at the age       of 38, almost 4 years ago. We have been living with it as a       chronic disease and she is in stable condition.        Health care costs have been about $15,000 a year for us out       of pocket, but we've been able to manage because of the       protections afforded by the ACA, specifically no caps on       annual or lifetime benefits and no denials for preexisting       conditions. . . .        Please assure me you will do all you can to keep those       protections we so desperately rely on from disappearing.    Sarah writes:         On June 20, 2016, my second child, my daughter Emma, was       born. . . . She was born six weeks early and weighed 3 lbs.       10 oz. At birth. We knew prior to her birth that she had a       heart defect (a hole in her heart) that would need to be       repaired through open-heart surgery during the first year of       her life.        We also knew that she wasn't growing properly and she might       have other issues. . . . During the past five months, Emma       has undergone more surgeries and procedures than most people       will undergo in their entire lives. . . . I haven't recently       tallied the cost of Emma's medical care, but I believe she       will easily reach $1 million (or much) in medical expenses       before she turns 1.        I have become extremely anxious about how my family will       meet Emma's ongoing needs if the ACA is repealed and       insurance companies are allowed to reinstate lifetime       maximums and to discriminate against preexisting conditions.       . . .        I beseech you to do everything you can to preserve the       provisions that will help my family--and to do everything       possible to ensure that the millions who have finally been       able to acquire health insurance since the ACA was passed       don't lose their insurance.    People have received probably hundreds of thousands of these letters  in the Senate. It seems to me--I mean, yes, we should be having a  conversation about how to make the law better. I have said from the  very beginning that I don't think it is perfect. I think there were big  problems with our health care system before we passed the Affordable  Care Act. I think there are big health care problems with our health  care system today. That is a fact that anybody in America ought to be  able to notice. And the Senate ought to be able to notice that and say:  Why don't we make it better? Why don't we improve it? We should improve  it.    I would love to meet with colleagues here to talk about how we deal  with the fact that in rural Colorado, there is not enough competition  in health insurance for people. I would love to be able to have a  conversation here about how to drive the cost of insurance down in  rural Colorado, rather than continue to see those costs increase.   I would say this. If there is somebody here with a solution to that  problem, on either side of the aisle, I would be happy to write that  amendment with them. But the problem I have with where we are in this  debate--and I will close with this--is that we are talking about  throwing out all the protections that all of these people have come to  rely upon, that all of these people have come to count on in America  with our health care system. We are going to throw them out, but we are  not going to tell you what we are going to put in its place. In fact,  for all you know, we are not going to put anything in its place because  what we have heard is that there is no consensus on the other side  about how we should move forward.   Part of the problem I have had with this legislation since the  beginning is that we have been unable to forge a bipartisan consensus  on how to deal with the fact that this country is spending 16 percent  of its GDP on health care when every other industrialized country in  the world is spending about half that or, in some cases, less than half  that and delivering better results. I would love to see a bipartisan  consensus. But what we have come to understand in the days leading up  to this debate is that there is not a consensus on the Republican side  about how we should go forward.   After 7 or 8 years, you would think we would have the opportunity to  see a plan. It is not hard to think about what the values would be  underlying a plan--the values that would say: Let's  [[Page S170]]  try to maximize coverage where we can. Let's try to increase quality  where we can. Let's try to drive prices down where we can. Let's try to  spend less, as a country, on health care where we can.   Those are not Democratic or Republican ideals. It would seem to me  that those values would have the virtue of being able to inform  Democratic pieces of legislation and Republican pieces of legislation.  But in 8 years, we haven't seen a plan.   Here we are tonight, talking about repealing the protections that  Coloradans are counting on every single day for their peace of mind and  so they can plan for the sake of putting nothing in its place. It  reminds me--and, colleagues, I will close with this--of the complaints  that I have had in my office and as I travel the State of Colorado,  where people say: Michael, we paid into our health insurance company.  Month after month after month, we paid our premiums. Then, when my kid  got sick and I called them up, their response was to keep me on the  phone as long as possible without an answer in the hope that I would  give up and go home and that the claim wouldn't have to be paid.   To be honest, colleagues, I have heard that before we passed the  Affordable Care Act, and I have heard that since we have passed the  Affordable Care Act. We have more to do. That is the honest thing to  say here.   But for us to talk about repealing this, taking away the benefits  that people have, the protections that people have, the security and  peace of mind that people have, and replacing it with the equivalent of  leaving the American people on hold so they will give up, so they will  move on to the next thing is beneath the dignity of this place and is  not worthy of the Members of the Senate.   I want to close by saying what I have always said. I will work with  anybody--Democrat or Republican--to make sure that we really do have  affordable health care in this country for the American people, for the  people whom I represent in Colorado, and I look forward to our getting  to a place where that is the politics we are pursuing in this Chamber,  instead of the politics we have seen over the past number of years.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.
