 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss the importance of  the American energy sector and my concern about President Biden's  Executive orders regarding domestic energy policy.   In the first hours of the Biden administration, the President signed  an Executive order revoking the Presidential permit of the Keystone XL  Pipeline, a project projected to add 11,000 American jobs this year and  pump $1.6 billion in wages into our economy. The new administration's  actions ceased construction work, nullified contracts issued last  October to hire an estimated 7,000 union construction workers, and  disappointed our Canadian ally.   It is deeply concerning that our national energy policy should take  such a dramatic turn away from pro-jobs and pro-American energy  independence. Americans' unemployment rate is already in a precarious  situation due to the ongoing global pandemic, and I fail to see how  destroying more jobs unifies our Nation.   Mississippians and Americans in the energy industry have worked  tirelessly for our Nation, and in 2019 America became energy  independent for the first time in 60 years. It is thanks to our energy  workers that we are no longer forced to rely on foreign powers who do  not wish America well.   Terminating the Keystone XL Pipeline was just the start of what we  now recognize to be a concerted effort to bring down fossil fuel  resources in our Nation. The administration's subsequent ban on new oil  and gas leases on Federal lands will result in an estimated $33.5  billion in lost GDP across Western States in President Biden's first  term and risk over $8.8 billion annually in conservation funding.   Oil and natural gas from Federal lands accounted for 6.4 percent and  9.2 percent, respectively, of the Nation's total production. Jobs and  economic opportunity are being carelessly stripped away.   And while my State may not be burned by the Federal leasing ban as  badly as Wyoming, New Mexico, and other Western States, Mississippi  will certainly feel the heat from this. Mississippi has a significant  energy infrastructure which provides thousands of jobs and hundreds of  millions of dollars in economic output.   The Gulf of Mexico is one of the Nation's most important regions for  energy resources and accounts for a large portion of our crude oil and  Federal offshore natural gas production.   My State is home to the 1,443-megawatt Grand Gulf nuclear power  station in Port Gibson, MS, which is the largest reactor in terms of  generating capacity in the United States. We host a large petroleum  refinery, a natural gas processing plant, and a liquefied natural gas  terminal located along the State's Gulf of Mexico coastline.   Additionally, the Red Hills surface coal mine provides lignite coal  to the Red Hills Power Plant, creating jobs and generation capacity in  North Mississippi. Along with these great sources, Mississippi has  growing investments in natural gas and in solar power.   Destructive policies that make fuel sources more difficult to obtain  could greatly harm economic growth and raise the cost of energy prices,  which will ultimately harm low-income families and many small  businesses, not just in Mississippi but across the entire Nation.   My concerns are not based on any objections to green or renewable  energy sources. I believe the American people want balanced national  energy policies that promote growth and price stability. However, the  early actions of the Biden administration are cause for concern and not  a source of unity. They signal a troubling willingness to sacrifice  strategic industries that are important to our economy and for the jobs  that they provide.   This body should take into consideration important legislation such  as the POWER Act and the Conservation Funding Protection Act, which  would allow Congress to enact responsible energy policies and move away  from policies landed in executive edits.   During a time when America's energy businesses are seeking recovery  from this global pandemic, losing precious jobs that keep the lights on  for the constituents and feed their families cannot and should not be  the route this administration is taking.                           Tribute to Sarah Thomas    Mr. President, now on a more positive note, I would like to speak on  a separate and special matter.   As Americans and people around the world settle in front of their  televisions this Sunday to watch the 55th annual Super Bowl, they will  be tuning in to a historic event. I am not speaking about the impact of  the COVID-19 pandemic on the game or Tom Brady's record Super Bowl  appearances. Instead, I am focused on the history that will be made by  an exceptional woman from Mississippi, my good friend Sarah Thomas.   Sarah Thomas, a native of Pascagoula, MS, will go down in sports  history on Sunday as the first woman to officiate the Super Bowl.   Sarah has always had a passion for athletics. She made a name for  herself in high school sports. She became an Academic All-American in  basketball at the University of Mobile, where she amassed a career  record of 779 points, 441 rebounds, 108 assists, and 192 steals-- accomplishments that illustrate her determination to perform at the  highest levels.   While the news of a female officiant for the Super Bowl is a historic  first, Sarah is no stranger to making history. Following college,  Sarah's attention shifted to football--namely, officiating games. She  quickly earned a reputation as an elite referee while officiating high  school games.   Sarah became the first woman to officiate a Division 1A high school  game in Mississippi. Sarah continued to do so well in her craft that it  caught the attention of renowned NFL official Gerry Austin, who invited  her to an officials' camp. Here again, Sarah's talents proved  impressive, and she soon became the first woman to officiate a college  football game and the first woman to officiate a college bowl game.   The NFL hired Sarah as its first female official in 2015, and in 2019  she became the first woman to officiate an NFL playoff game.   To me and many others, Sarah's selection to officiate at Super Bowl  LV is just a natural progression for a talented professional. I can  assure you, anyone who knows Sarah as I do will not be surprised by her  successful career.   Sarah--a mother, a career woman--has all the qualities I imagine the  NFL wants in a good official: smart, confident, decisive, reliable, and  committed.   My State of Mississippi is extremely proud of Sarah Thomas, and we  look forward to watching her latest history-making appearance at the  Super Bowl.   And to Sarah's children--these precious children: Bridley, Brady, and  Bailey--congratulations to you on this historic achievement, and you  can be so proud of your mother.   I yield the floor.
