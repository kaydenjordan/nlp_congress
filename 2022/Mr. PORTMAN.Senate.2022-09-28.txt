 Madam President, before I rise to talk about Ukraine  tonight, I want to join my colleagues in extending my prayers to all  those who are currently in Florida, in the area, and those with loved  ones and family there who are in Hurricane Ian's dangerous path this  evening.                                   Ukraine    Madam President, I come to the floor tonight to talk about Ukraine.  This is  [[Page S5138]]  the 24th week in a row I have come to bring to the attention of my  colleagues what is happening in this part of the world where Russia has  attacked a sovereign and democratic country with brutality.   I come to talk about the latest news of Russia's illegal and  unprovoked war on Ukraine and to ensure that my colleagues know how  important it is that we do follow up with our commitment to Ukraine and  pass the legislation that is on the floor this week to provide  supplemental funding to the Ukrainian Government, to their military,  and also for the humanitarian effort.   I will also highlight tonight the continued Ukrainian  counteroffensive up here in the northeast part of Ukraine, where there  has been a good deal of success.   The light blue is parts of Ukraine that have been liberated just in  the past few weeks. It is about 3,000 square miles. The red is parts  that are still occupied by Russia.   I will talk about the sham ``referendum'' that President Putin  announced just last Wednesday and then took place over the weekend, the  reasons for and consequences of Russia's recent decision to draft an  additional 300,000 troops, as well as Vladimir Putin once again  threatening a nuclear attack.   I will also discuss the vote in this body--again, this week--because  we, in the next couple of days, are going to decide whether to provide  additional funding for Ukraine. It is so important we continue to  provide that support at this crucial juncture, just as Ukraine is  making progress and pushing back against Russia's war of aggression.   Last week, I touched on the extraordinary success of this  counteroffensive. As you will recall, Ukraine launched a surprise  lightning counteroffensive here in the northeastern part of the  country, which caught Russian forces off guard. In a matter of days,  Ukraine liberated over 3,000 square miles of territory and sent the  invaders rushing back to Russia and back to eastern parts of Ukraine.   To the north, Russian forces have been pushed back to the  international boundary here and over into Ukraine or some into Belarus.   Along this front line is a river. It is the Oskil River, which many  thought would be a natural barrier to block Ukraine from making further  gains. Yet, as we have seen in the last week, Ukrainian forces have  actually managed to cross this river and establish major bridgeheads,  including one here at Kupiansk right here and also one here east of  Izyum. Izyum is the place where, unfortunately, there were all sorts of  atrocities discovered when the liberation took place. There has been  additional Ukrainian success here and progress crossing the river to  the east of Izyum.   As you will see from the map, a key city called Lyman will soon be  surrounded by three sides. When Lyman is surrounded by three sides, it  will be very difficult for Russia to defend it. The sense is that the  invaders there will be forced to either surrender or retreat.   Clearly, Ukraine continues to have the momentum here in the  northeast; again, therefore, exactly the time for us to continue to  support Ukraine.   U.S. funding has made a huge difference. The actions of this body and  the House of Representatives and the administration in providing this  help to Ukraine has allowed for successes that were unimaginable 7  months ago when Russia initiated this latest invasion. They have  actually stopped and are now pushing back a Russian army that is much  larger and with a lot more heavy equipment.   Our support, along with that of over 50 countries around the world-- and let me underline that. Fifty countries around the world or more  have now provided military assistance to Ukraine. That has helped  enable the survival of this country as a free and independent Ukraine.   Yesterday, I had the privilege to host Ukraine's Ambassador to the  United States, Oksana Markarova, along with Ukraine's Parliament. We  heard firsthand from them how the weapons we are providing are making a  huge difference on the battlefield.   One of the parliamentarians had just returned from the region, the  northeast region we talked about. She was just in the area of Kharkiv,  and she said that the soldiers there told her: Please, go back to the  United States and say thank you because these weapons you are giving  us--particularly, they focused on the HIMARS--are making such a huge  difference.   These HIMARS are long-range missile systems, and they have changed  the tide of this war.   Along with more ammunition and equipment, of course, we have to  continue to insist on total transparency to ensure that the end use is  being monitored. ``End use monitoring'' is the term that the 101st  Airborne used when I talked to them in Poland about the U.S. weapons  that are going into the country.   This is an example. HIMARS is an example. We know now from public  information there are 16 of these HIMARS from the United States. There  are also some from the UK--not exactly the same weapon but a similar  weapon--and also some from Germany. Those 16 remain undamaged, which is  extraordinary, and they have been incredibly useful.   But we need to ensure that all this equipment goes to the right place  to ensure there is no fraud, no diversion of weapons. In my visits to  the region, including a month ago, I did speak to U.S. military  officials both in Poland and in Ukraine, who provided details on how  they are tracking U.S. and other weapons to ensure they are not  diverted from the Ukrainians and from the frontlines.   This end-use monitoring, which as our military explains it is,  according to them, being implemented in ways never done before; and  they claim the Ukrainian Government and military are full partners in  these accountability measures. That is what I heard as well. I heard  that from the President of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy; and I heard it  from all the Ukrainian officials, including the Parliamentarians with  whom we met, that they want to have total transparency. They think it  is in their interest as well.   Of course, Russian disinformation is trying to convince media  otherwise. Let me give you an example of that. Over the weekend, a BBC  investigation revealed allegations from Russia media sources that were  picked up, frankly, by some U.S. and European media--which is a  warning, I think, to our own media to be careful and check your  sources--but the reports from the Russian media was that U.S.-supplied  weapons were being sold on the black market in Ukraine. BBC determined  that was entirely false.   Russians had posed as Ukrainians on the dark web pretending to sell  these weapons in order to undermine American and European confidence in  Ukraine's ability to control these weapons. It turns out it was a  totally false narrative peddled by the Russian Government in order to  sow division between Ukraine and its allies. The BBC report again  affirms what I've heard in the region, that our military aid to Ukraine  is getting into the right hands and is not being diverted for malign  purposes.   A specific example of what we had provided that is making a  difference are these HIMARS, as we talked about. By all accounts,  Ukrainian forces have used these really creatively to be able to  disrupt the logistics of the Russian Armed Forces. They have been  striking behind enemy lines to destroy Russian ammunition depots,  logistics hubs, command and control outposts. Prior to the HIMARS, only  the Russians had long-range artillery, and they could fire on Ukrainian  civilians and military with impunity. Finally, they have the ability to  push back. These weapons have enabled this spectacular counteroffensive  we saw in the northeast to be able to succeed. So when we give the  Ukrainians weapons they have actually been asking for, they actually  need, they use them effectively, and it is working.   In the clearest sign yet that Russia is feeling desperate, last week  President Putin announced a new draft, a mobilization of at least  300,000 soldiers to support his troubled war on Ukraine. Remember,  President Putin promoted his ``special operation'' in Ukraine as a  special military operation that would not touch the lives of ordinary  Russians. It would be quick; it would involve minimal casualties; it  would bring great glory to Russia.   Now after 7 months, tens of thousands of casualties, a substantial  part  [[Page S5139]]  of their military equipment being lost on the battlefield, and global  outrage at what Russia is doing, President Putin is being forced to  implement Russia's first mass mobilization since World War II to  bolster his failing war effort. This is an act of desperation, and it  is deeply unpopular among the people in Russia. According to reports,  antimobilization protests in 38 Russian cities saw more than 1,300  people arrested just last week. Here are some of those demonstrations.   The punishment for many of those detained, by the way, if they are  males between the ages of, say, 18 and 50, is to be forcibly  conscripted. Meanwhile, several Russian enlistment offices have been  burned down by citizens armed with Molotov cocktails who want nothing  to do with Putin's war in Ukraine.   In fact, the announcement of the mobilization has caused many  thousands of military-aged men to flee Russia to avoid being sent to  war. It is reported that airline tickets out of Moscow have reached  $5,000 or $10,000 or more, and flights are totally sold out. Car  traffic at Russia's international borders have caused massive traffic  jams, as those who can't fly out of Russia try to drive out to get away  from the conscription. Here is an example with the border with Georgia.  You can see these cars lined up for miles.   Russia is so desperate that they are recruiting just about any able- bodied man just to get bodies in to fill their ranks. These are not  military-trained individuals. They are letting prisoners out of jail if  they promise to fight. Despite the official policy that this  mobilization will only draft men with prior military experience, they  will take anyone. In the Irkutsk region of Russia, a young man shot and  killed a military commissar who was attempting to conscript his friend  who had no prior military experience. President Putin is breaking his  promises to the Russian people, and they are responding.   Russia's desperation has shown itself in other ways too. After  numerous postponements, Moscow-backed occupation officials in Luhansk,  Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk Oblast suddenly announced last  Tuesday they would hold immediate referendum to join Russia, which they  completed over the weekend. In typical Russian fashion, these so-called  referenda are not free or fair. The results have been preordained in  Moscow, and the actual conduct of the voting is just theater. There are  a lot of videos circulating--and you have probably seen them--of online  videos of armed Russian soldiers going door-to-door to conduct these  illegal referendum. So you have an armed soldier with an automatic  weapon next to an election official asking someone how they are going  to vote. Here is an example of one of the photographs that somebody  bravely took of a Russian soldier literally looking over the shoulder  of a Ukrainian citizen. How can any Ukrainian vote against the  referendum in the face of an automatic rifle? The European Union, the  United Nations, the United States, and others, of course, have called  these sham elections. It appears that Russia thinks by claiming these  territories as theirs, it can justify now their use of chemical,  biological, or even nuclear weapons in order to defend what Putin would  call his own sovereign territory. Of course, no matter what Russia  says, this--all of this--is Ukrainian territory. It is sovereign  Ukrainian territory. And a sham referendum is only a Russian escalation  of their illegal and unprovoked war on Ukraine.    So the results this week are predictable. You can look for them. It  will be 95 percent. It will be 98 percent. The process won't be fair.  It will be done with flagrant disregard for Ukrainian law and for  international law. Russia's actions reveal their weak hand, and the  world is not fooled. UK defense secretary Ben Wallace said that the  partial mobilization and the annexation of parts of Ukraine are an  admission, as he said, of Mr. Putin's invasion failing. Ambassador to  Ukraine Bridget Brink called the announced measures ``signs of  weakness.''   We must make it clear that the United States will never recognize  Russia's claims to these annexed territories. President Putin's veiled  threats last week and again this week, some say, to use nuclear weapons  to defend illegally annexed territory have received a good deal of  media attention. First, it should be noted, he has made similar  threatening statements in the past. But he also knows that the use of  nuclear weapons would be catastrophic for his own country. As the  Washington Post said over the weekend:         There are no military gains to be had from a nuclear attack       that indiscriminately incinerates everything in its path and       leaves the land uninhabitable.    The nuclear fallout of attacking neighboring Ukraine, of course, will  also affect Russia and its citizens. Meanwhile, if he were to act on  such a threat, President Putin would immediately turn his country into  even more of a pariah than it is now, and there would be a severe  consequence, as the United States has warned.   Nuclear weapons have not been used since World War II, almost 80  years ago. Using them now would plunge us into a far more dangerous  world, and the world would never forgive President Putin. The countries  that have taken a neutral stance on this brutal conflict would quickly  change their tune, and the resolve of the West and so many other  countries to stand against Russian aggression would only increase. This  conflict has shown that when push comes to shove, the alliance actually  comes together to protect Ukraine; it binds together.   Nuclear blackmail cannot be allowed to work. Responding to Vladimir  Putin's reckless threats by pulling back would only reward bad behavior  and create a more dangerous and volatile world. Appeasement does not  work. In response to these threats, it is crucial that we continue to  support Ukraine while making clear to Russia that there will be  enormous costs for use of a nuclear weapon. National Security Advisor  Jake Sullivan said on Sunday morning that ``any use of nuclear weapons  will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia.''   This battle for freedom transcends this Congress; it transcends  partisanship. We all know who the aggressor is in this fight. The  people of Ukraine have never asked for anything other than peace and to  be able to live with their neighbors, including Russia, in peace; the  right to exist as a sovereign, independent nation. Russia's illegal and  unprovoked war is an attack on their fundamental right to self- governance.   We have all seen the evidence of war crimes: the torture, the rape,  the killings of innocent Ukrainian civilians and noncombatants, the  videos of Ukrainian soldiers being tortured with box cutters, and the  mass gravesites. NATO's response last week to the Russian atrocities in  Izyum this past week was to reaffirm ``our unwavering support for  Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity . . .  and for Ukraine's inherent right to self-defence. NATO allies remain  resolute in providing political and practical support to Ukraine as it  continues to defend itself against Russia's aggression.''   Global support for Ukraine has increased in response to the  increasing number of atrocities being committed by Russian soldiers. I  was able to hear about this firsthand last week when I met with  Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin about the ongoing global  effort to hold Russia accountable for their war crimes, which are a  clear violation of international law. We discussed ways the United  States can aid Ukraine in its effort to investigate and prosecute cases  of war crimes conducted by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Last week, I  talked about the mass graves of people tortured and executed in the  city of Izyum. Who knows how many more are out there. The evidence of  this genocide grows every day, and every day the anger against Russia  grows alongside it. So far, we believe these war crimes have resulted  in the deaths of at least 7,300 civilians, including 391 children.   The West and our allies must all recognize that these Russian  atrocities will not stop until Russia believes the costs are too high,  until there are more Ukrainian victories on the battlefield, and until  the sanctions are more effective at cutting off funding to Russia's war  machine. Russia needs to feel the squeeze. We talked about this in the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing today. That is the only way  this Russian brutality, this madness, ends. For the sake of global  freedom, Ukraine must be allowed to end this war on its terms, not on  Russia's  [[Page S5140]]  terms. To get to that point requires us to continue supporting Ukraine,  to keep the momentum going. What would it say if we backed down now?   In an address before the United Nations last week, President  Zelenskyy said:         Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world wants       peace. And we have seen who is the only one who wants war.    Secretary of State Blinken summed it up:         If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Russia stops       fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine       ends.    I encourage the Senate to act with a united voice in support of the  people of Ukraine. By providing additional funding, the battlefield  gains can continue; the government in Kyiv can continue to operate;  Ukrainian prosecutors can investigate more war crimes and bring the  perpetrators to justice.   As Russia continues their ruthless attack on freedom and democracy,  it is our duty to stand up for what we believe to be true: that life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will always win in the fight  against tyranny. And it is working. Ukrainian liberators have taken  back cities across Ukraine, as we have seen. It is working. And unlike  Russia, the morale of the Ukrainian people and the troops is strong.  Their determination is strong.   We must continue to let the world know we stand with Ukraine. And as  I have heard from multiple meetings with Ukrainian officials, including  some of the Parliamentarians we were with yesterday, they said: Freedom  must be armed.   And the United States must be there to lead that effort to ensure  that freedom's flame is not extinguished in Ukraine.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to P.J.  O'Rourke, one of America's greatest humorists. P.J. passed away after a  brief illness earlier this year, leaving behind his beloved wife Tina  and his three children, as well as countless readers who will miss the  laughter and delight he brought them over a career that spanned nearly  half a century.   P.J. was born 74 years ago in Toledo, OH. We are proud to call him an  Ohio native. His father owned a car dealership; his mother was a  homemaker. P.J. was the product of Toledo's public schools, then of  Miami University in southwest Ohio. One of his English professors,  spotting a unique talent, arranged a scholarship that allowed him to  continue in school and get his degree in English, with honors.  [[Page S5222]]    In the 1970s, P.J. moved to New York. There, he became editor of the  legendary satirical magazine ``National Lampoon,'' then in its prime.  After the Lampoon came stints at ``Rolling Stone,'' the ``Atlantic  Monthly,'' and many other magazines, as well as 20 books known for  their energy and wit.   Frequently, he turned his attention to American politics. Some here  in Washington can still feel the sting. He even found humor in the  world's trouble spots; He was in Beirut in the 1980s, Somalia and  Afghanistan in the 1990s, Iraq in the 2000s.   One of my favorite P.J. O'Rourke quotes is: ``Politics is a necessary  evil, a necessary annoyance, a necessary conundrum.'' His tone was  always one of mischievous irreverence, tempered by an abiding sympathy  for our common humanity.   And he was never far from Toledo or from Ohio. ``No Toledoan ever  outgrows Toledo,'' he wrote several years ago, in a tribute to his  hometown. He was clear-eyed about the charms of a Midwestern upbringing  and blind to any imperfections.   ``Toledo is better than exciting,'' he went on, ``it's happy. Nothing  is more conducive to unhappiness than taking yourself seriously, and  taking yourself seriously is difficult when your baseball team is  called the Mud Hens.''   In truth, P.J. O'Rourke, while not taking himself too seriously,  achieved much success in life--best-selling books, packed lecture halls  in America and Europe, a journalistic career that took him to every  corner of the world. But he never forgot he was from Toledo, from Ohio,  from the heart of the country. And the country's heart always beat  within him.   My fellow Buckeyes join me in bidding farewell and offering our  thanks to a treasured native son.                            ____________________
