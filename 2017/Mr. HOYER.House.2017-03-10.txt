 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), my friend, for the purpose of inquiring of the majority  leader the schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   I would now like to ask him, we passed the DOD Appropriations bill  and sent that to the Senate. We have already done the MILCON bill. And  I am wondering--there are ten remaining bills--whether the majority  leader could give me some idea, in light of the fact that the CR, which  once it goes to April 28, we will either have to do those bills  individually or in some sort of an omnibus, whether the gentleman has  any idea how soon we might be considering the balance of the year's  appropriation to September 30?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that insightful  comment.   Let me say this, Mr. Leader, if, as we did in the Defense  Appropriations bill, if we follow the template where we will reach  bipartisan agreement on those bills in committee without any poison  pills language in them--which you did on the appropriation bill, and,  as you saw, we appreciated that, and we were overwhelmingly supportive  of that effort--I would hope that, Mr. Leader, you would urge--and I  think, very frankly, I am a big fan of Mr. Frelinghuysen, who is the  chairman of the committee. I think he is a Member that I have worked  well with over the years, and I think he is somebody who is going to do  the committee proud as its chairman--but I am hopeful that we can do,  as we did with the appropriation bill for the Defense Department, a  similar procedure. So I think that the majority leader will be pleased  with our support if, in fact, that can happen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, on a less happy collegial note, it comes as  no surprise to the majority leader at the height of our displeasure and  disappointment as it relates to what is going on, back to the  consideration of the reconciliation process for the repeal or  modification of the Affordable Care Act with the American Health Care  Act. The bill was posted this Monday, this past Monday night, it was  marked up on Wednesday, there were no hearings, there were no  opportunities for witnesses to come forward. And as the gentleman  knows, he is absolutely correct, I like these quotes, but I like these  quotes because they point out theoretically what I would have great  agreement with in terms of process.   Particularly, I call your attention to a quote of Speaker Paul Ryan:  ``Congress is moving fast to rush through a healthcare overhaul that  lacks a key ingredient: the full participation of you, the American  people.''   That quote was July 19, 2009. That quote was referring to the process  involved in the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.   As the gentleman knows, the Affordable Care Act had 79 hearings. As  the gentleman knows, there were 181 witnesses who testified about the  Affordable Care Act. As the gentleman knows, that process took  approximately 1\1/2\ years, 8 months of which was waiting to see  whether Senator Grassley would participate in a bipartisan way in  forging healthcare reform in this country.   The gentleman is well aware, not only have we had literally hundreds  of thousands of people around the country come to townhall meetings,  many that his Members have held, and express their deep concern about  the loss of healthcare security if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.  So there is no doubt that the American public--I am not saying it is  100 percent--but a large number of the American public are very  concerned.    The gentleman further knows, I am sure, because I am sure he has seen  the letters, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital  Association, the American Nurses Association,  [[Page H2042]]  even the Consumers Union, and hundreds of other groups representing  providers, patients, even insurance companies, have expressed deep,  deep concern about the adverse consequences of the passage of the  American Health Care Act that was marked up in the dead of night. We  were criticized. The gentleman apparently doesn't agree with that. But  the facts are the facts. They are not alternative facts.   You started marking them up on Wednesday morning, there was some  delay during the day, as you know, because we were very concerned about  how fast you were moving that. Less than 48 hours after it was  introduced, it was marked up. No hearings, no witnesses, no ability to  read the bill.   As a matter of fact, shockingly, Mr. Brady voted against an amendment  which said: Read the bill. Now, what was shocking about that is that  was Mr. Brady's amendment that he offered back in 2010. He voted  against the amendment that said: Read the bill. I don't think anybody  really had much opportunity to read the bill before it was marked up.   Greg Walden, who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,  said also, in July of 2009:         On a bill of this significance, you would think that we       would at least allow people to come in who are affected by       the extraordinary changes in this bill and have a chance to       let us know how it affects them.    That was Greg Walden, now the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, July 9, 2009. He is now in charge of that committee. Not a  single witness testified on the bill that was marked up in his  committee. And it was marked up through the dead of the night, if we  want to parse our words, because it started in the morning of  Wednesday. But it didn't end until the morning, 26 hours later, on  Thursday. Which meant that Mr. Walden kept his members in their seats  marking up a bill, except when they were voting coming over here, for  26 hours straight on one of the most consequential bills this House  will consider and that the Senate will consider, affecting, as I said,  millions and millions and millions of people.   Now, I understand the Budget Committee is scheduled to mark that bill  up on Wednesday, just a week later. Again, I don't know whether there  are going to be hearings and if those hearings will be open to the  witnesses that should be called to testify on a bill of such impact.   Let me do one additional quote, because the chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee had an interesting quote as well. He said: ``The  Democratic Congress and White House simply aren't listening. Democrats  are ramming it through over the public's objections.''   That was on March 17, 2010, some year after the bill had been  introduced. Thousands of meetings had been held by Republicans and  Democrats around the country on the bill. And, as I said, 79 hearings  and 181 witnesses later. That is what Chairman Brady said.   And, of course, Chairman Brady, in less than 48 hours, had a markup.  Now, he did not have quite as long a markup. It ended at 4:30 a.m.  Thursday morning. So that was the dead of night. Or, if you want to  parse words, perhaps, the dead of the early morning. But, nevertheless,  most of my public wasn't up watching. I presume even at 4:30, which  would have been 1:30 for your public, they weren't up watching.   So this was done out of the sight of the public and is inconsistent,  I suggest to my friend, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader, inconsistent  with the pledge of transparency, openness, and those three quotes that  I just read you that said the American people should have the  opportunity to express their opinion on legislation generally, but  certainly on legislation of this consequence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, we have had, literally, tens of thousands of hearings  that have dealt with almost every issue that this  [[Page H2043]]  House considers. I suppose I should take from the majority leader's  discussion that, if we have had those hearings in previous Congresses,  in the last Congress, the Congress before that, the Congress before  that, and we have a substantial number of new Members in this House,  and we have millions and millions of voters who are counting on this,  we will just simply tell them: Read the transcript of 2002 or of 2009  or of 2013. That is not regular order, Mr. Speaker.   Regular order is you introduce a bill. It is referred to a committee,  which in turn refers it to a subcommittee, and, even if it keeps it in  the bosom of the full committee, it has a hearing. It posts the bill.  It tells citizens throughout this country: If you have an interest,  come in and tell us what your interest is, what your perspective is,  what you think the ramifications of this bill are. The subcommittee  marks it up, if it was referred to a subcommittee, then the full  committee marks it up, and then it is referred to the floor. That is  regular order, Mr. Speaker.   To rationalize a procedure which has a bill introduced Monday night  and is subjected to 26 hours, straight, of markup on the following  Wednesday, less than 48 hours later, no matter how you dress it up,  that is not, Mr. Speaker, regular order.   What it is is trying to jam through a bill before the American public  has an opportunity to tell us what they think about the bill. What it  is is jamming through a bill and not allowing the providers, the  doctors, the patients, the insurance companies, all of the  stakeholders, to have an opportunity to read that bill introduced about  72 hours ago now--a little more than that, maybe close to 96.   That, Mr. Speaker, is not regular order. And I will tell my friend  for whom I have a great deal of respect, I think he puts the best face  on it, but nobody believed the Republicans had a bill, Mr. Speaker,  until Monday night. Well, actually, I believed they had a bill at the  last colloquy, and I looked for it all over this Capitol. I couldn't  find it. It wasn't posted. The ranking member on the committee didn't  have it. No committee Democrat had the bill. They couldn't read it.   So to pretend, Mr. Speaker, that hearings on some other bill at some  other time in some other Congress suffices for regular order is  something, Mr. Speaker, I cannot agree with. And if the situations were  reversed, as I have experienced over the last 36 years, that side of  the aisle would have torn this place apart. Why do I think that?  Because I have seen it.   Yes, we had some delaying, four motions to adjourn, so that we had  some time to figure out what this bill was about and some time to hear  from the American people. It certainly wasn't enough time. We are going  to be hearing more from the American people, I think, Mr. Speaker.   I appreciate the gentleman trying to say that, well, we only had 48  hours. Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we do that in a hurry. And the reason is  because we are about to go on a break. We are about to go on an August  break or a recess or something of that nature. That is not the case.  These committees didn't have to meet through the night. They could have  met Thursday. They could have met today. They could meet next week. But  this bill is being rushed through too fast with too much adverse  consequence to the American people.   I would hope the majority leader would slow this bill down. I hope  the Rules Committee has full hearings on this bill and that it does not  have just attenuated hearings with few witnesses, because there are a  lot of people who want to tell us, their Representatives, what their  view is of this bill.   I know the Speaker has said there are going to be three phases to  this bill, and the majority leader said so as well, and there will be  additional legislation. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that my friend, the  majority leader, will urge the committees not to consider additional  legislation either in the middle of the night or with no notice and no  opportunity for witnesses and no hearings.   Previous hearings will not suffice, Mr. Speaker. Other Congresses had  hearings. This Congress has a responsibility to hear from the American  people. That is what Speaker Ryan said; that is what Mr. Brady said;  that is what Mr. Walden said. They said it at a time when they were in  the minority, but it ought to apply when they are in the majority. And  if we are in the majority, it ought to apply to us as well. I hope that  happens, Mr. Speaker, for the country's sake, for our people's sake.   I will yield to the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, if he would like to  speak.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the majority  leader. I presume that he has heard from--I don't have the quotes in  front of me,  [[Page H2044]]  but maybe I will bring them next week--the thousands of people who have  said their lives have been saved by the Affordable Care Act; the  thousands of parents with a child with a preexisting condition that, if  the Republicans had succeeded in their 65 votes to repeal it, would not  have been protected; the millions of seniors who are paying less for  their prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care Act.                                time  1200    I could read all those letters.   Why do I read the letters of Mr. Walden, Mr. Brady, and Speaker Ryan?   Because they are in charge.   All our constituents, on either side, had no opportunity to testify  on this bill. But Speaker Ryan, Mr. Walden, and Mr. Brady could have  given them that opportunity, and they chose not to. They rationalize it  apparently because, well, we had hearings in the past.   Does this bill have the subject matter of the ACA?   It does. But this bill was offered just some, as I said, 90-or-so  hours ago. And the leader says: Well, that is okay. It is based on all  those hearings we had.   The fact is this bill has not been brought forward for the last 7  years while there was a repeal for ACA.   Why?   We all know why. Mr. Speaker, it is because the majority could not  come to an agreement, and they are not in agreement now. Perhaps, if  this bill stands out there a little bit, it is so flawed they won't be  able to get the votes on their side of the floor.   I was here--I don't think the majority leader was here--when we  adopted the part D prescription drug program. It was called up by the  majority, the Republican Party at the evening hour; and we voted from 3  a.m. until 6 a.m. And when I say we voted, that vote was kept open for  3 hours while they opportuned their Members: You have got to vote for  this. President Bush wants it. You have got to vote for this.   We voted against it. But the vote was held open 3 hours, I tell my  friend. That was not regular order.   Now, our side has held a vote open from time to time--never for 3  hours, but from time to time. That is why it is being rushed. It is not  because they had a lot of hearings before, not because witnesses had  testified they didn't like the Affordable Care Act. We understand that.   The issue is not whether people like or dislike the Affordable Care  Act. It is how are we going to provide what the President has promised:  access for everybody to health care at a lower cost and a better price.   I told the majority leader last week--and I repeat my comments, Mr.  Speaker, to the majority leader this week--if they bring such a bill to  the floor, I will support it. This bill does not do that.   So what President Trump promised during the election and what he  promised from that podium just a few days ago is not what this bill  represents. It is not what they promised to the American people.   What I asked the majority leader was--they are apparently going to  have some additional bills--whether or not they will be also rushed  through without hearings on the premise that there were hearings in the  past.   I repeat that there are a lot of new Members in this body that didn't  have the opportunity to have those hearings and weren't in this body. I  don't know how many there are because I don't know how many Congresses  we are talking about if we adopted this bill 7 years ago and then there  were hearings subsequent.   So I don't know where we are going, Mr. Speaker, but I think the  American people expect an opportunity to be heard. Yes, I may quote  some next week.   The people who were elected by the American people to do their job  have the power to open up the doors and open up the windows and pull  back the curtains so that the American people could come in and  testify. There were all those witnesses who testified in the last  Congress and the Congress before that, but I am talking about the  people who testified during a Congress in which we considered the bill.  We haven't had an open rule this year, Mr. Speaker. We have had  structured rules. We have had no open rule.   So in terms of the majority leader telling me, Mr. Speaker, that we  want everybody to have their opportunity, and he caricatures one  amendment that was--I think I would agree with him--more to show that  not a single Republican would vote. And Mr. Brady, as I pointed out,  didn't vote for his own amendment that he offered when the Affordable  Care Act was marked up to say read the bill.   Time was not given to read the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I understand we are not going to come to any conclusion  today; but I am hopeful that the process that was perpetrated on not  only the minority but also the majority this week will not be repeated,  and that the representations that have been made by the Speaker, by the  young guns, and by so many others would be a process that is, in fact,  open, thoughtful, and democratic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
