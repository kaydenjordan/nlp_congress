 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, since President Trump was inaugurated,  he has unveiled a series of damaging and truly un-American Executive  orders--in particular, the Executive order banning refugees and  individuals from Muslim-majority countries from entering our country.   For President Trump and his team, it is a projection of an inward- looking, isolationist vision for America. For many New Mexicans, myself  included, it is also seen as an attempt to fundamentally change our  American values. We are not a country that discriminates based on how  you pray. We are not a nation that turns our back on the innocent  victims of terrorism or the allies who have risked their own lives so  that American soldiers might live.   President Trump's actions seek to turn us into the kind of  authoritarian Nation that we have always stood against. He has promoted  this dark vision instead of asserting America's longstanding role as a  voice for democracy, for freedom, human rights, the environment,  tolerance, and respect for women--values which extend far beyond our  shores.   In essence, this selfish and bully-like mentality abandon the values  that we hold dear and which have defined our great Nation as a global  power.   It should come as no surprise that President Trump's nominees to be  our Nation's top diplomats--Nikki Haley, Rex Tillerson--have no  diplomatic experience. On Nikki Haley's first day on the job, President  Trump announced that he would be cutting funding for the United Nations  by 40 percent, and Ambassador Haley announced to the world that the  United States is now ``taking names'' of those who disagree with us.   In an attempt to show strength, the Trump administration is actually  creating weakness. By stepping away from multinational organizations  that we helped establish--organizations like the U.N. and NATO--and by  presenting a hostile attitude to other countries and allies, the United  States is walking away from its role as the indispensable Nation.   This morning, former CIA Director and retired GEN David Petraeus  warned that the global alliances of the United States are at risk,  stating:         Americans should not take the current international order       for granted. It did not will itself into existence. We       created it.        Likewise, it is not naturally self-sustaining. We have       sustained it. If we stop doing so, it will fray and,       eventually, collapse.    Just as I am not confident in President Trump's nominee for  Ambassador to the United Nations, I am equally concerned, if not more  so, about his choice for Secretary of State. During his Senate  confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil,  demonstrated that he is blatantly unaware of global affairs. He failed  to recognize and condemn human rights violations around the world,  including in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and declared dangerous  policy positions without knowing what those policies would actually  mean.   In his hearing, Mr. Tillerson repeatedly avoided answering the most  rudimentary questions about foreign policy by stating things like ``I'd  need more information on that issue.''   For as long as I can remember, throughout grade school and college,  women in Saudi Arabia have lacked basic freedoms. Yet Mr. Tillerson  either had no knowledge of women's issues in Saudi Arabia or fails to  value the importance of that issue, which I believe to be an American  value.   The United States faces an increasing number of global threats,  including North Korea, Russia, China, Iran, and terrorist organizations  across multiple continents. We face evolving threats from nonstate  actors and terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic  State. Instability and civil war in the Middle East have led to the  greatest global refugee crisis since World War II. Russia and China are  acting aggressively to assert their influence and challenge and provoke  American interests and allies. Global threats such as pandemic disease,  nuclear proliferation, and climate change require international  cooperation and responses.   The next Secretary of State will be diving headfirst into all of  these incredibly daunting and gravely important foreign policy  challenges. Mr. Tillerson's lack of foreign policy experience, combined  with a President who promotes an isolationist world view, leaves me  deeply concerned for the future of American foreign policy.   The world looks to America to uphold human rights, to promote  democratic values, and to take the lead on many challenges we face as  an international community. The American people look to the White House  and to the State Department to represent our fundamental American  values on that international stage. The American people expect their  leaders to show that their only interest is in representing the  public's best interest.   Americans have reason to doubt where Rex Tillerson's interests rest.  His world view has been shaped through the lens of looking out for what  is best for his company's profits, not what is best for the American  people, not what is best to address complex international challenges.  Just like negotiating a real estate deal does not prepare one to lead  the Nation, negotiating oil deals does not prepare you to be a diplomat  whose primary interest is in advocating for American values.   When Mr. Tillerson has worked with foreign governments to pursue  lucrative oil deals and profits, he has been agnostic to human rights  and to America's diplomatic and security interests as well. As Exxon's  CEO during the Iraq war, Mr. Tillerson undermined the State  Department's efforts to keep Iraq cohesive as a nation and instead  served the interest of his company's financial gain, in direct conflict  to the American interest.   Under Mr. Tillerson's guidance, ExxonMobil signed a deal directly  with the Kurdish administration in the country's northern region, a  move that fueled Kurdish secessionist ambitions and undercut the  legitimacy of Iraq's central government. This deal was drawn despite  the State Department's recommendation that they wait until national  legislation was passed because a law governing nationwide oil  investments was being reviewed by Parliament.   In Russia, Mr. Tillerson worked closely with Vladimir Putin's  government to forge deals to drill for oil in the Arctic, the Black  Sea, and Siberia. Mr. Tillerson developed such a cozy relationship with  the Kremlin that in 2013 he was awarded the Order of Friendship by  Vladimir Putin, the highest honor awarded to non-Russians.   After Russia unlawfully invaded the Ukraine and took Crimea, the  United States and the European Union enacted sanctions against Russia  that Mr. Tillerson would be partly responsible for overseeing as  Secretary of State. Right now, when we are trying to hold Russia  accountable for its illegal aggression in Eastern Europe, for its war  crimes in Aleppo, and for its interference in our own Nation's  election, how on Earth can we trust someone with such a cozy  relationship with the Putin government to be our Secretary of State?   Mr. Tillerson's record also leads one to wonder how he will address  the imperative to implement the Paris climate agreement, especially  since President Trump is now exploring how to withdraw from it. At the  height of the debate on climate change legislation in Congress, Mr.  Tillerson spent tens of millions of dollars to kill a bill that would  have reduced our carbon emissions sooner. It has also been reported  that his scientists at Exxon have known about the relationship between  carbon emissions and climate since the 1980s and that Exxon even made  business decisions about what resources to develop and how based on  that knowledge. Yet, under Mr. Tillerson's leadership, they chose to  withhold those findings and fund  [[Page S547]]  groups determined to sow confusion and doubt. How can we be confident  that Mr. Tillerson will help America address the impacts of climate  change and put America's security and values first as our top diplomat?   Those conflicts of interest are troubling enough, but the most  troubling reason I cannot support Mr. Tillerson's nomination is this:  In just the first week and a half of the Trump White House, we have  seen numerous cases of Trump nominees saying one thing during their  confirmation hearings before this body and then the administration  turning around and doing something entirely different. After Secretary  Mattis told us that he opposed the Muslim travel ban and Director  Pompeo stated his opposition in hearings to torture, we saw this  administration move forward with both.   I have seen nothing that shows me that Rex Tillerson will stand up to  President Trump's dangerous vision for American foreign policy. What  will he do to stand up for NATO? What indication do we have that he  will call on the President to act in the interests of the American  people and not the interests of President Trump's business holdings in  numerous nations around the world?    The Secretary of State sits on the National Security Council. Will  Mr. Tillerson stand up to Steve Bannon, President Trump's political  strategist who has been outrageously placed on the National Security  Council, while, I would add, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the  Director of National Intelligence were demoted? President Trump has  shown that he trusts the former leader of the far-right Web site  Breitbart News more than our leading generals and his appointed leader  of the intelligence community. You can already see the influence of Mr.  Bannon, who has made a career out of selling hateful and divisive  propaganda aimed at women, Hispanics, African Americans, Jews, and  other minorities in the actions President Trump has taken in his first  days in office.   During his first week in office, President Trump floated the idea of  bringing back the CIA's use of ``black site'' prisons and torture  techniques, imposed a gag order on our Federal agencies, and renewed  talk of a wall on our southern border.   All of this culminated with an Executive order blocking refugees from  around the world from entering the United States. This is not  greatness. In fact, this is un-American. I will not stand aside as the  values that created the greatest Nation on Earth are trampled upon.   This dangerous Executive action has already had a clear human impact.  In New Mexico, the Albuquerque Journal reports that our universities  have issued an advisory to foreign students and faculty: ``Don't leave  the country if you want to come back.'' Think about that.   My office has already heard from New Mexicans who fear for their  safety and the safety of their families abroad as a direct result of  this order. A man who moved to the United States as a refugee from Iraq  and settled in my hometown told me that his wife and two kids went to  Baghdad to attend his mother-in-law's funeral. They are currently in  Iraq and scheduled to return in February. They are all green card  holders. They are part of our community. President Trump's Executive  order has left him and his family feeling in limbo. He said: ``I am  afraid about our destiny as a family, I am afraid I will lose them.''   The heartbreaking human impact we have already seen is only part of  why the Muslim travel ban was such an appalling action for the  President to take.   George Washington once said: ``I had always hoped that this land  might become a safe & agreeable Asylum to the virtuous & persecuted  part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong.'' It is very  clear that President Trump is clearly no George Washington. This  Executive order flies in the face of that sentiment and, I believe, the  sentiment we share as Americans.   I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump about  this order. I am particularly outraged about the absurd and careless  nature of the order, which will have a profound effect on many Iraqi  men and women who risked their lives and the lives of their families on  behalf of our soldiers, on behalf of American soldiers.   Late last summer, I traveled to Iraq, to Kuwait, to the heart of  Africa, and I met with top military officials to discuss operations  against ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations. In order to  find a lasting solution in that volatile region, we must take a smart  approach that provides training, resources, and support to our regional  allies, like the Iraqi security forces, rather than putting tens of  thousands of U.S. troops on the frontlines there ourselves. Alienating  our regional allies, alienating Muslims as a whole puts all of that at  risk.   Former Cabinet Secretaries, senior government officials, diplomats,  military servicemembers, and intelligence community professionals who  have served in the Bush administration and the Obama administration  together have expressed their deep concern this week with President  Trump's Executive order. In a letter, they warned:         This Order not only jeopardizes tens of thousands of lives,       it has caused a crisis right here in America and will do       long-term damage to our national security.        In the middle of the night, just as we were beginning our       nation's commemoration of the Holocaust, dozens of refugees       onboard flights to the United States and thousands of       visitors were swept up in an Order of unprecedented scope,       apparently with little to no oversight or input from national       security professionals.    Also this week, the Iraqi Parliament, in direct response to President  Trump's Muslim travel ban, voted to implement an identical visa ban on  Americans.   How can we possibly think this is in our national security interests?   Rex Tillerson has not answered questions about President Trump's  Muslim travel ban. Mr. Tillerson needs to tell us where he stands on  this un-American policy. If we are going to move forward on his  nomination, Mr. Tillerson needs to reassure the American people and he  needs to reassure this body that he understands the repercussions of  these kinds of appalling actions. He needs to show us that he will  stand up for American values and against the President's dangerous  impulses that will isolate our Nation, alienate our allies, and  abdicate our role as leader of the free world. Mr. Tillerson has not  shown any of that to me, to this body, or to the American public.   Thousands of New Mexicans have flooded my office with letters,  emails, and phone calls urging me to oppose his nomination. I share New  Mexicans' well-founded concerns about Mr. Tillerson's qualifications to  lead the State Department and to stand up for our Nation's interests.   I will not support his nomination, and I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to stop and think carefully about this vote we are  about to take. Our Nation's future role in the world is at stake.
