 Mr. Speaker, since I joined this body in  January, I have done my darnedest to steer clear of the political  circus that we see on a daily basis in Washington.   Instead, I have worked with so many Members to pass legislation  preventing child abuse and legislation that makes it easier for  Americans to save for school and for their retirement. We have made  progress, and I have been a key part of that progress in USMCA, in  welfare reform, and in implementing the farm bill.   But, Mr. Speaker, the impeachment proceedings going on in this  Chamber in the last few weeks have given me pause, and they should give  pause to every Member of this Chamber and to all American people.   I know--we all know--that some Members are for impeachment and others  of us are opposed. But we should all admit that, by its very nature,  impeachment is emotional, it is taxing, and it is divisive.   You are talking about removing our President from office. This is no  small thing. This is changing the trajectory of this country.   Given how contentious and given how important that proceeding is, we  have an obligation to play by the rules and to have a process that is  open, that is sound, and that is fair. Mr. Speaker, we are failing at  that special obligation.   First, the Speaker has launched impeachment without a vote by this  body, and that is unprecedented. Members have been denied their  authority, their voice, their opportunity to be on the Record in that  matter.   Let us be clear: Under the Constitution, the authority to launch  impeachment rests with the U.S. House of Representatives, not with the  Speaker and not with the chair of House intelligence.   Second, this proceeding has not been open and transparent. Instead,  Members have been denied access to witness testimony and kicked out of  committees. There is no live streaming and there is no TV coverage as  we have seen in past impeachments. The result is that Americans don't  have access to important facts because they can't get them.   Finally, this proceeding has not been fair. In the past, Presidents  have had an opportunity to have counsel present. Counsel has had an  opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, and they have been given an  opportunity to review the evidence and to prepare a defense instead of  battling secondhand accounts of closed-door testimony selectively  leaked to the media.   228 Members of this body have already announced that they are for  impeachment even though the evidence is not fully gathered yet, and, in  any case, they have not reviewed it. How is that fair?   Mr. Speaker, elections matter; transparency matters; due process  matters; and faith in this Constitution, in our Constitution, and in  institutions matter.   As I said, it is time that this body lives up to its special  obligation. Our country deserves nothing less.                            ____________________
