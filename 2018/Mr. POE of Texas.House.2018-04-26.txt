 Mr. Speaker, Pakistan has been betraying the  international community and is supporting terrorism. The Financial  Action Task Force officially placed Pakistan on its grey list of  countries not doing enough to counter terror finance. Not only does  Pakistan provide safe haven for all stripes of terrorist groups, it  also turns a blind eye to so-called Islamic charities tied to terrorist  operations and other terrorist financiers. Pakistan has paid lip  service to the fight against terrorism, while supporting the very  criminals that kill Americans and our allies.   Mr. Speaker, I was just at the White House where the President  honored many of our wounded warriors, some of them wounded in  Afghanistan and Iraq. Pakistan's intelligence services have fostered  working relationships with the Haqqani network, al-Qaida, and the  Taliban--terrorist groups. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Government has  received over $30 billion of American aid.   Pakistan is a Benedict Arnold unfaithful ally. We need to stop paying  Pakistan to betray us. They will do it for free.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
