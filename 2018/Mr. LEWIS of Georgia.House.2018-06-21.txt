 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend,  Mr. Nadler, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart to oppose this mean-spirited  bill: heavy because the House does nothing to stop families from being  torn apart or locked in cages behind bars; heavy because you still  won't bring a clean Dream Act to the floor; heavy because you do  nothing to stop this administration's assault on immigrant families and  communities.   The world is watching with shame and disgust. The late A. Philip  Randolph, the dean of Black leadership during the sixties, reminded us  that we may have come to this great land in different ships, but we all  are in the same boat now. And just 3 short years ago, the Pope reminded  this body to do unto others as you would have them to do unto you.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. The very soul of our Nation is at  stake, and time is running out.   The moral question is simple, Mr. Speaker: Will you lead or will you  follow? Will you bring a bipartisan, compassionate bill to the floor?  Will we show the Nation and the world that we respect human rights and  the dignity of every man, woman, and child?                                time  1900    Mr. Speaker, will you offer your brothers and sisters a lifevest, or  will you let them drown?   We can do better as a Nation and as a people.   Will you be a headlight? Will you be a headlight? Will you lead? Will  you be compassionate and look out for all of our citizens? Look out for  the Dreamers, look out for the little children, the mothers and the  fathers? The choice and responsibility are yours, Mr. Speaker.
