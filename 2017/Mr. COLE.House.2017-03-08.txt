 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  and, frankly, I want to thank her for taking on this rule and the role  she plays in this House. She came to Congress with an extraordinary  expertise in national security, probably unsurpassed by any new Member.  So she is not only a valuable member of the Rules Committee, she is an  important voice for the security of the United States of America in a  very dangerous era.   Before I begin, I want to actually agree with my friend from  Massachusetts on a couple of very important points that he made. First,  I want to agree with him that this should have been done earlier. My  friend is exactly right about this. This could have been done, in my  view, in November and December. We should have gotten it done then. We  would have avoided a lot of problems that come with a continuing  resolution.   I am very pleased that we are moving it now, but earlier would have  been better, no question about it. And that is true with every other  bill, and my friend made that point as well. We really should make sure  that each of the appropriations bills are passed. All of the problems  associated with the continuing resolution are so evident for our  military, are evident, frankly, in every other department. So I would  hope my leadership continues to do what they are doing today and that  is move these bills forward.   My friend is also right, in my opinion, about the authorization of  the use of military force. This is something we have agreed on, even  when we disagree on other things. This is a congressional  responsibility. The President has announced he is going to announce a  new strategy going forward on ISIS. I would suggest to my side of the  aisle and to the administration, now would be a great time to come to  the Congress so we could have this robust debate on deploying and using  our military and discharge our constitutional responsibilities.   I am less persuaded by my friend's arguments about the spending  levels here. I just point out for the record this is well below what  former Secretary of Defense Gates, when he was Secretary in the Obama  administration, recommended we should be doing at this time. Frankly,  that is because the last administration dropped the ball and simply  didn't listen to its own experts as to what the appropriate level of  our forces should be.   The underlying legislation here is an excellent bill. My friends have  already talked about it in detail. I am going to take a 30,000-foot  look at the bill and remind our listeners and our colleagues, there are  three important objectives that this bill achieves:   The first is stopping the erosion in end strength, something that  went on for years under the last administration that somehow thought we  would be safer if our military got smaller. That was a bad assumption.  [[Page H1607]]    The second is to restart the procurement cycle. We have fallen far,  far behind what we should be doing in terms of replacing, upgrading,  and improving the weapons systems and the communication systems, every  system that we move into war with and that we ask our men and women to  use.   And finally, this actually begins to address a problem that my friend  from Wyoming discussed in great detail: readiness. We simply are not  ready now to fight with the effectiveness. Now, I don't have any doubt,  if we had to deploy massively, that our forces would do well and they  would win, but a lot of people would die because they hadn't had the  appropriate training, the appropriate time on task to get ready.    The other great objective that this bill meets is that we finally  match up spending with the authorization. Last year, we had an  excellent authorization bill out of the House Armed Services Committee.  Unfortunately, that doesn't get you very far if the money doesn't match  the policies and the recommendations that they advanced. This now takes  care of that problem.   I also remind our colleagues that passing this bill is only a first  step. As my friend from Wyoming pointed out, we are going to need a  supplemental later this year, just for this year. We are going to need  a robust increase in the fiscal year 2018 authorization and  appropriation, something that the President has committed to and  something I hope we can advance on a bipartisan basis.   Finally, again, as my friend pointed out, real military buildups take  years, not months and weeks. We are going to have to be at this task  for several years to restore and strengthen, frankly, what we allowed  to decline, what the last administration allowed to decline over  several years.   So this is an extraordinary first step, but it is only a first step;  and I would hope my colleagues would join us on a bipartisan basis,  while we have differences, but come together and put the defense of the  country in a very dangerous time ahead of all else that we do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill and the underlying  legislation, and I urge the passage of the rule.   Again, I want to thank my friend from Wyoming. I want to thank my  friend from Massachusetts. We sometimes disagree, but he makes very  valuable and very important points in some of the critiques he offers,  and I hope that we heed them well.   With that, again, Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the underlying  legislation and the adoption of the rule.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his kind words and  for understanding that it is inappropriate for Congress to continue  these wars without having a vote on an AUMF. I hope that that changes,  but I appreciate his support, and there is bipartisan support for  having this body actually do its job. That shouldn't be a radical idea,  but, unfortunately, nowadays, doing our job seems to be something that  a lot of people don't want to do.   Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of the year, the Republican  majority adopted a rule to explicitly exempt the cost of any bill that  repeals or amends the Affordable Care Act from a requirement that it  not increase spending by $5 billion. They effectively adopted a  legislative blindfold to completely ignore the cost of repeal.   Let me show you the poster of the language, and I am happy to provide  this to my colleagues on the Republican side. I will even give you my  bifocals if you want to read it, because I think it is important that  people understand what it says. It says:         Point of order: It shall not be in order to consider any       bill that would cause a net increase in direct spending in       excess of $5 billion.        Limitation: This subsection shall not apply to any bill       repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, as you can see, with this act, the majority declared  that they were not going to let the rules of this House, which are  purportedly in place to ensure fiscal discipline, stand in the way of  repealing the Affordable Care Act no matter how much it would cost  American families.   But, Mr. Speaker, it gets even worse. As we stand here today,  Republicans have taken their head-in-the-sand approach to the  Affordable Care Act to a new low. Right now, both the Energy and  Commerce and Ways and Means Committees are considering Republican  legislation to repeal healthcare reform without providing any analysis  from the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget Office on the  cost of their legislation.   So let me put this another way. Earlier this year, the Republicans  said: It does not matter how much it will cost to take health care away  from millions of Americans. Now they are saying they don't even want to  know how much it will cost or what impact it will have on American  families.   Mr. Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget  Office. That office costs nearly $50 million a year. We pay them to  advise us precisely at times like this. Republicans have talked about  repeal and replace for 7 years. Acting like they had not enough time to  weigh the cost of their actions would be laughable if it were not so  irresponsible.   Now, we Democrats care about health care and we care about costs and  we demand to know what the impact of this repeal bill will be. Members  should not be asked to vote on this legislation until they know the  full weight of their decision.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made  publicly available before any legislation that amends or repeals the  Affordable Care Act may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or  Ways and Means Committee or on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of that  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia). Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), who has been a leader on this  issue, and he will explain this even further.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for yielding.   Before I begin my prepared remarks, I had no idea there was such  interest in the Arbuckle watershed, but I am flattered and pleased that  all of you are here for this important legislation.   I rise in support H.R. 132, the Arbuckle Project Maintenance Complex  and District Office Conveyance Act. This bill is straightforward. As  has been mentioned, it is a land conveyance which has both Federal and  local support.   I would like to remind my colleagues this legislation was passed in  the 114th Congress on December 7, 2016, by a vote of 412-1. Clearly, it  was so good, everybody wanted it back again.   H.R. 132 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey  certain lands and buildings of the Arbuckle Project in Murray County,  Oklahoma, to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District.   In 1962, Congress authorized the payment of reimbursable costs for  construction, operation, and maintenance of the Bureau of Reclamation's  Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in south-central Oklahoma. The  district completed repayment of the capital costs of the project in  September of 2012.   In accordance with the Bureau of Reclamation's policy framework for  title transfer, in December 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation and the  district executed an agreement to transfer, in fee title, certain  facilities that could be more effectively and efficiently managed at  the local level.   The title transfer involves approximately 2.83 acres of land. On this  land is a small house, associated structures, and the conservancy  district's headquarters office building. The house and property are  used to accommodate a district employee who maintains and inspects the  dam and the pumping facilities. The headquarters office building is the  base of operation for the district.   This bill also divests the Federal Government of its responsibility  and liability associated with the district's facilities. Reclamation  and the district have worked cooperatively and successfully to address  all of the elements necessary to bring this legislation forward and  make this transfer proceed as smoothly as possible.   I am pleased this bill is an agreement in which both the Federal and  local interests are satisfied. I want to urge all of my colleagues to  support this legislation once again.   I want to again thank the chairman for his help in expediting this  matter.
