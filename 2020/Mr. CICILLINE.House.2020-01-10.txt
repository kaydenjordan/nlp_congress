 Mr. Speaker, I just returned from overseas. I led a  delegation of our colleagues, a bipartisan delegation, to visit our  troops during the Christmas holiday; and, of course, we all were struck  by the extraordinary service of these brave men and women who are  serving our country.   One of the things they shared about was, of course, their concerns  about things back at home with their families. It reminded me that the  agenda that we develop to address the urgent priorities of the American  people remains important: to drive down the cost of healthcare, to  raise family incomes and rebuild the crumbling infrastructure of our  county, to take on the corruption and self-dealing in Washington, and  to get the government working for the people again.   That is what Democrats have been working on in a bipartisan way. We  have passed over 400 pieces of legislation; 275 of those bills are  bipartisan. Sadly, 80 percent of those bills are stuck on Mitch  McConnell's desk.   So, as we return from this trip, I am reminded that this is an  opportunity to call on the Senate majority leader. We are working hard  to prevent war with Iran. We are working hard to hold the President  accountable for his misconduct. But our most important priority is to  deliver on those promises we made to the American people: to drive down  the cost of healthcare, to raise family incomes, to rebuild the  infrastructure of our country, and to get government working for the  people again.   It is time for the Senate majority leader to take those bills up and  give them a vote. Our men and women deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
