 Mr. Speaker, because I was chairing a Committee on  the assault weapons ban, I missed the following vote. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 542.    Mr. Speaker, because I was held up chairing a  hearing on the assault weapons ban, I missed the motion on ordering the  previous question to the rule, House Resolution 577, regarding the  Homeland Security bill and the whistleblower bill. If I had been here,  I would have voted ``yea.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and certainly the  ranking member for his position on this bill, but I rise with great  enthusiasm to support H.R. 2203 by the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas, and as well to indicate to her that I had wished that the joy of  doing this would be that we are passing productive legislation, but the  sadness is that it is based upon the history and the evidence of what  is going on at the southern border where she lives.   So I hope those who are waiting for this bill will realize that it is  going to pass this House and that we are going to move this bill to the  United States Senate and ask the Senate whether, in fact, they believe  in the humanity of all people.   Let me share with you what this bill is about from my perspective.  First of all, I take no backseat to dealing with the border patrol  agents, the CBP, and any others.   In 2004, Senator Kerry and I, he in the Senate and I in the House,  helped contribute to the modernizing of the border patrol, because when  I went down to the border, they didn't have the tools that they needed.  We gave them the night goggles, we gave them the kinds of equipment  that they needed, those heavy terrain vehicles. We gave them the fast  boats that they needed.   We gave them their equipment, recognizing that we had been organized  just a few years as the Homeland Security Committee, and we wanted our  border to be safe and secure, but at the same time, we wanted to make  sure that we had comprehensive immigration reform. That was imploded  when we could not pass a major bill that came to this House.   So I am curious why anyone would not want to have a bill that says it  is the Homeland Security Improvement Act.   So I stand here in the name of Roger, 9 months old, who was separated  from his parents by the Trump administration's heinous policies of  family separation.   This bill deals with eliminating family separation.   I stand here for the mother who had had a baby, and 45 days after  having that baby, she had not been to a hospital, but she was in a  detention center.   I think it is fair that there be a policy for border patrol agents to  wear those cameras, like any other law enforcement, to protect them and  others; the limitation on the separation of families; the prohibition  of exceeding 72 hours in short-term detention; the ombudsman, which is  so important so that we have a fair investment.   To my friend that was on the floor dealing with human trafficking:  Any day of the week, I will join him in a bill that deals with human  trafficking. I held the first hearing by Homeland Security on human  trafficking in the field almost 8 years ago, because Houston is a known  epicenter for human trafficking.   But right now, we are dealing with the improvement of this  Department, and I believe this commission is going to be important and  crucial for migrant families and children that have been separated and  abused by the Trump administration.   Do we want to see human beings in cages? Or do we want to have a fair  system that protects the United States and the border from the  intrusion of those who would do us harm?   A regular immigration system would allow these desperate families to  come and be processed.   I would have wanted the Mexican program to be out. I would have  wanted to have my amendment that deals with making sure that the FOIA  amendment covers every detention center, private and nonprivate, that  would have ensured that they had to report about what was going on  inside these detention centers.   Those amendments were not allowed at this time, but we will work with  the gentlewoman and work with Homeland Security to make sure that we do  not have Members of Congress blocked from coming to these private  detention centers that women and children are in.   But this is a good start. This gives tools to those who are in need  of those particular tools.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the  additional time.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to focus on this: We know in the past year,  under this administration, seven-plus children have died. How many  adults have also passed? It is as important to report the deaths of  individuals in our own prison systems as it is to report migrant  deaths. They are human beings.   It is important to be able to use and to understand the use of force.  To every law enforcement officer, I say to their families, I want them  to go home to their families. But to every human being who comes  desperate for the hope and the blessings of America who has not come to  do us harm, I want to be able to have the oversight that is in this  bill, the accountability and transparency in that border area.   We all know that El Paso has been touted as the safest city in the  Nation. It was not an immigrant that killed 22 people. It was not an  immigrant whose violence and victimization and utilization of an  automatic weapon caused the injuries to the people whom I had to visit  in the hospitals of El Paso. It was not an immigrant.   Mr. Speaker, this is a worthy bill that will, in fact, provide the  right direction for the Homeland Security Department. I rise to support  H.R. 2203.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2203, the Homeland  Security Improvement Act.  [[Page H7933]]    I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Escobar for her leadership in  drafting this important piece of legislation.   As a member of the House Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland  Security, I am well aware of the many problems associated with this  Administration's immigration policy.   Independent Ombudsman:   Establishes an independent Ombudsman for Border and Immigration  Related Concerns within DHS.   The functions of the Ombudsman include establishing an independent,  neutral, and confidential process to assist individuals with complaints  against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP).   Provides for annual reporting on the complaints filed, including the  number and types of complaints received to identify trends and solve  systemic problems.   Reviews compliance by CBP and ICE with all departmental policies and  standards related to treatment of migrants in custody, including with  respect to force-feeding.   Makes the complaint resolution process easy to follow by establishing  a publicly available website.   Border Communities Liaison:   Directs the Ombudsman, in conjunction with the Office for Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties at DHS, to appoint a Border Community  Liaison in each Border Patrol sector along the northern and southern  border to:   foster cooperation between ICE, CBP, and border communities;   consult with border communities on CBP and ICE policies, directives,  and programs;   receive feedback from border communities about CBP and ICE activities  in the region; and   report annually to the Ombudsman.   Border Oversight Panel:   Directs the Ombudsman to establish a Border Oversight Panel to  evaluate and make recommendations regarding the border enforcement  policies, strategies, and programs that directly affect border  communities.   Specifically directs the Panel to pay special attention to the way  DHS policies impact due process, property rights, legal obligations,  and migrant and officer safety.   Training Evaluations:   Requires the Ombudsman to conduct annual evaluations of all training  given to the agents and officers at CBP and ICE.   The Ombudsman must examine whether there is training in specific key  areas including community policing, enforcement near sensitive  locations, interacting with vulnerable populations, and professional  and ethical conduct (like lawful use of force, LGBTQ sensitivity, and  sexual harassment).   Mandates that the Ombudsman provide recommendations to the Secretary  on additional training needs. The Secretary must respond to these  recommendations publicly within 180 days with an action plan to  implement such recommendations and a justification for why any of such  recommendations have been rejected.   Body-Worn Cameras:   Directs the Ombudsman, in coordination with CBP Commissioner, ICE  Director, and labor organizations representing agents and officers, to  submit to Congress a plan for requiring the use of body-worn cameras by  U.S. Border Patrol agents and ICE officers when engaged in border  security and immigration enforcement activities.   Provides that the plan must consider existing state and local body- worn camera policies and principles developed by major civil and human  rights organizations.   I offered an amendment to H.R. 2203, that was not included in this  final bill.   This Jackson Lee Amendment, listed as No. 6 on the Rules Committee  Roster, makes a good bill better by creating an affirmative obligation  on the part of Customs and Border Protection to provide access to  records of entities that contract with the agency to provide services  related to detention or removal of persons, including children.   The Jackson Lee Amendment states simply:   ``In the case of a contractor including a State licensed, vetted, and  qualified contractor, and a nonprofit entity, which has a contract with  U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the provision of direct or  support services associated with providing care for individuals,  including unaccompanied alien children, apprehended at the southern  border of the United States, any record of the contractor held by U.S.  Customs and Border Protection shall be considered an agency record for  purposes of section 552 on title 5, United States Code.''   Since 1967, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has provided the  public the right to request access to records from any federal agency.   It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know  about their government.   Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested  under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which  protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law  enforcement.   The FOIA also requires agencies to proactively post online certain  categories of information, including frequently requested records.   As Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court have all  recognized, the FOIA is a vital part of our democracy.   I will continue to work with my colleagues on gaining greater  transparency and oversight of CBP.   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.    Madam Speaker, today the transcript was released of  the conversation between the President of the United States and the  President of Ukraine.   As a person who believes in the Constitution and the rule of law, it  is crucial that we proceed with the work that is necessary, and so I  rise to add my enthusiastic support for H. Res. 576 that just passed,  expressing the sense of Congress with respect to the whistleblower  complaint, in order to protect the whistleblower and to have the  complaint sent to the United States Congress, which, I believe, it is  on its way, and, if not, we must have it as quickly as possible.   Let me also say that today we had a very important hearing in the  Judiciary Committee regarding the ban on assault weapons. It has been  53 days since El Paso, 52 days since Dayton, and 25 days since Odessa.   It seems that the leadership of the NRA finds my statements  attractive, and so they have taken to the airways with their cousin,  FOX News, to talk about the opinion that I had regarding the AR-15  that, to me, ``it was as heavy as 10 boxes.''   As a person who believes in the First Amendment, I have a right to  say that. To all of the members of the NRA: I believe in your beliefs  and your right to believe them, but you are being led by an unfortunate  group of leaders who simply want to attack and have no solutions.   I will take the hit from the NRA to save lives. I am not afraid of  the NRA.                            ____________________
