 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  as in morning business.    Mr. President, what has happened to the State Department  under this administration is almost impossible to imagine. What we are  seeing there is a devastation and a decimation of the resources of a  great part of our government, one of the most important parts. It is a  small percentage of our budget, but the work done by the State  Department is critically important in maintaining the position of the  United States around the world, projecting our image--our values--where  we can, helping the helpless in parts of the world where many countries  come to their aid.   Under this administration in the last year, we have seen things  happen that are unimaginable. When it gets down to the basics, key  posts are unfilled at the State Department. There are more than 30  vacancies in ambassadorial positions. Don't blame Congress for it. In  many cases, they have not even sent us the names of the nominees.   Can anyone here believe that we still do not have an ambassador from  the Trump administration to South Korea? South Korea? We spend time  talking about the Korean Peninsula and the future of the Korean  Peninsula, and this President cannot find an ambassador to represent  the United States in South Korea. What is the possible explanation for  this? He can't blame anyone but himself. He has not sent us a nominee  to even consider.   We are faced with a nuclear-armed North Korean dictator. We have  28,000 American U.S. military personnel who are literally risking their  lives in South Korea, and we don't have a diplomat on the scene to try  to make sure that the United States is well represented.   The Department is also hemorrhaging top staff. Under Secretary Tom  Shannon--one of the most respected--is scheduled to leave soon. It is  no surprise this is happening. President Trump has repeatedly proposed  dramatic, irresponsible cuts in the budget of the Department of State.  His administration has kept top diplomats out of key discussions and  deliberations. How, at a time of such international unrest in this  dangerous world we live in, can we be diminishing and demoralizing our  topline diplomats? How can that be a smart way to keep America safe?   I have been hoping someone would come along to right the ship at the  State Department--someone to draw on this amazing reservoir of American  talent in the areas of diplomacy and foreign policy, someone to make  sure our best diplomatic efforts are projected to prevent conflict and  to further American interests, someone who could be a proud face of  America around the world.   It was in this context and with this challenge that I met with Mike  Pompeo. He and I have met and had serious and challenging discussions  before, notably when he was nominated to be Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency. We met again a few weeks ago. It was a good,  candid conversation. He seemed to understand the desperate situation at  the State Department and that the State Department's top experts should  be included in key administration discussions.   This conversation left me in the same place, I believe, that Senator  Menendez pondered at the end of Pompeo's Foreign Relations Committee  hearing: Who is the real Mike Pompeo?   You see, I find it hard to square the reasonable man I met with the  other day with some of his actions and comments. For example, has  Michael Pompeo completely renounced the use of torture? He said he  would not obey an order from the President to use torture. Let me add  it is tragic that we have a President who brags about using such  illegal, abhorrent, and un-American approaches, but we still have to  worry about this. Contrast that with Mr. Pompeo's previous defense of  waterboarding or his jarring comments about the 2014 Senate  Intelligence Committee's torture report when he said ``Senator  Feinstein [today] has put American lives at risk'' and that the  intelligence operatives whose acts were scrutinized were ``heroes, not  pawns in some liberal game being played by the ACLU and Senator  Feinstein.''   Or what about Mr. Pompeo's association with prominent anti-Muslim  figures in the United States, like Frank Gaffney? The Southern Poverty  Law Center calls Mr. Gaffney one of America's most notorious  Islamophobes. For  [[Page S2410]]  example, Gaffney favors congressional hearings to unmask subversive  Muslim conspiracies and was even banned from the far-right Conservative  Political Action Conference events after accusing two of its organizers  of being agents of the Muslim Brotherhood. Yet Mr. Pompeo appeared on  Mr. Gaffney's radio show at least 24 times between 2013 and 2016.   What about when Mr. Pompeo used his position on the House  Intelligence Committee to accuse then-Secretary of State Clinton of  orchestrating a wide-ranging coverup of the Benghazi attacks that ended  in the tragic loss of American lives in Libya? Is there anyone here who  believes for a minute that was not a political witch hunt, which in  part led to the further discrediting of the critical congressional  committee involved--a committee that, incidentally, has lost all  legitimacy in the current investigation over Russia's involvement in  our election?   I face this decision on Mr. Pompeo with real concern. There are many  policy issues on which Mr. Pompeo and I might disagree, notably on the  Iran nuclear agreement. I asked him point-blank: What do you think is  going to happen to this nuclear agreement to stop the Iranians from  developing a nuclear weapon?   His conjecture was that this President would walk away from it and  hope that our European allies, who also signed on to this agreement,  would enforce it. Does that sound like a cogent foreign policy for a  leader in the world like the United States?   Our Nation desperately needs someone to bring leadership to the State  Department, but torture, Islamophobia, and wild political conspiracy  theories don't seem to mesh with being our Nation's top diplomat from  where I am standing.   I will vote against Mr. Pompeo's nomination. I sincerely hope I am  wrong about this nominee. I believe he will be approved by a very small  margin. I hope he will, in the end, uphold our Nation's laws and values  when it comes to torture, tolerance, and international cooperation. I  hope he will make sure diplomacy is exhausted before we turn to yet  another war and, in particular, that he will resist John Bolton and  others who are notorious for wanting to rush into military conflict. I  hope he will listen carefully to Secretary Mattis at the Defense  Department--someone I supported and someone I trust. I hope he will be  clear to this President, as the man who is the Secretary of State in  his administration, that climate change and Russia are truly threats to  our Nation and well-being. Doing this will help strengthen America's  leadership abroad and help build greater trust and cooperation in  Congress.    Mr. President, last Sunday, April 22, marked the 49th  Earth Day. Given the Trump administration's reckless assault on the  environment, it is frightening to think where we might be on the 50th  Earth Day.   President Trump hasn't built that ``big, beautiful'' wall he  promised. More than a year into his term, he still hasn't filled dozens  of critical posts, from Cabinet Secretaries to ambassadors.   Looking at what hasn't been done, a reasonable person might assume  that this President still hasn't learned how to make government work.  That might be true in many areas, but when it comes to the environment,  it is dead wrong.   From day one of his administration, President Trump has used budget  cuts, executive orders, and other administrative and regulatory tools  to push a concerted rollback of environmental protections. President  Trump has repealed or frozen some 850 rules and regulations, many of  which have a direct impact on the environment.   He has signaled his intention to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris  climate accord. America is the largest emitter of carbon gases, and we  are the only nation on Earth that is not part of the global effort to  save the planet from climate chaos and catastrophe.   Under this President, we have ceded global leadership on the climate  to other nations, especially to China. Not only is that shameful, it is  bad business. Some of the best-paying jobs of the 21st century will be  in renewable energy industries. How are we going to create those jobs  and industries in America with a President and administration that  refuse to admit even the existence of climate change?   Since Earth Day last year, the U.S. has suffered some of the  deadliest and costliest disasters in our history. Last August,  Hurricane Irma battered the southern U.S., especially south Florida. It  was followed quickly by Hurricane Harvey, which caused an estimated  $200 billion in damage and pummeled Houston. In September, Hurricane  Maria caused the worst natural disaster on record in Puerto Rico.  Nearly 8 months later, most of the island is still without electricity.  After the hurricanes came the wildfires, including some of the worst  wildfires in California's history.   Scientists warn that without significant reductions in carbon  emissions, climate chaos will become more frequent, more deadly and  more expensive.   What is FEMA's response? Strategic plans drawn up by FEMA during both  the Obama and George W. Bush administrations acknowledged climate  change as a serious threat, right up there with terrorist attacks.  Under this President, FEMA has dropped any mention of climate change  from its strategic plan. The reality we dare not deny has become the  crisis whose name the Agency dare not utter.   Last year and again this year, President Trump has sent Congress  budget plans that would gut the Department of Interior and the  Environmental Protection Agency.   Scott Pruitt, the President's choice to run EPA, is an ethical  nightmare, but he is a polluter's dream. He has vowed to withdraw the  Clean Power Plan, a plan to cut emissions from the U.S. power sector by  32 percent from 2005 by 2030. Administrator Pruitt has signaled that he  wants to roll back modest new fuel efficiency standards for cars and  light-duty trucks--standards that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas  emissions significantly. The EPA under Donald Trump and Scott Pruitt  has suspended the ``waters of the United States'' rule, designed to  reduce pollution in 60 percent of the Nation's lakes, rivers, and  streams.   EPA is not the only member of the Trump Environmental Wrecking Crew.   Today, 94 percent of the outer continental shelf in the Pacific,  Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans is off limits from oil and gas exploration.  The Department of the Interior is proposing to open 90 percent of the  outer continental shelf for future oil and gas drilling. On top of  this, this administration has weakened safety requirements that prevent  oil spills.   Interior's Bureau of Land Management is also selling off thousands of  federally owned parcels of land for oil and gas development. Among the  national treasures up for sale are two national monuments in Utah: the  Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears, home to some of the richest  and most important archeological finds in our Nation.   Interior Secretary Zinke had a special flag designed for himself and  ordered that it be flown whenever he was in the Department  headquarters. It would be more fitting if he flew the white flag of  surrender because that is what this administration is doing.   They are surrendering America's global leadership in the efforts to  save this planet from climate catastrophe, and they are surrendering  decades of important and lifesaving progress we have made since the  first Earth Day in safeguarding our environment, preserving our natural  treasures, and protecting the health and safety of the American people.   They are undoing decades of bipartisan agreements that balanced  science  [[Page S2430]]  and the public good with the interests of States, localities,  landowners, business, and conservationists.   This past weekend, on the eve of Earth Day, the New York Times  published an oped entitled, ``America Before Earth Day: Smog and  Disasters Spurred the Laws Trump Wants to Undo.'' The article recounts  five devastating ecological disasters that shook Americans deeply in  late 1960s and the 1970s and led to the creation of major environmental  laws that have saved millions of lives and reversed horrendous  environmental damage.   The accidents include the Cuyahoga River burning in 1969, which  helped spur passage of the Clean Air Act, and the toxic poisoning of  Love Canal in Niagara Falls, NY--a catalyst for the creation in 1980 of  a superfund that would make oil and chemical companies pay for the  pollution they cause and not walk away from the devastation and stick  taxpayers with the tab.   The Trump administration is working to dismantle not just to these  major environmental laws and abdicate America's role as a global leader  on environmental protection, it is reneging on a bipartisan tradition  on conservation and preservation of America's public lands that goes  back more than a century, to a proud Republican President by the name  of Teddy Roosevelt.   I ask unanimous consent that that full New York Times op-ed be  printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Fortunately, American businesses and scientists, State and local  governments, and the American people themselves refuse to wave the  white flag. They refuse to sell America's clean air and clean water and  the health of the American people to the highest bidder.   They are working in boardrooms and classrooms, in laboratories, in  city halls, State houses, and courthouses to solve the urgent  environmental challenges of our time and preserve the bipartisan  environmental progress we have made.   The Trump administration needs to listen and stop waving the white  flag of surrender. Our world and the health of our children and  grandchildren is worth fighting for.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From The New York Times, April 21, 2018]    America Before Earth Day: Smog and Disasters Spurred the Laws Trump                               Wants to Undo              (By Livia Albeck-Ripka and Kendra Pierre-Louis)         A huge oil spill. A river catching fire. Lakes so polluted       they were too dangerous for fishing or swimming. Air so thick       with smog it was impossible to see the horizon.        That was the environmental state of the nation 50 years       ago. But pollution and disasters prompted action. On April       22, 1970, millions of people throughout the country       demonstrated on the inaugural Earth Day, calling for air,       water and land in the country to be cleaned up and protected.       And that year, in a bipartisan effort, the Environmental       Protection Agency was created and key legislation--the Clean       Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act--      came into force.        Now, the Trump administration has made eliminating federal       regulations a priority, and an increasing number of       environmental rules are under threat.        Here's a look at five environmental disasters that shifted       the public conversation and prompted, directly or indirectly,       lawmakers to act.                         The Santa Barbara Oil Spill         On January 28, 1969, an oil rig exploded off the coast of       Santa Barbara, Calif., spewing three million gallons of crude       oil into the ocean in one of the worst environmental       disasters in the history of the United States.        At the time, there were no federal measures in place to       regulate offshore drilling.        After the spill local officials pleaded with the federal       government to end oil exploration off the California coast.       But it was not until 1978 that the first federal regulations       were passed.        Just over 40 years after the Santa Barbara rig blowout, on       April 20, 2010, an even worse spill, known as the Deepwater       Horizon disaster, resulted in the tightening of federal       rules.        But this past January, the Trump administration said it       would reopen vast areas of United States coastal waters to       new offshore oil and gas drilling projects. Shortly       thereafter, the administration began the process of rolling       back safety regulations on existing rigs.        Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has also proposed       revising a five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leasing,       which conservationists say would harm marine life and could       also pose a danger to humans.                           The Cuyahoga River Fire         The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland in 1952. The river burned       at least 13 times before the 1969 fire that was covered by       Time magazine. On June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River near       Cleveland caught fire--both literally and in the public       imagination. A few months later the conflagration became a       big story in Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as a       river that ``oozes rather than flows.''        The story prompted outrage throughout the country, where       many rivers, after decades of industrial pollution, were too       dangerous for swimming, fishing or drinking. (The main photo       in Time was actually of the Cuyahoga when it caught fire 17       years earlier, in 1952. The river had burned at least 13       times.)        The fire, fueled by an oil slick on river's surface, and       resulting media coverage galvanized the outrage into broader       public action.        It culminated in the passage of the 1972 Clean Water Act.       That measure, like the Clean Air Act, was an extension of       earlier laws. But the piecemeal nature of the earlier rules       had resulted in a lack of oversight and regulatory control.       The 1972 act coordinated the rules and gave regulatory       authority to the nascent E.P.A.        Since the law's creation, waterways across the United       States are markedly cleaner, though half still fall short of       national goals. Recent decisions, though, could lead to       backsliding.        The E.P.A. has suspended the Obama-era Waters of the United       States rules, which sought to clarify which waterways are       considered part of the national water system. Smaller bodies       of water, like intermittent streams and wetlands, have been       in a legal gray area since the 1972 act despite having       significant impact on water quality.        Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, also removed Clean       Water Act decision-making authority from regional offices,       leaving him the sole arbiter.                           The Love Canal Disaster         In the late 1970s, residents of Love Canal in Niagara       Falls, N.Y., began complaining of odd smells, rashes and       liquid leaching into the basements of their homes. Decades       earlier, the Hooker Chemical Company had dumped toxic waste       in the canal and buried it. Outraged, the residents of Love       Canal organized and were eventually relocated from their       town.        While the residents of Love Canal were not the first or       only community to confront the toxic legacy of industry,       their plight caught the attention of national media, and       ultimately, helped prompt the creation of the Comprehensive       Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,       commonly known as the Superfund.        Passed by Congress in 1980, the law meant that chemical and       petroleum companies would be taxed to create a cleanup trust       fund.        Over time, however, the trust fund has dwindled, with       taxpayers increasingly footing cleanup bills. In the E.P.A.'s       2019 budget, staff cuts have been made, while some people       nominated for key positions have direct links to polluting       industries. In December, the administration also rejected a       proposed rule that mining companies prove they have the money       to clean up pollution left behind at their sites.                            The Smog-Filled Skies         Pittsburghers used to say that if you wore a white shirt to       work in the morning, that the shirt would be as gray as the       air by lunchtime. In cities and towns throughout the country,       Americans didn't just breathe the air, they could all but       touch it. In the nation's National Parks, air pollution       clouded the views.        This was the United States before the 1970s Clean Air Act.        There was no single smog event that led to the act. In the       years leading up to its passage, though, ``You had growing       awareness in the scientific community about problems like       smog,'' said Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the       Environmental Integrity Project. ``You had the beginnings of       an understanding that it was bigger than any state agency       could manage.''        The act was an overhaul and extension of the 1963 Clean Air       Act. It enabled the newly created E.P.A. to set standards       related to six key pollutants that were known to harm human       health.        In recent months the Trump administration has signaled its       desire to undo some of parts of the act. Mr. Pruitt, the       E.P.A. administrator, has said that Obama-era car emissions       standards designed to reduce greenhouse gasses and other       pollutants linked to respiratory diseases and heart disease       are set ``too high.''                     The Near-Extinction of the Gray Wolf         In the early 1970s, the gray wolf was teetering on the edge       of extinction in the lower 48 states. Throughout the earlier       part of the century, the wolf was largely considered a trophy       and was hunted and skinned for its fur to within an inch of       the species' life.        In its company were dozens of other species at risk of       dying out, with few laws to protect them.        In 1973, shortly after the first Earth Day, with the       American public increasingly aware of the importance of       biodiversity, the Endangered Species Act was signed into law       by President Richard M. Nixon. The act was designed to       prohibit the killing or harassing of protected species or       damaging the habitats necessary for their survival.        Shortly thereafter, the gray wolf was listed as       ``endangered'' under the act and--alongside the bald eagle,       American alligator  [[Page S2431]]       and dozens of other species--began to slowly recover in some       areas. Scientists estimate that the act has directly       prevented the extinction of more than 200 species.        The act has long been a point of contention between       industry and conservationists, and has come under criticism       from previous administrations. But under the Trump       administration, at least 63 separate legislative efforts to       weaken the act have been undertaken since January 2017,       according to the Centre for Biological Diversity.        Among them were the delisting of various species that       conservationists argue are not fully recovered, like grizzly       bears in Yellowstone National Park. The attempts to water       down the act are ``among the worst'' by any administration,       said Bruce Stein, the chief scientist of the National       Wildlife Federation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in honor of April being National Poetry  Month, I want to take a few moments to recognize an extraordinary  teacher, poet, and Quincy, IL, legend, Dwain ``Doc'' Preston.   In the winter of 1936, Doc was born on a farm near Barry, IL. The son  of a World War II tank crewman and a tough as nails mother who grew up  in Oklahoma surviving the Dust Bowl, Doc attended four different one- room schoolhouses, including Berrian Elementary School in Quincy. After  graduating from Liberty High School, he enrolled at Western Illinois  University. That was the decision that he said ``took me out of the  cornfield.''   Doc joined the Air Force, attending Chinese language school, spending  6 hours a day for 8 months, studying at Yale University. To this day,  much of his work in the Air Force remains classified. After his  service, Doc returned to Quincy and was introduced to Regina Higgins by  a friend Jay Lenne at Park Bowl, a bowling alley at the corner of 12th  and Harrison. They fell in love, got married, and started their family.  They had the first of four daughters in 1963, the second in 1964, the  third in 1965, and lastly, the fourth, in--you guessed it--1966.   Doc followed in his uncle's footsteps--a teacher of 55 years--and  accepted a position at Quincy Junior High School after two of his  former teachers vouched for him. Six years later, Doc used his G.I.  bill to work toward his doctorate at the University of Illinois in  Champaign. While working on his dissertation, he taught at Western  Illinois University and officially became ``Doc'' Preston. He then did  the unexpected and tried his hand at selling insurance, but Doc had  teaching in his blood and returned to the classroom after just 1 year.  For the next 26 years, Doc Preston could be found in the classroom,  teaching writing, speech, and English at Quincy Notre Dame, where each  of his daughters would attend high school. He also supervised the QND  student council, teaching leadership skills and important life lessons  that aren't normally found in high school textbooks. Even after his  official retirement, Doc continued teaching creative writing to seniors  and others.   Throughout the years, Doc has stayed in touch with many of his  students. They will send him notes using words like icon, terrific,  great, awesome, amazing, special--to describe him as a teacher or  writer, but mostly as a man. When hearing these compliments, he  responds in his humble simple way: ``That's always fun.'' They just  don't make them like Doc Preston anymore.   Doc and his wife, Regina, spent 44 years, or as Doc put it, ``over  16,000 days'' together before Regina passed away in 2006, just 4 weeks  following Doc's retirement. In his beautiful poem titled, To Regina, he  writes:       For over 16,000 days      You were part of me.      Now only memories are left      Of days that used to be.       But Ah! What memories they are!      The Buoy of my very life,      Which would have been of little worth      Had you not been my wife.    His words are haunting as he takes us on an emotional ride that both  breaks the heart and allows us to celebrate the blessings that are  memories.   Doc Preston didn't write to publish or make money. He wrote because  he loved it and his audience, consisting largely of his family, loved  it. When each of his four daughters were married, Doc wrote them a  sonnet. When each of his 11 grandchildren turned 13, he wrote what  could be called a ``goodbye to their youth'' poem. When they were  younger, Doc wrote each of them a book. All told, Doc estimates he has  written about 150 books. On his 80th birthday, Doc's children compiled  and presented him with a book of his poem's that he dedicated to  Regina.   Despite being a brilliant writer and teacher, Doc's proudest  accomplishment is his family. In an interview last year, he said, ``One  of the things that is joyful about being a parent is watching them grow  up and succeed.'' His children certainly did. Two even went into the  family business and became teachers. Doc loved parenting, but he once  said, ``Grandparenting is better.'' I couldn't agree more.   When looking for heaven, many look toward the sky--not Doc Preston.  Doc and Regina, looked along the river bluffs of the Mississippi River  and built heaven in Quincy, IL. Whether it was with Doc's wife, Regina,  four daughters--Carolyn, Cheri, Debbie, Teresa--11 grandchildren, or  countless student, his life, love, and poetry have touched so many  lives, including my own.   I want to thank Doc Preston for his dedication to teaching and his  generosity to the wonderful people of Quincy. They call Quincy ``Gem  City.'' Well, there is no gem shining brighter than Dwain ``Doc''  Preston.   Thank you, Doc, for sharing your gift with us all.   I would like to share the final lines of Doc's poem, Southern  Memories.       Oh, yes, I'll savor snapshots,      To be sure,      But what I'll treasure most      Are all the memories I made with you.    Doc's right. I would like to tell him that what will be treasured  most by those who know Doc, ``Are all the memories [we] made with  you.''                            ____________________
