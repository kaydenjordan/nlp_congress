 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 94th birthday  of a truly inspirational figure in our Orange County community, Piri  Katz. Piri Katz is a Holocaust survivor.   At just 15, Piri and her family were taken by Nazis on the eve of  Passover. After spending months in concentration camps, where her  family was murdered, she was liberated by American soldiers in May  1945. No one can imagine the horrors she and others who lived through  this tragedy experienced and the strength it took just to survive.   In September 1949, she came to America and built her own American  Dream. She made a beautiful life for herself here. Piri has four kids  and eight grandkids that she is so proud of.   Piri's story is inspiring and should remind all of us to never take  our freedom for granted.   Happy 94th birthday, Piri.                            ____________________
