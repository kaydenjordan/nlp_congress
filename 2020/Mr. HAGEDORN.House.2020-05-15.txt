 Mr. Speaker, I believe this is a bad idea for this  institution and a terrible example for the Nation. I recommend a ``no''  vote.   You know, it is ironic that as our Nation opens up and people go back  to work safely and responsibly into their jobs, the House is making a  move to shut down, for all intents and purposes.   You know, tens of millions of Americans throughout this outbreak,  this pandemic, have been out delivering and producing our energy, our  food, helping with people in hospitals, policing our neighborhoods.  They have been doing their jobs, and we should be doing our jobs in  person moving forward.   You know, some might question why a Member of Congress like myself,  who is dealing with stage 4 cancer, getting treatment the last year at  the Mayo Clinic, why I would be the one passionately wanting everyone  to travel and work in this Chamber, work in our committees. And it is  because it is a bad idea for this House. It is a bad idea that we don't  do our jobs in person. We are setting a terrible example.   Personally, though, I can tell you this: This is the job that I  signed up for. This is the job that I asked the people of southern  Minnesota for. And this is the job that I want to do. It is an honor to  serve them. I think we should do it in person, work in committee in  person, and do our jobs. And we can do it safely and responsibly.   I recommend a ``no'' vote.
