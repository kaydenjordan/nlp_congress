 Pursuant to the order of the House of  January 3, 2017, the Chair will now recognize Members from lists  submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning-hour debate.   The Chair will alternate recognition between the parties, with each  party limited to 1 hour and each Member other than the majority and  minority leaders and the minority whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no  event shall debate continue beyond 11:50 a.m.                            ____________________     Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President-elect.                            ____________________     The Chair recognizes the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Duncan) for 5 minutes.  [[Page H312]]        Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in the history of mankind,  civilizations have turned to sports as a means of entertainment, as a  distraction from the routines of everyday life, a great way to spend  time with friends and family. Whether it was the gladiators in the  coliseums of Rome, the jousting in the Middle Ages, or college football  today, it is a great form of entertainment.   I rise today to honor and recognize Clemson University, the 2016  college football national champions. The coaches are to be commended-- from Dabo Swinney and his coaching staff, the team he has put together,  the men of character that he builds, and I will mention some of those  shortly; President Jim Clements; athletic director Radakovich; the  students of Clemson; and, most importantly, the fans, a 35-31 victory  against Alabama.   It has been 35 years since Clemson won the national championship in  1981. That is a special national championship to me because my brother  John was on the national championship team in 1981. Danny Ford, Coach  Ford, was the coach when the 1981 national championship team was  inducted, recognized in the College Football Hall of Fame the very  night, Monday night, of this year's national championship.   The connections between the University of Alabama and their football  program and Clemson University's football program are numerous. Danny  Ford played football for Bear Bryant. He coached the national  championship in 1981. Dabo Swinney, current head coach at Clemson,  played for Alabama. Dabo was a walk-on at Alabama. It has been 110  years since Clemson defeated Alabama, 1905.   I am not taking anything away from Coach Saban and the Alabama  Crimson Tide. What a great football program they have in the great  State of Alabama. They fell to a very good Clemson football team on  Monday night.   Deshaun Watson, number 4, he was the difference. He is the best  football player in the Nation with 420 yards passing, 36 for 57; total  offensive, 511 yards. Watson was the MVP of the national championship  game. Ben Boulware was Clemson's defensive MVP of the game.   But I want to give a special shout-out to a unique individual, Hunter  Renfrow, number 13, who caught the winning touchdown pass at the end of  the game with 1 second left. Hunter Renfrow, a walk-on at Clemson, like  his head coach, Dabo Swinney, a walk-on who earned a spot, ultimately  catching two touchdown passes in this national championship game, two  touchdown passes in the 45-40 loss last year, a walk-on.   Both ends of the spectrum, a five-star quarterback, number 4, Deshaun  Watson, arguably the best quarterback in the Nation, throwing to the  other end of the spectrum, a walk-on. What a great story.   I want to give a shout-out to the coaching staff, specifically Dabo  Swinney, and to Deshaun Watson for both recognizing that their talents  and that team's specialness came from Almighty Creator God.   Clemson is special to me. I am a 1988 graduate. I played walk-on at  Clemson 1984, 1985, and part of 1986. Part of Hunter Renfrow's and Dabo  Swinney's stories that you can be a walk-on and ultimately succeed is  one that we should take away from this great game.   So my congratulations, standing here on the floor of the United  States House of Representatives, representing the Third Congressional  District, home of Clemson, South Carolina, home of Clemson University,  and now home of the 2016 college football national champions, the  Clemson Tigers. I am proud to be here and say, ``Go Tigers.''  Congratulations, Clemson.                            ____________________     Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the  Chair declares the House in recess until noon today.
