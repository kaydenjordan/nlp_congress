 Madam Speaker, this bill is the beginning of  transparency Americans deserve regarding COVID's entry into our Nation,  a virus that has killed more than a million of our loved ones here at  home and millions more across the world.   Our colleagues on the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic  will piece together all the facts and share them with the public,  including the role played by elements of our government and the media  to try to discredit those who told the truth about COVID.   This bill is focused on safe disclosure of what our intelligence  agencies have learned about the central role foreign actors had in the  creation and spread of this deadly virus.   It is important that Americans and others across the globe learn  about the Chinese Communist Party's coverup of COVID's origins at its  Wuhan research facility, as well as the World Health Organization's  subsequent role in suppressing this truth.   Until China and others who echo China's false narrative face  accountability and consequences for that, we are just inviting the next  coverup.
