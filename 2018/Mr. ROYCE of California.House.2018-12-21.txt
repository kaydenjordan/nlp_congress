Congress finds the following:        (1) The recruitment or use of children in armed conflict is       unacceptable for any government or government-supported       entity receiving United States assistance.        (2) The recruitment or use of children in armed conflict,       including direct combat, support roles, and sexual slavery,       occurred during 2016 or 2017 in Afghanistan, Iran, Mali,       Niger, South Sudan, Sudan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of       the Congo, Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.        (3) Entities of the Government of Afghanistan, particularly       the Afghan Local Police and Afghan National Police, continue       to recruit children to serve as combatants or as servants,       including as sex slaves.        (4) Police forces of the Government of Afghanistan       participate in counterterrorism operations, direct and       indirect combat, security operations, fight alongside regular       armies, and are targeted for violence by the Taliban and       other opposition groups.        (5) In February 2016, a 10-year-old boy was assassinated by       the Taliban after he had been publicly honored by Afghan       local police forces for his assistance in combat operations       against the Taliban.        (6) Recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by       government forces has continued in South Sudan with the       return to hostilities.        (7) At least 19,000 children have been recruited since       South Sudan's civil war began in 2013.       SEC. 212.

(c) Availability to Congress.--The report required by       subsection (a) shall be made available to all members of       Congress.       SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the       use of military force.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1158, the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities  Prevention Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is the Senate version  of H.R. 3030, which this body passed on July 17. The vote here on the  floor was 406-5.   Mr. Speaker, it is an important bipartisan, bicameral bill that  ensures that the United States is a leader in efforts to prevent  genocide and crimes against humanity. It deserves our unanimous  support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1580) to enhance the transparency, improve the  coordination, and intensify the impact of assistance to support access  to primary and secondary education for displaced children and persons,  including women and girls, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  S. 1580         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Girls' Access to       Education in Vulnerable Settings Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) As of June 2018, more than 68,000,000 people have been       displaced by disasters and conflicts around the world, the       highest number recorded since the end of World War II, of       which more than 25,000,000 people are refugees.        (2) More than half of the population of refugees are       children and, according to the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees, nearly 4,000,000 school-aged       refugee children lack access to primary education.        (3) Education offers socioeconomic opportunities,       psychological stability, and physical protection for       displaced people, particularly for women and girls, who might       otherwise be vulnerable to severe forms of trafficking in       persons (as such term is defined in section 103(9) of the       Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C.       7102(9)), child marriage, sexual exploitation, or economic       disenfranchisement.        (4) Displaced children face considerable barriers to       accessing educational services and, because the duration of       such displacement is, on average, 26 years, such children may       spend the entirety of their childhood without access to such       services.        (5) Despite the rising need for educational services, as of       2016, less than two percent of humanitarian aid was directed       toward educational services.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) it is critical to ensure that children, particularly       girls, displaced by conflicts overseas are able to access       educational services because such access can combat extremism       and reduce exploitation and poverty; and        (2) the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls       should be considered in the design, implementation, and       evaluation of related United States foreign assistance       policies and programs.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) partner with and encourage other countries, public and       private multilateral institutions, and nongovernmental and       civil society organizations, including faith-based       organizations and organizations representing parents and       children, to support efforts to ensure that displaced       children have access to safe primary and secondary education;        (2) work with donors to enhance training and capacity-      building for the governments of countries hosting significant       numbers of displaced people to design, implement, and monitor       programs to effectively address barriers to such education;       and        (3) coordinate with the governments of countries hosting       significant numbers of displaced people to--        (A) promote the inclusion of displaced children into the       educational systems of such countries; and        (B) in circumstances in which such inclusion is difficult,       develop innovative approaches to providing safe primary and       secondary educational opportunities, such as encouraging       schools to permit children to be educated by extending the       hours of schooling or expanding the number of teachers.       SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL                     SERVICES FOR DISPLACED CHILDREN.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing       efforts to support programs that--        (1) provide safe primary and secondary education for       displaced children;        (2) build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting       displaced people to prevent discrimination against displaced       children, especially displaced girls, who seek access to such       education; and        (3) help increase the access of displaced children,       especially displaced girls, to educational, economic, and       entrepreneurial opportunities, including through the       governmental authorities responsible for educational or youth       services in such host countries.        (b) Coordination With Multilateral Organizations.--The       Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate       with the World Bank, appropriate agencies of the United       Nations, and other relevant multilateral organizations to       work with governments in other countries to collect relevant       data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the ability of       displaced people to access education and participate in       economic activity, in order to improve the targeting,       monitoring, and evaluation of related assistance efforts.        (c) Coordination With Private Sector and Civil Society       Organizations.--The Secretary and the Administrator are       authorized to work with private sector and civil society       organizations to promote safe primary and secondary education       for displaced children.  [[Page H10548]]            SEC. 6. REPORT.         The Secretary and the Administrator shall include in the       report required under section 7 of the READ Act (division A       of Public Law 115-56; 22 U.S.C. 2151c note) a description of       any primary or secondary educational services supported by       programs for natural or manmade disaster relief or response       that specifically address the needs of displaced girls.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1580, Protecting Girls' Access to Education in  Vulnerable Settings Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is the  Senate version of H.R. 2408, which this body passed last October.   Again, this is a very important bipartisan, bicameral bill that will  prioritize ongoing efforts to promote access to education for refugee  children, especially girls. It deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1862) to amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  of 2000 to modify the criteria for determining whether countries are  meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1862         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trafficking Victims       Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of       2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (15) as       paragraphs (7) through (17), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:        ``(5) Concrete actions.--The term `concrete actions' means       actions that demonstrate increased efforts by the government       of a country to meet the minimum standards for the       elimination of trafficking, including any of the following:        ``(A) Enforcement actions taken.        ``(B) Investigations actively underway.        ``(C) Prosecutions conducted.        ``(D) Convictions attained.        ``(E) Training provided.        ``(F) Programs and partnerships actively underway.        ``(G) Efforts to prevent severe forms of trafficking,       including programs to reduce the vulnerability of       particularly vulnerable populations, involving survivors of       trafficking in community engagement and policy making,       engagement with foreign migrants, ending recruitment fees,       and other such measures.        ``(H) Victim services offered, including immigration       services and restitution.        ``(I) The amount of money the government has committed to       the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (H).        ``(6) Credible information.--The term `credible       information' includes all of the following:        ``(A) Reports by the Department of State.        ``(B) Reports of other Federal agencies, including the       Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor       or Forced Labor and List of Products Produced by Forced Labor       or Indentured Child Labor.        ``(C) Documentation provided by a foreign country,       including--        ``(i) copies of relevant laws, regulations, and policies       adopted or modified; and        ``(ii) an official record of enforcement actions taken,       judicial proceedings, training conducted, consultations       conducted, programs and partnerships launched, and services       provided.        ``(D) Materials developed by civil society organizations.        ``(E) Information from survivors of human trafficking,       vulnerable persons, and whistleblowers.        ``(F) All relevant media and academic reports that, in       light of reason and common sense, are worthy of belief.        ``(G) Information developed by multilateral institutions.        ``(H) An assessment of the impact of the actions described       in subparagraphs (A) through (I) of paragraph (5) on the       prevalence of human trafficking in the country.''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Private Sector Support to Strengthen Law Enforcement       Agencies and the Role of Private Businesses in Preventing and       Combating Child Sex Trafficking.--It is the sense of Congress       that--        (1) the President should work with the private sector to       explore, develop, and use technology that strengthens Federal       law enforcement capabilities to combat traffickers and       criminal networks; and        (2) private businesses, both domestic and international,       should take every reasonable step to prevent and combat child       sex trafficking.        (b) Efforts to End Modern Slavery.--It is the sense of       Congress that any future authorization of appropriations to       carry out the grant program authorized under section 1298 of       the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C.       7114) should simultaneously extend the accountability       provisions under subsections (c), (d), and (e) of such       section.       SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON PLACEMENT OR RECRUITMENT FEES.         Section 106(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of       2000 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)) is amended--        (1) by redesignating clauses (i) through (iv) as paragraphs       (1) through (4), respectively, and moving such paragraphs 4       ems to the left; and        (2) in paragraph (4), as redesignated--        (A) by redesignating subclauses (I) through (V) as       subparagraphs (A) through (E), respectively, and moving such       subparagraphs 4 ems to the left;        (B) in subparagraph (B), as redesignated, by redesignating       items (aa) and (bb) as clauses (i) and (ii), respectively,       and moving such clauses 4 ems to the left; and        (C) in subparagraph (D), as redesignated, by striking       ``unreasonable placement or recruitment fees'' and all that       follows through the period at the end and inserting       ``placement or recruitment fees.''.       SEC. 5. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF TRAFFICKING.         Section 108(b)(7) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act       of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7106(b)(7)) is amended by inserting ``or       enable'' after ``condone''.       SEC. 6. ACTIONS AGAINST GOVERNMENTS FAILING TO MEET MINIMUM                     STANDARDS.         Section 110(b) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of       2000 (22 U.S.C. 7107) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) by striking ``The report should'' and inserting ``The       report shall, to the extent concurrent reporting data is       available, cover efforts and activities taking place during       the period between April 1 of the year preceding the report       and March 31 of the year in which the report is made, and       should'';        (B) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``based only on       concrete actions taken by the country that are recorded       during the reporting period'' after ``such standards'';        (C) in subparagraph (B) by inserting ``based only on       concrete actions taken by the country (excluding any       commitments by the country to take additional future steps       during the next year) that are recorded during the reporting       period'' after ``compliance'';

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1862, the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is part of a  package of bipartisan bills negotiated between the House and the Senate  to reauthorize, reform, and strengthen our Nation's efforts to combat  human trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, it deserves our unanimous support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 3247) to improve programs and activities relating to  women's entrepreneurship and economic empowerment that are carried out  by the United States Agency for International Development, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3247         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Entrepreneurship and       Economic Empowerment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Because women make up the majority of the world's poor       and gender inequalities prevail in incomes, wages, access to       finance, ownership of assets, and control over the allocation       of resources, women's entrepreneurship and economic       empowerment is important to achieve inclusive economic growth       at all levels of society.        (2) Research shows that when women exert greater influence       over household finances, economic outcomes for families       improve, and childhood survival rates, food security, and       educational attainment increase. Women also tend to place a       greater emphasis on household savings which improves family       financial resiliency.        (3) A 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute       estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic       activity could add as much as $28,000,000,000,000 to annual       global gross domestic product by 2025.        (4) Lack of access to financial services that address       gender-specific constraints impedes women's economic       inclusion. Roughly 1,000,000,000 women around the world are       currently left out of the formal financial system, which       causes many women to rely on informal means of saving and       borrowing that are riskier and less reliable.        (5) Among other consequences, this lack of access hampers       the success of women entrepreneurs, including women who are       seeking to run or grow small and medium-sized enterprises.       The International Finance Corporation has estimated that 70       percent of women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in       the formal sector are unserved or underserved in terms of       access to financial services, resulting in a financing gap of       $300,000,000,000 for women-owned small businesses.        (6) Women's economic empowerment is inextricably linked to       a myriad of other women's human rights that are essential to       their ability to thrive as economic actors across the       lifecycle, including--        (A) living lives free of violence and exploitation;        (B) achieving the highest possible standard of health and       well-being;        (C) enjoying full legal and human rights, such as access to       registration, identification, and citizenship documents;        (D) benefitting from formal and informal education;        (E) equal protection of and access to land and property       rights;        (F) access to fundamental labor rights;        (G) policies to address disproportionate care burdens; and        (H) business and management skills and leadership       opportunities.        (7) Discriminatory legal and regulatory systems and banking       practices are obstacles to women's access to capital and       assets, including land, machinery, production facilities,       technology, and human resources. These barriers are often       connected to a woman's marital status, which can determine       whether she is able to inherit land or own property in her       name. These constraints contribute to women frequently       running smaller businesses, with fewer employees and lower       asset values.        (8) Savings groups primarily comprised of women are       recognized as a vital entry point, especially for poor and       very poor women, to formal financial services. There is a       high demand for such groups to protect and grow the savings       of women with formal financial institutions.        (9) Evidence shows that, once a saving group is linked to a       bank, the average savings per member increases between 40 to       100 percent and the average profit per member doubles.       Investing in financial literacy, business leadership       training, and mentorship are key elements to these outcomes.        (10) United States support for microenterprise and       microfinance development programs, which seek to reduce       poverty in low-income countries by giving small loans to       small-scale entrepreneurs without collateral, have been a       useful mechanism to help families weather economic shocks,       but many microcredit borrowers largely remain in poverty.        (11) The vast majority of microcredit borrowers are women       who would like to move up the economic ladder, but are held       back by binding constraints that create a missing middle -       large numbers of microenterprises, a handful of large firms       or conglomerates, and very few small and medium-sized       enterprises in between, which are critical to driving       economic growth in developing countries.        (12) According to the World Bank, small and medium-sized       enterprises create 4 out of 5 new positions in emerging       markets, but approximately 50 percent of formal small and       medium-sized enterprises lack access to formal credit. The       financing gap is even larger when micro and informal       enterprises are taken into account. Overall, approximately 70       percent of all micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in       emerging markets lack access to credit.       SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3247, the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic  Empowerment Act, passed the Senate unanimously. It is the Senate  version of H.R. 5480, my bill, which this body passed on July 17 of  this year. It is an important bipartisan, bicameral bill that would  expand women's access to finance and inclusion in the formal economy in  emerging markets around this globe.   I thank Jessica Kelch, Andy Taylor, and Meghan Gallagher for their  expert contributions to this bill and on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves our unanimous support, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Engel  of New York for his friendship for over 20 years on the committee, but  also for his shared leadership over the last 6 years on this committee.  I would also like to thank him for his commitment over the years and  for his focus on American values and spreading those values around the  globe.
