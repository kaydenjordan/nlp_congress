 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this week is All  American Week, the annual celebration of the 82nd Airborne Division's  mission and the paratroopers who serve to uphold it.   Based in my district at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 82nd Airborne  Division is the Nation's Global Response  [[Page H4562]]  Force and can mobilize, load, and strike in a moment's notice. These  rapid reaction forces put the ``air'' in airborne and are absolutely  vital to our national security.   This year marks the division's 100th anniversary, and it is a special  time for us to celebrate its incredible history as America's Guard of  Honor.   Since its inception, the 82nd Airborne Division has played a role in  every major U.S. conflict around the world. It was nicknamed the ``All  American Division'' because of the unique and diverse group of soldiers  who came together to form the division from all across the United  States.   As the Representative of Fort Bragg in Congress, I am so proud of the  82nd Airborne's legacy, of our paratroopers and their families. They  put country before self, and we are so grateful.   I will continue to work to ensure this critical installation remains  the epicenter of the universe and the tip of the spear guaranteeing our  national security.   As we celebrate All American Week this week, I ask my fellow  Americans to join me in praying for servicemembers stationed at Fort  Bragg who are currently deployed and for their families here at home.   We also remember our veterans who served in the 82nd Airborne  Division, particularly those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Today's  paratroopers stand on the shoulders of these giants.   Airborne, all the way.
