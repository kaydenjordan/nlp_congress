 Madam Speaker, I rise to thank my communications  director, Conor Fryer, for his commitment to the 11th Congressional  District of Ohio and his invaluable contributions to my team and that  of my predecessor.   Conor joined the office in 2019 under the leadership of then- Congresswoman and now Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and was pivotal in my  transition in 2021. He consistently raised the bar and that of those  around him.   When we arrived in Congress, we had a skeleton crew of a staff. Conor  always stepped in and stepped up, filling those gaps, from legislation  to transportation and everything in between.   His boundless energy, strategic creativity, and Ohio pride has served  my constituents well. I wish Conor well as he moves closer to reaching  his long-term professional goals. He will be missed.                            ____________________
