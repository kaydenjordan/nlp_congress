 Mr. Speaker, I support the 21st Century AIRR Act, H.R.  2997. This is something that needs to get done. We need to solve our  problems for America's airlines and our passengers who are traveling  across the country.   This is a short-term extension, but we have got to get our job done.  As well, we have got to get our job done on teaching hospitals. While  we continue to debate the healthcare of this Nation, we have got areas  like mine that have a lack of access. If you can't see a doctor today,  you have no healthcare.   I think it is important that our Teaching Health Center Graduate  Medical Education program gets extended long term. We have a bill to do  that. Just expanding it 3 months, if you are graduating from medical  school right now, you want to be able to have the certainty that you  are going to have a residency program long term.   I support this extension, but we have got to do a lot more. It is  time for both Houses to come together. More importantly, it is time for  both parties to come together to solve our issues for the FAA, for  modernization, making sure that we actually have an aviation system  that works. It is ridiculous that I can look at the Waze app on my  phone, yet we have got the airlines getting stalled across the entire  country. We can do better. We have got to come together to do that.
