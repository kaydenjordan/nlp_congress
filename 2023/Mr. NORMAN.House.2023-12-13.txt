 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Allen  Brandon for his retirement following 30 years of service in public  safety.   Officer Brandon has served the Fifth District of South Carolina in  many roles. In each, he displayed incredible leadership, bravery,  honoring his community with incredible work and dedicated service  throughout his career.   In 1983, he began his service as a patrolman at the Tega Cay Police  Department and was quickly promoted to a supervisor in 1985. He then  moved to the York County Sheriff's Office where his work proved to make  a true impact in the community. He held many roles, operating in the  narcotics department for many years before being promoted again to the  patrol lieutenant and the captain of the Uniform and Field Services  Division.   Officer Brandon's service is reflective of the values that the police  force holds most important: accountability, integrity, honesty, and  courage.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take the time to recognize Mr.  Brandon's family--his wife, Melanie; and his two children, Sarah and  William. Working in the police force requires sacrifice and support  from the entire family.    In addition to his service on the police force, Officer Brandon has  served the community as an elder at Forest Hills Church, a Keystone  Board member, member of the Palmetto Boy Scouts Board, and a leader for  the United Way of York County.   Officer Brandon has set the gold standard for representing his  community with pride and prioritized fairness and justice. Please join  me in honoring Officer Brandon for 30 years of impactful service to the  Fifth District of South Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to offer Officer Brandon Godspeed in his  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of this  impeachment inquiry. I hope all the public tuned into the Rules  Committee yesterday. My question: What are you scared of? What facts do  you not want to come out? That was so evident. You spent more time  quoting Donald Trump, January 6, anything but the facts about what  Hunter Biden and his family did.   The checks don't make themselves up that are written to this family.  LLC accounts don't make themselves up. These are facts. What more to  come out that you are hiding is so evident.   This resolution follows the bar set by Democrats during the  impeachment proceedings in 2019. We are playing by the same rules the  Democrats set. If Democrats thought this process was fair for President  Trump, they should think it is fair for President Biden.   The evidence against the Bidens I think will come out and finally  show what the trail is and the fact that there are consequences. You  cannot just say you are innocent and not have to prove it. I fully  support this inquiry.
