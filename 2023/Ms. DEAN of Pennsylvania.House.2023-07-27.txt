 Mr. Speaker, last week another train  derailment alarmed a Pennsylvania community. This time 15 CSX cars  derailed in Whitemarsh Township in the heart of my district.  Fortunately, no one was hurt and there was no environmental harm.  Authorities believe it was due to a sinkhole after the area endured  major flooding in the days before.   Whitemarsh is just another example of a train derailment, two in  Pennsylvania this year, and, of course, the disaster in neighboring  East Palestine, Ohio. This is a growing and alarming trend that cannot  be overlooked.   These are different scenarios, but whether it is a repercussion of  improper oversight or a consequence of growing climate crises, we must  meet this moment.   Whether it is a sinkhole or overheated wheels, we must do better at  monitoring freight trains and their rails because we rely upon our  rails to feed us, heat and cool our homes, and bring other necessities.  Many of these freight trains carry hazardous chemicals. These trains  run through Pennsylvania neighborhoods directly threatening the safety  of our residents.   In the face of this climate crisis, re-imagining and investing in  America is what we must do. Investing in our infrastructure is vital,  and that is exactly what we are doing. Freight trains are essential to  our Nation and should never be a threat to our communities.                            ____________________
