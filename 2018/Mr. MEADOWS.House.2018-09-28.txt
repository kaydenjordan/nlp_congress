 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the pro-growth,  pro-family, and pro-small business reforms in tax reform 2.0 led by my  good friend Chairman Brady.   I want to say a special shout-out to him but also to the Ways and  Means staff. Let me just tell you, a lot of times we take credit for  things that are done, but it is the staff that has done not only a  yeoman's job but an outstanding job in doing this. And a real shout-out  to Representative Rodney Davis, the bill's sponsor, who believes that  it is a good thing to give more of the taxpayers' money back to them.   You have heard arguments on the floor today, Mr. Speaker, all about  revenue and about what this needs to do. But the revenue that we are  talking about is actually the hardworking wages of men and women on  Main Street. It is their money.   I have been around this place too long. I can tell you, I would  rather trust a mom and dad on Main Street to spend their money more  wisely than any spenders here in Washington, D.C. It is time that we  give it back.   Since we signed the last tax bill, the largest in American history,  the economy has been booming. Unemployment is at a 50-year low.                                time  1015    New job openings are setting a record pace. We are increasing wages.  Consumer confidence, Mr. Speaker, is at its highest level in decades.  And while these strong numbers continue to roll in, Congress needs to  act to make sure that we are more resolved than ever to make these tax  cuts permanent.   You know, we talk about a vibrant economy--4.2 GDP growth. According  to some sources, it is now at 4.4. When we look at that kind of GDP  growth and economic growth, it means increased wages, it means job  security, and that is what we need to make sure that we put back on the  docket today.   I ask my colleagues to vote for that. Vote for the men and women on  Main Street.   Yes, they may call this tax reform 2.0, but what I call this is  actually make sure that we are responsible in Washington, D.C., to give  the money back to its rightful owner, which is we, the people.   Now, this indeed makes the tax cuts for individuals permanent, but it  also  [[Page H9172]]  gives a whole lot of options for families saving for education and  those baby savings accounts. It encourages small business development.   It is time, Mr. Speaker, that we act on behalf of those who are doing  all the hard work here in America, those small businesses and men and  women on Main Street who deserve a break from Washington, D.C.   I thank Chairman Brady and Rodney Davis for their leadership. I also  look forward to working with them to deliver these tax cuts and make  sure they are permanent.
