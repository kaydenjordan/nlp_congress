 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 35,  the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which amends 18 U.S. Code 249, to  establish the act of lynching as a federal hate crime.   I thank our colleague, Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois, for his  work in shepherding this legislation and acknowledging the  unfathomable, barbaric history of lynching.   The Civil Rights Act of 1968 is the closest our country has ever come  to adopting antilynching legislation.   The Emmett Till Antilynching Act is necessary legislation, intended  to bring justice to victims of lynching, to heal past and present  racial injustice and prevent these wretched, gruesome acts from  continuing to occur.   Ida B. Wells, the renowned educator, investigative journalist, and  Civil Rights activist advocated tirelessly from 1886 to 1931 for the  passage of antilynching legislation and collected data to show the vast  scope of racial tensions and hate crimes.   In October 1892, Ms. Wells published research on lynching in a  pamphlet entitled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases and  continued to write, speak and organize for the recognition of lynching  as a crime and for civil rights until her death in 1931.   She traveled internationally, teaching foreign audiences about the  intensity and severity of American racial tensions.   Ms. Wells' contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and American  political discourse are still immensely influential and we look to her  as a leader and role model to this day.   The Southern Poverty Law Center reports that its research uncovered  approximately 75 other people who died violently between 1952 and 1968  under circumstances suggesting that they were victims of racial  violence.   For most of them, the reason their names were not added to the  Memorial is because not enough was known about the details surrounding  their deaths.   Sadly, the reason so little is known about these cases is because  they were not fully investigated or, in some cases, law enforcement  officials were involved in the killings or subsequent cover-ups.   And because the killings of African Americans were often covered up  or not seriously investigated, there is little reason to doubt that  many slayings were never even recorded by the authorities.   The reason justice had not been served was the callous indifference,  and often the criminal collusion, of many white law enforcement  officials in the segregated South.   The all-white, all-male jury acquitted Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam for  the murder of Emmett Till, with the two men posing for photographs and  lighting cigars after the verdict was announced.   There simply was no justice for African Americans during the civil  rights era.   The entire criminal justice system--from the police, to the  prosecutors, to the juries, and to the judges--was perverted by racial  bigotry.   African Americans were routinely beaten, bombed and shot with  impunity.   Sometimes, the killers picked their victims on a whim.   Sometimes, they targeted them for their activism.   Many times, prominent white citizens were involved and no  consequences flowed.   Herbert Lee of Liberty, Mississippi, for example, was shot in the  head by a state legislator, E.H. Hurst, in broad daylight in 1961.   It is, of course, fitting and proper that this legislation bears the  name of Emmett Till, whose slaying in 1955 and his mother's brave  decision to have an open casket at his funeral stirred the nation's  conscience and galvanized a generation of Americans to join the fight  for equality.   Sadly, hundreds of them were killed in that struggle, and many of the  killers, like those of Emmett himself, were never successfully  prosecuted.   Madam Speaker, over the past half century, the United States has made  tremendous progress in overcoming the badges and vestiges of slavery.   But this progress has been purchased at great cost.   Examples of unsolved cases include the 1968 ``Orangeburg Massacre''  at South Carolina State University where state police shot and killed  three student protesters; the 1967 shooting death of Carrie Brumfield,  whose body was found on a rural Louisiana road; the  [[Page H1203]]  1957 murder of Willie Joe Sanford, whose body was fished out of a creek  in Hawkinsville, Georgia; the 1946 killing of a black couple, including  a pregnant woman, who was pulled out of a car in Monroe, Georgia, and  dragged down a wagon trail before being shot in front of 200 people.   Solving cases like these is part of the unfinished work of America.   Madam Speaker, 53 years ago, Medgar Evers was murdered in Jackson,  Mississippi; justice would not be done in his case for more than twenty  years.   But that day was foretold because the evening before the death of  Medgar Evers, on June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy addressed the  nation from the Oval Office on the state of race relations and civil  rights in America.   In his historic speech to the nation President Kennedy said:   ``We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the  scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.   ``One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln  freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free.  They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet  freed from social and economic oppression. And this Nation, for all its  hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens  are free.''   H.R. 35 will help ensure that justice is received by those for whom  justice has been delayed.   In doing so, this legislation will help this Nation fulfill its hopes  and justify its boast that in America all persons live in freedom.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for its passage.    Madam Speaker, I rise to support further the bill  today on the floor of the House, H.R. 35, the Emmett Till Antilynching  Act, and I thank my colleague from Illinois for his astuteness.   Lynching was the most heinous act of intimidation and violence  against slaves and those who came after in the 1800s and the early  1900s.   Ida B. Wells, a renowned educator and investigative journalist,  fought from 1886 to 1931 for the passage of antilynching legislation,  the Emmett Till bill, which recounts the violence that a 14-year-old  boy experienced until his death when he simply walked on a street and  may have looked at a White woman.   This is an important standard and statement that also hopes to bring  about the debate and passage of H.R. 40 on the floor of the House,  which is the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for  African-Americans Act.   Let me also acknowledge H.R. 2819, to extend the authority for the  establishment of a commemorative work in honor of Gold Star Families,  and for other purposes. I am a strong supporter of those families who,  obviously, lost their loved ones.    I want to finally say that this administration did not tell the truth  on the coronavirus. It is absolutely imperative that they address the  American people and address the next steps for protecting the American  people, as I have done.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, allow me to thank the gentleman from  New York for his friendship and for the recognition that the clarion  call has to be called.   Let me thank my colleague and friend from New York as well, from the  great borough of the Bronx, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for her clarion  call.   I want to take this from a perspective of civil rights and the idea  that, most often, civil rights are defined by the movement of the  1960s, framed around the marches of poor people led by Dr. King and  many others who saw the inequities dealing with the treatment of  African Americans and others in the social justice system.   One might not think that that movement ties directly to where we are  today. As a cosponsor of the Green New Deal, I see this as a question  of social justice. When the foot soldiers marched, many did not  understand why they were attempting to change the way people had lived  for decades and, yes, centuries. They didn't fully understand that the  unequal treatment under the law was oppressive and denied families,  children, regions of the country the ability to reach their highest  dream.   I represent, still, the many communities that are experiencing  inequities. When I held a meeting some weeks ago to deal with what we  call cancer clusters, I had a thousand people at a townhall meeting. A  chemical, creosote, had gotten into the soil of neighborhoods, which,  in Texas, with your patches of land, front yard or back yard, you plant  your fruit trees and other garden vegetables.   I asked: ``If you have cancer or your relatives have cancer, would  you stand up?'' Two-thirds of that audience stood. Today, I am still  getting calls from people in surrounding neighborhoods, talking about  that chemical.   When you begin to look at purifying and cleaning, making sure the air  quality is clean, making sure the soil quality is clean, it is looking  at ways not to diminish people who are working in industries, who are  in hardworking, blue-collar jobs, but to expand their vision of what  can happen if you commit to the reasonable policies of the Green New  Deal that speak to bringing everyone to the table and addressing this  as a civil rights moment, not judging it on the inequities of race but  on the inequities of the quality of your neighborhood and the quality  of your life.   As I listened to the reading of the legislation, there is room at the  table for everyone. There is room at the table for scientists. I was a  member of the Science Committee for a good number of years. I believe  in good science.   There is room at the table for technicians, people who are embracing  technology.   There is room at the table for primary and secondary students who can  [[Page H1219]]  learn what climate change has done and what the impact is, and how  science is connected to a green economy.   There is room at the table for elected officials.   There is room at the table for large industries that have in their  companies huge departments dealing with the environment.   The sadness is that that information is not given to all of those who  look at these companies and see a particular purpose, but they don't  know that they are working on environmental issues. My argument would  be about education and information, and understanding that there is so  much about quality of life that is tied to the quality of the air and  water.   Now, just one moment of deviation, as a member of the Homeland  Security Committee, as one of the first Members who went to her  district to speak about the coronavirus, asking why the administration  had done nothing and had not given information to the American public,  who said that it was urgent that they give this information.  Unfortunately, in a presentation which we have seen when we deal with  climate change or the Green New Deal, it was reported to us, Members of  Congress, that there was nothing to worry about; it wouldn't get here  to the United States.   Well, I dealt with H1N1 as a Member of Congress, and the Ebola virus,  which hit Dallas, Texas. I am in Houston, and before we understood what  it was, various providers had treated the individual but had already  left the State. Information can save lives.   Just recently, before I left Houston, I had a press conference to at  least share with the community the various documents and handouts about  how one should react to any signs of a flu-like symptom, not to  diagnose yourself, but to get to a health provider. In the Green New  Deal, it talks about access to healthcare.   Many of my constituents died from creosote because they had no access  to healthcare. When I say creosote, the ramifications--cancer,  respiratory illnesses.   I rise today to join my colleagues in a clarion call. I am supposed  to be at the Homeland Security Committee right now, but I really wanted  to join in this commitment that we need to inform, educate, and  activate so that we can begin to be on the journey in America, the  greatest Nation in the world.   In fact, the United States of America is the Nation now that is being  looked on to bring relief on the coronavirus. And we are still missing  a team or a plan.   But the greatest Nation in the world can now be at the forefront of  leading the idea that green is real and right, and it is good for the  American people, good for our families, good for our children, good for  the leadership that we must give to developing nations and other  nations around the world.   I rise to join my colleagues and thank them again for their  leadership.
