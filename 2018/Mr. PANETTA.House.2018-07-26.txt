 Mr. Speaker, I recognize July as American Grown Flowers  Month. I am proud to offer this recognition since my district on the  central coast of California produces many cut flowers, including $62  million worth in 2016.   The cut flower industry doesn't just offer a product. It provides  jobs, investment, and, of course, beauty to our communities.   Now, despite changes, trade conditions, and ongoing international  uncertainty within the market, this industry survives because those in  the cut flower industry, like many of their ancestors who immigrated  here, are willing to take risks by pivoting, adjusting, and making sure  that their businesses continue to bloom.   As co-chair of the Congressional Cut Flowers Caucus and as a member  of the Agriculture Committee, I am working to ensure that our producers  who want to remain or even enter into the industry now not only have  the opportunity, but the tools they need to succeed and grow.   So I ask you to help this American-made industry by supporting  investments in research and innovation, for access to accurate industry  data at USDA, and to work to ensure an available workforce through  immigration reform.   Do this so that those American producers can continue to do what they  do best: grow flowers, contribute to our community, and bring joy into  the lives of all of our constituents.                            ____________________
