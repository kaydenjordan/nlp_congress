 Madam Speaker, today, thanks to the  relentless efforts of our military's special operations servicemembers,  ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is dead and our world is a safer  place. Saturday night's victory over this violent enemy is due to our  troops' selfless sacrifices and superior work with our Nation's  intelligence operatives.   President Trump has shown that under his command there is no safe  place for terrorists, and I thank him and our troops for helping keep  our country free and safe.   Providing national security is the number one job of the Federal  Government. Now it is time the House of Representatives puts our troops  first by passing the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for  Fiscal Year 2020 to support our military's continued success and ensure  the safest possible outcome in all its missions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by  thanking Representative Stefanik for her leadership on this legislation  before us today.   I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging  Act, which will reauthorize the Older Americans Act through 2024.   For over 50 years, the Older Americans Act, or OAA, has helped  provide social and nutrition services to older Americans. With more  than 40 million Americans aged 65 and older, the programs and services  offered by OAA are helping them maintain independence, and the data  shows overwhelmingly that these programs help older Americans live  higher-quality lives.   The reach of this law is substantial and covers many aspects of elder  care beyond just well-known programs like Meals on Wheels. OAA supports  services that include: Nutrition programs providing meals at senior  centers, schools, and churches; care to prevent the abuse, neglect, and  exploitation of seniors; family caregiver support systems; and services  to help older Americans move into employment.    This reauthorization is the product of bipartisan hard work with  Members of the Education and Labor Committee and shows the good that  can come from working together. Through productive conversation and  compromise, we have successfully authorized grants for States and Area  Agencies on Aging, AAAs, responsible for coordinating local services  for older individuals.   Specifically, the supportive services program funds a wide range of  social services aimed at helping our older population remain  independent in their own homes and communities. These services include,  case management, adult daycare, and other numerous activities of senior  centers. Additionally, States are required to devote a certain portion  of funding to access services, home care, and legal assistance.   Furthermore, local agencies that implement the law on the ground will  receive additional clarity about cost-sharing policies designed to  increase the cost-effectiveness of OAA programs.  [[Page H8476]]    The bill also infuses additional accountability over hardworking  taxpayer funds into these programs by requiring programs to demonstrate  they met their stated goals prior to receiving a renewal of their  grant.   In addition to funding for supportive services and nutrition  services, H.R. 4334 also provides for caregiver support. The bill  continues support for the National Family Caregiver Support Program,  which provides funds to States to support Americans caring for aging  family members.                                time  1500    The program provides a range of services, including information and  assistance to caregivers about available services, counseling,  organization of support groups and caregiver education, respite  services to provide families temporary relief from care-giving  responsibilities, and supplemental services to complement care provided  by other caregivers.   The bill also provides increased flexibility to states by lifting a  cap on the percentage of funds that can go to older relative  caregivers, which will allow for additional support for those seniors  who have taken responsibility for caring for family members due to the  growing problem of opioids in our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I am very encouraged by the teamwork and bipartisanship  that went into this bill. H.R. 4334, the Dignity in Aging Act, reflects  Congress' commitment to our Nation's seniors and builds upon the law's  flexible policies, allowing older Americans to age with health,  dignity, and independence in the communities of their choosing.   I would like, again, to thank Representative Stefanik for her  diligent work on this legislation and Chairman Scott for his commitment  to bipartisanship. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this  reauthorization that will benefit an entire generation of older  Americans.
