 Mr. President, today, the resolution designating  January as National Stalking Awareness month will be voted on and pass  the Senate. I thank my colleague and friend Senator Amy Klobuchar for  her work and dedication to this subject. Approximately 1 in 6 women and  1 in 17 men in the U.S. have experienced stalking at some point in  their lives.   This bipartisan resolution sends a clear message: We will not stand  for this egregious conduct. Millions of our fellow Americans have been  victims of stalking. Oftentimes, their stories involve years-long  episodes, drastic changes to their lives to secure their safety and,  sadly, other criminal activity by stalkers. This month is a time for us  all to reflect on the pervasiveness of stalking and the serious  hardships and dangers faced by victims.   As stated in the resolution, I also want to thank the advocates who  are on the frontlines of this issue and stand ready to assist victims  and provide them with the resources and support they need and deserve.   The work of advocates raising awareness, of law enforcement and  courts taking preventive and punitive action and of serviceworkers in  providing help to victims are all worthy of our thanks.   Our work doesn't stop here. I am once again recommitting to the fight  against stalking, trafficking, and other conduct that targets our most  vulnerable populations.                            ____________________
