 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of the  Promoting United Government Efforts to Save Our Sound Act, or the PUGET  SOS Act, and I thank my good friend and colleague, Representative  Strickland, for her partnership on this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, those of us who are lucky to call the better  Washington home know that Puget Sound is our most iconic body of water.  Generations of our friends and neighbors have built their lives and  earned their livelihoods on the Sound.   We know the Puget Sound is critical to the environmental and economic  future of our region. And some of our region's most iconic species,  including salmon, orca, and Dungeness crab, rely on a healthy Puget  Sound.   But despite years of efforts to protect and restore Puget Sound, we  still have a lot of work to do to address the significant challenges,  including storm water runoff, habitat loss, and harmful algal blooms,  that continue to threaten this crown jewel of our region's identity and  economy.   That is why I am proud to see the House advance this critical bill,  which will finally bring to bear the coordinated Federal resources  necessary to save our Sound. If we are going to recover our salmon and  orca populations, if we are going to ensure future generations can dig  for clams, if we are going to respect and uphold Tribal treaty rights,  we need the Federal Government to step up and support the work already  being done by the State, Tribes, local communities, and businesses that  all depend on a vibrant and healthy Puget Sound.   Madam Speaker, I am proud that this bill represents meaningful  progress toward these goals. If future generations, including my two  kiddos, are going to have the opportunities to enjoy these treasures  and to build their livelihoods in our region, we have to act now to  protect and restore the Sound.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical bill.
