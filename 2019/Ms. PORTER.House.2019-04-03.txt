 I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I am honored to be here today to introduce  my amendment to the Violence Against Women Act, which integrates the  term ``economic abuse'' throughout the legislation. I wrote this  amendment to ensure that this largely invisible abuse is recognized  federally, and victims are afforded all of the protections offered  under VAWA.   Over one-quarter of women and 11 percent of men have experienced  sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner  in their lifetimes. I am one of them.   I suffered domestic violence, and every year, millions suffer in  silence for many reasons, but one of the most prominent among those  reasons is economic necessity. According to a study conducted in 2012,  74 percent of survivors stayed with their abuser for financial reasons.   Financial abuse through consumer credit still has not been  appropriately recognized under the law. Using debt to exercise coercive  control is one of the most prevalent and nefarious forms of domestic  violence. In a Michigan State study, 99 percent of domestic violence  victims reported some form of economic abuse.   Economic abuse takes many forms, ranging from employment sabotage to  malicious attempts to restrict survivor's access to funds.   Threats of violence cause women to take time off from school or work  and interfere with their abilities to maintain employment or complete  their educations.   Abusers obstruct childcare and transportation options to disrupt job  and academic performance, stealing victim's keys, and leaving children  intentionally unattended. They cut off access to financial information  to keep their partner in a state of financial dependence and unable to  leave. They commit identity theft to run up credit card debt and ruin  their partner's credit scores, taking out loans in their partner's name  that the victim knows nothing about and cannot pay off.   In intimate partner relationships, on average, physical violence  victims lose 7 days of paid employment, rape victims lose 8, and  stalking victims lose 10 per year.                                time  1930    For the rest of their lives, these survivors are less financially  secure because they endured an abusive relationship.   Abusers often take advantage of their heightened degree of financial  sophistication relative to their partner's. They don't tell their  partners about the assets the couple owns, and they force their  partners to sign quitclaim deeds and give up ownership in major assets  like homes without knowing it.   Coerced debt follows victims of domestic violence for the rest of  their lives, long after they have left the relationship. It is  particularly destructive in the weeks after these women leave, when  they try to rent an apartment or otherwise provide for themselves  financially.   Burdening a woman with economic obligations that she did not take on  as she is trying to escape an abusive relationship can be as crippling  to her long-term well-being as violence.   Credit repair is an almost impossible process. Expunging coerced debt  from a victim's credit report, even with extensive evidence of fraud,  is an intractable task, which is why I will be introducing legislation  to provide a way forward for women whose credit scores are ruined as a  result of domestic violence.   I endured an abusive relationship, and my three children and I were  able to move forward with our lives, staying in our community and in  our home. I had a good job; I had a strong credit history; and I was  extremely engaged with our family's financial decisions, which allowed  me to leave when I needed to.   However, without a substantial safety net, many women can't and don't  [[Page H3061]]  leave. When they do leave, almost 40 percent of survivors become  homeless. This is wholly unacceptable.   Until we address the full spectrum of abuse that survivors face, we  won't significantly reduce rates of domestic violence. And for so long  as domestic violence is a glaringly prevalent problem in our society,  we will not see gender equality.   Incorporating economic abuse into the definition of domestic violence  in this landmark Federal legislation is a huge step.   I am honored to have the opportunity to carry the voices of Orange  County families and survivors to the Halls of Congress.   I found help to let my family rebuild our lives. A police officer who  had been trained in DV because of VAWA helped create the amazing,  healthy children I have. I will count the passage of VAWA among my  proudest achievements.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
