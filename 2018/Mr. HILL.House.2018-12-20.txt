 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on the House floor to object to  President Trump's decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria.   I encourage the President to remember the poor decision of the Obama  administration in 2011, when the United States announced its withdrawal  from a ``stable Iraq.'' ISIS is not defeated and may have as many as  30,000 fighters remaining in Syria. Atrocities being committed by the  brutal dictator, Assad, and his henchmen, including Russia and Iran,  will now continue with impunity. This opens the door for Iran to  consolidate gains.   I am especially concerned with the tragic consequences this will have  months and years down the road. The United States policy in Syria must  ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS, roll back Iranian influence, and  achieve a political solution to the crisis.   I echo the late John McCain and his message from 2011, as it applies  today. This decision is a ``sad case of political expediency  supplanting military necessity.''                            ____________________
