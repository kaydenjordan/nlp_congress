 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague, Chairman Thompson,  in strong support of H.R. 251, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism  Standards Program Extension Act. This bill reauthorizes the Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program, more commonly known as  CFATS, for 2 more years.   CFATS began as a program aimed at keeping dangerous chemicals out of  the hands of terrorists. In recent years, it has grown, in large part,  due to partnerships between the Department of Homeland Security and  industry stakeholders working to identify high-risk facilities and  ensuring appropriate security measures are in place to mitigate these  risks.   The current CFATS authorization expires January 18, and swift action  is needed to make sure there is no lapse in this program.   I believe this program has achieved its purpose in making Americans  safer by helping chemical facilities secure dangerous substances. Mr.  Speaker, I support this reauthorization and urge my colleagues in the  Senate to also act with the urgency required to prevent this program  from expiring.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), my friend and colleague, and a  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
