 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I will  object to this bill and to the process by which we have reached this  point.   Several of my colleagues and I are studying this matter. This is a  highly complicated, 70-page agreement. It only passed out of the House  last night. It has only been on the Senate floor for barely a day. We  were supposed to have 15 minutes ago gone to a joint meeting of  Congress. The Senate should not be ramming through such agreements at  the very last minute without our having had the time to review them.  There is more than enough time for Senators and their aides, over the  next 2 weeks of recess, to review this 70-page, complicated agreement  and then address it in the month of July.   So I object.
