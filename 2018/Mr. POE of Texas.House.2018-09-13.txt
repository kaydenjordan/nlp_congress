 Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year, a time  folks in Texas and in the South have been waiting for. It is called  football season.   It has been said there are only two seasons in Texas: football season  and spring football season.   Football in Texas is its own religion. Whether you are watching the  game under the Friday night lights, joining 25,000 of your closest  friends on Saturday, or checking your watch in church to make sure your  preacher gets you out on time on Sunday, there are more than a few  prayers being said in the name of football on any given day in Texas.   Just last week, I headed to Waco, Texas, with my entire family to  watch my alma mater, the Abilene Christian Wildcats, take on the Baylor  Bears. The outcome wasn't what we were hoping for, but there is nothing  better than college football under a Texas sunset.   Texans naturally believe everything is bigger and better in Texas-- because it is. My son, Kurt, started playing football when he was 8  years old, and I have watched him play every game from Humble, Texas,  pee-wee football until he took the field wearing the purple and white  of our alma mater, Abilene Christian University.   From the beginning, Kurt played quarterback. Being the quarterback is  one of those positions that is tough on parents. It is all the fame or  all the blame. Every time I saw him take the field, I saw that same  little 8-year-old boy full of determination. It was that very  determination that led to him being a walk-on at Abilene Christian  University and earning a spot as a safety and becoming an Academic All- Conference player.   I was a judge during that time in Texas in Houston, and I would head  out on Friday night after court and drive all night to towns such as  Abilene; Kingsville; Canyon; Wichita Falls; Commerce; Las Cruces, New  Mexico; and Ada, Oklahoma, to get there in time for Saturday's game.   There is nothing more fun than being in a stadium on that first  weekend and seeing your team and your son take the field to thousands  chanting, ``Wildcats, purple, white, purple, white, fight, fight,  fight.''   Last week I saw Kurt's son, my grandson, Jackson, take the field,  also as safety, for the Georgetown, Texas, middle school team.   Texas football is a legend and legacy. It has spawned books, movies,  TV series, and it has been known to ruin a family dinner or two in a  house divided over the loyalty of their team. Blood may be thicker than  water, but it is not thicker than football.   Yes, Texans love football, right down to the names they choose for  their children and to the cars they drive. I am sure there is some big  executive in Detroit wondering why they have to send so many maroon  pickups to Texas. Well, of course, they are for the Texas Aggie fans.   We may not have too many fall weddings in Texas, but I am willing to  bet you that you have been to a wedding where the new Mr. and Mrs. took  off down the aisle to the University of Texas' ``The Eyes of Texas'' or  got a big Texas A&M ``Whoop'' after the preacher declared them husband  and wife.   But it is not just the action on the gridiron. It is the atmosphere;  it is the band; it is the drill team; it is the cheerleaders; it is the  moms selling T-shirts, the school clubs hanging banners, the same old  guys in the same old seats season after season in the stands, and the  whole atmosphere of what makes the game great.   So, Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year. Put on your school  colors; head for the game; grab some hotdogs and Dr Pepper or Coke; and  take part in one of Texas' finest religious traditions: Texas football.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is the 1-minute story of Kelly  Dore.   Kelly's biological father began trafficking her for sex in the first  year of her life. The evildoer continued to do so for 14 years. Kelly  spent her childhood in a living hell most of us cannot even  contemplate.   Her kindergarten memories are not of playtime and story time;  instead, they consisted of hiding in the bathroom because the repeated  trauma caused uncontrollable bleeding.   The evildoer threatened to kill Kelly's mother if Kelly ever told.   At 14 years, Kelly liberated herself from this depravity by  testifying against her father in a courtroom. Miraculously, she not  only survived the ordeal, but she became an advocate.   Today, Kelly works to strengthen trafficking laws, giving an  inspirational voice for victims of human trafficking like her.   No child should ever have to go through what Kelly went through.  Congress must join Kelly in the fight against the buying and selling of  our children on the marketplace of sex trafficking.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
