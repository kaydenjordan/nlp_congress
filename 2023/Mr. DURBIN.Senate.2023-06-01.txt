 Mr. President, this is a historic day in the annals of  the U.S. Senate because we are faced with a critical role as to whether  we can pass the bipartisan compromise on spending or default on our  debt for the first time in history, whether we will fail as a nation  for the first time ever--ever--to pay our bills.   There is a strange construction in the law where we can vote in the  Senate and in the House for spending, send it to the President, who  signs it into law, go back to our States and districts and announce in  press conferences that we have millions of dollars coming home--Federal  dollars--back home to our States and districts and take credit for it  and then not face the reality that the money appropriated actually adds  to our national debt.   The debt ceiling is the mortgage of the United States, which needs to  be expanded as we spend money. So we reached a point where we have a  deadline--first June 1 and now June 5--of doing something in Congress  to extend the Nation's mortgage or default on that mortgage and debts  for the first time in history.   There was a ferocious negotiation that went on for weeks. It was  precipitated by the threat of one person on Capitol Hill, Speaker Kevin  McCarthy, who said: I am willing to risk defaulting on America's debt.  All the other leaders, including the Republican leader in the Senate  and the Democratic leader, said that is unthinkable; we would pay a  price for that for generations to come. The reputation of the United  States, the value of the U.S. dollar would be in danger because of such  a careless and reckless act.   So negotiation was underway for the last few weeks; an agreement was  reached to Speaker McCarthy's satisfaction; and it passed the U.S.  House of Representatives yesterday.   Now it is our turn in the Senate. We have taken a look at this  agreement. First, let me say the premise is this. Defaulting on our  national debt is unacceptable, unthinkable. We cannot let it occur.   So as painful as some of the decisions that will come from this  agreement reached, they are virtually, at this point, inevitable to  avoid default on our debt.   There is one I want to zero in on because it means so much to  everyone in this Nation--and most people don't realize that it has been  part of the debate and negotiation in this compromise--and that is the  question of America's commitment to medical research.   The National Institutes of Health is the preeminent medical research  institution in the world--in the world. When it comes to discovering  cures for diseases, new medications, it is the National Institutes of  Health and the  [[Page S1861]]  Food and Drug Administration which are charged with that  responsibility, and we lead the world in research. I am such a fan of  this Agency that I can speak for a long time about what they are doing.   But suffice it to say, if you or a member of your family have a  diagnosis from a doctor that scares you to death, one of your first  questions is, Doctor, is there anything we can do? Is there a medicine?  Is there a surgery? Is there anything we can do?   Some of us have asked that question and we pray that the answer is  yes and we pray that it leads us back to the NIH and all the work they  put in.   So here is what we face with the budget agreement that passed the  House, now headed to the Senate. We asked the experts on the budget to  tell us what is going to happen to the budget of the National  Institutes of Health--the preeminent medical Agency in the world--as a  result of Speaker McCarthy's demand that we cut spending. What will  happen is this. We face this prospect almost with certainty. We are  going to see a cut in the NIH spending for the first time in 10 years.  For 10 years, we have consistently increased research funds, and they  paid off. Finding that vaccine for COVID as quickly as we did was no  accident. It was planned through medical research. And it saved so many  thousands of lives here in the United States and beyond.   So here we face, for the first time in 10 years, a cut in the budget  of the National Institutes of Health. How much of a cut? At least $500  million--$500 million.   And I stepped back, and I thought to myself, you mean, we are going  to cut medical research? That was Speaker McCarthy's idea of fiscal  conservatism? That, to me, is mindless. It may have some political goal  in mind, and I don't know what it might be, but to cut that makes no  sense.   And let me suggest that my colleagues want to cut wasteful spending  in Federal Government, and there is plenty of it. I know one obvious  place to start. This projected cut of $500 million happens to match  almost exactly the amount of money we waste each year maintaining an  offshore military prison that only serves to violate our fundamental  values and undermine the rule of law. You probably know what I am  referring to: Guantanamo. In the 21 years since Guantanamo first  opened, American taxpayers have wasted more the $7 billion on that  facility--$7 billion. This $7 billion monument to bureaucracy and  failed policy costs us $500 million a year to maintain now, the same  amount we are cutting from medical research to maintain Guantanamo Bay.    You say to yourself, well, if it keeps us safe, it is worth it. How  many detainees are being held by the United States of America today at  the Guantanamo facility? Thirty. Thirty for $500 million a year. That  is almost $17 million per year, per prisoner. Florence, CO, has a  maximum-security prison for the United States of America. To maintain  those prisoners in that maximum-security facility is around $30,000 a  year. When it comes to Guantanamo, maintaining a facility for 30 of  these detainees is costing us $17 million per detainee.   You know who called that a crazy idea? None other than former  President Donald Trump.   For what great purpose are American taxpayers paying more than half a  billion dollars every year to keep Guantanamo open? Is it to keep  America safe, to detain convicted terrorists and threats to America?  Guess again. Because right now, 16 of the 30 remaining detainees--more  than half of them--have already been approved for release. That means  we are wasting hundreds of millions of dollars every year to detain men  who should have already been released. What is more, there are 10 other  detainees who are still awaiting trials in the facility's dysfunctional  military commissions.   How can we possibly explain to the world--let alone to our own  citizens--that we have detained people for over 20 years and never  charged them with a crime? The trial against five men charged in  relation to 9/11 has not even begun, more than 2 decades since the  attack on the United States.   And those who follow the military commissions the closest can tell  you that these trials, let alone any convictions that might come down  on appeal, are nowhere in sight. There is not even a plan.   Former Bush administration Solicitor General Ted Olson has a special  level of expertise and interest in this issue. Ted also was chosen by  the Bush administration to argue their cases before the Supreme Court.  He is a respected lawyer in Washington, DC. Sadly, on 9/11, 2001, Ted  Olson's wife died when a plane crashed into the Pentagon. She was a  passenger. So he has a special interest in this matter and a special  level of expertise.   Here is what he wrote about the idea of trials by military  commissions of detainees at Guantanamo. He said they were ``doomed from  the start.'' He is calling for the Biden administration to negotiate  guilty pleas with all the 9/11 defendants. To state the obvious, we are  failing the victims of 9/11 and their families by continuing the  Guantanamo charade. These military commissions, which were supposed to  be the court of law trying the detainees, have not or are unlikely to  ever deliver justice.   In December of 2021, I chaired a hearing in the Senate Judiciary  Committee on Guantanamo. One of our witnesses was Colleen Kelly, a  nurse practitioner from the Bronx, mother of three. She testified about  losing her younger brother Bill on 9/11. He was in the North Tower when  the first plane crashed. Colleen described the pain of waiting--waiting  almost 20 years after Bill's death, year after year after year--for  something to happen.   In March, I received a letter from a young woman named Leila Murphy.  She was 3 years old when her father Brian died on 9/11. For nearly 22  years, Leila Murphy has waited for a trial that has never come. In her  letter to me, she pleaded with our government to bring this process to  an end by securing guilty pleas from defendants in the 9/11 cases.   Leila, Colleen, and Ted Olson are not alone in calling on the Biden  administration to finally deliver a shred of justice to the victims of  9/11 and their loved ones through guilty pleas. Just last week, Leila  and several of the children and grandchildren of the victims who died  on 9/11 wrote to the President. Here is what they said. They implored  him to salvage ``whatever justice can still be had for the parents and  grandparents we lost . . . [do] not let [this] drag on any longer,''  these survivors begged.   The signers in that letter included three daughters of New York  firefighter Douglas Miller. He was among the more than 340 firefighters  in New York who were killed when the towers collapsed. If you have seen  the programs dedicated to these men and women, you cannot forget the  bravery they demonstrated that day.   At the time of Mr. Miller's death, his daughters were just children.  His firstborn Elizabeth was 7; Rachel was 6; Katie was 4. He and his  wife Laurie had been sweethearts since high school. In their letter,  Mr. Miller's daughters and other signers expressed how hopeful they  felt last year when the 9/11 prosecution team began negotiations to  finally obtain guilty pleas from defendants. They considered it a  breakthrough that would finally bring closure; that would finally  provide answers they had sought for more than 20 years.   But their hopes were crushed when the prosecution team recently  indicated they are now going to start to open the pretrial litigation  again. That was devastating news for these children, like Mr. Miller's  daughters. In their letter, they wrote:         The thought of going back to endless courtroom proceedings,       when more than 10 years of litigation did not lead to trial,       is painful.    Returning to pretrial purgatory will not deliver justice to the loved  ones that lost the people that they cared for so much. The only way to  do this is by securing guilty pleas in the 9/11 cases.   And let's be honest, this will not be the full measure of justice  these families deserve. Sadly--sadly--this is no longer possible.  Because these families were robbed of true justice when the  administration at the time decided to torture and abuse detainees in  our Nation's custody and throw them into an untested legal black hole  rather than trusting America's time-honored system of justice.    As Ted Olson wrote a few months ago:   [[Page S1862]]              Nothing will bring back the thousands whose lives were so       cruelly taken that September day. But we must face reality       and bring this process to an end. The American legal system       must move on by closing the book on the military commissions       and securing guilty pleas.    The Biden administration must complete the interagency process to  review the terms of the plea deals without further delay. Securing  guilty pleas from the detainees who had been charged with a crime will  bring us one step closer to ending the shameful chapter of Guantanamo.   These men will then serve out their sentences--some for the rest of  their lives.   When it comes to the detainees who had not been charged, they should  be released. That means the State Department must find countries who  will take the 16 men for the approved transfer. It is not an easy  assignment, but it is one that is inevitable.   The United States is a Nation of laws. When we indefinitely detain  people who have never been charged with a crime and who have been  deemed safe to release, we are betraying our own basic constitutional  values. And autocrats abroad point to the history of abuse and  detention without charge or trial to justify their own human rights  abuses. If you want to stand for liberty and the rule of law, be honest  with the American people.   Guantanamo Bay is a blight on our national conscience, and it has  been for a long period of time. It is time for us to accept reality. It  is not only a waste--tremendous waste--of taxpayer dollars, but it is  an injustice that must end.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet)  and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.

I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    Madam President, we had a hearing this week in the  Committee on the Judiciary. We had a grower from South Carolina, a  guest of Senator Graham. He professes to be the second largest peach  grower in America. I asked him point-blank: If you had E-Verify on your  farm today, what would happen to you and the growers who need workers?   He said: We would be out of business tomorrow.   That's what your amendment does. It imposes E-Verify on farmers in  Kansas and Illinois and all across the United States.   We are not ready for this. You are going to put them out of business.   And, secondly, it strips away all of the protections of unaccompanied  children at the border. We do not want kids in cages anymore at the  border. Please vote against this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 110    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question now occurs on agreeing to  amendment No. 110.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.
