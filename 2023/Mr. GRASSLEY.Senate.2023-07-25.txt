 Mr. President, today, I would like to address the  unclassified, FBI-generated 1023 form that I made public last week.  This is a 1023 that Director Wray refused to admit existed until I and  Chairman Comer told him that we had read the document.   The FBI provided a highly redacted version to the House Committee on  Oversight and in the process ignored the Senate access to that  document. That version redacted references to the alleged audio  recordings between then-Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, and the  foreign national. It also redacted references to text messages and  financial records that allegedly existed to prove the criminal act was  done. Those redactions are an obstructive conduct by the United States  Government. Why? Because this was an unclassified document. It is not  even marked ``law enforcement sensitive.''   By the way, Justice Department and FBI leaks exposed the source well  before the 1023 became public.   Now there have been allegations in the media that this 1023 consists  of unverified information. That didn't stop the media's breathless  reporting for years about the unverified and very famous Steele  dossier. But the Justice Department and the FBI have not told us what  they did to investigate the 1023 document. So since the FBI hasn't told  us anything about their investigation of the 1023, if they did any, how  does the media then know that it is unverified?   From what I have seen, much of the media's reporting has missed the  essential question. That essential question is this: Did the Justice  Department and the FBI follow normal investigative process and  procedures to run the information down or did they sweep this  information under the rug?   Now, we have had several media outlets interviewing law enforcement  sources with knowledge of the 1023 who start to answer that very  question, so I am going to refer to some of these reports from the  media.   One law enforcement source reported that ``this was a confidential  human  [[Page S3508]]  source that had a long relationship with the FBI, had given information  that was used in multiple other investigations unrelated to Burisma or  the Bidens.''   That law enforcement source said there was a ``fight for a month'' to  get the FBI handler to reinterview the FBI source. That reinterview was  necessary because a separate 1023 mentioned Hunter Biden, and that  reinterview ultimately produced the 1023 that I made public last week.   When seeing that, my first question was: Why the fight to reinterview  the FBI source? That is the fight that supposedly took a month that I  previously referred to. Then the law enforcement source said:         We got that report back and we're, like, holy smokes, this       is something.    The news reports also show that the Justice Department and FBI  personnel were able to validate some claims in the 1023 report without  compulsory process. For example, a news report quotes a law enforcement  source:         There were multiple meetings alleged overseas. Some of the       confidential human source's claims were corroborated against       the confidential human source travel records and contemporary       knowledge from the handler about him attending meetings with       Zlochevsky and other people present.    The news report also notes that public records also validate some of  the 1023 claims about Zlochevsky's efforts to buy into the American  energy market. A separate news report, based on a law enforcement  source with knowledge, says that Weiss's team was briefed on the  validations, which then begs the question, What did the investigators  do to investigate?   Well, it has been reported that a law enforcement source believed  U.S. Attorney Weiss was reluctant to pursue leads because of political  sensitivities. More precisely, Weiss' team was concerned about  investigating because it would involve then-Presidential candidate  Biden. Well, that didn't stop the Justice Department when Trump was a  candidate the first or second time.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention a July 25, 2022, letter that I  wrote to the Justice Department and FBI. That letter talked about the  FBI shutting down verified and verifiable investigative avenues into  Hunter Biden separate from the ongoing U.S. Attorney Weiss'  investigation and the 1023. So it is clear that even if information is  verified, the FBI has shut it down in the past if it relates to the  Biden family.   Former Attorney General Bill Barr has said that the 1023 was credible  enough to be passed on to Delaware for ``further investigation.'' He  has also said that a review was done to ensure the 1023 wasn't  disinformation before passing it on.   Director Wray, likewise, informed me and Chairman Comer of its  credibility, noting that it is relevant to an ongoing investigative  matter. This also took place in the phone call that Comer and I had  with Wray. Wray also didn't say that it is part of Giuliani's  information, and he didn't tell me and Comer that it is the product of  any disinformation.   Accordingly, I want to make clear what my oversight focus is and will  be: holding the Justice Department and the FBI accountable to explain  to the American people what they did to investigate and what they  found. To do that, congressional oversight must focus on the Justice  Department and the FBI's investigative process and whether the U.S.  Attorney Weiss's scope includes bribery.   Congress and the public must get answers to these questions: What did  the Justice Department and FBI do to investigate the information  contained in the 1023? Did the Justice Department and FBI follow normal  investigative process and procedures or try to sweep it all under the  rug because of political bias? More precisely, did the FBI and DOJ seek  to obtain the evidence referenced in the document? Did the DOJ and FBI  seek to interview individuals relating to the 1023? If not, why not? If  so, one way or the other, what did they find?   Here we are in July 2023, and we are talking about a June 2020  document. The FBI can easily answer those questions. The fact that they  haven't indicates to me that the Justice Department and FBI have not  followed normal investigative protocol.   Congress must also find out the true extent to which the August 2020  assessment created by Brian Auten was used to shut down the Biden  family investigative leads. For example, we know that the FBI had at  one time over a dozen sources who provided potentially criminal  information relating to Hunter Biden. Did the August 2020 assessment  shut any of them down?   In conclusion, as we prepare to celebrate National Whistleblower's  Day, let's not forget that the only reason why Congress has been able  to make this information public is because of brave and very patriotic  whistleblowers who have approached my office.   Remember this: To date, the Justice Department and the FBI have not  disputed any of their allegations. Further, remember that it includes  information relating to this 1023 that I made public, and some of this  information goes back to October of last year. During that period of  time, the Department of Justice and the FBI haven't disputed any of  that information. And a perfect chance for Christopher Wray, Director  of the FBI, to do that would have been in that telephone conversation  that he had with Chairman Comer and me.   Having given you all this information, that ought to tell you  something about what the FBI is up to, what the DOJ is up to. And the  information I have given you today ought to tell you that there is  plenty out there in the media, and the media should not be questioning  whether or not this information in the 1023 has any validity.   I yield the floor.
