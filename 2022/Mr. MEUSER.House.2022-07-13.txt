 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, U.S. troops are in Syria to fight ISIS  pursuant to the 2001 counter-terrorism AUMF. For years, we have worked  with partners on the ground to eliminate the deadly and destabilizing  threat of ISIS.   This mission in Syria has been extremely successful. The job,  however, is nowhere near done. Just this week, our military succeeded  in eliminating the leader of ISIS in Syria. This comes after the  capture of a top ISIS leader and bombmaker in northwest Syria last  month.   According to the U.S. Central Command, ``removal of these ISIS  leaders will disrupt the terrorist organization's ability to further  plot and carry out attacks.''   Our continued presence on the ground is necessary to ensure the  enduring defeat of ISIS.                                time  2350    Such a short-sighted amendment would prematurely cut short our  presence in Syria. Our force in Syria has been extremely effective and  part of a global coalition to defeat ISIS. This is not the time for the  U.S. to abandon our allies and partners in Syria. We have seen what  occurs when such actions are taken.   None of us want our soldiers, American soldiers, men and women,  overseas longer than absolutely necessary. Many of us believe that the  AUMF of 2001 must be updated and replaced. But forcing a withdrawal too  soon virtually ensures we will have to return.   Such a plan that is outlined in this amendment undermines our  military position. We saw it in Iraq when President Obama withdrew, and  U.S. troops had to go back in just a few years later to fight ISIS.   We must avoid a similar situation in Syria. Withdrawal should be  based on the defeat of ISIS, not on an artificial timeline. For these  reasons, I urge opposition to this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
