 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to finish my remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to make  history in the U.S. Senate. Together, we can move forward with passing  one of the most important conservation bills in decades.   In fact, standing here today, I can tell you something. There are not  many issues that bring Republicans and Democrats together, but  something actually does that, and that is protecting our public lands.   If you remember, about a year and a half ago, we passed a major  bipartisan lands package where we permanently authorized a conservation  program--something we are here to talk about today--and that is the  Land and Water Conservation Fund.   Today we have the opportunity to move forward on this bipartisan  Great American Outdoors Act, a conservation bill that will provide full  and permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and  finally tackle this massive maintenance backlog that is plaguing our  public lands, including our national parks.   How we got here today isn't by chance. In fact, on February 27, I sat  down with my colleague Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Leader  McConnell, and President Trump in the White House--we were in the  Roosevelt room, in fact--to pitch a simple idea: Let's set aside  political gridlock, and let's pass the most important conservation law  in decades.   In fact, I showed the President of the United States, President  Trump, pictures of land and water conservation projects in Montana--the  Tenderfoot Creek and the Falls Creek projects--and we talked about the  importance of this program in places like Montana.   As a fifth-generation Montanan, I know just how important our public  lands are to protecting and preserving our Montana way of life, from  fishing on the Yellowstone River to summiting Granite Peak, which I did  back in college--in fact, the week after that, I summited the Grand  Teton down in Wyoming--or backpacking in The Barracks, which we do  virtually every summer. I have enjoyed our great outdoors, and this is  an appreciation and something that Cindy and I have passed on to our  four children. In fact, I proposed to my sweet wife Cindy on top of  Hyalite Peak, a peak over 10,000 feet just south of Bozeman, in July of  1986.   Montana is a place where you can still go down to Walmart and buy an  elk tag or deer tag over the counter and, literally, within minutes  have access to our public lands to hunt and fish.   As Montana's voice in the U.S. Senate, I have made it one of my  highest priorities to protect and expand access to our public lands,  and the Land and Water Conservation Fund is a critical tool for  accomplishing that.   Think about this for a moment: Over 70 percent of the fishing  accesses across Montana are funded through this conservation program.  Sportsmen, conservationists, and outdoor enthusiasts will agree that  this program is critical for conservation and important for protecting  our great outdoor heritage and our Montana way of life.   This conservation program is important for creating and protecting  jobs for our outdoor economy. This program is also an important tool  for land managers and agencies to address the checkerboard land  ownership. We see that in Montana. Addressing that checkerboard  ownership makes a lot of sense.   You see, over 1\1/2\ million acres of Federal land in our State sit  entirely landlocked. In many cases, specific land and water  conservation projects in Montana will help consolidate land  [[Page S2759]]  ownership that can make overall landscape management less complicated  and easier for agencies.   In fact, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was passed with the  intent to be funded at $900 million per year, and, every single year,  $900 million plus goes into that trust account, but nowhere close to  that level of funding is actually appropriated   In reality, if Congress wanted to, they don't have to fund the  program at all. In fact, only twice--going back to 1965--has it been  funded at the $900 million mark. What we see each year is the Land and  Water Conservation Fund gets raided by Congress, and millions of  dollars are spent on other programs.   Mandatory funding would create certainty for land managers that the  full $900 million goes toward that program every year moving forward.   Now, we must also support and preserve our country's beloved national  parks. Our national parks are what set us apart from the rest of the  world. I like to think of them as our office of first impressions, and  we need to do a better job taking care of them, be better stewards.   With record visitations and increased visitation each year, park  infrastructure has inevitably experienced wear and tear, and this has  led to a significant maintenance backlog. Today, there is nearly $12  billion in maintenance backlog facing our national parks across the  Nation, including $700 million in Glacier and Yellowstone National  Parks and an additional $34 million throughout the State in places like  Little Bighorn Battlefield and the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Park.   The bill also addresses the backlog in our Forest Service, BLM, and  Fish and Wildlife Service lands. In Montana, our forests are critical  for outdoor recreation as well as our wood products industry. It makes  sense that we protect and maintain access to these lands for future  generations because the wonders of our public lands are unique to any  other country in the world.   Montanans were brought up with a love of the outdoors and a sense of  responsibility to conserve as well as maintain them. To us, protecting  our public lands is about preserving the way of life unique to our  western frontier heritage.   It is an honor to serve the people of Montana in the U.S. Senate and  to bring this vote--a vote decades in the making--before the U.S.  Senate today. I urge my Senate colleagues to stand with me to pass this  bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act.   I am ready to get this done for Montana. Future generations are  counting on our vote today, and I believe, truly, it is a conservative  principle to conserve. The Founders' vision for America was a frontier  nation, a wild nation.   What made America distinct from industrial Europe and all the other  countries in the world was our outdoors, for, of course, what is  America without Lewis and Clark?   I will leave you with this last thought from Teddy Roosevelt. This  was in the context of thinking about our national parks and our public  lands: ``We have fallen heirs to the most glorious heritage a people  ever received, and each one must do his part if we wish to show that  the nation is worthy of its good fortune.''   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
