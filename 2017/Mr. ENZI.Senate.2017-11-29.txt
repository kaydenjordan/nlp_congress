 Mr. President, this is a historic day, as the Senate begins  consideration of tax reform that will help boost America's economy,  create more jobs, and leave more money in people's paychecks.   The House and Senate passage last month of the fiscal year 2018  budget resolution marked an important first step toward tax relief for  American families and job creators that will jump-start economic  growth. The resolution gave the Senate Finance Committee the headroom  to come up with comprehensive tax reform, and it instructed the Senate  Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save $1 billion. Finance  Committee Chairman Hatch and Energy and Natural Resources Committee  Chairwoman Murkowski both deserve praise for developing legislative  recommendations that fit with the budget resolution's reconciliation  instructions, and I thank them for their efforts.   Yesterday, the Senate Budget Committee took the next step by  combining the legislative recommendations from the Finance and the  Energy and Natural Resources Committees and reporting the combined bill  to the full Senate for consideration. This put our Nation one step  closer to real tax reform while advancing American energy security.   It is past time for us to act. A lot of things have changed since the  last major tax reform in 1986, and unfortunately our Tax Code hasn't  kept pace with those changes. It is an outdated mess that is hurting  American workers and holding back our economy. That is why we need tax  reform that will make our system simpler and fairer and allow people to  keep more of what they earn. The bill before us will do that. It will  help grow the economy, create jobs, and ensure that hard-working  Americans aren't missing available tax relief.   This bill also will provide relief to small, family-owned businesses.  We want to make sure that small businesses, which currently employ the  majority of the private sector in Wyoming and are the backbone of our  communities all over the country, have the opportunity to grow and  provide more jobs.   If you care about jobs, if you care about American companies staying  here and being able to compete globally, then you should also care  about reforming our business tax system. America has the fourth highest  corporate rate in the world. We need to encourage companies to bring  back their overseas money to increase the number of jobs here in the  United States. Lowering our uncommonly high and uncompetitive business  tax rate would be one of the quickest ways to solve the problem. It is  time we make America a more inviting place to invest, to do business,  and to create jobs.   We heard a lot of rhetoric yesterday in our committee meeting where  we reported this bill, and I expect we will be hearing a lot more of  the same arguments over the next couple of days. So I want to address  some of the claims made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  yesterday.   Several Members complained that there have been zero hearings on this  reconciliation legislation and that this has been a rushed process.  Nothing could be further from the truth.   The entire 2018 budget reconciliation process has been open,  transparent, and subject to regular order, starting with the passage of  the Senate budget resolution. The Senate Budget Committee marked up the  budget over 2 days and accepted amendments from both sides of the aisle  to make the resolution stronger. In fact, for the first time ever, the  minority was given a copy of the chairman's bill 5 days prior to the  start of the markup. According to many of my colleagues, it was one of  the most transparent budget resolution markups in history.   The budget resolution, complete with the reconciliation instructions  being used this week, was then debated on the floor in an open process  that allowed every Senator the opportunity to offer and vote on  amendments to improve the resolution before its final passage. That set  in motion the instructed committees' process for producing  recommendations.   Over the last 6 years, the Senate Finance Committee has held 70  hearings on how the Tax Code can be improved and streamlined to work  better for all Americans.   Earlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee held a 4-day markup  before finally approving tax reform legislation designed to modernize  our Tax Code. The markup lasted 23 hours and 34 minutes over the course  of those 4 days. Of the more than 350 amendments filed, 69 were asked  to be considered in committee. An additional 35 amendments, offered by  both Democrats and Republicans, were included in the final bill  reported out of committee.   On November 2, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held  a hearing to receive testimony on the potential for oil and gas  exploration and development in the so-called 1002 area of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. On November 15, after adopting a  bipartisan amendment, the committee approved, with bipartisan support,  legislation authorizing responsible development in the 1002 area and  meeting the $1 billion reconciliation deficit reduction target.   Let me explain what we are talking about. ANWR is 19.3 million acres.  It is about the size of South Carolina. The 1002 area is 1.57 million  acres--about the size of Delaware. The area within 1002 that we are  talking about for development is just 2,000 acres, which is smaller  than the Fargo, ND, airport.   When the Budget Committee met yesterday, consistent with our  responsibility under the Congressional Budget Act, we were only allowed  to combine the recommendations of the two committees. We reported the  combined bill to the full Senate. As provided by law, no amendments  were allowed because, under the Budget Act, our committee is prohibited  from substantially changing either committee's approved  recommendations. Now that this bill is on the floor, however, it will  be subject to the amendment process. For reconciliation bills like  this, the amount of amendments that can be offered is unlimited.   Several Members yesterday accused us of no longer caring about  overspending and the debt. Again, this is completely false. Better tax  policy will boost the value of everything we produce, and this will  mean more revenue for the Federal Government.   The cost of this bill that you will hear my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle argue assumes the bill has little effect on the  economy. That assumption is based on the sluggish growth we have had  recently. In 2016, annual GDP growth was 1.6 percent, but our  historical average growth is 3.2  [[Page S7395]]  percent. Under President Trump's efforts and the hope that he has  brought to working Americans, our economy has grown at more than 3  percent over the last two quarters. If we only get to 2.4 percent  growth in the private sector, this bill will be paid for. If we reach  3.2 percent growth, part of the debt will be paid down with the extra  revenue that will be generated.   We have tried stimulus, and it left us with the 1.6 percent. We have  tried cutting. In Washington, if you don't give the amount of increase  that people are asking for but you give them more money than they had  last year, that is considered a cut. So cuts haven't worked here,  either. So what is the other option that we have? Growing the economy.   Now, I want to repeat that in 2016 the annual GDP growth was 1.6  percent, but our historical average growth is 3.2 percent. And under  President Trump's efforts and the hope he has brought to working  Americans, our economy has grown at more than 3 percent over the last  two quarters, without this. If we only get to 2.4 percent growth in the  private sector, this bill will be paid for. I believe we can reach the  3.2-percent growth, and part of the debt will be paid down from the  extra revenue that will be generated.   Some people will say that after tax cuts before, the deficit has gone  up. I hope you check and see that the revenue has gone up, but the  spending went up bigger. It is like somebody winning the lottery and  spending their winnings twice.   This reconciliation bill will make concrete reforms to the broken  U.S. Tax Code and put the American economy back on a growth track. This  tax plan is an investment in hard-working Americans, one that will  produce more jobs and result in higher wages and a stronger and more  competitive American economy.   You are probably going to hear a lot of screaming going on in  speeches this week. Please don't confuse volume with veracity or truth.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to help pass this bill.  It will not only benefit hard-working Americans, but it will make our  economy and our country stronger.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 3003 of H. Con. Res. 71, the  concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates and levels in the budget resolution for legislation  considered under the resolution's reconciliation instructions.   I find that S. Amdt. 1618 fulfills the conditions found in section  3003 of H. Con. Res. 71. Accordingly, I am revising the allocations to  the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources, and other enforceable budgetary levels to account for the  budgetary effects of the amendment.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and Section 3003 of H.
