 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx for the  opportunity to speak about my vital piece of legislation.   I rise today as an avid hunter and fisherman and as someone who wants  to see these timeless traditions and skills passed down to the next  generation.   My bill, the Hunting Heritage and Education Act, will prohibit the  Department of Education from withholding Federal funds from school  archery programs, hunting safety courses, and culinary classes.   The Biden administration's misinterpretation of the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act unfairly targeted archery and shooting sports programs  in K-12 schools. It didn't address fencing programs.   Democrats and Republicans agree, the Biden administration missed the  target here in Congress by a long shot. In fact, the bill came out of  committee unanimously. Under the Department of Education's current  interpretation of the law, other school activities like fencing and the  culinary arts would also be at risk eventually. This would be  unacceptable.                                time  1645    For my family and those in my district, hunting and fishing are more  than just hobbies. They are a way of life. The early mornings and long  hours that I have spent hunting and fishing, first with my father and  now with my son and son-in-law, are extremely important to me. I  cherish these memories, and I know many families across the country  feel the same way. I will tell you this: You can really get to know  someone after spending a few hours in a duck blind with them.   Hunters and fishers are also the best conservationists. As Psalms  24:1 says: The Earth is the Lord's and all it contains, the world and  those who live in it.   I believe we are all called to steward God's creation, and this is a  part of what we teach our children when we take them hunting.   The truth is, being out in nature is good for kids. Education  policies oriented toward K-12 schools should place a larger focus on  getting kids out from behind screens and into the great outdoors. Our  Nation is blessed with beautiful lands and waters, and we need more  kids to put down the controller and take up the rod or a bow.   Despite the administration's flawed ruling, many are. Across the  country, thousands of students participate in shooting sports and  archery. In fact, 9,000 schools belong to the National Archery in the  Schools Program, and many of these students go on to receive college  scholarships. It would be cruel to take these opportunities away from  these students.   I am glad to lead this charge, and I thank all those who are behind  me, such as 24 State attorneys general, including my own attorney  general from Tennessee, the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the  Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports, the Boone and  Crockett Club, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the Backcountry  Hunters and Anglers, the National Wildlife Federation, and the  bipartisan members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.   Let's get this done.
