 Madam President, we have all heard the phrase ``law  enforcement family.'' This law enforcement family is a diverse family  with representatives from all walks of life. This family is not bound  by traditions of race, religion, color, or sex. This family is all  inclusive. Today, I want to provide an example of this family and how  they came together to save the life of a fellow law enforcement  officer.   On January 28, 2022, Kentucky State Police Trooper Michael Sanguini  was shot multiple times while conducting a traffic stop in Harrison  County. According to the preliminary investigation, he was struck six  times, of which three shots were stopped by his ballistic vest. One  shot struck his portable radio, and another struck his issued taser,  with one shot striking his body.   Although many officers from multiple agencies responded to assist the  injured trooper, I want to recognize Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Officer  Samantha Faoro for her quick response and actions of assistance.  Officer Samantha Faoro is a native of Colorado, who moved to Kentucky  to pursue her career with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife.  She graduated from the police academy in February 2021 and was assigned  to work in Harrison County. Officer Faoro comes from a family of first  responders, continuing the life of service to protect the great  Commonwealth of Kentucky.   Officer Faoro was working in the area of Cynthiana, KY, when she  heard Trooper Sanguini state he had been shot. Without hesitation,  Officer Faoro responded directly to the scene to provide assistance to  a fellow officer in need. Upon arrival to the scene, she observed the  wounded trooper and quickly transported him to the hospital. Trooper  Sanguini quickly received medical treatment for his gunshot wounds  because of the quick action of Officer Faoro.   It is my privilege to stand here today and recognize another great  officer such as Officer Samantha Faoro. She exemplifies the law  enforcement motto, ``To Protect, and To Serve.''                            ____________________
