 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, next week will mark what would have been the  100th birthday of my predecessor, Senator Claiborne de Borda Pell, who  was born on November 22, 1918. This year, appropriately enough, the  date falls on Thanksgiving.   We lost Senator Pell nearly 9 years ago after a long struggle with  Parkinson's disease, which robbed him of his mobility but not his  spirit. He was sustained by the love of his wonderful family,  especially his beloved wife, the late Nuala Pell.   A person who dedicated his life to selfless service to Rhode Island  and the Nation, Senator Pell would not want a showy commemoration of  his centenary. He was not one to seek the limelight. Moreover, for him,  his birthday--November 22--became a somber day for remembrance and  mourning the loss of his dear friend, President John F. Kennedy.   But at a time when differences seem more striking than our common  cause and when there is a question of whether America's role in the  world community should be guided solely by narrowly defined self- interest or by our democratic ideals, it is helpful for us to recall  the example and standard Senator Pell set--both his accomplishments and  the civility he maintained throughout his career.   He was born into a family of great wealth and privilege, yet  Claiborne Pell never exhibited a sense of entitlement. At a defining  moment in the history of our country and a defining moment in his life,  Claiborne Pell demonstrated that privilege and wealth was not a way to  avoid the rigors of life. Rather, for him, they offered the opportunity  and responsibility to meet the challenges of the times with vigor and  wisdom and optimism.   As World War II approached, Claiborne Pell, with family connections,  poor eyesight, and a high draft number, could have easily secured a  sinecure, a safe posting to ride out the war. Instead, before Pearl  Harbor, he decided on his own to enlist in the Coast Guard and  eventually sailed the dangerous North Atlantic convoy runs.  Significantly, Claiborne chose to enlist not as an officer but as a  seaman so that he could get a chance at sea duty.   The complete lack of regard for status or pretense, which he showed  in his World War II service, would continue to mark his public service  and endear him to generations of Rhode Islanders. For 36 years,  Claiborne Pell did not simply represent Rhode Island in the U.S.  Senate; he represented the ideal of what a public servant should be.   He said that his motto or statement of purpose was to ``translate  ideas into action and help people.'' And that is what he did. One  hundred years after his birth and 58 years after his first election to  the Senate, millions of Americans continued to be helped by his ideas  translated into action.   He believed that government had a critical role in providing  opportunity, particularly the opportunity for a good education for  every American, and he knew that there were unbounded horizons for the  initiative, invention, and innovation of these well-educated sons and  daughters of America. Truly, they would continue and enhance the great  endeavor that is America.   He authored the legislation that established the Basic Education  Opportunity grant, now known as the Pell grant. Today, roughly 7.5  million students rely on Pell grants to help pay for college.   He wrote the legislation that created the National Endowment for the  Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. To this day, these  agencies support artistic, educational, and cultural programming in  communities large and small across the Nation, fulfilling Senator  Pell's commitment to strengthening and preserving our national cultural  heritage for all Americans.   He led the effort to establish the Institute of Museum and Library  Services, helping libraries and museums across the Nation transform  their communities through access to information and opportunities for  lifelong learning. According to the Institute, people visited libraries  over 1.3 billion times in 2015, and 55 million student groups visit  museums each year.   The vision he articulated in the early 1960s for high-quality  passenger rail service connecting the major population centers on the  east coast into a megalopolis led to the creation of Amtrak and the  Northeast Corridor. Decades later, it is interesting to see not only  how much of his vision has been achieved but also how much of his  vision is now reflected in ideas like Elon Musk's ``hyperloop.''   Touched by the death of two members of his staff who were killed by  drunk drivers, Senator Pell authored the first Federal anti-drunk  driving bill in 1976--4 years before the founding of advocacy group  MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Senator Pell's legislation became  the model for Federal policy efforts to combat impaired driving by  giving the States strong incentives to toughen their laws.   Senator Pell was also deeply committed to America's role in securing  world peace. His notion of a powerful America leading the world--not  standing apart from it--and his notion that our values, our system, and  our commitment to human decency would prevail in the face of  totalitarianism were wisdom of the ages. In his service on the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, he espoused those views, seeking to remind  us that our destiny would take us far beyond what simply a military  operation or our economic power might because of our ideals and  commitment to creating a world community.   Senator Pell's approach to legislating was unfailingly kind and  civil. In his farewell speech to the Senate, he laid out his guiding  rules. In his words: ``First, never respond to an adversary in ad  hominem terms.''   In his six campaigns for the U.S. Senate, Claiborne Pell never ran a  negative ad or attacked his opponent personally. Rhode Islanders  rewarded him with an average vote of more than 60 percent for each of  his elections.   ``Second, always let the other fellow have your way.''   For Senator Pell, winning an ally to achieve a legislative victory  was more valuable than getting exclusive credit.       ``Third, sometimes half a loaf can feed an army.''       He lived by those rules, but he feared that our politics and our  media were pulling us in the opposite direction. That is why he used  his farewell speech to urge us to stay true to a practice of politics  worthy of our Democratic tradition, saying:         If I could have one wish for the future of our country in       the new millennium, it would be that we not abandon the       traditional norms of behavior that are the underpinning of       our democratic system.            Comity and civility, transcending differences of party and       ideology, have always  [[Page S6948]]       been crucial elements in making Government an effective and       constructive instrument of public will. But in times such as       these, when there is fundamental disagreement about the role       of Government, it is all the more essential that we preserve       the spirit of civil discourse.    Those words ring very true and relevant today as they did when he  gave them in his farewell address.   Following in Senator Pell's footsteps, I am one who is in awe of his  presence and accomplishments and feel a deep responsibility to  continuing his legacy. He forged an enduring bond with the people of  Rhode Island. He put ideas into action to help people. He was always  civil and ready to find common ground.   As we celebrate Senator Pell's 100th birthday, let's take inspiration  from his spirit of service and collegiality. Let's translate ideas into  action and help people.   Mr. President, I know my colleague Senator Whitehouse is here. Mr.  Whitehouse is someone who knew Senator Pell well, and he continues in  the image and spirit of Senator Pell by being someone who brings his  great talents and skills to serve the people of Rhode Island and the  Nation with dignity, civility, and great energy. With that, Mr.  President, I would like to yield to my colleague Senator Whitehouse.    I again want to thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse for  his very eloquent words about a great American, Claiborne Pell.   Just a final comment. If you ever want to feel truly beloved,  embraced by constituents, respected and admired, do what I did several  times--march in a parade with Claiborne Pell and pretend they cheer for  you.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
