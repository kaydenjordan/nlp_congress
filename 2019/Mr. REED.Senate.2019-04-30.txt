 Mr. President, the PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act,  which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley, will permit the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to make public the  disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit  firms earlier in the process.   More than fifteen years ago, our markets were victimized by a series  of massive financial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron  and WorldCom. In response to this crisis, the Senate Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted multiple hearings, which  produced consensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak  corporate governance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate  oversight of accountants charged with auditing public companies'  financial statements.   In a 99 to 0 vote, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  to address the structural weaknesses and faults revealed by the  hearings. Among its many provisions, this law called for the creation  of a strong and independent board, the PCAOB, responsible for  overseeing auditors of public companies in order to protect investors  who rely on independent audit reports on the financial statements of  public companies.   To conduct its duties, the PCAOB, under the oversight of the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversees more than 1,800  registered accounting firms, as well as the audit partners and staff  who contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The Board's ability to  begin proceedings that can determine whether there have been violations  of its auditing standards or rules of professional practice is an  important component of its oversight.   However, unlike the SEC, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading  Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and other  oversight bodies, the Board's disciplinary proceedings cannot be made  public without consent from the parties involved.  [[Page S2523]]  Of course, parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no  incentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus  these proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In  addition, the Board cannot publicize the results of its disciplinary  proceedings until after the appeals process has been completely  exhausted, which can often take several years.   Concealing PCAOB disciplinary proceedings from the public creates a  lack of transparency that invites abuse and undermines the  Congressional intent behind the PCAOB, which was to shine a bright  light on auditing firms and practices, and to bolster the  accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing public.   Over the years, some bad actors have used this loophole to shield  themselves from public scrutiny and accountability. Former PCAOB  Chairman James Doty repeatedly stated in testimony provided to both the  Senate and House of Representatives that the secrecy of the proceedings  ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and that such secrecy is  harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and the public at large.   For example, an accounting firm continued to issue no fewer than 29  additional audit reports on public companies without those companies  knowing that it was subject to a PCAOB disciplinary proceeding.  Disturbingly, these investors and the public company clients of that  audit firm were deprived of important information about the proceeding  against the firm and the substance of any violations. There are other  critical reasons why the Board's enforcement proceedings should be open  and transparent.   First, the incentive to litigate cases in order to shield conduct  from public scrutiny as long as possible frustrates the process and  requires both litigants and the PCAOB to expend needless resources.   Second, agencies such as the SEC have found that open and transparent  disciplinary proceedings can be valuable because they inform peer audit  firms of the type of activity that could lead to enforcement action by  the regulator. In effect, transparent proceedings can serve as a  deterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in the  likelihood of ``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry as a  whole would also benefit from timely, public, and non-secret  enforcement proceedings.   Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices,  orders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless  otherwise ordered by the Board. This would more closely align the  PCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters.   Increasing transparency and accountability of audit firms subject to  PCAOB disciplinary proceedings bolsters investor confidence in our  financial markets and better protects companies from problematic  auditors. I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in  supporting this legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's  enforcement process.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act,  which I reintroduce today with Senator Grassley, will permit the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to make public the  disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit  firms earlier in the process.
