 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4969) to improve the design and construction of  diplomatic posts, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4969         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Embassy Security       Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2019''.       SEC. 2. STANDARD DESIGN IN CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department of State's Bureau of Overseas Building       Operations (OBO) or successor office should give appropriate       consideration to standard embassy design, in which each new       embassy and new consulate starts with a standard design and       keeps customization to a minimum.        (b) Consultation.--The Secretary of State shall, in       consultation with the appropriate congressional committees,       carry out any new embassy compound project or new consulate       compound project that is in the design phase or pre-design       phase as of the date of the enactment of this Act and that       utilizes a non-standard design. The Secretary shall provide       such committees, for each such project, the following       documentation:        (1) A comparison of the estimated full lifecycle costs of       the project at issue to the estimated full lifecycle costs of       such project if such project were to use a standard embassy       design.        (2) A comparison of the estimated completion date of such       project to the estimated completion date of such project if       such project were to use a standard embassy design.        (3) A comparison of the security of such completed project       to the security of such completed project if such completed       project were to use a standard embassy design.        (4) A justification for the Secretary's selection of a non-      standard design over a standard embassy design for such       project.        (5) A written explanation if any of the documentation       necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as       the case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4)       cannot be provided.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that the Bureau of       Overseas Building Operations of the Department of State or       its successor office shall continue to balance functionality       and security with accessibility as defined by guidelines       established by the United States Access Board in constructing       embassies and consulates and shall ensure compliance with the       Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 to the fullest extent       possible.       SEC. 4. CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION TRANSPARENCY.         (a) In General.--Section 118 of the Department of State       Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 304) is       amended--        (1) in the section heading, by striking ``annual report on       embassy construction costs'' and inserting ``quarterly report       on overseas capital construction projects''; and        (2) by amending subsections (a) and (b) to read as follows:        ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this subsection and every 90 days       thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a comprehensive report regarding all       ongoing overseas capital construction projects and major       embassy security upgrade projects.        ``(b) Contents.--Each report required under subsection (a)       shall include the following with respect to each ongoing       overseas capital construction project and major embassy       security upgrade project:        ``(1) The initial cost estimate as specified in the       proposed allocation of capital construction and maintenance       funds required by the Committees on Appropriations for Acts       making appropriations for the Department of State, foreign       operations, and related programs.        ``(2) The current cost estimate.        ``(3) The value of each request for equitable adjustment       received by the Department of State to date.        ``(4) The value of each certified claim received by the       Department of State to date.        ``(5) The value of any usage of the project's contingency       fund to date and the value of the remainder of the project's       contingency fund.        ``(6) An enumerated list of each request for adjustment and       certified claim that remains outstanding or unresolved.        ``(7) An enumerated list of each request for equitable       adjustment and certified claim that has been fully       adjudicated or that the Department has settled, and the final       dollar amount of each adjudication or settlement.        ``(8) The date of estimated completion specified in the       proposed allocation of capital construction and maintenance       funds required by the Committees on Appropriations not later       than 45 days after the date of the enactment of an Act making       appropriations for the Department of State, foreign       operations, and related programs.        ``(9) The current date of estimated completion.''.        (b) Initial Report.--The first report required under       subsection (a) of section 118 of the Department of State       Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (as amended by this       section) shall include an annex regarding all overseas       capital construction projects and major embassy security       upgrade projects completed during the 10-year period ending       on December 31, 2018, including, for each such project, the       elements specified in subsection (b) of such section 118 (as       amended by this section).

(2) Elements.--The system required under paragraph (1)       should prioritize such evaluations as follows:        (A) Project completion evaluations should be prioritized       over annual evaluations.        (B) Evaluations for relatively large contracts should have       priority.        (C) Evaluations that would be particularly informative for       the awarding of government contracts should have priority.        (c) Briefing.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall brief the       appropriate congressional committees on the Department of       State's plan for completing all evaluations by October 1,       2020, and the prioritization system developed pursuant to       this section.        (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) contractors deciding whether to bid on Department of       State contracts would benefit from greater understanding of       the Department as a client; and        (2) the Department should develop a forum through which       contractors can rate the Department's project management       performance.       SEC. 6. GROWTH PROJECTIONS FOR NEW EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES.         (a) In General.--For each new embassy compound project       (NEC) and new consulate compound project (NCC) in or not yet       in the design phase as of the date of the enactment of this       Act, the Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and       Innovation of the Department of State shall project growth       over the estimated life of the facility at issue using all       available and relevant data, including the following:        (1) Relevant historical trends for Department personnel and       personnel from other agencies represented at the NEC or NCC       that is to be constructed.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous materials in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me make this observation for my colleagues. The U.S.  Department of State operates more than 270 diplomatic posts around the  world, often in difficult and sometimes very, very hostile  environments. These embassies and consulates project American power and  reflect our values. They protect the lives of the Americans who work in  and visit those embassies every day. We owe it to the American people  and those who serve us overseas to build the most secure, effective,  and efficient embassies and consulates that we possibly can.   That is why I want to thank Chairman Mike McCaul, the author of this  [[Page H7842]]  bill, who is with us. Each day, there are thousands of brave Americans  who serve our country at our embassies and consulates overseas. These  facilities are our outposts for democracy. While our diplomats serve  overseas, it is our job to ensure that they have the resources and  support they need. This bill will do just that, by authorizing critical  resources for embassy security, construction, and maintenance;  enhancing worldwide security protection; and lastly, improving  oversight of embassy design and construction of these consulates and  embassies.   The threats facing our embassies and diplomats overseas are real. We  need to respond. The reported sonic attacks against our diplomats  serving in Havana--and Canadian diplomats serving there, too, as you  will recall--serve as a stark reminder of the real and complex security  challenges they face on a daily basis. Yet, the last time Congress  authorized resources for enhanced embassy security was immediately  after al-Qaida bombed the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es  Salaam, Tanzania. Over 220 people were killed and 4,000 others were  injured in these attacks.   On August 7, we solemnly recognized the 20th anniversary of those  cowardly attacks. Thus, we must strengthen our resolve to do everything  within our power to prevent another Nairobi or Dar es Salaam attack by  constructing the safest, most secure, and most appropriate diplomatic  posts around the world. That starts with this bill, which, if enacted,  will be the first embassy security authorization in 15 years.   Since the East African Embassy bombings, the State Department has  used several different approaches to design and construct new posts  quickly and efficiently. This is no small task, but what has become  clear is that effective congressional oversight of these projects is  essential to ensuring their success.   That is why this bill promotes efficient contracting methods, ensures  the facilities meet security and safety standards, and engages with the  State Department in an effective, long-range planning process for the  new projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4969, which will  improve the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of our embassies  and consulates.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for  mentioning the State Department authorization. We are still working on  that measure. We hope to move that.   In the interim, though, the ability to move on the floor now with the  embassy security measure is important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, of course,  a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and he is the  author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America's embassies obviously are forward operating  bases for our democracy, for our system. The brave men and women who  serve at those posts represent our country on a daily basis and  represent them often in a difficult and increasingly dangerous  environment.   As we have tragically seen before, diplomatic posts overseas are  often the first and easiest targets our enemies choose to attack.  Importantly, this legislation will improve the security, the  functionality, and the efficiency of our embassies and our consulates  through enhanced oversight and better management of the construction of  new diplomatic facilities.   So, again, I want to thank Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas, and I want  to thank Representative Robin Kelly, as well as Ranking Member Engel  and the many members of the committee from both sides of the aisle who  have worked extensively on this important piece of legislation.   Our embassies project American power. They do reflect our values. We  owe it to our diplomats and the American people to build the best  embassies possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5576) to address state-sponsored cyber activities  against the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5576         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Deterrence and       Response Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On February 13, 2018, the Director of National       Intelligence stated in his testimony before the Senate Select       Committee on Intelligence that ``Russia, China, Iran, and       North Korea will pose the greatest cyber threats to the       United States during the next year'' through the use of cyber       operations as low-cost tools of statecraft, and assessed that       these states would ``work to use cyber operations to achieve       strategic objectives unless they face clear repercussions for       their cyber operations''.        (2) The 2017 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the United       States Intelligence Community stated that ``The potential for       surprise in the cyber realm will increase in the next year       and beyond as billions more digital devices are connected--      with relatively little built-in security--and both nation       states and malign actors become more emboldened and better       equipped in the use of increasingly widespread cyber       toolkits. The risk is growing that some adversaries will       conduct cyber attacks--such as data deletion or localized and       temporary disruptions of critical infrastructure--against the       United States in a crisis short of war.''.        (3) On March 29, 2017, President Donald J. Trump deemed it       necessary to continue the national emergency declared in       Executive Order 13694 as ``Significant malicious cyber-      enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons       located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United       States, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat       to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the       United States.''.        (4) On January 5, 2017, former Director of National       Intelligence, James Clapper, former Undersecretary of Defense       for Intelligence, Marcel Lettre, and the Commander of the       United States Cyber Command, Admiral Michael Rogers,       submitted joint testimony to the Committee on Armed Services       of the Senate that stated ``As of late 2016 more than 30       nations are developing offensive cyber attack capabilities''       and that ``Protecting critical infrastructure, such as       crucial energy, financial, manufacturing, transportation,       communication, and health systems, will become an       increasingly complex national security challenge.''.        (5) There is significant evidence that hackers affiliated       with foreign governments have conducted cyber operations       targeting companies and critical infrastructure sectors in       the United States as the Department of Justice and the       Department of the Treasury have announced that--        (A) on March 15, 2018, five Russian entities and 19 Russian       individuals were designated under the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, as well as pursuant to       Executive Order 13694, for interference in the 2016 United       States elections and other malicious cyber-enabled       activities;        (B) on March 24, 2016, seven Iranians working for Iran's       Revolutionary Guard Corps-affiliated entities were indicted       for conducting distributed denial of service attacks against       the financial sector in the United States from 2012 to 2013;       and        (C) on May 19, 2014, five Chinese military hackers were       charged for hacking United States companies in the nuclear       power, metals, and solar products industries, and engaging in       economic espionage.        (6) In May 2017, North Korea released ``WannaCry'' pseudo-      ransomware, which posed a significant risk to the economy,       national security, and the citizens of the United States and       the world, as it resulted in the infection of over 300,000       computer systems in more than 150 countries, including in the       healthcare sector of the United Kingdom, demonstrating the       global reach and cost of cyber-enabled malicious activity.        (7) In June 2017, Russia carried out the most destructive       cyber-enabled operation in history, releasing the NotPetya       malware that caused billions of dollars' worth of damage       within Ukraine and across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.        (8) In May 2018, the Department of State, pursuant to       section 3(b) of Executive Order 13800, prepared       recommendations to the President on Deterring Adversaries and       Better Protecting the American People From Cyber Threats,       which stated ``With respect to activities below the threshold       of the use of force, the United States should, working with       likeminded partners when possible, adopt an approach of       imposing swift, costly, and transparent consequences on       foreign governments responsible for significant malicious       cyber activities aimed at harming U.S. national interests.''.

(ii) Transmission.--If the President exercises the       authority under this subparagraph to withhold from       publication in the Federal Register the identification of a       foreign person or agency or instrumentality of a foreign       state designated as a critical cyber threat actor under this       subsection, the President shall transmit to the appropriate       congressional committees in classified form a report       containing any such identification, together with the reasons       for such exercise.        (b) Non-travel-related Sanctions.--        (1) In general.--The President shall impose one or more of       the applicable sanctions described in paragraph (2) with       respect to each foreign person and each agency or       instrumentality of a foreign state designated as a critical       cyber threat actor under subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, foreign adversaries have developed  sophisticated cyber capabilities that can disrupt our network, that can  threaten our critical infrastructure, and that harm our economy and  undermine our elections.   Malicious cyber activity topped the Director of National  Intelligence's list of worldwide threats in 2018--topped it--ahead of  terrorism and weapons of mass destruction; and in testimony before this  Congress, Director Coats stated: ``Frankly, the United States is under  attack.''   A report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates  that malicious cyber activity cost the U.S. economy between $57 billion  and over $100 billion in 2016 alone. But it is not just the economic  cost of cyber incidents that we should worry about. There are real  physical costs to these online attacks as well.   Last year's WannaCry cyberattack by the North Korea regime  compromised the U.K.'s healthcare sector, if you will recall. In 2016,  Russian cyber actors attempted to interfere in our election--an assault  on our very democracy--and these attacks by Russia continue today.  Despite the gravity of this threat, the U.S. continues to lack a  unified framework to deter and respond to state-sponsored cyber  activities.   I applaud Representative Yoho and Ranking Member Engel for  introducing the Cyber Deterrence and Response Act, which establishes a  framework for deterring and responding to state-sponsored malicious  cyber activity against this country.   Consistent with the State Department's recommendation to the  President on deterrence in cyberspace, this bill will ensure swift,  powerful, and transparent consequences against bad actors online.   Specifically, this bill requires the President to designate as a  critical cyber threat actor each foreign person or each foreign agency  of a foreign state that the President determines is responsible for  state-sponsored cyber activities that pose a significant threat to the  national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial  stability of the United States. In effect, this would codify America's  longstanding unofficial policy of naming and shaming bad actors in  cyberspace.   Further, this bill would require the President to impose sanctions  from a menu of options against any critical cyber threat actor.   Finally, the bill calls on the President to coordinate designations  and sanctions with our allies and partners to maximize their  effectiveness. The Secretary of State is to lead an international  diplomatic initiative to deter state-sponsored cyber activities and  promote mutual support to our allies and partners to respond to  malicious cyber incidents.   This legislation will put countries like Iran, North Korea, and  Russia on notice that the United States is prepared to impose tough  consequences for cyber attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, July 20, 2018.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 5576, the       Cyber Deterrence and Response Act of 2018.        As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on       Financial Services concerning provisions in the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor. The Committee  [[Page H7846]]       on Financial Services takes this action with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5576,       at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward so that       we may address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule       X jurisdiction.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 5576, the Cyber Deterrence and       Response Act of 2018, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this measure into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as it moves       through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick). He is a member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is a cosponsor of this legislation. He  has formerly worked for the FBI on cyber issues, and we very much  appreciate his expertise in this area.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis). He is a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and a cosponsor of this legislation as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would really like to thank our colleagues  here, especially Representative Ted Yoho, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and the ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Eliot Engel of New York.   I also want to thank the Financial Services Committee that worked  with us on this legislation. We want to thank, in addition, the  Judiciary Committee. We had the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee that worked with us as well in support of this bill.   I think, as Mr. Yoho would share with you, the bill is truly a  bipartisan endeavor that has been improved by contributions from  multiple committees, government agencies, and the business community.  And with the passage of this bill, Congress sends a strong message to  our adversaries, that cyberattacks against the United States and  against our allies will not be tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5274) to promote international exchanges on best  election practices, cultivate more secure democratic institutions  around the world, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5274         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Electoral Exchange       Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) recent elections globally have illustrated the urgent       need for the promotion and exchange of international best       election practices, particularly in the areas of       cybersecurity, results transmission, transparency of       electoral data, election dispute resolution, and the       elimination of discriminatory registration practices and       other electoral irregularities;        (2) the advancement of democracy worldwide promotes       American interests, as stable democracies provide new market       opportunities, improve global health outcomes, and promote       economic freedom and regional security;        (3) credible elections are the cornerstone of a healthy       democracy and enable all persons to exercise their basic       human right to have a say in how they are governed;        (4) inclusive elections strengthen the credibility and       stability of democracies more broadly, as democratic       institutions flourish when representative of all groups of       society;        (5) at the heart of a strong election cycle is the       professionalism of the election management body and an       empowered civil society; and        (6) the development of local expertise via peer-to-peer       learning and exchanges promotes the independence of such       bodies from internal and external influence.       SEC. 3. GLOBAL ELECTORAL EXCHANGE.         (a) Global Electoral Exchange.--The Secretary of State is       authorized to establish and administer a Global Electoral       Exchange Program to promote the utilization of sound election       administration practices around the world.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Global Electoral Exchange       Program described in subsection (a) shall include the       promotion and exchange of international best election       practices, including in the areas of--        (1) cybersecurity;        (2) results transmission;        (3) transparency of electoral data;        (4) election dispute resolution;        (5) the elimination of discriminatory registration       practices and electoral irregularities;        (6) equitable access to polling places, voter education       information, and voting mechanisms (including by persons with       disabilities); and        (7) other sound election administration practices.        (c) Exchange of Electoral Authorities.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of State may, in       consultation, as appropriate, with the United States Agency       for International Development, make grants to any United       States-based organization described in section 501(c)(3) of       the Internal Revenue Code of  [[Page H7849]]       1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code       with experience in comparative election systems or subject       matter expertise in the areas of election administration or       electoral integrity that submits an application in such form,       and satisfying such requirements, as the Secretary may       require.        (2) Types of grants.--An organization described in       paragraph (1) may receive a grant for one or more of the       following purposes:        (A) To design and implement programs bringing election       administrators and officials, including government officials,       poll workers, civil society representatives, members of the       judiciary, and others who participate in the organization and       administration of public elections in a foreign country to       the United States to study election procedures in the United       States for educational purposes.        (B) To design and implement programs taking United States       or another country's election administrators and officials,       including government officials, poll workers, civil society       representatives, members of the judiciary, and others who       participate in the organization and administration of public       elections to study election procedures for educational       purposes.        (3) Limits on activities.--Activities administered under       the Global Electoral Exchange Program may not--        (A) include observation of an election for the purposes of       assessing the validity or legitimacy of that election; or        (B) facilitate any advocacy for a certain electoral result       by a grantee when participating in the Program.        (4) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Secretary of State should establish and maintain a       network of Global Electoral Exchange Program alumni, to       promote communication and further exchange of information       regarding sound election administration practices among       current and former program participants.        (5) Further limits.--A recipient of a grant under the       Global Electoral Exchange Program may use such grant for only       the purpose for which such grant was awarded, unless       otherwise authorized by the Secretary of State.        (6) Not duplicative.--Grants made under this subsection may       not be duplicative of any other grants made under any other       provision of law for similar or related purposes.       SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act and in each of the following two years thereafter,       the Secretary of State shall provide to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a briefing on       the status of any activities carried out pursuant to this Act       during the preceding year, which shall include, among other       information, the following:        (1) A summary of all exchanges conducted under the Global       Electoral Exchange Program, including information regarding       grantees, participants, and the locations where program       activities were held.        (2) A description of the criteria used to select grantees       under the Global Electoral Exchange Program.        (3) Any recommendations for the improvement of the Global       Electoral Exchange Program, based on the purpose specified in       section 3(b).       SEC. 5. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members may have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, America is more secure when fewer nations are  authoritarian, and that is the unfortunate alternative to democracy,  are authoritarian strongmen. These strongmen regimes justify their  repression at home by creating enemies abroad.   Since the freedom we enjoy is a threat to authoritarian regimes, the  U.S. and our allies are natural targets for their aggression. We have  seen this, unfortunately, with Moscow, with Beijing, and with the  regime in North Korea. This is why there is longstanding, bipartisan  support in this Congress for our democracy promotion programs overseas.   In recent years, however, we have seen democracy decline worldwide.  This is fueled, in many cases, by a decreasing level of public  confidence in democracy and in elections. Unfortunately, many people  around the world just cannot trust that their elections are free and  fair, and we have seen this happen in Honduras, in Cambodia, and in the  DRC.   The bill before us addresses these issues by crafting an  international exchange program with an objective, and that is, of  promoting capabilities and instilling best election practices around  this planet. This two-way exchange program will support countries in  between their election cycles when they have the time to assess  shortcomings. And then it will help them during elections to integrate  lessons learned, to build coalitions, and to implement reforms.   Healthy societies depend on elections that accurately reflect the  decision of voters. The world has a shared stake in the integrity of  the election mechanisms--these are the nuts and bolts of how people  cast their votes and how these votes are counted, and how they have  done this free from manipulation.   I want to close by noting that this is a very real-time concern, and  particularly important in the Western Hemisphere, as there are national  elections coming up this fall in Brazil, and next year in Bolivia and  El Salvador. So I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would like to thank the authors of the bill. I would like to thank  Representative Castro and Representative Meadows. I would like to thank  also our ranking member, Mr. Engel. They put a lot of work in on this  important legislation.   There has long been a strong bipartisan consensus in Congress on the  importance of promoting democracy overseas, and this is because America  is undeniably more secure when fewer nations are authoritarian.   But democracy promotion is not just about that. It is not just about  our security. It is also morally just. Human rights are far better  protected in democratic countries, ones without dank prison cells full  of political prisoners.   Elections are an important part of democracy, but all too often,  elections overseas are plagued, often by corruption or technical  challenges, sometimes by lack of transparency. And this bill will  address these impediments by creating an electoral exchange program so  that we can take our best practices and lessons learned overseas to  help local governments improve their own election capacity.   So I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
