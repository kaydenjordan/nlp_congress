 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition,  but I also thank Mr. Nadler, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  for bringing this important statement of our American values to the  floor of the House. I thank him and our colleagues from the Senate,  Senators Kamala Harris, Tammy Duckworth, and Mazie Hirono, three Asian- American Members of the United States Senate who were so instrumental  in advancing this important, as I said, statement of American values.   And yes, it is a good use of time for us in the House of  Representatives to state our values, to remove all doubt that people in  our country are respected, and that we are not using a pandemic to have  people--I will go into that in a moment.   But let me just say this. Before the distinguished leader spoke, the  gentleman on the other side said: Where are you when you are talking  about violence, this or that?  [[Page H4503]]    We are there. We support peaceful demonstrations. We participate in  them. They are part of the essence of our democracy. That does not  include looting, starting fires, or rioting. They should be prosecuted.  That is lawlessness. I am very proud that Joe Biden has presented the  clarity of that, making a distinction that I don't think our colleagues  quite understand but the American people do.   In a poll released today, it said that the American people support  congressional Democrats over President Trump in terms of dealing with  the issue of crime in our country, for all of their misrepresentation.   It is interesting to hear the revisionist history that the  distinguished leader put on the floor of this House when he asked us  what have we done. It is a very long list, and I will go into some of  it.   But I want to say to him, when you had the majority and the  Presidency, the one thing that you did was pass a tax bill that put $2  trillion of debt onto our children and giving 83 percent of the  benefits to the top 1 percent in our country. And yet you resent the  fact that we want to invest more money in making it safe for our  children to go back to school; more money into crushing the virus,  which is what we do in the HEROES Act; and that we want to help our  heroes. That is why it is called that.   Our State and local employees, our State and local governments that  provide services to the American people, our healthcare workers, our  first responders, our police and fire, our transportation, our  sanitation workers, our food providers, all of those people working  make life go on for us; without them, we couldn't. And our teachers,  our teachers, our teachers, the custodians of our children for a good  part of their day and of their lives.                                time  1030    Yet the disdain that the Republicans have for our heroes is clear  because that is the obstacle to our bringing the coronavirus  legislation to the floor that is so needed. I hope that we can reach  agreement on that.   So when they talk about accomplishment, you had a President and you  had two Houses of government. What did you do but take care of the top  1 percent to the tune of 83 percent of the bill that would put $2  trillion of debt to our children and their future?   In terms of China, I have taken second place to no one in this body  in my opposition to China for three decades. Sometimes I take pride in  being called the most disliked American in China for my opposition to  China; their trade policies which have been a rip-off of the American  worker, and have fought them for decades, whether it is stealing our  intellectual property, barriers to our products going into China and  other violations; trying to stop their proliferation of weapons  technologies of mass destruction to rogue countries, and delivery  systems to make delivery possible of those weapons; to their human  rights policies in Tibet and Hong Kong and now with the Uighurs and,  again, all over China. So I have been on it every single day for over  30 years.   I need no pontificating from the leader on the other side who seems  to have newly arrived at this issue in order to deflect attention from  the fact that the Russians are trying to, once again, infiltrate and  jeopardize the security of our elections. Whoever interferes with our  elections must be dealt with, whatever country it is; but all of a  sudden it is all about China and not about Russia. I think the American  people should decide who the next President of the United States is,  not Vladimir Putin.   So we come here today, and I say this about the legislation: We have  had four bills that have been overwhelmingly bipartisan on COVID. Our  first one on March 4 was testing, testing, testing; and still we do not  have a commitment from this administration that we can crush the virus  by testing, tracing, treatment, mask wearing, sanitation, ventilation,  and separation--still. The solution is as plain as the nose on your  face, which should be covered with a mask.   Yet the President said he didn't want to cause panic, but he doesn't  mind causing panic that will result in some terrible things happening  to the Asian-American community in our country.   He has brought about great angst as he shines a bright light on the  injustices experienced by so many, including the surge of violence and  discrimination being experienced by the Asian American/Pacific Islander  community.   So I thank the Asian Pacific American Caucus Chair, Judy Chu; the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair, Joaquin Castro; and the  Congressional Black Caucus Chair, Karen Bass, for their leadership on  this important resolution and this very necessary use of our time to  condemn and combat anti-Asian sentiment. Grace Meng has led this  drumbeat for justice for a generation. Together with the other leaders  she has brought this legislation to the floor, and I salute her.   As the resolution states--and we have all seen--at the same time that  the coronavirus pandemic has broken out, so too has a disturbing  epidemic of hate and discrimination against the AAPI community erupted.  You may not have noticed it. You may have tried to ignore it, but it,  in fact, exists.   According to the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, more than 2,500  recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate have been perpetrated against the  AAPI community since March. These include both physical and verbal  attacks, commuters spat on, racial slurs lobbed at passersby, community  members shunned, store owners having businesses vandalized, and even  little children being pushed and shoved, and families insulted in  places of business. Many of these incidents represent civil rights  violations, and that is a value for us to protect.   It is particularly unconscionable that more than 2 million members of  the AAPI community are fighting on the front lines against the COVID-19  virus, yet instead of being celebrated as heroes, they are fighting  violence and bigotry.   In February, during one of my visits to San Francisco's Chinatown-- which I am overwhelmingly proud to represent--I was heartbroken to  witness the devastating impact that fear, stigma, and misinformation  are continuing to have on its families and businesses.   Nearly half of recorded incidents of anti-Asian hate, according to  the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, have occurred in California.   For many of the bay area who remember the systemic injustices and  discrimination perpetrated against generations of Asian Americans, this  resurgence is a traumatic reminder of the lingering specter of  xenophobia.   Sadly, this bigotry is being fueled by some in Washington, D.C.--I  thought there would be almost unanimous consent to condemn violence  against Asian Americans--even from the White House itself, which uses  dangerous, false, and offensive terms to describe the coronavirus.   The World Health Organization and the CDC, the Centers for Disease  Control, have explicitly warned against linking infectious diseases to  a specific ethnicity because of the stigmatizing effects which have  serious impact on health and defeating the virus. As the CDC chief  medical officer said, stigma is the enemy of public health.   Anti-AAPI bigotry violates our bedrock American values and undermines  our fight against the coronavirus, and it must end.   That is why we must do our part to combat hate, and that is why I am  proud to support this resolution and am proud to bring it to the floor  as an appropriate and excellent statement of values and good use of our  time, instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our  country at the expense of our children and their future.   It calls on public officials to condemn and denounce any and all  anti-Asian sentiment in any form, and it recognizes that the health and  safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of the  utmost priority. We are none of us safe until all of us are safe.    It condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia,  discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or  religious intolerance.   It calls on Federal law enforcement officials working with State and  local officials to investigate and collect data on hate crimes and  bring perpetrators to justice.   It recommits our leaders to diversity and inclusion, including in our  response to COVID-19.  [[Page H4504]]    This resolution has the support of hundreds of organizations,  including from the medical and scientific communities.   Now I know science doesn't mean much to you because you are anti- science, but the scientific community, the American College of  Physicians, recently wrote a letter of support for this resolution,  stating:         It is an essential step to support the health and safety of       our Nation during a national crisis.        Hate crimes directed against individuals based on       individuals' race, ethnic origin, ancestry, primary language,       cultural background or nationality are a true public health       threat.    He goes on to say:         It is imperative that physicians, and all people, speak out       against hate and discrimination, especially during this       national crisis caused by COVID-19.    At this challenging time, our Nation's focus should be on respecting  the dignity of everyone. That should always be the case. We cannot  allow prejudice and discrimination to divide us.   So let me just close by adding this: we had a tremendous opportunity,  as I said, we passed four bills that were overwhelmingly bipartisan.  The CARES Act has done some good things for our country. It also gave  an enormous, practically $150 billion, tax break to the wealthiest in  our country and made it retroactive.   What did that have to do with the coronavirus, making a tax break for  the wealthy retroactive?   They can't pass a bill without doing something at the high end and  then worrying when we want to help working class families in our  country.   Anyway, our counter to that bill was called the Take Responsibility  Act. Those two bills came together. We were able to find our common  ground, even though we had to swallow some bitter pills in order to  help America's working families as well as small businesses in our  country.   Why does it have to be so hard?   Because there is an anti-science attitude in this Congress and in  this administration. There is an anti-governance; there is contempt of  science; and there is disdain for State and local government which does  so much for our country.   Don't take it from me. The chairman of the Fed is saying that it  recognizes that State and local government are an important part of our  economy.   Don't take it from me that we cannot open our economy unless we crush  this virus. That is exactly what the Fed chairman said yesterday: it is  essential to do this.   But it takes money, it takes respect for science, and respect for the  advice of scientific leaders in our country that has been absent.  Instead, they play a blame game.   Who pays the price?   The Asian-American community in our country.   That is why it is essential for us to follow Grace Meng's lead and  that of the Hispanic, Asian-Pacific, and Black Caucus leadership today.   I thank, again, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his  leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor. It is  one of many.   We have many bills that we have taken up and we will take up next  week as we try to work together to find our common ground. One thing  that we are working on right now is to keep government open, because  while they may have an anti-governance attitude, we know that we have  to make our compromises to keep government open.   So, Madam Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to use my  Speaker's 1 minute to salute the leadership and thank the sponsors of  this legislation. You bring luster to the House of Representatives when  you enable us to associate ourselves with the great values of our  country and to respect the dignity and worth of everyone in our  country. It has never been more important than in this time of great  crisis in our country.
