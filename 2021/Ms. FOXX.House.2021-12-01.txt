 Mr. Speaker, middle- and lower-income households across the  country are getting the short end of the stick under the so-called  Build Back Better Act.   For months, House Republicans have exposed radical provisions in this  bill that do nothing to help the American people or the country. One  such provision is the raising of State and local tax deductions,  commonly referred to as SALT.   Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $10,000 cap was placed on SALT  deductions. This meant that taxpayers who itemized their returns could  deduct up to $10,000 in certain taxes that are paid to State and local  governments.   Under the so-called Build Back Better Act, the cap would be set at  $80,000. That is a $70,000 increase in tax deductions for high-income  households in America. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  estimates that raising the SALT cap to $80,000 equates to a gift of  $625 billion in perpetuity to wealthy Americans.   Speaker Pelosi was quoted as saying that raising SALT deductions is  ``about which States get the revenue they need in order to meet the  needs of the people.''   Mr. Speaker, that claim may sound appeasing to some, but not all  Members of the Democrat Party are sold. Jason Furman, the former chair  of former President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and current  Harvard economist, calls this giveaway obscene.   Representative Jared Golden, a Democrat from Maine, who voted against  the so-called Build Back Better Act, said he was concerned about tax  giveaways to millionaires. Even Senator Bernie Sanders came out in  staunch opposition to these proposed changes for the SALT cap. Noticing  a pattern here?   Consider who will be the people reaping these benefits. Here is a  hint: it is not hardworking American families. With the tax deduction  cap set at $80,000, the households with the highest income would be  saving $25,900 more than they do under the current law.   The Tax Policy Center found that this $80,000 cap would directly  benefit the top 1 percent of households. Middle- and lower-income  households will be left behind. With only 5.4 percent of the households  earning more than $200,000 per year in North Carolina, few people would  receive this handout.   Higher-income States such as California, New York, and New Jersey  have historically benefitted from SALT cap deductions--with North  Carolina being far removed from the conversation.    Mr. Speaker, economic experts, Republicans, and even Democrat Members  of Congress agree that Washington has too much SALT in its diet. If the  majority believes upping SALT deductions and leaving both middle- and  lower-income Americans behind is a viable route to take, the  consequences would be a lot more than they bargained for.   The Senate should kill the so-called Build Back Better Act  immediately.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to the  Department of Labor's attack on religious freedom. The Department of  Labor's proposal to rescind protections for religious Federal  contractors demonstrates how hostile the Biden administration is to the  free exercise of religion when it bucks up against progressive  priorities.   Prior to President Trump's rule clarifying the rights and obligations  of religious Federal contractors, religious organizations were  reluctant to seek Federal contracts. If the rule is rescinded,  religious organizations will, once again, be dissuaded from competing  for these contracts. This will lead to less competition for Federal  contracts, meaning the American people will pay a higher price for  Federal projects.   Religious organizations should be able to compete for contracts on a  level playing field without having to compromise their faith. The Biden  administration apparently disagrees. It is of the utmost importance to  protect our very first right--the religious freedom of all Americans-- including Federal contractors.                            ____________________
