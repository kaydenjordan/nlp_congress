 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  bipartisan Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act, which  I was proud to cosponsor.   Since 2017, many families in the north county of San Diego and south  Orange County communities I represent have taken an unexpected, unfair  tax hit. The financial plans they had made, like whether to buy a new  home, were upturned when Washington Republicans passed a tax bill that  capped the State and local tax deduction.   In my district, more than 58,000 people who make less than $100,000  per year claimed SALT deductions in 2017, saving $6,328, on average.   Many of the families in California's 49th District have made serious,  long-term financial decisions in recent years based on the expectation  that they could take advantage of this significant deduction. Now,  because of the Republican tax bill and the SALT cap that placed new  limits on those deductions, their financial plans are being turned  upside down. That is why I am glad that we are voting on legislation to  restore the SALT deduction.   The House is doing its part. Now Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell needs to do what is right and bring this bipartisan bill up  for hearings and a vote.
