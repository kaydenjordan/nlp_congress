 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great man and a friend  who recently passed away, Mr. Edwin Russell Megonegal, or, as his  friends called him, Russ.   Russ passed away peacefully last week on June 21, 2019, at the age of  97. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 21, 1921.   Mr. Megonegal was part of America's Greatest Generation, serving his  country during World War II and the Korean war in the Army Air Corps,  the Air Force, and retiring in 1973 from the Pennsylvania National  Guard, with the rank of colonel.   He was a graduate of Franklin & Marshall College and Temple  University.   Mr. Megonegal had a long career in education in Pennsylvania as  teacher, assistant principal, principal, and retiring as assistant  superintendent of the William Penn School District.   He and his beloved wife, Tigger, retired to Lake Mary, Florida, in  1981, where he served as the commissioner of the City of Lake Mary. He  and Tigger made Clay County their home in 1991 and immediately became  ensconced in their community.   I first met Russ in 2012, while running for office. He was at every  meeting, every gathering, and knew everyone. He always had a smile on  his face and many pearls of wisdom that he would impart upon me,  whether it was solicited or not. No matter what, he also told you what  he believed and what he felt and what he thought was right; and that is  perhaps what I will miss most about Russ.   Russ's service to Clay County was boundless. He served on the City  County Planning and Zoning Committee and the board of Penney Farms  Retirement Community. He was actively involved in many of the  charities, including the Rotary Club of Green Cove Springs, J.P. Hall  Charities, the Clay County Salvation Army Advisory Council, the Food  Pantry of Green Cove Springs, the Republican Club of Clay County, the  Republican Executive Committee of Clay County, the DePaul Society of  St. Vincent's Medical Center, the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary,  and the Clay County Fair Association.   He was an active member of the First Presbyterian Church of Green  Cove Springs.   He had received many awards for his public service, including the  Clay County Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016 and the Boy Scouts of  America 12 Points Award in 2019. Of all of these awards, Russ may  perhaps be remembered best as the unofficial mayor of Penney Farms,  where he made his home.   Russ's life was full, and he touched all those who knew him. I am  proud to have known him and to have called him a friend.   Russ, you will be missed.                         Congratulations to Jim Lloyd     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and celebrate one  of my constituents, Jim Lloyd.   Dr. Lloyd received his degree in veterinary medicine from Michigan  State University in 1981, but he didn't stop there. He furthered his  education with a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1983 and began  his long career as both a published researcher and educator.   Before leaving Michigan, Jim served as the dean of the Michigan State  University Veterinary College. After years of teaching, presenting, and  serving the agricultural community of Michigan, Jim was selected as the  dean of the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in  2013, my first year in Congress. In that role, I had the great  privilege of working with him directly on a number of initiatives.   His passion for science, his commitment to agriculture, his passion  for the veterinary profession in general, and his friendship inspire  not just me, but everyone who comes in contact with him.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Jim well in his retirement, and I look forward to  working with him in the future.  [[Page H5310]]                                 In Honor of Ken Brock     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ken Brock.   Mr. Brock calls Keystone Heights home and is an Army veteran.   In addition to serving his country with distinction and honor, he has  done something else that is incredible. Mr. Brock has walked more than  2,650 miles across the United States to promote PTSD programs for the  Wounded Warrior Project, with the aim of making it to Idaho by  Independence Day.   His walk began on February 1 of this year and wasn't without  challenges. He faced two weekends of deadly tornadoes, deadly floods,  thunderstorms, a collision with a tractor trailer, and plenty of snow.   In the midst of the Ken's trek, he was called back to Florida for a  mandatory VA benefit evaluation. Not to be deterred, Ken made his  appointment and got right back on the road.   Nonetheless, he arrived at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 6 days ahead of the  town's Fourth of July parade, with residents standing five deep along  Sherman Avenue. Brock was featured in the parade doing what he does  best: walking with his 100-pound supply cart and his service dog, Pam.   This Sunday he will receive a hero's welcome from the Keystone  Heights community. I am proud to honor and celebrate Ken Brock's  journey to honor our veterans.                            ____________________
