 Mr. Speaker, 30 days ago, I invited Mr. Biden to Yuma  County in my district to view firsthand the crisis his open border  policies have created.   My invitation was as urgent as it was sincere.   The crisis all along the southern border has only gotten  substantially worse. Illegal alien crossings are at a  [[Page H1797]]  15-year high; border facilities are 1,700 percent over capacity; 5,000  illegal aliens crossing the border have prior criminal records.   Mr. Biden recently named Kamala Harris as a crisis manager for the  border crisis he created.   Under her watch, the problem has gotten dramatically worse. Over  172,000 illegal-alien apprehensions have occurred, including 20,000  unaccompanied minors taken into custody in March--the highest monthly  total in the history of the United States, and it is much greater.   The situation is charitably called a disaster. This needs to stop. We  need order restored to the border and we need faithful execution of  existing Federal laws.   To date, Mr. Biden has not responded to my invitation. Therefore, I  stand on the House floor today to re-invite Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris to  visit Yuma to see what my constituents are experiencing from this  historical surge of illegal-alien border crossings.                            ____________________
