 Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senator Blumenthal. This  legislation would end special tax exemptions for huge CEO bonuses by  closing a glaring loophole that allows publicly traded corporations to  deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar bonuses from their corporate tax  bills. If executives perform, companies may compensate them however  they wish, but U.S. taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize these massive  bonuses.   Under current tax law, when a publicly traded corporation calculates  its taxable income, it is generally permitted to deduct the cost of  compensation from its revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some  of the firm's most senior executives. However, a loophole relating to  performance-based compensation has allowed many public corporations to  avoid such limits and freely deduct excessive executive compensation.  To illustrate how this loophole works, if a CEO receives $1 million in  cash compensation and $14 million in performance-based compensation in  a given year, the public corporation's taxable income would decline by  $15 million. With the current corporate tax rate at 35 percent, the  corporation in this case would receive a tax giveway of $5.25 million.   The Stop Subsidizing Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act puts  an  [[Page S207]]  end to that giveaway and limits public corporations to a single $1  million per employee deduction as was originally intended. Using the  same example above, a profitable public corporation could deduct $1  million of the CEO's $15 million compensation package but could not  claim a deduction on the remaining $14 million. So instead of claiming  $5.25 million in Federal subsidies for the CEO's pay, this public  corporation will be contributing $4.9 million toward improving our  roads, our schools, and our military--costs that middle-class families  are already underwriting.   Indeed, over a 10-year window, the Joint Committee on Taxation, in  their most recent assessment, estimated that closing this loophole  would save U.S. taxpayers over $50 billion.   Specifically, our legislation first applies section 162(m) of the Tax  Code to all employees of publicly traded corporations so that all  compensation is subject to a deductibility cap of $1 million. Publicly  traded corporations would still be permitted to pay their executives as  much as they desire, but compensation above and beyond $1 million would  no longer be subsidized by other hard-working taxpayers through our Tax  Code.   Second, our bill removes the exemption for performance-based  compensation, which currently permits compensation deductions above and  beyond $1 million when executives have met performance benchmarks set  by the corporation's board of directors. As a result, publicly traded  corporations would still be able to incentivize their executives, but  all such incentives would be subject to a corporate deductibility cap  of $1 million.   Finally, our legislation makes a technical correction to ensure that  all publicly traded corporations that are required to provide quarterly  and annual reports to their investors under Securities and Exchange  Commission rules and regulations are subject to section 162(m).  Currently, this section of the Tax Code only covers some publicly  traded corporations who are required to provide these periodic reports  to their shareholders. Discouraging extravagant compensation packages  shouldn't turn on whether a publicly traded corporation falls into one  SEC reporting requirement or another, and our bill closes this  technical loophole.   Even our President-elect has acknowledged the problem of excessive  CEO pay. When asked about this issue on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' on  September 13, 2015, then-Presidential Candidate Trump said, ``Well, it  does bug me. It's very hard if you have a free enterprise system to do  anything about that. The boards of companies are supposed to do it. But  I know companies very well. And the CEO puts in all his friends. And so  you will take a company like, I could say Macy's or many other  companies, where they put in their friends as head of the company, and  they get whatever they want, because the friends love sitting on the  board. So that's a system that we have. And it's a shame and it's  disgraceful. And, sometimes, the boards rule. But I would say it's  probably less than 10 percent. And you see these guys making these  enormous amounts of money. It's a total and complete joke.''   Our legislation tackles this issue head on by ending the public  subsidy of excessive CEO compensation, derailing the lavish tax breaks  that exclusively benefit public corporations. This is simply a matter  of fairness, ensuring that corporations--and not hard-working taxpayers  who face their own challenges in this economy--are paying for the  multimillion-dollar bonuses they have decided to dole out to their  CEOs.   We need to prioritize tax breaks that grow our economy and strengthen  the middle class. This bill would eliminate some of the inequity in the  Tax Code. Again, companies are free to pay their executives as much as  they want, but the American taxpayer shouldn't help foot the bill for a  CEO's multimillion-dollar bonus.   I thank Public Citizen, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO,  International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and MIT professor Simon Johnson  for their support. I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for working  with me on this issue, and I urge our colleagues to join us in  cosponsoring this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):   S. 90.
