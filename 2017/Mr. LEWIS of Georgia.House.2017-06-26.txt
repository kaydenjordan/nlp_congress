 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from Georgia, the Honorable Karen C. Handel, be permitted  to the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome the newest  member of the Georgia congressional delegation, Representative Karen  Handel, serving the Sixth Congressional District in our beautiful  State.   I want to congratulate Karen on becoming the first Republican woman  ever elected to the House of Representatives from the State of Georgia.  She was actually born in the District of Columbia, and was raised in  Upper Marlboro, Maryland. So she is returning home.   She was president and CEO of the Greater Fulton County Georgia  Chamber of Commerce, Deputy Chief of Staff to then-Governor and now  Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, chairman of the Fulton County  Board of Commissioners, and Secretary of State of Georgia.  [[Page H5166]]    The Georgia delegation is Democrats and Republicans, but we are a  family. We are trying to do our very best to serve the people in our  district, in our State, and to work on behalf of the people of this  great Nation.   I welcome Karen and her husband, Steve.   If you should need my help, please feel free to call on me.   I wish her well, and I look forward to serving with her.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves), my  friend and brother.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. Handel).
