 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) be removed as a cosponsor  from  H. Res. 246.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
