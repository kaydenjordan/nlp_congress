 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to join the Presiding Officer and  others who have been on the floor hoping that we will move this week to  support the confirmation of Mike Pompeo, who has been nominated to be  the Secretary of State.   It is a critically important time for the country. I think we heard  this morning in a joint meeting from the President of France the  importance of our country and those who agree with our defense of  freedom and security to stand up for that. There are threats all over  the globe, and certainly everybody realizes that Mike Pompeo, the  current Director of the CIA, would have the knowledge he needs to do  the job. He clearly has the experience he needs to do the job, and he  has the support of the President, whom he would be representing.   Historically, this body, until recent years, always dealt with  foreign policy as if we were sure that bipartisanship starts at the  water's edge and partisanship ends at the water's edge. That long  tradition was always evident, particularly in the Secretary of State's  job and confirming people to important positions that relate to our  national security.   John Kerry was confirmed as Secretary of State by a vote of 94 to 3.  Hillary Clinton was confirmed by a vote of 94 to 2, Condoleeza Rice  received 85 votes when she was confirmed, and Colin Powell was  confirmed unanimously. That is the tradition the country has always set  for this job.   My colleague from New York Senator Schumer said in 2013--and this is  an exact quote: ``Who in America doesn't think a President, Democrat or  Republican, deserves his or her picks for who should run these  agencies? Nobody.'' That is end of that quote. That is the answer to  his own question. Apparently, that is no longer the answer to that  question on the part of Senator Schumer and others.   Senator Kerry, and later Secretary of State Kerry, said in 2009:         It is essential that we provide the President with the       tools and resources he needs to effect change. That starts by       making sure he has the national security team he has chosen       in place as soon as possible.    Secretary Kerry and Secretary Clinton were not confirmed because  Republicans agreed with every single one of their policy positions.  They weren't confirmed because their colleagues in the Senate agreed  with every one of their votes. They were confirmed because they were  qualified to do the job, and the President, who had nominated them,  deserved to have his team in place to carry out the policies he had  been elected to carry out.   Now the same standard should be extended to Director Pompeo, who is  eminently qualified for the job. Director Pompeo graduated first in his  class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986, and he served  as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain before the fall of the  Berlin Wall.   After leaving Active Duty, Director Pompeo graduated from Harvard Law  School where he edited the Harvard Law Review. This is a man of great  accomplishment before he entered politics.   In addition to those things, he also ran two successful businesses  before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010. He  served in the House from 2010 to 2017. He was a member of the  Intelligence Committee. In that role, he was at the forefront of  information that is important to national security, ranging from the  Iran nuclear accord to the PATRIOT Act. He understands these issues. He  is a person of significant capacity. Again, maybe most important of all  the qualifications, he was picked by the President of the United States  who, after this time of working together with Director Pompeo as the  Director of the CIA, the President should know exactly what he is  getting, and, frankly, we should too.   President Trump decided to not only nominate Director Pompeo to be  the Director of National Security, but when he was sworn in--when he  was confirmed, before he was sworn in, 66  [[Page S2408]]  to 32 was the vote. Fourteen Senate Democrats, most of them still  here--if not, they may all still be here--voted for Mike Pompeo to be  the Director of the CIA. I would say he is more qualified today to be  Secretary of State than he was then to be the Director of the CIA  because not only has he done everything he has done up until then, but  he has understood, from the unique perspective of the CIA, the foreign  policy and the intelligence challenges we face every day.   He has taken the responsibilities seriously. He has briefed the  President over and over again. The President knows exactly what he is  getting and Director Pompeo should know exactly whom he is working for.
