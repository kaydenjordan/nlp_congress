 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would prohibit any funds  from being used by the Department of Homeland Security to assist the  Department of Defense to house illegal immigrants at military  installations within the United States, specifically, referring to  Coast Guard bases.   I had an amendment earlier today that passed by voice vote with no  opposition. The reason why this is needed, unfortunately, is because  the Governor of New York State, which I represent, sent a letter on May  12 to President Biden requesting that national parks as well as  military installations and naval resources in and across the northeast  be utilized as available space to maintain critical and essential  public services to shelter and house migrants.   I know that it is hard to believe that in a post-9/11 world, the  Governor of New York, of all places, would actually want to house  citizens of other countries on our military installations, but sadly,  that is the reality of what my Governor is requesting of the  administration.   It is not the first time that this has been considered. Under the  Obama administration, they had identified a number of bases that were  accommodating individuals who were citizens of other countries,  including the Army base in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, an Air Force base in  San Antonio, Texas, and a naval base in southern California.   I think it is particularly important to note that we found roughly  250 individuals on the terror watch list at the southern border, but  that does not include those individuals who are among the 1.7 million  who have entered our country without any interaction with our  government or our law enforcement.   There is a concern there that we didn't know who they are, where they  are, and what their intentions are. They could very well turn up in New  York City and try to demand housing because our mayor continues to  incentivize illegal immigration and people to come to New York City to  do so.                                time  0045    Mr. Chair, I think, again, in a post- 9/11 world, it would be  ridiculous to allow citizens of other countries to become residents of  our military installations. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
