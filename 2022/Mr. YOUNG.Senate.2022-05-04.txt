 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire.   This bill is about maintaining our competitiveness with China.   We cannot compete with China without robust domestic R&D. A company  investing $100 in R&D in China this year will get a $200 deduction. In  America, that company investing $100 would only get to deduct $10 this  year.   We must not lose out on innovation and production to China. I ask my  colleagues to support this motion and support domestic R&D. Every day  we wait is another day we fall behind.
