 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is important, I think, to note, so you get a sense of what the  gray wolves have done, that 1987 was when a plan was finalized to  restore them to the Northern Rockies by transplanting the wolves from  Canada into central Idaho, Yellowstone National Park.   In 1995 and 1996, 66 Canadian wolves were transplanted, with a goal  of establishing 10 breeding pairs in each of three recovery zones in  Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming for three consecutive years.   Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker?   Those 66 Canadian wolves have done pretty well. In fact--and I think  this is largely why the scientists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, with whom I have had many disagreements--but in this, these  folks have come out and said: You know what? The U.S. population of  5,500 wolves have done real well since being transplanted from Canada.  They are not the original U.S. wolves, but from Canada. They are  bigger, more aggressive. But there are 3,800 just in the upper Great  Lakes, 8,000 to 11,000 in Alaska, and now 60,000 in Canada. As their  numbers increase, so do the massive problems.    I appreciated the anecdotal information about seeing more elk and  moose. I would suggest, based on the rapidly escalating number of  attacks, that you are going to see more and more elk and moose want to  come hang around the cars so they don't get eaten by wolves. So you  will have more and more tourists seeing elk and moose, but their  populations are diminishing.  [[Page H9548]]    In fact, it is rather dramatic. Wolves eat 20 pounds of meat a day  and elk comprise 92 percent of the wolf kills during the winter. Other  prey include moose, caribou, deer, beaver, hares, and livestock.   In 1995, there were 19,000 elk in the northern Yellowstone herd. By  2008, there were 5,000. That is down from 19,000. The moose herd in the  area also dropped from more than 1,000 to somewhere around 100 to 300.  I am sure they will get to hanging out with tourists more and more just  to keep from getting eaten.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I know there is a contention that gray wolves, though  they have dramatically exploded from those 66 original wolves being  introduced to thousands and thousands now, are not  [[Page H9549]]  a threat to people; but I would suggest to you that, not only have the  liberals in the U.S. Government seen a need year after year to delist  the gray wolves, but a college student named Kenton Carnegie's family  members would suggest that, when Kenton was killed by gray wolves, the  gray wolves were a threat to mankind; and Candice Berner, a teacher in  Alaska who was killed while jogging, her surviving family members would  suggest gray wolves are a threat to people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that time be managed by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, we are living in interesting times. As  Dickens said, it is the best of times and the worst of times.   There has never been a country in the history of the world with the  amount of opportunity and freedom for individuals that has been found  in the United States. Even in Solomon's Israel--great wealth there-- there was not the opportunity and the individual assets that we have  here in the United States of America.   It is incredible that even for the Nation's poor, obesity is a major  health issue. That is just unheard of in world history.   It is deeply grieving to hear that so many of our Nation's college  students and college graduates have been indoctrinated with the notion  that socialism is so much better. Communism, really, is what we are  talking about. They call it progressivism and socialism, what they are  proposing, that that would be a superior form of government to what we  have. What those students have not been taught--and it is an enormous  gap  [[Page H9555]]  in education; it is an enormous area of ignorance for those students-- is that you can't have socialism or communism without giving up a  tremendous amount freedom.   That was one of the things that scared some people in the Soviet  Union, when the Soviet Union came to exist no more. They had given up  so much liberty, the idea that they were now free to find whatever job  they wanted, and they didn't have to just take what the government told  them to take. They could find whatever job they wanted. They could be  entrepreneurs.   I talked to some. They were scared because with liberty and with  freedom comes uncertainty.   But the Founders felt that government had always been a threat to  people's freedom, to their liberty. They felt liberty, freedom, was far  superior to security. It is often attributed to Franklin that those who  would give up liberty for security or safety deserve neither.   When you really break down a socialist, communist system, you don't  have a middle class. You have a ruling class, and you have a ruled  class. That is what we are headed for.   I believe we saw the beginnings of that in this last election when  billionaires poured hundreds of millions of dollars into this election  like never before, because unlike many of our college students now,  they know what happens in a socialist, communist system. You have the  ruling class, and you have the ruled class.   Yes, it is true. It is so wonderful that the ruled class basically  has the same amount of money. They get paid similar amounts. But I kind  of like the idea of physicians being paid more than most people,  because that means you draw the best and brightest into that  profession. I found that not to be the case as an exchange student in  the Soviet Union back when it was the Soviet Union. I got a glimpse of  their socialized medicine, and thanked God, literally, that I lived in  the United States and didn't have to be part of a socialized medicine  system where the doctors were paid the same amount whether they saw one  or two people or they saw the 40, 50 people who were waiting to see  them. They didn't care. They were going to make the same amount every  day.   Exactly that was what the farmers said at a collective farm when I  asked in the middle of the morning when they worked out in the field,  because it was midmorning. I have worked on farms and ranches. In the  middle of July, like this was, you would normally start at sunup, so  you could finish by midafternoon before the sun got too hot. Here these  farmers were sitting in the shade.    I couldn't tell what was cultivated. There were thousands and  thousands of acres out there. I couldn't tell what was cultivated and  what wasn't.   I tried to use my best Russian to ask: When do you work out in the  field?   I pointed. They laughed. I thought maybe I had said it wrong, but one  of the farmers said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there  in the sun as I do here in the shade, so I am here in the shade.   That basically explains why the Soviet Union could never come  anywhere close to being as productive with wheat and with crops as we  were in the United States.   People, going back to the Pilgrims after the first winter, loved the  idea of bringing all into the common storehouse. Everybody was sharing  and sharing alike until after that first winter when so many Pilgrims  died. They found that the idea of private property where people could  keep what they produced was just fantastic. They were so much more  productive. They worked harder, and it was better for the overall  community.   But we seem to be slipping into a time when the concept of freedom  will be forsaken for bigger and bigger government, and more and more  government intrusion. You have to have, though, a totalitarian  government for socialism or communism, either one, to succeed. That is  how you eliminate the middle class. You have the ruled class, and you  have the rich class and the powerful class.   Sometimes they may not have as much money as they do power, but I  think the reason we see billionaires pushing us in the direction of  socialism is because they see themselves in the ruling class and see  themselves as being so much wiser, and they see what they perceive  should be the ruled class as not being nearly as smart and as inventive  as they are.   So things will be just paradise. It will be utopian, once you have  the billionaires--and I think some people who want to push us in that  direction who are not billionaires still have to consider they know so  much better than individuals across the country, and we would profit so  much more from having this intelligentsia be the ruling class and all  the rest of us be minions and do what we are told. We never have to  decide what job we have.   We have been moving in that direction. That is why I think you saw  under the Obama administration the takeover of student loans. Then you  will see, I think, in the next couple years a move toward more and more  control over college students. You will see an effort to say: Look,  there is so much student debt, why don't we tell these students that if  you go to the location we tell you, if you go take the job we tell you,  then we will start forgiving your debt, as long as you do what we tell  you?   There again, we are on the road to giving up a middle class and to  giving up our liberty and freedom, letting there be a ruling class that  we will call the government.   When I was studying history at Texas A&M, I did a research paper on  the Soviet government. I was intrigued that Khrushchev, as Premier of  the Soviet Union, understood that true communism theoretically did not  have a government in existence. True communism means from those  according to their ability, to those according to their need. People  shared and shared alike. Regardless of how hard they worked, everybody  shared equally. But in true communism, there is no government.   The Premier, Khrushchev, set up a commission to come up--they loved  their 5-year plan for their economy--with a plan of how they could move  to ultimate communism when there was no government. There would just be  the people existing--loving, living together, and sharing together-- without a government.   It didn't take too long--I can't remember, a year or 2--until the  commission and Khrushchev realized that, in this world, you can never  have communism or socialism without a totalitarian government. He  disbanded the commission. They never achieved their plan of how they  could move into ultimate communism with no government, and so they  moved forward with a totalitarian government.   Of course, those who actually study real history know that no truly  socialist or communist government has ever succeeded. They always fail.  Margaret Thatcher said that they fail when they run out of other  people's money to spend.   But we seem to be moving there. It wasn't lost on some that, during  the Obama administration, we had millions more added to poverty and in  need of government assistance. We had so many moved out of the middle  class into poverty. At the same time, President Obama himself  admitted--it is on video, and it is the only time it has ever happened  in the history of the United States of America. Under President Obama's  administration, for the first time in American history, 95 percent of  the American income went to the top 1 percent income earners.                                time  1145    It had never happened before. I hope and pray it doesn't happen  again. It has been fantastic in the last 2 years, or since President  Trump has taken office, that we have seen the economy surge. We heard  from President Obama that it is unlikely we would ever hit 3 percent  growth again and that those days were behind us.   So the middle class shrunk. The ruling class got more and more power.  People were standing in line saying: Oh, please, master government,  give me more of this, give me more of that. And it has been so  refreshing to see millions no longer needing government assistance in  different areas and that they are getting better jobs.   But that shouldn't have been a revelation, because if you look at  single-mom income when adjusted for inflation from 1965, when welfare  began, to 1995, when a work requirement was  [[Page H9556]]  added by the brand-new Republican majority under Speaker Newt Gingrich,  that single-mom income adjusted for inflation for those 30 years  flatlined. Single moms had no increase in income adjusted for inflation  for 30 years.   When the Republican majority in 1995 added a work requirement that  you couldn't get welfare unless you worked, if you were able to work,  for the first time single-mom income, when adjusted for inflation,  started taking off.   I saw a graph by a dean at Harvard when I was there for a seminar. I  was amazed, for one thing, that they would show that, reveal that at  Harvard. But it was amazing.   So, on the one hand, you had people that say: We care more about  single moms, so we are going to give them more money for every child  they can have out of wedlock. What it did was pull them into a rut they  could not get out of.   When I was a felony judge in Texas, one of the things that really  began to deeply trouble me is seeing more women coming before me-- single moms--for welfare fraud as a felony. I never sent any of those  women to prison. I always gave them probation. But the stories were  normally very, very similar. There were a number of different races.  That wasn't the issue.   But the big point that seemed to be repeated over and over was often  they were bored in high school. Someone would say: If you have a baby,  you don't have to finish high school. The government will start sending  you a check. And then they would have a baby out of wedlock. The  government would send them a check, and then they find out you can't  live very well like that.   So the ones that came before me--I know it is not a blanket case--but  the ones that came before me, most of them would have another child,  thinking maybe if I can get another check, I can get out of this hole.  And they would get in a deeper and longer rut they could not extricate  themselves from.   I have had great conversations with Star Parker, who can testify  about the trouble with that. I have spoken to sociology classes at  Texas college, a traditionally Black college, as well as Wiley College  and Jarvis College in my district. They have done an amazing job of  educating, so often it is the first person in a family to have ever  gone to college. What is amazing is that once that first child gets to  college, then their children end up going to major universities. It is  just a wonderful, great step to help pull people out of poverty.   I heard from students--the most vocal were single moms in their late  twenties, some in their thirties--who realized that I am not going to  have a good life if I stay in poverty. They set about to improve  themselves through education. It was amazing to hear some of them, just  adamant, you have got to have a mandatory work requirement, and another  saying you have got to drug test people who are on welfare.   These are all African American single moms. One of them was saying:  Nobody ever drug-tested me, so I can take government money and spend it  on drugs. They were asserting that we should do things that this  Congress has never ventured out to do. But they were adamant, because  they have been lulled into, enticed into a hole, a rut that they were  almost not able to get out of.   A government should not be about luring people into holes or ruts  from which they cannot extricate themselves. We ought to be about  pushing, encouraging people to reach their greatest potential. That can  not, will not, does not, has not ever happened in a socialist or  communist system. If you get rid of the middle class, you have a ruling  class, and you have a ruled class.   If you wanted to call it sort of a middle class in the Soviet Union,  they didn't make more money than the rest in the ruled class, but if  people had a little bit of power or a lot, then people that were part  of the ruled class that had a shoe store or a grocery store or some  other kind of place where goods or services could be purchased--but  especially goods--the storekeeper would reserve things in the back to  give to people that might have a little power that could help them.   But I will never forget when, one morning, in a youth hostel in  Moscow, a Ukrainian friend was staying in our room with me and two  others--there were 8 Americans in the Soviet Union that summer--and a  cleaning lady came in and she saw the Ukrainian and screamed and ran  out of the room.   I said: Why did she scream? Why is she going?   He said: In your country, you are able to elevate yourself by working  harder, making more money. You can elevate yourself. In my country, the  only way you can elevate yourself is to step on other people. So she is  going to run down and tell people I shouldn't be here. She will step on  me. It will elevate her a little bit. That is what we do in our country  to get ahead. We step on each other, trying to get ahead.   I said: That makes no sense. What has she got to gain by running down  and saying that you are here?   He said: She will be elevated for ratting me out.   We are looking at major changes in this country. We are looking at a  couple of years where there will be some socialist notions that will be  brought here to the floor. But as we saw during the Obama  administration, the economy doesn't do well, people don't do well,  people don't see right.    We were moving dramatically in a socialist direction. ObamaCare was  the first step toward total socialized medicine. But as I have told  some of the Big Pharma lobbyists back when it passed and some of the  big insurance people and AARP, who sold their souls to endorse the  program, yes, you are going to make more money than you ever made in  the short term. But by endorsing this program, you may well have signed  your own death warrant. Down the road, maybe it is 15 years, but at  some point you will cease to exist or you will be making next to  nothing.   But unfortunately, some of the big rich folks and some of the top  corporate positions knew that if they made extra billions for their  industry in the short term, they would have a golden parachute and they  would be gone before their industry was destroyed by socialized  medicine. And they didn't seem to care. Of course, AARP sold out to  seniors, because ObamaCare had a $716 billion cut to Medicare and the  seniors are feeling it now.   But we had a new group of voters come out. They don't understand what  happens in either socialized medicine or in a socialized system and  they think it is going to be wonderful. Well, if you like less freedom,  less assets, less opportunity, then socialism, progressivism,  communism, whatever phase you want to call it, you will love a  socialistic system.   We have seen also the courts moving us in that direction. They have  taken over more and more. Though the Founders saw the judiciary as  being the least threat to liberty of the three branches, we have  allowed the judiciary to basically become oligarchs and run America.  Presidents are no longer allowed to make decisions as the Constitution  and the Congress both have directed, when it comes to immigration,  refugees. So, it is not just voters. We have seen the courts do their  share in moving us toward a socialized system.   But here again, like the billionaires, some of these judges--not all;  I have been there, I have been a judge, been a chief justice--but some  of these Federal judges see themselves one day alongside the  billionaires as being part of the ruling class as we get rid of the  middle class and have the ruling class and the ruled class.   My hope, my prayer, the reason I am still here in Congress--I ran  again--is to try to get us off this track. I deeply regret that we  wasted September, haven't done a whole lot this week, but I think the  best Christmas present that this Congress, this current Republican  majority could give America is--obviously, we are out now today until  Thanksgiving--but stay in session through Christmas Day if we have to,  through January 1, if we have to, and work out some of these issues,  including money to build a wall where it is needed.   That is not only good for America. It will help reduce the 70,000- plus Americans who are killed from drug poisons coming from Mexico drug  cartels, but it also would be the best thing we could ever do for our  neighbors in Mexico. They ought to be a top 10 economy in  [[Page H9557]]  the world. The only reason they are not is because of corruption from  the drug cartels.   Look historically at what they have got. They have got more natural  resources than most countries in the world. They have got a better  location than even the United States. They are between two continents,  between two oceans. They have got it all going on. And they have some  of the hardest working people in the whole world.   Why are they not a top 10 economy? Because of the drug cartel's  corruption, the control they have over government.                                time  1200    We cut anywhere from 80 billion--some estimates say they made that  much last year on drugs sent into the U.S. Some say they may be making  as much from human trafficking, getting people into the United States.   Heck, they have people pay them to get them into the United States so  they can be sent by DHS to a city where the drug cartels need them to  sell drugs or be engaged in sex trafficking, human trafficking, and  that is what has been going on all through the Obama years.   That is why Border Patrol said the drug cartels call us, the DHS,  their logistics. They get them into our country illegally, and then we  ship them wherever the drug cartels want them to go. They give them the  address; our people would send them there.   That is being changed under this President, but it may not change for  long with the new Congress. We will see.   We owe America better than we gave them the last almost 2 years, and  I hope and pray we are going to come back and not just snap the ball  and fall on it, but do some good that we should have done long before  now in the next couple of months.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  November 20, 2018, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
