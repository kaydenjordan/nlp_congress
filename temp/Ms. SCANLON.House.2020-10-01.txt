 Madam Speaker, our elections are foundational to our  democracy, the pulse of our Nation, and the most sacred form of protest  that we as Americans have at our disposal.   We, the people, have a right to vote without obstruction, without  fear, without intimidation, and with the assurance that every vote will  be counted.   Madam Speaker, I want to take a minute to assure the American people  who are receiving mail-in ballots for the first time, making a plan to  vote on election day, looking for locations where early voting is  taking place, signing up to volunteer, or feeling a sense of  uncertainty as we participate in one of the most important elections of  our lifetime: your vote is safe, your vote is secure, and your vote  matters.   And, Madam Speaker, to the young people who will be casting their  votes for the first time: you are the future of this country, and we  need you to participate in our government now more than ever.   To those who have lost faith in our government: we, the people, are  the gatekeepers of our democracy, and our participation has never been  more important.   There is far too much on the line for us to take voting for granted.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  [[Page H5124]]  call up House Resolution 1164 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1164         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 1153)       condemning unwanted, unnecessary medical procedures on       individuals without their full, informed consent. The       amendment to the resolution printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted. The resolution, as amended, shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the resolution and preamble, as amended, to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 1154) condemning QAnon       and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes. The       resolution shall be considered as read. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble       to adoption without intervening motion or demand for division       of the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1164, providing for consideration of  H. Res. 1153, condemning unwanted, unnecessary medical procedures on  individuals without their full, informed consent, under a closed rule.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment offered by Chairman  Nadler, which clarifies the last statement in the resolved clause. The  rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee.   The rule also provides for consideration of H. Res. 1154, condemning  QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes, under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Judiciary  Committee.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to offer the rule for two timely and  necessary resolutions, one that addresses allegations of gross human  rights violations conducted under the watch of the United States  Government and the other a long-overdue resolution that forcefully  condemns QAnon, an anti-Semitic, racist, and, frankly, unhinged  conspiracy theory that has infiltrated the internet and infected the  rightwing of our Nation's politics.   Let's start with H. Res. 1153, offered by my colleague, Congresswoman  Jayapal of the House Judiciary Committee, in response to some of most  repulsive and inhumane allegations ever directed at a U.S. Federal  agency.   In mid-September, just a couple of weeks ago, a whistleblower came  forward to disclose that women who have been detained for immigration  offenses at Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia, operated by a  private prison company, LaSalle Corrections, have been subjected to a  pattern of nonconsensual and inappropriate medical treatment, including  forced partial and full sterilization.   This complaint was submitted to the Office of Inspector General at  the Department of Homeland Security and outlined concerns raised by a  nurse at the facility and numerous immigrant detainees at the facility.   While the IG's investigation is just beginning, many of the central  allegations in the complaint have already been confirmed in reporting  by The New York Times and by a delegation of a dozen of my colleagues  who visited the detention center last weekend, interviewed women who  had suffered through these procedures, and consulted with medical  professionals who have reviewed the women's medical records relating to  those incidents.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record The New York Times article  from yesterday entitled ``Immigrants Say They Were Pressured Into  Unneeded Surgeries.''                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2020]         Immigrants Say They Were Pressured Into Unneeded Surgeries       (By Caitlin Dickerson, Seth Freed Wessler, and Miriam Jordan)    Immigrants detained at an ICE-contracted center in Georgia said they   had invasive gynecology procedures that they later learned might have                              been unnecessary         Wendy Dowe was startled awake early one morning in January       2019, when guards called her out of her cellblock in the       Irwin County immigration detention center in rural Georgia,       where she had been held for four months. She would be having       surgery that day, they said.        Still groggy, the 48-year-old immigrant from Jamaica, who       had been living without legal status in the United States for       two decades before she was picked up by immigration       authorities, felt a swell of dread come over her. An outside       gynecologist who saw patients in immigration custody told her       that the menstrual cramping she had was caused by large cysts       and masses that needed to be removed, but she was skeptical.       The doctor insisted, she said, and as a detainee--brought to       the hospital in handcuffs and shackles--she felt pressured to       consent.        It was only after she was deported to Jamaica and had her       medical files reviewed by several other doctors that she knew       she had been right to raise questions.        A radiologist's report, based on images of her internal       organs from her time at Irwin, described her uterus as being       a healthy size, not swollen with enlarged masses and cysts,       as the doctor had written in his notes. The cysts she had       were small, and the kind that occur naturally and do not       usually require surgical intervention.        ``I didn't have to do any of it,'' Ms. Dowe said.        The Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Ga., drew       national attention this month after a nurse, Dawn Wooten,       filed a whistle-blower complaint claiming that detainees had       told her they had had their uteruses removed without their       full understanding or consent.        Since then, both ICE and the hospital in Irwin County have       released data that show that two full hysterectomies have       been performed on women detained at Irwin in the past three       years. But firsthand accounts are now emerging from       detainees, including Ms. Dowe, who underwent other invasive       gynecological procedures that they did not fully understand       and, in some cases, may not have been medically necessary.        At least one lawyer brought the complaints about       gynecological care to the attention of the center's top       officials in 2018, according to emails obtained by The New       York Times, but the outside referrals continued.        The Times interviewed 16 women who were concerned about the       gynecological care they received while at the center, and       conducted a detailed review of the medical files of seven       women who were able to obtain their records. All 16 were       treated by Dr. Mahendra Amin, who practices gynecology in the       nearby town of Douglas and has been described by ICE       officials as the detention center's ``primary gynecologist.''        The cases were reviewed by five gynecologists--four of them       board-certified and all with medical school affiliations--who       found that Dr. Amin consistently overstated the size or risks       associated with cysts or masses attached to his patients'       reproductive organs. Small or benign cysts do not typically       call for surgical intervention, where large or otherwise       troubling ones sometimes do, the experts said.        The doctors stressed that in some cases the medical files       might not have been complete and that additional information       could potentially shift their analyses. But they noted that       Dr. Amin seemed to consistently recommend surgical       intervention, even when it did not seem medically necessary       at the time and nonsurgical treatment options were available.        In almost every woman's chart, Dr. Amin listed symptoms       such as heavy bleeding with clots and chronic pelvic pain,       which could justify surgery. But some of the women said they       never experienced or reported those symptoms to him.        Both the reviewing doctors and all of the women interviewed       by The Times raised concerns about whether Dr. Amin had       adequately explained the procedures he performed or provided       his patients with less invasive alternatives. Spanish-      speaking women said a nurse who spoke Spanish was only       sporadically present during their exams.        The diagnoses and procedures are ``poorly supported'' and       ``not well documented,'' said Dr. Sara Imershein, a clinical       professor at George Washington University and the Washington,       D.C., chair of the American College of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists.        Even if the patients had reported the symptoms recorded by       Dr. Amin, ``there  [[Page H5125]]       would have been many avenues to pursue before rushing to       surgery,'' she said. ``Advil for one.''        ``He is overly aggressive in his treatment and does not       explore appropriate medical management before turning to       procedures or surgical intervention,'' said Dr. Deborah       Ottenheimer, a forensic evaluator and instructor at the Weill       Cornell Medical School Human Rights Clinic.        But the doctors who reviewed the cases noted that       aggressive overtreatment is all too common among doctors--      especially with patients who do not have the resources to       seek a second opinion.         Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service       Corps, said in a statement that the whistle-blower's       allegations ``raise some very serious concerns that deserve       to be investigated quickly and thoroughly.'' She added, ``If       there is any truth to these allegations, it is my commitment       to make the corrections necessary to ensure we continue to       prioritize the health, welfare and safety of ICE detainees.''        Dr. Amin's lawyer, Scott Grubman, said in a statement that       the physician ``strongly disputes any allegations that he       treated any patient with anything other than the utmost care       and respect.''        ``Dr. Amin also strongly disputes that any patient was       treated without full informed consent,'' the statement       continued. Mr. Grubman said that patient privacy laws       prevented him from discussing any specific patient's       treatment, but in each case it ``was medically necessary,       performed within the standard of care, and done only after       obtaining full informed consent.''        The statement added that Dr. Amin always uses an       interpreter when treating patients who do not speak English       and ``always attempts to treat his patients with more       conservative treatment, including medicine and less invasive       procedures, before even recommending surgery,'' which he       views as a last resort.        Independent doctors that provide treatment for ICE       detainees are paid for the procedures they perform with       Department of Homeland Security funds. Procedures like the       ones that Dr. Amin performed are normally billed at thousands       of dollars each.        Dr. Amin's billings had previously come to the attention of       federal authorities. In 2013, the Justice Department named       him in a civil case alleging that he and several other       doctors had overbilled Medicare and Medicaid by, among other       things, performing unnecessary procedures on terminal       patients and leaving the emergency room staffed by nurses       while billing for diagnoses and treatments as if they had       been performed by doctors. The case was settled for $520,000       with no admission of fault on the part of the defendants.                        I could not ask any questions         In many cases, Dr. Amin's patients said they were confused       about why they ended up being sent to his office in the first       place--some after raising medical issues that had nothing to       do with gynecology.        Yuridia, a 36-year-old immigrant from Mexico, sought out a       nurse at the center soon after she arrived because she was       having pain in her rib after a fight with her abusive ex-      partner just before she was picked up by ICE. She asked to be       identified by her first name because she feared for her       safety.        She was sent for a medical exam at Dr. Amin's office, where       she said he began to prepare an ultrasound machine. ``I was       assuming they were going to check my rib,'' she said. ``The       next thing I know, he's doing a vaginal exam.''        Dr. Amin recorded in his notes that Yuridia had cysts in       her ovaries and scheduled a surgery to remove them. He also       wrote that she had complained of heavy menstruation and       pelvic pain. She said that she never experienced or reported       those conditions and that she had not asked to see a       gynecologist.        Weeks later, she underwent surgery. Pathology reports show       that she did not have dangerous cysts, but small ones of the       kind that occur naturally in most women and do not call for       surgical intervention.        Yuridia said she had expected only a minor procedure that       would be performed vaginally, but she was surprised when she       woke up to find three incisions on her abdomen and a piece of       skin missing from her genital area.        ``I woke up and I was alone, and I was in pain and everyone       spoke English so I could not ask any questions,'' Yuridia       said. Three days later, still sore and recovering, she was       deported.        Yuridia's case bears striking similarities to others that       the panel of doctors reviewed. Many of them led to two       surgical procedures performed simultaneously: ``dilation and       curettage,'' often referred to as a ``D & C,'' which involves       inserting tools into a woman's vagina and scraping tissue       from the uterus, and laparoscopy, in which three incisions       are made to insert a camera into the abdominal cavity to       examine or perform procedures on the reproductive organs.        The cases suggest a pattern of ``excessively aggressive       surgical intervention without adequate trial of medical       remedies,'' Dr. Ottenheimer said.                   A report reveals longstanding complaints         It was the Irwin County center's handling of the       coronavirus pandemic that inspired Ms. Wooten, the nurse       whose whistle-blower complaint was first reported by The       Intercept, to come forward about another issue that troubled       her: Dr. Amin's surgeries. She said in an interview that she       had for years noticed that an inordinate number of women were       being referred to Dr. Amin. She said she would hear reports       that they had undergone surgeries but that they had no idea       why the surgeries were performed.        ``After they get up from general anesthesia,'' Ms. Wooten       said, the women would ask, ``Why'd I have this surgery?''        ``And I don't have an answer for why,'' she said. ``I am       just as shocked as they are. Nobody explained it to them.''        Data from ICE inspection reports show that the center,       which is operated by a private prison company, Lasalle       Corrections, refers more than 1,000 detainees a year for       outside medical care, far more than most other immigration       detention centers of the same size. It is not clear how many       of these referrals are for gynecological care. Lasalle       Corrections did not respond to requests for comment.        Concerns from women detained at Irwin emerged long before       Ms. Wooten came forward.        Ms. Dowe, after being told by Dr. Amin that she had a mass       the size of a ``cantaloupe'' on her uterus, had reached out       in early 2019 to Donald Anthonyson, an immigrant advocate she       had met through a fellow detainee. She was asking for help,       Mr. Anthonyson said.        ``She expressed real concerns about going to that doctor,''       he said. ``She was concerned about what was happening to her       and what she was hearing from other women.''        Unlike some of the women who had no gynecological       complaints, Ms. Dowe was experiencing intense menstrual       cramping, which the doctors who reviewed her case said could       sometimes justify the procedure she underwent--but only if       the patient understands the options and elects to move       forward. Even then, the doctors raised questions about       several seemingly healthy and naturally occurring cysts that       Dr. Amin might have removed unnecessarily while he was       operating on her.        After the procedure, Dr. Amin wrote in his notes that Ms.       Dowe requested a second surgery--a full abdominal       hysterectomy and removal of her ovaries.        But Ms. Dowe insists she never made any such request. A       note in her medical records from the detention center appears       to corroborate her denial. ``Detainee is requesting a second       opinion to have a hysterectomy,'' it reads, ``OB/GYN       scheduled hysterectomy and patient refused.''        Complaints about Dr. Amin had also been raised with senior       officials long before Ms. Dowe's case.        In November 2018, a woman named Nancy Gonzalez Hidalgo was       left shaken after several visits with the physician, during       which she said he performed rough vaginal ultrasounds and       ignored her when she cried out in pain. Ms. Gonzalez       Hidalgo's lawyers sent an email to the warden of the center,       David Paulk.        In the email, Erin Argueta, a lawyer at the Southern       Poverty Law Center, explained that Ms. Gonzalez Hidalgo's       health was worsening because of complications she was       experiencing from an earlier miscarriage.        ``Nancy hesitated to seek medical attention because her       last experience with Dr. Amin was so painful and traumatic       that she did not want to be sent back to him,'' Ms. Argueta       wrote.        She referred in her email to several previous verbal       complaints about Dr. Amin that lawyers had taken to the       center's inmates services director, Marteka George. ``Ms.       George stated that this was not the first time someone       complained about Dr. Amin, and she said that she would look       into whether Nancy could see a different provider,'' the       lawyer wrote.        The warden responded twice, stating on Nov. 30 that Ms.       Gonzalez Hidalgo had been scheduled for an appointment with       an outside provider ``that is unassociated with Dr. Amin.''       The other doctor, Warden Paulk said, was ``reportedly well       thought of by his patients.''        Warden Paulk did not respond to requests for comment.        Other women who questioned Dr. Amin's care in the past said       they had also faced challenges when they tried to seek       answers.        On the morning of Aug. 14, Mileidy Cardentey Fernandez       said, there was no interpreter present at the Irwin County       Hospital when she was presented with consent forms in English       to sign for a procedure she was undergoing that day.        She asked the technician, ``Spanish, please? Little       English.'' The woman urged her to sign the forms--and so she       did.        Afterward, she said, she filled out a form on numerous       occasions at the detention center requesting her medical       records but got no response.        ``I wanted to know everything they had done,'' she said.       ``I made requests for the biopsy, analyses, and they don't       want to give them to me. They said they don't have the       results. How can they not have the results?''        When she was released from detention on Sept. 21, she       called her daughter in Virginia and then headed straight to       Dr. Amin's clinic with her lawyer to demand her records,       which she received.        Some women said they had managed to avoid surgeries by Dr.       Amin but not without facing resistance.        Enna Perez Santos said she objected when Dr. Amin suggested       that she undergo a procedure similar to the ones that other       women had complained about. Dr. Amin, she said,  [[Page H5126]]       counseled her that it was a mistake to forgo the treatment       and he wrote in his notes that she had asked to speak to a       mental health care provider.        Back at the detention center on the same day, Ms. Perez       Santos was given a psychiatric evaluation. ``I am nervous       about my upcoming procedure,'' Ms. Perez Santos told the       examiner, according to the practitioner's notes. ``I am       worried because I saw someone else after they had surgery,       and what I saw scared me.''        Ms. Perez Santos was brought three more times to Dr. Amin's       office over the next several months, she recalled. Each time,       she said, Dr. Amin raised the prospect of a surgery. She felt       ``pressured'' to agree, she said, but each time she told him       she did not consent.        Three board certified gynecologists who reviewed Ms. Perez       Santos's medical files say that her instincts appear to have       been correct. ``Based on what I see here, Amin was       inappropriately suggesting a D & C scope,'' Dr. Ottenheimer       said. ``There is nothing at all there to support the       procedure.''     Madam Speaker, the whistleblower complaint raises  multiple serious questions which should concern every Member of this  body and the administration.   First, these women were apparently subjected to unnecessary and  inappropriate medical care without their consent, which, in many cases,  has rendered them unable to have children, one of the most precious  decisions a family can make.   Second, think about the circumstances. Many of these women did not  speak English and had no access to interpreters to explain the  procedures to which they were subjected. They were being held in  detention, awaiting adjudication of their legal applications to stay in  this country, not for any crime. But they had no access to family  members, their family doctors, or legal counsel.   Many report that they went to the doctor for unrelated medical  conditions and only learned that they had been subjected to surgery  after the fact.   Finally, we must determine how such outrageous and inhumane treatment  of human beings in the custody of a U.S. agency could be allowed to  occur, and we must hold that agency, as well as the detention center,  the facility, the private prison operator, and the medical personnel,  accountable.   I cannot even begin to express how appalling these allegations are  and the stain that, if found to be accurate in their entirety, they  will leave on this country.   I am sure there is not a single Member of this body who doesn't want  to see a full independent investigation into these claims, and that is  exactly why we are offering this resolution today.   This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that this  investigation must begin immediately. Any delay is simply unacceptable.   Members of this body have already been forced to intervene in ICE's  attempts to deport witnesses central to the investigation since the  complaint was filed. This further affirms the necessity for the  investigation and that the very nature of how Federal agencies like ICE  and DHS are operating under this administration, in violation of the  rule of law and without accountability, that this is unacceptable.   Our current administration is aware of the structural flaws in our  immigration system and exploits them to great political effect. What we  are left with is a leader and a party that vilify immigrants as a tool  for political gain. Then they systematically round up and detain  immigrants in some of the most horrific ways possible, using private  detention centers, separating children from their parents, denying  basic medical treatment such as flu shots or COVID prevention, and  inflicting lifelong trauma on our fellow humans, creatures of God.   The allegations from the Irwin County detention facility are  repugnant, but they are consistent with a pattern of inhumane and  similar injustices that have been perpetrated by this administration.  ICE and DHS operate with impunity under a President who is using them  as a secret police force.   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in passing this necessary  resolution, but more than that, I hope that we can come together to  reform our broken immigration system.   Our current system harms significantly more than it helps, inflicting  physical and emotional pain without protecting our borders. We are long  overdue for serious changes that will better reflect our values and  interests as a country.   Next, Madam Speaker, we have H. Res. 1154, a resolution condemning  the rightwing conspiracy theory QAnon.   I am not entirely sure where to start with QAnon, but basic research  tells us it is a rightwing conspiracy theory concocted in some of the  darkest corners of the internet that purports to hail President Trump  as a savior of the country by combating shadowy members of a deep state  who kidnap children in order to drink their blood.   This is a theory so ludicrous that it could be considered absurd if  not for the thousands of Americans who have fully bought into these  premises and the rash of violence, hatred, and criminal activity that  these wild theories have encouraged.   In August 2020, a woman in Colorado was arrested and charged with  attempted kidnapping of her daughter, who had been placed in foster  care as her mother was deemed unfit to care for her. The woman is a  fervent QAnon follower and was even found to have consulted other QAnon  believers in a plot to kidnap her son, also in the foster care system.   Then there is the case of an Arizona man who was a QAnon follower. He  was charged with aggravated assault and making terroristic threats  after he was inspired by QAnon theories to use an armored van to block  a bridge over the Hoover Dam and demand release of a report he believed  existed that would expose the deep state, whatever that is.    The court ultimately blocked his guilty plea as the judge determined  that the sentencing would have been too lenient for the crimes he had  committed.   One of the most high-profile QAnon incidents came after an alleged  leader of the Gambino crime family in New York was murdered by a QAnon  supporter who, according to his testimony, believed that the murder  would assist President Trump.   While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to flirt  with these fringe conspiracy theories, including riling up their base  with allegations of invasions by antifa, which have been debunked by  the administration's own FBI, QAnon and those who have bought into it  are genuine threats to our democracy.   We are talking about a coordinated, sophisticated cult that is  poisoning the brains of more and more Americans each day.   In our Rules Committee meeting last night, many of my colleagues  claim to have never even heard of this deadly cult. I cannot possibly  believe that these skilled political operatives are so clueless, but  that is beside the point.   President Trump is certainly aware, and his tacit support and  encouragement of these dangerous narratives are a threat to the law and  order he so noisily embraces.   I hope that every single one of my Republican colleagues joins us in  condemning QAnon today for the sanity of this country. It is  particularly important that we do so now because the Republican Caucus  may not be united on this front in the next Congress.   Madam Speaker, with more than 15 QAnon believers on the ballot this  November across the country, it appears likely that at least one or two  of them may be taking seats in Congress next term.   In the meantime, every single Member on both sides of the aisle must  take their share of blame if these Hallowed Halls are going to be  contaminated by Representatives of a deranged conspiracy theory.   In any case, I look forward to seeing how Minority Leader McCarthy  will find a spot for this kind of expertise next Congress.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am so pleased to hear that we should all be working  together to get to the bottom of this, because that is exactly what the  resolution puts forward. It says that these are allegations. It doesn't  say that they are conclusively proved. But the resolution asks for an  investigation, and it asks our government to pull out all the stops to  do that.   The reason we need a resolution and a sense of Congress about this is  because we see ICE and the Department of Homeland Security undermining  this investigation already. When the news broke 2 weeks ago, they  promptly moved to deport one of the central witnesses. One of our  colleagues, Sheila Jackson Lee, had to get that witness removed from a  plane. She was on the tarmac ready to be sent overseas, where she then  would not be available to testify.   That same person was given humanitarian relief. She is allowed to  stay in the country. Today, this morning, as we speak here, she  reported to check in to ICE, as she was required to and as most  immigrants do in our system, and when she reported, they tried to  arrest her and deport her again.   As we speak, Members of this body are having to work to keep ICE from  undermining this investigation. So, yes, we need this resolution to  move forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Wow, that was hard to follow. Just to take a couple pieces there.   There is no allegation here of mass hysterectomies. What there are  allegations of, which have been strengthened over the intervening 2  weeks, are allegations that numerous women were subjected to  inappropriate medical care. And their medical records, as we begin to  receive them, are starting to confirm that there were a variety of  procedures that were committed upon these people without their consent,  including total and partial sterilization, but a range of procedures.   You know, Madam Speaker and I both come from Pennsylvania. We have  seen this kind of corruption before in our prison systems, where you  have a private prison system that gets involved in providing care--in  Pennsylvania, it was called the ``kids for cash'' scandal, where public  officials were being given kickbacks for interning children.   Now, is that what is going on here? The investigation may  substantiate that or it may not, but there is a lot that needs to be  dug into: the appropriateness of the medical care, whether someone was  profiting off what happened there, the humanity of what happened to  these women. All of that needs to be looked into.   That is what the resolution is asking for, that this be investigated,  because the allegations are so serious, and everything we have seen so  far has supported them.   Now, the IG is moving to investigate, and Congress has started to  investigate. While there was a general invitation to folks to attend  the codel that went down there last week, nearly a dozen of our  colleagues did go. They met with people down there.   This is just a first step. There will be hearings. We will get to  talk to the professionals from the community.   No one is saying that the investigation is complete, and no one is  saying that it is completely proven, but it is absolutely something  this body must do: to act, to make sure that our government agencies  are not participating in a scheme that deprives people of their basic  human rights.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Madam Speaker, of course, I look forward to joining my  colleagues in passing another round of coronavirus relief, as we did  unanimously or near unanimously the first four times, because we know  our communities, our colleges, our schools, our State and local  governments, our law enforcement officers, our healthcare systems all  need that relief that has been held up by the Senate and the White  House since May.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).    No, Madam Speaker. I do not yield for that purpose, and  I have no intention of doing so during this debate.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I do not yield.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We are in trying times. We have an erratic administration that  operates with the primary, if not exclusive, goal of winning reelection  at any cost and a Republican Party willing to do anything necessary to  aid in that goal.   We are in the midst of a global pandemic that has already upended  virtually every facet of our lives. Millions of people are unemployed  or facing unemployment, and over 207,000 of our friends and neighbors  have died.   Many of my constituents are facing eviction or are struggling to find  food for their families.   The fact that much of this suffering could be alleviated if not for  the apathy of Senate Republicans is tough to reckon with, but the  American people know who is on their side.   This Congress has passed more than 600 bills, and a quarter of them  have become law. Over 350 bipartisan bills lie untouched on Mitch  McConnell's desk while he focuses all of his energy on confirming as  many rightwing judges as he can.   We stand ready to negotiate, and we will pass a COVID relief bill  every day and twice on Sundays if that is what we have to do to get  Mitch McConnell's attention. And we will do it while passing other  legislation that is for the benefit of all the American people--not  just a select few, not just for those who dodge taxes--because that is  what governing is, and that is what we will continue to do.   We have a duty to provide an equal opportunity for all Americans to  live, work, and thrive in this country, and that is a responsibility  the administration and Senate majority leader have abdicated.   So for all of the criticism lobbed from the other side of the aisle  for taking up important resolutions like the ones we do today while a  COVID package still hasn't been signed into law, your words are  misplaced and you know exactly who to blame.   We were elected to govern, and that is exactly what we are going to  do. You are more than welcome to join us, but we are not going to let  you stand in our way while we move to protect human  [[Page H5136]]  rights and advance the best interests of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and  underlying legislation.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1164         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8265) to amend the Small Business Act and the       CARES Act to establish a program for second draw loans and       make other modifications to the paycheck protection program,       and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small       Business; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8265.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
