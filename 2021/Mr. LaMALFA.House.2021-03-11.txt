 Madam Speaker, after good results and success in recent  years of defending and controlling our border, the Biden administration  has turned on the green light that is seen all the way to Central  America for immigrating here illegally, giving us the Biden border  crisis.   It is not a matter of asylum, as asylum can be sought in Mexico.  Continuing the trek to the U.S. border shows it is really about  employment and economics.   Meanwhile, as our citizens struggle with unemployment and the  shutdowns from COVID, the Biden border crisis has subjected border  States, like my State of California, to COVID outbreak risks from those  bypassing our laws.   This begs the question: Whose side is the Biden administration on,  America's unemployed and COVID high-risk vulnerable or foreign  interests for politics?   Indeed, it doesn't seem like they are on the side of Americans, and  we are given, after less than 2 months, the Biden border crisis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Roy.   Indeed, as another representative of a border state, we feel the  effect as well of the Biden border crisis. President Trump saw the  importance, as did many law-and-order Americans, of having a secure  border. The Biden administration stopped construction of the security  fence hours after being inaugurated. This has given us now the Biden  border crisis.   Really bad enforcement of immigration, that seems to be their  priority. Risking health of Americans with virus superspreaders is a  result. As my colleague mentioned, the catch-and-release program is in  full force.   Do we really expect people to be released in this country to come  back to have a hearing within 2 years?   Past pattern shows not.   The Biden administration has just canceled an agreement with Mexico  to keep the asylum seekers on that side of the border, which worked  pretty well to keep the numbers down from those coming through Mexico  from Central America. Now the incentivization of that is another big  green light.   Look at the numbers we are talking about here. Just in January, the  numbers increased to 78,000 and change. In February, 100,000 so-called  encounters at the border for people who our personnel have to deal with  or might be sneaking through without dealing with our personnel.   To add final insult to this policy, to Americans, to taxpayers, in  the so-called COVID relief bill, checks can go to illegal immigrants  who are coming here via this manner.   I mean, whose side is this administration on? The hardworking  Americans coming through a COVID crisis, high unemployment? Who are  they working for?   I don't think it is us. I don't think it is the American people.   As a Californian, I also want to harken back to two tragedies amongst  many. In northern California, just a few short years ago, we lost a  beautiful young lady named Kate Steinle in San Francisco, who was  killed by an illegal immigrant who shouldn't have been here, who should  have been deported at least five times over.   Jamiel Shaw from the Los Angeles area, whose father I have met. His  dad lost his son to a killing by an illegal immigrant.   Whose side is this administration on when they carry out this policy  just to either show they are different from Trump or that it is a  political gain for them in their twisted view?   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.
