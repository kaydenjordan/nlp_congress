 Mr. Speaker, as the vice chair of the House Armed  Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, and representing Fort  Bliss in my home district of El Paso, Texas, I am proud to speak in  support of this bill, which passed out of our committee with  overwhelming bipartisan support.   The bill supports a military basic pay raise of 4.6 percent and  includes a targeted bonus to address the challenges of inflation. It  provides additional resources to decrease out-of-pocket costs for  housing and for our commissaries so they can keep their prices low.   It mitigates the tragedy of suicide by supporting an increase in the  number of behavioral health providers to ensure access to care for  those who need it most. And, given concerns about the increasing number  of vacancies of military and civilian providers across the Military  Health System, this bill prohibits the Department from realigning or  reducing military medical end strength until additional analysis on the  impacts is complete.   We also built on last year's historic reforms to the Uniform Code of  Military Justice, ensuring our criminal litigators are getting the best  training, resources, and experience possible to support our troops.   We are also taking care of our military children. In 2021, more than  20,000 children of servicemembers who had immediate need for childcare  were stuck on waitlists. In order to address the root causes, we are  requiring the Department of Defense to complete a study on adequate pay  for military childcare center employees.   To better support families with special needs, the bill establishes a  grant program to help them navigate school districts after every move  and ensures children with disabilities receive appropriate and high- quality educational services.   Together, servicemembers and their families make countless sacrifices  for our Nation, which is why we must continue our commitment to them.   I am grateful to Chairwoman Jackie Speier for her leadership, and I  am grateful to the ranking member and proud of the contributions our  subcommittee made to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would make a tremendous difference in the  lives of our military families, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask for support for my  amendment to allow servicemembers to get their chains of command to  process their complaints of harassment and prohibited discrimination in  a timely manner.   My amendment does not grant servicemembers any new rights or expand  existing ones, nor does it allow them to sue the Department of Defense.  It simply gives them the leverage to hold their chains of command to  their own timeline for processing complaints that have been filed.  [[Page H6266]]    Our servicemembers put their lives on the line protecting our country  every day. They make the ultimate sacrifice to serve our country in  ways that many cannot.   When they file complaints alleging serious harassment and  discrimination they have experienced while serving, they deserve to be  heard and to receive timely responses.   Data shows that civilian military employees file far more  discrimination and harassment complaints than servicemembers do,  despite having a smaller workforce than our servicemembers.   This is because our servicemembers lack many of the protections and  privileges that their civilian counterparts have when it comes to  discrimination and harassment, including this one.   While this benefits all servicemembers, my amendment would be  especially significant for women and minorities serving in the Armed  Forces.   Data from one Pentagon survey showed nearly a third of Black  servicemembers and a significant percentage of Asian and Hispanic  servicemembers experience racial harassment, discrimination, or both  during service.   This is talent we need to work to retain, and my amendment would help  with that. Our servicemembers deserve meaningful and robust policies  that ensure their complaints are processed expeditiously and with the  utmost urgency.   My amendment respects the separate internal administrative systems  the services have for processing complaints. It simply creates a time  limit to ensure they are processed within a reasonable timeframe that  is respectful of the servicemembers and their experiences.   Simply put, it ensures that after 180 days, if a servicemember's  complaint remains unresolved, the servicemember can request a court  order that would then direct the department to act on the case  expeditiously.   Absent this amendment, servicemembers routinely wait months and  months, and sometimes even years, for their complaints to be resolved,  with no ability to urge the services to act on their complaints.   This amendment brings an added level of urgency into internal  administrative processes.   My amendment would empower our servicemembers and bolster confidence  in the systems in place.   By passing this amendment, we are thereby extending protections  civilians already enjoy onto our servicemembers, whose battles should  be fought on the battlefield, not within the ranks.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I have tremendous respect for the ranking  member and the work that he has done on our great committee.   I do want to emphasize that servicemembers would not be allowed to  sue the Department of Defense. In fact, in many of these cases what  happens is the cases are resolved by policy or should be resolved by  policy within about 60 days, so this actually gives the service lines  added time to resolve these cases.   This is for those egregious examples--and I have spoken with  servicemembers who have had to live with these egregious examples--of  lack of a true effort to resolve these harassment and discrimination  claims. So this would be a last resort that would simply have a court  urge the service line to complete the investigation of harassment or  discrimination.   We are currently experiencing a challenge in recruitment. We want to  retain this talent, and we want to demonstrate to our servicemembers  that they matter, all of them, and that we will ensure that they have  access to a free and fair process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
