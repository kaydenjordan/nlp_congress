 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Capito, Van Hollen, and Isakson in the introduction of the Childhood  Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research, STAR, Act of  2017. This legislation is an extension of ongoing bipartisan efforts in  the Senate over the past decade to get us closer to the goal of  hopefully one day curing cancers in children, adolescents, and young  adults. Representatives McCaul, Speier, Kelly, and Butterfield are  introducing the companion legislation in the other body.   I first started working on this issue after meeting the Haight family  from Warwick, Rhode Island in June of 2004. Nancy and Vincent lost  their son, Ben, when he was just nine years old to neuroblastoma, a  very aggressive tumor in the brain.   With the strong support of families like the Haights for increased  research into the causes of childhood cancers and improved treatment  options, I introduced bipartisan legislation that eventually was signed  into law in 2008 as the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer  Act.   This was an important step. Yet, more work remains. The STAR Act  seeks to advance pediatric cancer research and child-focused cancer  treatments, while also improving childhood cancer surveillance and  providing resources for survivors and those impacted by childhood  cancer.   If a treatment is working, doctors elsewhere should know immediately.  The same should happen if a treatment isn't working, or if other major  medical events occur during the course of a particular treatment. It is  critical that doctors, nurses, and other providers are able to  effectively communicate information about the disease, the treatment  process, and what other health and development impacts children can  expect to experience with a particular course of treatment.   As such, the STAR Act would reauthorize the Caroline Pryce Walker  Conquer Childhood Cancer Act, creating a comprehensive children's  cancer biorepository for researchers to use in searching for  biospecimens to study and would improve surveillance of childhood  cancer cases.   This legislation also includes provisions dealing with issues that  arise for survivors of childhood cancer. Unfortunately, even after  beating cancer, as many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are  likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment; as many as  one-fourth experience a late effect that is serious or life- threatening, including second cancers and organ damage.   We must do more to ensure that children survive cancer and any late  effects so they can live a long, healthy, and productive life. This  legislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood  cancers, improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are  better able to care for this population as they age, and establish a  new pilot program to begin to explore improved models of care for  childhood cancer survivors.   Lastly, this bill would ensure more pediatric expertise at the  National Institutes of Health to better leverage the research  investment to improve pediatric cancer research by requiring the  inclusion of at least one pediatric oncologist on the National Cancer  Advisory Board and improving childhood health reporting requirements to  include pediatric cancer.   Last year, Senator Capito and I were able to get a provision of this  bill included in the 21st Century CURES Act, which was signed into law  at the end of the year. That provision will provide some clarity for  patients and their physicians attempting to access new drugs and  therapies from pharmaceutical companies. When a patient has run out of  other options, the last thing they and their families need is to spend  months being given the run-around trying to access a potential  treatment.   I am hopeful that we can build on this momentum. Indeed, it was  heartening to see the House of Representatives pass the Childhood  Cancer STAR Act as one of its last acts of the 114th Congress by a  unanimous vote. While, the Senate was unable to follow suit as time ran  out at the end of the year, HELP Committee Chairman Alexander and  Ranking Member Murray have committed to working with Senator Capito and  me to move the legislation this year.   The Childhood Cancer STAR Act has the support of the American Cancer  Society Cancer Action Network, St. Baldrick's Foundation, and  Children's Oncology Group, among others. I look forward to our  continued work with these stakeholders to build support for the bill  and with the HELP Committee to see this bill advance through the  legislative process.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Capito, Van Hollen, and Isakson in the introduction of the Childhood  Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research, STAR, Act of  2017.
