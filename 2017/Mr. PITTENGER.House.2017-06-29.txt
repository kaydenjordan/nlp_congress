 Mr. Speaker, the previous administration's biggest  homeland security failures were the lack of prosecution and enforcement  for crimes committed by illegal immigrants. For far too long, the Obama  administration failed to adequately punish illegal immigrants who  committed felonies in the United States.   A simple deportation is not enough. The United States must prosecute  and sentence all individuals who commit crimes and hurt Americans.   When we enforce the law, we create a deterrent mechanism for future  bad behavior. Failure to enforce the law is a failure to the American  people. That is why I support Kate's Law.   I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his strong work and leadership on this  issue for the safety and security of the American people.
