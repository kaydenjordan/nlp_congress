 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong solidarity with the  citizens and the political dissidents of Belarus.   On August 9, 2020, Belarus held its presidential election with its  incumbent President, Alexander Lukashenko, claiming victory with over  80 percent of the vote. Both the United States and the European Union  have called the elections ``neither fair or free,'' as the Lukashenko  regime restricted ballot access for candidates, prohibited local  independent observers, and employed intimidation tactics against  opposition candidates.   Mass protests erupted following the election. Tens of thousands of  protestors took to the street to express their disapproval of  Lukashenko and his administration. His regime responded with excessive  force to quell the protests, including the use of live and rubber  ballots, leading to thousands of Belarusian citizens being either  detained or arrested. It appears likely that violent crackdowns will  continue.   Mr. Speaker, included in these arrests are several opposition  leaders, including former presidential candidates Sergei Tikhanovsky,  Viktar Babaryka, Coordination Council members Liliya Vlasova, Sergei  Dylevsky, Maria Kalesnikava, and Maxim Znak, as well as several of  their staff and volunteers, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposition  presidential nominee, was forced to flee the country, as was opposition  leader Veronika Tsepkalo and her husband, former presidential nominee,  Valery Tsepkalo.   None of the dissidents have been given a fair trial, and all of them  have had their human rights denied. As I think about the current  situation in Belarus, I am reminded of President Ronald Reagan's speech  to Soviet dissidents at Spaso House in 1988. President Reagan made two  things clear that day: The United States' commitment to human rights  are, and will continue to be, fundamental and unwavering, and that  through strength, determination, and prayer, there is nothing you  cannot conquer.   Reagan also said in that speech, ``While we press for human rights  through diplomatic channels, you press with your very lives, day in,  day out, year after year, risking your jobs, your homes, your all.''   Mr. Speaker, while the people of Belarus continue their tireless  fight for human rights, the United States should be working with our  European partners and allies to impose new sanctions on those  responsible not only for voter repression, but also for the violent  crackdowns that follow the election.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of 28 individuals.                     Belarus Sanctions Recommendations         1.
