 Mr. President, now, later this morning, the four  congressional leaders will meet with President Biden and Vice President  Harris at the White House.   Speaking for the Democrats, our hope is to come together and find  common ground where we can work in a bipartisan way to overcome the  many challenges of our time. We cannot be small-minded or passive. We  must be big and bold to meet the changes in the world, the rapid  changes that are occurring in the world.   The world is rapidly changing and has been for some time. Just like  the steam engine launched the Industrial Revolution and a century of  tumultuous change and electricity changed things dramatically in the  latter half of the 19th and early parts of the 20th century, the  internet has launched the technological revolution.   We are living through that period of massive change everywhere: in  media, communications, transportation, how we learn and work and live.  The world is not going back to the old way that it was, and America  needs to adapt so our workers, families, and businesses can compete and  prosper in the 21st century.   There are so many different changes. Let me just point out one that  our society has basically neglected, and that is about childcare. When  I was a kid in the late fifties and early sixties, the typical American  family had two spouses, only one of whom worked. I would get home from  school every day, and there would be my mom for me, my brother, and  sister, with milk and cookies, to make sure we drank our milk. She  didn't care if we ate our cookies.   And she asked us: Did you have homework? We went out to play, but she  was keeping an eye on us. We would play in the street. That was one of  the places I learned the most, just playing stickball and other stuff  in the streets of Brooklyn.   But, in any case, that is not true anymore. The typical American  family is not the way it used to be. The vast majority are either  single-parent families or two-parent families where both work. That  means that childcare is much more needed to maximize both the happiness  and productivity of our society in the 21st century.   Parents sweat over childcare. They need to go to work, but who is  going to watch the kids? Can they afford childcare? Is it good enough  for the children, of course, whom they love? Our children are our most  precious possession. And if we don't dramatically change childcare, we  are going to fall far behind, far behind. I read somewhere that of the  37 OECD nations, we are 36th in childcare. Only Turkey is lower.   In general, these things should not be partisan issues.  Infrastructure and jobs, putting our economy on firm ground should be  the work of both Democrats and Republicans.   Another change, obviously, is climate. In the fifties and sixties, we  didn't even imagine a world with climate change. In the last 20 years,  it  [[Page S2464]]  has become apparent that we had better do something about it or we  could have worse times than this COVID year, every year, 10 or 15 years  from now. The dramatic changes that will discombobulate our society and  risk our health and our economy, just as COVID did, will happen if we  don't do anything. So fighting climate change and making sure America  leads the world in emerging industries that deal with climate should be  the work of both Democrats and Republicans.   This Congress has proven that we can legislate in a bipartisan way,  just most recently on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill and a bipartisan  water infrastructure bill. I believe we will continue that trend by  taking up and passing a bipartisan competition bill this work period.   So as we head to the White House today, I hope our other leaders are  thinking about how we can come together to solve our Nation's problems  in a bold and lasting way. One hundred percent of Democrats' focus--and  I think I can speak for Speaker Pelosi as well as myself and President  Biden--is on delivering help to the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, speaking of bipartisan legislation,  today the Commerce Committee will begin marking up the Endless Frontier  Act, one of the most significant investments in American innovation in  generations. The bill will be at the core of comprehensive legislation  to address American competitiveness and security in the 21st century.   Once again, for the information of the Senate, it is my intention for  the Senate to consider and finish competitive legislation before the  end of the month. There have been productive bipartisan talks over the  last week to improve the Endless Frontier Act.   This is an issue I have worked on with my friend the Republican  Senator from Indiana for the past few years. He has been a great help,  a great partner, and I appreciate his work. And, of course, Senator  Cantwell, our chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Wicker,  our ranking member, have come together. And everyone had to give a bit  here, there, and everywhere, but I think we have a strong bill that  should get strong bipartisan support.   The simple truth is very simple. The Endless Frontier Act is  legislation our country desperately needs. For decades after the Second  World War, our country led the world in science and technology, from  healthcare to computers, from telecommunications to manufacturing, to  defense. Our workforce brought these innovations to the global economy,  and it produced more than half a century of prosperity.   People in the last 50 years, from 1950 to 2000, thought the future  was going to be better even than the present, and it created the usual  American optimism. But things have changed, and one of the things that  has changed is years of Federal investment in sciences, and they have  exposed long-term weak spots--serious weak spots--in our economic  competitiveness. This could hurt us dramatically in the next 50 years.   The longer we put off investing in sciences, the likelier it is that  other countries, like China but others too, will overtake America as  the global leader in innovation, and that will have profound  consequences for our economy, our national security, even the future of  human liberty, and it will have a lot to do with whether Americans  believe that the future economically will be better for them than the  present, which is part of the American hallmark and trademark, our  sunny optimism, which we must restore. There has been a sourness in the  land lately. It is our mission to restore it.   So to take the initiative back, the Endless Frontier Act provides  $100 billion for basic research through the National Science  Foundation, focusing on the critical technologies of tomorrow, where we  have to stay the leader: AI, advanced manufacturing, renewable energy,  quantum computing, cyber security, 5G, battery storage, and so much  more.   This bill will nurture tech labs and tech hubs across the country in  places where they are not now. We have to spread the wealth. The clock  is ticking on the need to make these critical investments.   The Chinese Communist Party has gone to extraordinary lengths to  steal a generation of American intellectual property and cheat their  way to innovating and economic growth. We do not, we definitely do  not--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives do not want a  future where the Chinese Communist Party dictates the global order and  how the world uses 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing.   That is why the Endless Frontier Act is resoundingly bipartisan. We  already have six cosponsors from each side--six Democrats, six  Republicans--because these issues affect the future of our entire  country. I greatly look forward to the good work that Chair Cantwell  and the Commerce Committee will do to advance the bill this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final topic, I am not in the habit  of commenting on the House Republican minority, but today they have  reached a new and very dangerous low point. Earlier this morning, the  House GOP ousted Liz Cheney from the party's leadership. Her crime?  Telling the truth--telling the truth that Joe Biden is the legitimate  President of the United States and Donald Trump is lying when he says  the election is stolen.   Congresswoman Cheney spoke truth to power, and for that she has been  fired. Make no mistake, the Congresswoman and I disagree on so many  policy issues, but we both agree that truth matters. And she, like so  many characters in history--I am just thinking now of Sir Thomas More-- had the courage to tell the truth and paid a big price for it.   So this is sad--a very dark moment for the Republican Party.  Republicans are seeking to perpetuate and act upon the big lie that the  election was stolen, simply to placate the most dishonest President in  American history. This President lies at will. He doesn't care of the  consequences for the future of grand, great, and wonderful democracy.  He only cares about himself and feeding his ego, and truth has nothing  do with that. It mattered--what happened matters a great deal, and what  the former President is trying to do hurts our country dramatically.  The former President's lies, right now, are poisoning our democracy,  eroding our faith in government, and exciting a plague--often nasty,  sometimes racist--of voter suppression laws.    I had thought that January 6 revealed the devastating consequences of  the big lie. I thought that the invasion of our Capitol by an armed  mob--a mob that sought to delay the peaceful transfer of power; a mob  that I was within 15, 20 feet of at one moment--would demonstrate to  all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both ends of the  Capitol, the awful price of Donald Trump's lies. But after a brief and  all-too-short period of introspection, it appears that the big lie is  no longer on the retreat among Republicans but, instead, is spreading  like a cancer.   Far be it for me to tell House Republicans who should lead them, but  it is truly a dangerous--dangerous--sign of our times that the price of  admission in today's Republican Party is silence in the face of  provable lies.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.
