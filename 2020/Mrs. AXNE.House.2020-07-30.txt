 Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to cosponsor this amendment  today, to ensure that no taxpayer dollars go toward advancing a lawsuit  that literally threatens the livelihood of millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, since 2017, we have seen an administration obsessed with  undermining, sabotaging, and repealing a law that protects millions  living with preexisting conditions in this country.   As we end another month of a devastating health crisis that has taken  the lives of 150,000 Americans, they are doubling down and insisting-- and I quote their own words here--``the ACA must fall.''   This isn't only extraordinarily tone-deaf. It is playing politics  with the lives of people in this country, including Iowans.
