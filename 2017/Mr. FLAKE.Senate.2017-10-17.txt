 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on the much needed topic of  tax reform. The high rates and complicated nature of the current Tax  Code are burdening individual taxpayers and making businesses less  competitive in the global market. That simply has to change. It has  been more than 30 years since we have passed major tax reform, and we  are well past time.   Unfortunately, I recently learned of a serious threat to reforming  the Tax Code called alpacas. Now, what do these cute, mild-mannered  pets have to do with Federal tax policy? Earlier this year, I issued an  oversight report entitled ``Tax Rackets: Outlandish Loopholes to Lower  Tax Liabilities.'' That report demonstrated how clever accounting  allows nearly anything imaginable to become a writeoff, including  alpacas.   To illustrate the point, the report outlined how local and Federal  tax bills can be sheared by claiming exotic pets--these exotic pets--as  livestock and turning backyards into barnyards. That is when the fur  really started to fly.   Alpaca owners associations that once brazenly touted this tax fleece  as a key selling point for the animals now feigned outrage at the  suggestion. The association tried to pull the wool over the eyes of  taxpayers by retaining a professional PR consultant. They launched a  media campaign, inundating my office and others with phone calls,  social media messages, and letters with photos of alpacas.   Through slick reporting and aggressive lobbying, tax-subsidized  alpaca ownership was somehow presented as a bulwark of small business  and a flourishing middle class. If this mere mention of a tax break  costing $10 million annually and enjoyed by relatively few taxpayers  elicited such an outmeasured and aggressive response, imagine the  backlash we will face when we are attempting to actually eliminate tax  preferences benefiting powerful corporations and special interests to  the tune of billions of dollars.   There are over 200 loopholes buried throughout the Tax Code that  collectively cost $123 trillion annually. Again, there are over 200  loopholes buried throughout the Tax Code that collectively cost $1.23  trillion annually. This exceeds the total amount spent annually by the  Federal Government for all discretionary programs, which includes  defense, education, transportation, foreign aid, and protecting the  environment.   These exemptions increase the bill for the average taxpayer. They  also make the Tax Code so complicated that most individuals have to  hire a tax professional or buy software to help complete their tax  returns.   At more than 74,000 pages in length, no one--not even those in  Washington who write the laws or enforce them--truly understands  Federal tax law. Special interests are taking advantage of this  confusion by hiring armies of accountants and Washington lobbyists to  dodge taxes and cash in on the complexity of the code. For example,  developers are claiming--these are a lot of homebuilders are claiming  $8 billion in tax credits every year supposedly to construct low-income  housing, but with fewer homes being built and no basic accountability  requirements, it is nearly impossible to track how this money is being  spent.   The Government Accountability Office, the GAO, which is  investigating, said the ``IRS and no one else in the federal government  really has an idea of what is going on.''   The same is true with hundreds of other tax loopholes. A luxury yacht  can qualify as a second home and can be eligible for a mortgage  interest deduction. Alaskan ship captains can expense costs for whaling  as charitable contributions, even though no money goes to charity and  whaling is typically illegal otherwise. High rollers can itemize the  cost of gambling trips, including entertainment. Even the cost of  losing lottery tickets can be deducted, a kind of scratch-off writeoff.   Only the IRS knows who is taking advantage of these loopholes, and  the agency often cannot verify whether those claiming the tax giveaways  are eligible. In order to achieve meaningful tax reform that makes the  code simpler and fairer, we have to be able to first evaluate who is  benefiting from these loopholes, for what purpose, and for what price.   That is why I am introducing the Tax Expenditures Accountability Act,  which will publicly disclose the names of the corporate and special  interests receiving tax credits and the costs of these tax credits.  This bill requires the Department of Treasury to disclose the special  interest receiving tax credits just as all other Federal expenditures  are currently disclosed on the public website USAspending.gov. Sunlight  is obviously the best disinfectant, and I look forward to exposing many  of these loopholes, eliminating them, and returning the savings to  individual taxpayers in the form of lower taxes.   As the alpaca lobby demonstrated, riding herd on tax breaks will  cause every special interest benefiting from the code's complexity and  unfairness to cry foul. Washington's powerful special interests will  mobilize and threaten to derail tax reform. Many would rather protect  these loopholes than allow taxpayers to keep more of their own  paycheck.  [[Page S6465]]    Coming up short on reform is not an option. We have to do it this  year. Individuals and businesses are suffering under a broken,  antiquated tax code that is in dire need of fixing. We can't be  deterred in efforts to achieve real reform that reduces the tax bill  for everyone.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 1975.
