 Mr. Speaker, on July 1, 1997, Britain transferred  sovereignty over Hong Kong to China. Under a ``one country, two  systems'' arrangement with London, Beijing promised to allow universal  suffrage as an ultimate aim, along with other freedoms.   But 20 years later, that promise remains unfilled. Last March, a new  chief executive was elected, not by the people of Hong Kong, but by a  committee whose members have close ties to the Chinese Government.  Human rights groups have documented an erosion of press freedom and  growing threats to judicial independence. Hong Kong's freedoms are at  grave risk.   This Saturday, Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Hong Kong to  mark the 20th anniversary of the handover. Some protesters have already  been detained, including Joshua Wong, who I have met, and newly elected  legislator, Nathan Law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of this Chamber to hold China to its  word and speak out in support of democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.                            ____________________
