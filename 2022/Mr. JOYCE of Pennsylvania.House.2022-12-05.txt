 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate  the Juniata College Eagles women's volleyball team on winning the NCAA  Division III national championship.   Playing with such grit, technical skill, and power, these young women  were instrumental in creating 34 victories during the season.   Coach Pavlik believed that there are no shortcuts to success.  Practice and hard work combined with respect for your opponent are the  hallmark of what makes a team great. It was those values and a refusal  to quit that allowed this team to come back to defeat Trinity College  to win the national championship.   It is the Eagles' third national title, as they become one of just  five women's volleyball programs to have won three national  championships.   Equally as important as the team's success in volleyball is their  success in the academic classroom. Juniata's commitment to academic  excellence is a shining example of how student athletes can be  supported both on and off the court.   On behalf of all the people of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District, I congratulate Juniata College Eagles and wish them every  continued success in the years to come.                              Secure Our Borders     Mr. Speaker, it has been reported that a  near-record number of migrants are flocking to our southern border as  the title 42 remain in Mexico policy is set to expire.   Initial reports show that over 70,000 immigrants evaded apprehension  just in the past month, the highest on record, according to preliminary  data.   This surge in crossings is bringing a national security and  humanitarian crisis to our border, even as the Biden administration  refuses to provide additional funding to our Customs and Border Patrol  agents.   Without that funding, without the tools, without the training and  equipment our Border Patrol needs, our safety and security are at risk.   President Biden has never stepped foot at the southern border, and he  has worsened and ignored our historic border crisis at each and every  turn.   Now is not the time to end title 42. Now is not the time to leave our  ports of entry vulnerable. And now is not the time to play political  games with our national security.   Our borders are at risk, and the sovereignty of our country is  maintained only with protecting our borders.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 198, the Data Mapping to Save Moms'  Lives Act, that mirrors legislation from Representatives Bilirakis and  Butterfield. Their legislation passed the House by over 400 votes in  April of this year.   Maternal mortality continues to affect moms and children across the  United States. The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked in a  bipartisan way to address this preventable issue, but unfortunately,  challenges remain.   This legislation will build on existing tools of the Federal  Communications Commission by incorporating publicly available data on  maternal health outcomes into its Mapping Broadband Health in America  tool. The FCC would be required to work with the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to determine what maternal health outcomes to  include.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4052, the Early Hearing  Detection and Invention Act, the companion legislation to H.R. 5561  sponsored by Energy and Commerce Committee members, Representatives  Guthrie and  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1193, the Cardiovascular  Advances and Opportunities Legacy Act, or the CAROL Act. I am excited  that we are going to pass this legislation and send it to the  President's desk.   Our friend and colleague, Representative   Andy Barr, introduced the  CAROL Act to honor his late wife who tragically passed away from an  underlying condition known as mitral valve prolapse.   The bill authorizes grants administered by the National Heart, Lung,  and Blood Institute to support research on valvular heart disease and  convene subject matter experts to identify research opportunities to  develop treatment guidelines for patients with valvular heart diseases.  It also instructs the CDC to increase public awareness regarding  symptoms of valvular heart disease and effective strategies for  preventing sudden cardiac death.                                time  1615    Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death for most  demographic groups in the United States. Over 600,000 Americans die  from heart disease each year. This is equal to one person every 36  seconds.   We know that early action is critical to surviving a heart condition.  People need to know warning signs and symptoms, so we must identify the  gaps in education and information sharing.   This bill also has been a model in terms of how legislation should be  done. It was the subject of a hearing at the Energy and Commerce  Committee, was voted on by the subcommittee and full committee, and  then passed by the entire House. The Senate then also moved it through  the committee process and made some improvements to the legislation in  consultation with  [[Page H8756]]  House sponsors and the Energy and Commerce Committee. Last week, the  Senate voted to send the updated legislation back here to the House.   This regular order process only improved this important legislation,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.
