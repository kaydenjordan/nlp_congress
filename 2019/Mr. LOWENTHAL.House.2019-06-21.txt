 Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Pride Month, we are  reminded of the great strides towards equality we have taken.   Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, on the streets outside the Stonewall Inn  where the modern LGBTQ rights movement began, the journey towards  equality, no doubt, looked endless. Today, we can see the end in sight.  And yet, for all of our success, the struggle continues.   We cannot rest; we cannot compromise; we simply cannot allow the  demagogues of ignorance, of fear, and of hatred of others, no matter  what levels of power they hold, to stop our march forward.   We must redouble our efforts to ensure that life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness applies to each and every American, no matter who  they are and no matter whom they love.                            ____________________
