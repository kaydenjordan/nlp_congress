 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Draco Miller, a  cherished member of the Brownwood community who sadly passed away on  February 16, 2023.   Draco was a father, husband, son, businessowner, and public servant  to the community of Brownwood as a city council member, mentor to our  youth, and leader in numerous service-oriented boards and  organizations.   In 2022, Draco was named Man of the Year by the Brownwood Chamber of  Commerce for his service to Brownwood. In his own words, he said:  ``This is my city, and I love my city. There is no place like home.''   Although he loved and cherished Brownwood, his family was the most  important facet of his life. He dedicated his life to passing along his  long-held values of faith, family, and a strong work ethic.   He is remembered for his seemingly endless energy, optimism, and good  will that carried him through decades of community involvement and  community improvement projects.   Although we mourn his loss, I know his legacy will live on through  his wife, Sonja; their children; many extended family members; and the  entire Brownwood community.                            ____________________
