 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I am honored to share today's  Special Order hour on Black Wall Street on behalf of the Congressional  Black Caucus, which is chaired by our great leader, Congressmember  Joyce Beatty.   I want to extend my condolences to Congressmember Beatty and her  family for the loss of her husband.   On May 30, 1921, a single scream in an elevator became the spark that  ignited a powder keg of racial terror that set on fire Black Wall  Street. A young Black man enters an elevator, and an elevator operator,  a young White woman, screams, giving the impression that she had been  assaulted.    A local newspaper, the Tulsa Tribune, accuses the young Black man of  raping the young White woman. The headline of the article was an  incitement to racial violence: ``Nab the Negro Who Attacked the Girl in  the Elevator.''   As a result of the incitement, a White lynch mob descended on Black  Wall Street and set on fire the wealthiest Black community in the  United States, reducing it to ashes. The ashes of Black Wall Street are  a metaphor for the failure of Reconstruction.   In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, there were newly  emancipated African Americans who set out to build a better life for  themselves and their family, only to be held back by racial terror and  violence that ultimately came to be codified in the form of Jim Crow.   We, as the CBC, are not only here to recite the facts of the Tulsa  Race Massacre, but we are also here to reflect on the deeper meaning.  The massacre in Tulsa tells a larger story about false accusation as an  incitement to violence. It tells a larger story about the failure of  Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow. It tells a larger story about  domestic terrorism and white supremacist extremism as a form of  domestic terror. It tells a larger story about the systematic denial  and destruction of Black wealth. And, finally, it tells a larger story  about the legacy of discrimination and the need for restitution.   It is worth noting that here in the United States Congress there is  no greater champion of reparations than the chair of the Special Order  hour, Congressmember Jackson Lee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for his deep  insight and kind words earlier.   Some background on Tulsa, Oklahoma: The district of Greenwood in its  time was famously described by Booker T. Washington as ``Black Wall  Street.'' It was so named because it was the most vibrant and affluent  African-American community in the United States. It was an oasis of  opportunity in a desert of du jour discrimination.   For many African Americans in search of a better life, it was a  promised land amid the broken promise of Reconstruction. It was home to  10,000 residents. There were 30 vibrant restaurants, 45 vibrant grocers  and meat markets. There was a 54-room hotel. There was a theater and a  hospital.   Black Wall Street was a self-contained, self-sufficient community of  Black wealth, a community of Black entrepreneurship and Black  ownership.   And Black Wall Street, at the hands of racial terrorism, at the hands  of racial violence, the wealthiest Black community in the United States  became a scene of mass murder, looting, and arson. It became a scene of  death, destruction, and displacement. Nothing was spared in the Tulsa  Race Massacre.   Churches, schools, and hospitals were burned down. Twelve thousand  homes were burned down. Thirty-five blocks burned down. The Tulsa  burning had a death toll of 300 and a displacement toll of 10,000. Ten  thousand people lost their homes, their businesses, and their  livelihoods. And 6,000 of those people were relegated to internment  camps.   Then, after the internment camps, Black professionals, Black business  owners who lost everything, were forced to live in tents and shacks. It  was the worst act of racial terrorism and one of the worst acts of  domestic terrorism in the history of the United States.                                time  2000    Now, I see a parallel between the Tulsa Race Massacre and January 6.  The insurrection against the United States Congress on January 6 was  not simply an attack on a physical structure, it was an expression of  racial rage and resentment against multiracial democracy. And the same  is true of the Tulsa Race Massacre.   We have to recognize that the domestic terrorism that we saw unfold  on January 6 did not happen in a vacuum. It has a history, and that  history includes the KKK; it includes Jim Crow, and, yes, it includes  the Tulsa Race Massacre. And it is a scandal in America that most  Americans have never heard of the Tulsa Race Massacre.   Madam Speaker, as Congressman Johnson noted earlier, it has been  referred to as a race riot, which is an attempt to whitewash the white  supremacist, domestic terrorism at the heart of the massacre. And so we  are here to tell the truth about the Tulsa Greenwood Massacre because  we see a proper revision of history away from whitewashing as part of  our national reckoning with race in America.   It is worth noting that in 2021, Black homeownership is at historic  lows. The rate of Black homeownership is lower today than it was before  the Fair Housing Act in the 1960s. The gap between Black and White  homeownership has never been greater. According to the Federal Reserve,  White households on average have eight times more wealth than Black  households. And part of the reason is the Tulsa massacre, and the  systemic racism that it represents.   There is a racial income gap between White households and Black  households, but there is an even greater wealth gap. And the wealth gap  is not an accident, it is a product of public policy. It is a  consequence of systemic racism.   During the post-war era, we saw Black Americans systematically  excluded from programs providing homeownership and higher education,  which are the pillars of wealth-building. And if you have no home to  own, then you have no home equity to build. And if you have no home  equity to build, then you have no wealth to pass down from one  generation to the next.   And so, instead of realizing the dream of intergenerational wealth,  too many Black Americans were condemned by public policy, condemned by  systemic racism to the nightmare of intergenerational poverty. The  Tulsa Race Massacre should be understood as a microcosm of what white  supremacy has done to Black people and Black property, to Black  business and Black  [[Page H2410]]  community. And the ghosts of Jim Crow, the ghosts of the Tulsa and  Greenwood massacre hunts us till this day.   I represent a neighborhood named Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, and many  of the businesses on Arthur Avenue have been owned by the same family  for more than 100 years, but those businesses--all of them are white.   And I thought to myself, what if Black Wall Street had been left  alone, had been left to survive and thrive. It may very well be the  case that some of those businesses would have endured until 2021. We  could have had businesses owned by Black families for more than a  century had it not been for the racial terrorism that took hold in  1921. And we know that when it comes to business, longevity is often  the basis for resilience. Established businesses which tend to be  wealthier and whiter had greater resilience in the face of COVID-19;  whereas, newer businesses, which tend to be Black and Brown, were too  fragile to survive the cataclysm of COVID-19.   In the first two months of the outbreak, 44 percent of Black  businesses were wiped out, which raises the question, what if Black  Wall Street were left to thrive, and what if we could have had  businesses that would have endured for more than a century and could  have had the resilience, the longevity, to overcome even a cataclysmic  event like COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I want to provide some more historic background, on  May 31-June 1, 1921, a White mob attacked America's Black Wall Street,  the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and what is known as the  Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre. The White mob of thousands of people  shot and murdered Black residents, looted their homes and businesses,  and burned more than 1,000 homes, churches, schools, and businesses.  Not only did local authorities and law enforcement fail to maintain  civil order and protect Tulsa's Black residents, some government agents  aided the White mob in carrying out the massacre.   Many of the residents who fled the massacre were detained in  internment camps immediately following the massacre. And local  officials later made, and ultimately failed, an attempt to block the  ability of the Black community to rebuild the Greenwood commercial  district by enacting a restrictive building ordinance.   Less than a month after the massacre, a grand jury placed the blame  entirely on the Black community and indicted 85 people--mostly African- Americans--with massacre-related offenses. No White person was ever  held individually accountable for crimes committed during the massacre,  and the vast majority of survivors and their descendants were never  directly compensated for these harms.   So not only did a White lynch mob set the most vibrant, Black  community on fire, but then the United States proceeded to whitewash  the history of the Tulsa massacre, claiming that it was a race riot  rather than the act of domestic terrorism that it was and should always  be seen as. No White person was held to account, and no Black person  was made whole.   Despite the acute challenges of racism in the late 19th and early  20th century, Black residents have been able to create thriving  community in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, this  community was literally burned to the ground in one of the worst  incidents of racial violence in American history. And to this day, no  one has been truly held responsible. And it is worth noting, even  though Greenwood has rebuilt itself, Greenwood does have among the  highest rates of poverty and unemployment in the city of Tulsa, which  demonstrates the legacy of systemic racism, how hard it can be to  overcome that legacy.   The Tulsa Massacre resulted in property damage valued anywhere from  $25 million to $100 million when adjusted in today's dollars. As the  descendants of the white mob that looted Tulsa businesses have had the  opportunity to benefit from the wealth of their ancestors, many Black  survivors of the Tulsa Massacre and their descendants have not been  able to recoup the wealth that had been lost or destroyed during the  massacre.   Despite the Oklahoma Commission to study the race massacre of 1921  stating, ``Reparations to the historic Greenwood community in real and  tangible form would be good public policy and do much to repair the  emotional and physical scars of this terrible incident in our shared  past.'' Despite that finding, neither the State of Oklahoma nor the  city of Tulsa has provided direct compensation to survivors or their  descendants.   Discrimination against Black Tulsans did not end following the  massacre. Over the local decades, local ordinances to prevent  rebuilding, redlining, urban renewal, and slum clearance,  gentrification, highway construction, tearing apart communities.   I will offer a note of personal reflection. I represent the South  Bronx, which has been ravaged by a racist highway known as the Cross  Bronx Expressway. It was built by Robert Moses and largely funded by  Federal dollars. And the Cross Bronx Expressway has left behind decades  of displacement and environmental degradation.   There are children who are born in the Bronx who live near the Cross  Bronx Expressway, who breathe in pollutants every day that cause  respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. And we saw those  diseases become lethal during COVID-19.   As a son of the Bronx, I was often in three places. I was at home, I  was at school, and I was in the emergency room, because I was  repeatedly hospitalized for asthma. And the asthma epidemic in the  Bronx, again, is not an accident. It is a consequence of the Cross  Bronx Expressway, which is both literally and metaphorically a  structure of racism. The South Bronx has a childhood asthma  hospitalization rate that is double to three times the national  average.   So like the South Bronx, the neighborhood of Greenwood has its own  racist highway. And one of the most exciting features of the American  Jobs Plan is a proposed $20 billion fund that would rebuild  neighborhoods that have been divided and devastated by the structural  racism of highways. And I hope neighborhoods like Greenwood and the  South Bronx will benefit from our national reckoning with race.   The impact of the massacre and the ongoing systemic discrimination is  clear when you compare North Tulsa, where many Black residents of Tulsa  now live, to other areas. North Tulsan residents are significantly  poorer than residents in other parts of the city. There are fewer  businesses and large-scale employers in North Tulsa than in other  cities.   According to a 2018 city study, North Tulsa had the fewest jobs of  any region of Tulsa. The unemployment rate is 2.37 percent times higher  for Black Tulsans than for White Tulsans. The lowest life expectancy in  Tulsa occurs in the poorest regions with the greatest concentration of  Black residents.   The United States has a responsibility to both acknowledge the harm  caused by the Tulsa Massacre and to enact legal remedies and policy  proposals to compensate survivors and their descendants. And as many of  you know, there is no greater champion of making the victims of  systemic racism whole, no greater champion of reparations than the  chair of our Special Order hour, Congress Member Jackson Lee.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
