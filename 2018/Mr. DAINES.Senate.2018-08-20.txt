 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing  Charles Dowd of Deer Lodge County, MT for his honorable service in  uniform at a pivotal time in our Nation's history and as a leader in  his community.   In January of 1941, at the age of 17, Charles volunteered for service  at sea in the U.S. Navy. He completed boot camp in Newport, RI, and  later communications school in San Diego. In September, as a basically  trained radio operator, he was transferred to his first permanent duty  station: Pearl Harbor, HI. Three months later, he would take his place  in history.   On Sunday morning, December 7, just after completing a night shift,  he and his fellow shipmates came under attack by more than 300 enemy  aircraft. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service conducted a successful  military strike on the heart of the U.S. Pacific Fleet--destroying or  severely damaging 21 ships and claiming the lives of 2,400 Americans.  In only a t-shirt and trousers, he sprinted from the barracks to the  armory, where he climbed to the roof with a .30-06 Springfield rifle  and began firing at the pilots of low-flying torpedo bombers. He  suffered burns on his arms and neck from the nearby USS California,  which was engulfed in flames.   Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, Charles volunteered for duty  in Solomon Islands during the bloody Guadalcanal campaign, where he  earned the nickname ``Devil Dog Dowd,'' harkening to the marines of  Belleau Wood in World War One. Once U.S. forces secured the islands,  Dowd would climb a signal tower on the island of Tulagi and message a  nearby destroyer that he was willing to exchange duties with any  willing radioman. The ship's commodore, CAPT Arleigh Burke, accepted  his request. Burke would later reach the rank of four-star admiral and  serve as Chief of Naval Operations. In Burke's stateroom, Dowd shared  his experiences at Pearl Harbor and Tulagi. Burke was so impressed by  Dowd's fighting spirit, that he assigned Dowd as his flag radioman.   During the course of his service, Dowd was awarded seven Bronze Star  medals. After the war, Charles and his wife returned stateside, where  he worked in masonry and carpentry construction, before completing his  degree at the University of Florida. After graduation, he spent the  next 18 years passing on his knowledge of industrial arts and drafting  to high school students. An avid sportsman with a passion for the  outdoors, Dowd later relocated to Anaconda, MT. He has been an active  member of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, dedicated to  preserving the memory of the events of World War II and those who paid  the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Charles continues to speak  for civic groups and museums around the State.   It is my privilege to honor the life of this esteemed Montanan, who  contributed so much to the preservation of freedom and improving the  lives of others. On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank  Charles, whose courage and selfless dedication to others are a hallmark  for generations to come.                            ____________________
