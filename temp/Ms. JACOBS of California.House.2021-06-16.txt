 Mr. Speaker, even before COVID-19 hit, the  care economy was at the heart of our communities.   Care workers keep our kids safe, our families healthy, and our  businesses open.   Last week, I met with a group of childcare providers in San Diego,  extraordinary women who do this work because they have a passion for  helping kids. They love their jobs and they love the kids they care  for, but that doesn't mean they should have to accept low wages and job  insecurity.   When the pandemic hit, thousands of childcare centers across the  country closed, including more than 500 in San Diego County, leading to  devastating job loss in an industry that is 95 percent women.   The American Rescue Plan included $39 billion in grants to help  parents afford childcare, and funding to help providers stay open and  pay workers.   Now we need to go further.   The American Families Plan will create universal pre-K, make  childcare affordable to all, and pay care workers a living wage.   Mr. Speaker, let's make sure that we care for the amazing workers who  care for our future.                            ____________________
