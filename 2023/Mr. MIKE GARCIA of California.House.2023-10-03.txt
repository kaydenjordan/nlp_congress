 Mr. Speaker, I want to recalibrate our  minds on what is actually happening here today.   This proceeding looks important. It feels consequential, but let's  look at what else is happening across America.   Today, about 300 Americans will die from fentanyl poisoning. Today,  about 11,000 people will illegally penetrate our borders. Today's debt  is approaching $34 trillion. Today's mortgage rates just hit a 25-year  high now approaching 8 percent. Our energy prices are again at  backbreaking highs with gas approaching $8 a gallon in my district.  Today, China and the CCP grow stronger with an intent to go to war by  2027, and our military is experiencing record-low retention and record- low recruitment.   This is the reality of today for 335 million Americans under  President Joe Biden. It is a dark and scary reality. This Republican  majority here today in the House is the only firewall against the  damaging far-left policies of the Biden administration.   The single-subject appropriations bills that we were supposed to be  voting on this week will literally fight to reverse the darkness of  these realities and fight inflation, cut spending, secure our border,  while enhancing our Nation's security and investing in our soldiers at  a meaningful level.   Today, this body filled with people in fancy suits led by a few  Republicans who are running with scissors and supported by Democrats  who have personal issues with the Speaker, have uncertain intentions  and even more uncertain goals, and they have decided to make today  about drama. Today is not about solving problems and helping our  constituents but about drama.   We need to be the no-drama option for America--this party, this  majority. I fear that this self-inflicted drama of today jeopardizes  our majority and by definition removes the last layer of defense  protecting America from this Biden administration.   Let's dispense with the drama, do our jobs, and move on with  defending this beautiful country.
