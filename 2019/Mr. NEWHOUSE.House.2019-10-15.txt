 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as National Hispanic  Heritage Month comes to a close, to celebrate the Central Washington  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which is celebrating 10 years of service  to central Washington communities.   The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was formed to support Yakima  Valley's growing Latino business community. They work to develop a  professional network that fosters a thriving business environment,  encourages job development, and promotes business growth. Their diverse  membership is a testament to the range of positive contributions  Hispanic Americans and Latinos have on our central Washington  communities.   Last month, the chamber hosted ``Taco Fest,'' a celebration to mark  the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month with our friends and neighbors  throughout the Yakima Valley. They also, annually, hold the Estrella  Awards, which honor exemplary local Hispanic leaders and professionals.   I am proud to represent the Central Washington Hispanic Chamber of  Commerce and its members, whose work strengthens and improves our local  communities in the Yakima Valley. I urge all of my colleagues to help  me celebrate their 10-year anniversary, and I thank all who join me in  celebrating the contributions of Hispanic Americans and Latinos during  National Hispanic Heritage Month.                            ____________________
