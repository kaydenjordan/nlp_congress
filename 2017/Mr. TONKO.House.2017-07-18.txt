 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to express my strong opposition to H.R. 806, the  Ozone Standards Implementation Act, which would undermine the Clean Air  Act and the decades of progress that we have made to improve our  Nation's public health and air quality.   This bill delays implementation of the 2015 ozone standards until  2025, extends the review cycle for all National Ambient Air Quality  Standards from 5 to 10 years, and authorizes the EPA administrator to  consider technological feasibility when establishing or revising a  NAAQS.   Today, we will hear that removing health and environmental  protections creates jobs, despite all the evidence that protecting  public health and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive.   Since its enactment, the Clean Air Act has reduced key air pollutants  by roughly 70 percent, while the United States economy has more than  tripled.   We will hear today that our country has made enough progress, and we  will hear claims that further progress will be extremely difficult, if  not impossible, but this bill's supporters may not tell us that the  American Lung Association's 2017 State of the Air report found that  nearly 4 in 10 people in the United States live in counties that have  unhealthful levels of either ozone or particle pollution. Delaying  EPA's more protective health standards will only serve to delay these  Americans' access to guaranteed clean air.                                time  1445    I believe American ingenuity continues to be up to the task of  developing and deploying technologies that will protect our citizens.  History has shown again and again that meeting such basic health  protective standards is achievable. More importantly, advancing these  protections will make America more productive, more competitive, and  will improve quality of life and drive down public health costs tied to  asthma, heart disease, and even cancer.   We may hear today that standards change too frequently and EPA should  have more time to review and implement each standard. We will likely  not hear that EPA has discretion on these matters and is only tasked  with changing those standards if it will protect health.   Every year, more studies are completed. With each new study, we gain  an even better understanding of how ozone and other pollutants are  harming Americans' health. It is critical that these standards reflect  the latest available science.   What we are not likely to hear today is questioning of the large and  growing body of scientific and medical evidence that breathing air that  contains ozone and other criteria pollutants can cause serious health  effects.   Unfortunately, this bill would cast aside that scientific evidence in  favor of adding cost and technological feasibility considerations into  the standard setting process. The proposed changes to the Clean Air Act  will slow down, if not outright roll back, the progress we have made to  clean our air. This would be a giant mistake.   Healthier people means fewer sick days, fewer hospital visits, and  fewer premature deaths, all of which lead us to a more productive  society.   According to a peer-reviewed 2011 EPA study, in 2010 alone, the Clean  Air Act prevented over 160,000 premature deaths, 130,000 cases of heart  disease, 1.7 million asthma attacks, and a million more respiratory  illnesses. Many of those health benefits have helped our most  vulnerable populations, particularly our children.   Let's do this for our children. Let's not make it worse. Let's  improve our standards. That is why so many public health and medical  organizations and professionals have vocally opposed this bill every  step of the way.   The Clean Air Act keeps kids in school, adults at work and on the  job, and tens of thousands of Americans out of the emergency room each  and every year.   At a time when Republicans in Congress have been almost singularly  focused on ramming through legislation to repeal the Affordable Care  Act and rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, this  bill adds insult to injury. Plain and simple, the bill before us today  would undermine the Clean Air Act as a safeguard of our public health  law, and I encourage each and every Member of the House to oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just suggest that, when we move the  timeframe for accomplishment of our progress by 8 years out into the  future, we are stalling progress; and when we tamper with a review  every 5 years and make it 10, we are denying progress.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Cardenas).    Mr. Chairman, we have just heard from two colleagues from  Texas, and I want to remind all of my colleagues, our colleagues, that  the State of Texas has over 1.5 million residents with asthma,  including some 430,000 children. Weakening vital protections in the  Clean Air Act would put their health at risk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor).    Mr. Chairman, having just heard from the gentleman from  Arizona, I want to remind my colleagues that the State of Arizona has  over 660,000 residents with asthma, including some 175,000 children.  Weakening vital protections in the Clean Air Act would put their health  at risk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chair, having heard from my friend and colleague from  West Virginia, I want to remind my colleagues that the State of West  Virginia has 100,000 residents with asthma, including over 18,000  children. So it is weakening vital protections in the Clean Air Act  that would put these populations at risk.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I earlier stated, the State of Arizona has over 660,000 residents  with asthma, including 175,000 children; and I just question putting  their health at risk with this bill that moves us in the wrong  direction.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a number of supporting  documents. The first is a letter opposing the bill signed by the State  Attorneys General of New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware,  Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon,  Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and the District of  Columbia, and the Acting Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of  Environmental Protection.                                                     April 26, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 806, Ozone Standards Implementation Act           of 2017.       Hon. Greg Walden, Chairman,      Hon. Frank Pallone, Ranking Member,      Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walden and Representative Pallone: We       write in opposition to H.R. 806, Ozone Standards       Implementation Act of 2017. This bill would not only delay       implementation of more protective ozone air quality       standards, but, more broadly, would undermine the mandate in       the Clean Air Act (Act) that the national ambient air quality       standards for ozone and other criteria pollutants be based on       up-to-date scientific evidence and focus solely on protecting       public health and welfare. As explained below, these measures       would be a significant step backward in combatting the       dangers of ozone and other criteria pollutants.        Many of our states have struggled for decades with the       pervasive problem of ozone pollution. The scientific evidence       of harm to public health from ozone pollution is well       established, as are the economic consequences. At certain       concentration levels, ozone irritates the respiratory system,       causing coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and headaches.       People exposed to elevated levels of ozone suffer from lung       tissue damage, and aggravation of asthma, bronchitis, heart       disease, and emphysema. Children, older adults, people with       asthma or other lung diseases, and people who are active       outdoors are particularly susceptible to the harmful health       effects of ozone. Public health harms also exact an economic       toll. For example, increased hospital admissions on bad ozone       days increase health care costs borne by states and local       governments. Ozone pollution also harms public welfare by       damaging trees and reducing crop yields by interfering with       the ability of plants to produce and store food and making       them more susceptible to disease, insect pests, and other       stressors. Ozone can also inhibit the ability of plants and       trees to mitigate harms from climate change.        To protect against these and other adverse impacts and ``to       promote the public health and welfare and the productive       capacity of its population,'' the Act aims ``to protect and       enhance the quality of the Nation's air resources.'' 42       U.S.C. Sec. 7401(b)(1). To achieve this goal, the Act       requires EPA to adopt primary standards for certain criteria       pollutants, such as ozone, at a level that protects public       health with an ``adequate margin of safety.'' 42 U.S.C.       Sec. 7409(b)(1). The Act also requires EPA to adopt secondary       standards at a level that protects the public welfare from       ``any known or anticipated adverse effects.'' 42 U.S.C.       Sec. 7409(b)(2). The Act mandates that EPA review the air       quality standards for each criteria pollutant every five       years and revise the standards as advances in science       warrant. As Justice Scalia explained for a unanimous Supreme       Court, EPA's review must set the primary and secondary       standards based on the scientific evidence, and may not       consider implementation costs or other economic consequences.       Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 465 (2001).       Rather, implementation decisions are a matter for states,       which are empowered to evaluate the costs and co-benefits of       potential implementation strategies and determine, in light       of those costs and co-benefits, which strategies are most       suitable for them. See Union Elec. Corp. v. EPA, 427 U.S.       246, 266 (1976).        To ensure that our residents and natural resources enjoy       the benefits of the clean air that the statute demands, our       offices have advocated in rulemakings and litigation that EPA       set standards that protect public health and welfare with an       adequate margin of safety, as the Act requires. E.g.,       Mississippi v. EPA, 744 F.3d 1334 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (State       petitioners, including New York, California, Connecticut,       Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico,       Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia,       successfully argued for remand of secondary ozone standards);       American Farm Bureau Fed. v. EPA, 559 F.3d 512 (D.C. Cir.       2009) (State petitioners and amici, including New York,       California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland,       Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania Department of       Environmental Protection, Rhode Island, and the District of       Columbia, successfully argued for remand of primary fine       particulate matter standards); Murray Energy v. EPA (D.C.       Cir. 15-1385) (State amici., including California Air       Resources Board, Delaware Department of Natural Resources,       Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the       District of Columbia, filed a brief supporting the 2015       primary ozone standard against attempts to weaken it).        The ozone rule promulgated by EPA in 2015 strengthened the       primary standard of 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. 80       Fed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015). This level was at the high       end (i.e., less stringent) of the 65-70 ppb range that EPA       proposed in 2014. EPA's independent science advisors, the       Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, cautioned that this       level may offer little margin of safety, particularly for       sensitive subpopulations. Therefore, in comments on the       proposal, several of our states urged EPA to adopt a primary       standard lower than 70 ppb to protect public health with an       adequate margin of safety. However, even tightening the       standard from 75 ppb to 70 ppb will result in important       public health benefits. For example, EPA conservatively       estimated that meeting the 70 ppb standard nationally (not       including California) will result in net annual public health       benefits of up to $4.5 billion starting in 2025. These       national benefits include preventing approximately: 316 to       660 premature deaths; 230,000 asthma attacks in children;       160,000 missed school days; 28,000 missed work days; 630       asthma-related emergency room visits; and 340 cases of       acute bronchitis in children.        Under current law, states will develop and submit their own       plans to attain the 2015 standard by 2020 or 2021. But H.R.       806 would delay this deadline until October 2026 and delay       other similarly related deadlines, postponing even further       the life-saving benefits of attaining clean air. The bill       should be rejected on these grounds alone.        In addition, H.R. 806 would undermine the protection of       health and welfare from the dangers of all criteria air       pollutants by weakening the national ambient air quality       standards process for updating standards based on the most       recent scientific evidence. Instead of requiring that       standards be reviewed--and as necessary, revised--every five       years based on the latest scientific evidence on the harms to       public health and welfare from exposure to criteria       pollutants, H.R. 806 would require updates only once a       decade.        The bill would also eliminate the Act's requirement that       air quality standards be set solely based on adequate       protection of public health and welfare. Specifically, the       bill would authorize the EPA Administrator to also consider       ``likely technological feasibility'' in establishing primary       and secondary standards. This provision appears designed to       allow EPA to weaken standards nationwide if it thinks a       single area might be incapable of meeting them. But if that       were ever the case, the Act already provides relief       mechanisms for the affected area. In addition, the bill       undermines the Act's existing protections by creating a       loophole that allows EPA to treat hot or dry weather as an       ``exceptional event'' excusing an area's nonattainment.        Finally, the bill appears to be based on a misunderstanding       of the Act's balance between federal and state authority. The       bill directs EPA to cherry-pick hypothetical state       implementation strategies and only evaluate their adverse       side-effects, and, potentially, use that evaluation to weaken       ambient air quality standards. But EPA cannot know at the       time it sets standards what strategies states will choose, or       how individual states will value their beneficial side-      effects. Those considerations should remain separate from the       standard-setting process.        In summary, ozone pollution remains a serious and       persistent problem for our nation, posing a particular risk       to the health of children, the elderly and the sick, as well       as individuals who spend time outdoors. Because H.R. 806       would represent a significant step backward in combatting       ozone and other dangerous criteria pollutants, we urge you to  [[Page H5948]]       oppose the bill.

Office of the Commissioner, New York State Department of             Environmental Conservation,                                                        Albany, NY.      Re H.R. 806, Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017.       Hon. John Shimkus, Chairman,      Subcommittee on the Environment, Committee on Energy and           Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul D. Tonko, Ranking Member,      Subcommittee on the Environment, Committee on Energy and           Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Chair Shimkus and Representative Tonko: The       State of New York strongly opposes the ``Ozone Standards       Implementation Act of 2017,'' which will substantially harm       public health to the detriment of New Yorkers and residents       of many other states. The proposed bill would restrict the       efficacy of the Clean Air Act in a way that would delay       implementation of critical health-based standards for       protecting the public from harmful ground-level ozone and       other dangerous air pollutants. The result of this proposed       bill would be the significant postponement of health and       environmental benefits for nearly a decade, inevitably       resulting in increased illness and deaths from air pollution.                                 Introduction         The Clean Air Act (``Act'') addresses the critically       important issue of protecting the health and welfare of all       Americans from excessive levels of air pollution. It       establishes a federal-state partnership under which EPA,       informed by established science, sets National Ambient Air       Quality Standards (NAAQS) at a level necessary to protect       public health, and states develop and implement plans for       achieving those standards. This collaborative process has       significantly reduced pollutant concentrations to the great       benefit of the public. Importantly, the process provided by       the sections 109 and 110 of the Act recognizes that air       pollution knows no boundaries and that air quality in many       states, including New York, is impacted by emissions from       sources located upwind.        Section 109 of the Act ensures that implementation of the       Act is guided by established science; it charges the Clean       Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) with reviewing the       latest ``state of the science'' relating to public and       environmental health, and conveying its findings to the       Administrator. Based on that information, the Administrator       establishes the NAAQS at a level necessary to protect public       health within a reasonable margin of safety. Under Section       110 of the Act, States then develop plans to achieve air       quality that meets the standard in those areas that do not       meet the standard, known as ``nonattainment'' areas.        In its latest review, CASAC determined that the existing       2008 ozone NAAQS was insufficiently protective of public       health, particularly for at-risk groups including children,       older adults, people of all ages who have lung diseases such       as asthma, and people who are active outdoors. Based on       CASAC's scientific findings, EPA determined that implementing       the 2015 ozone NAAQS would help prevent a range of harmful       health effects each year, including 320 to 660 premature       deaths; 230,000 asthma attacks in children; 160,000 days when       kids miss school; 28,000 missed work days; 630 asthma-related       emergency room visits; and 340 cases of acute bronchitis in       children. EPA has identified additional serious health       threats from ozone including cardiovascular disease (e.g.,       heart attacks, strokes, heart disease, congestive heart       failure); potential harm to the central nervous system; and       potential reproductive and developmental harm. The health       benefits from meeting the 2015 ozone NAAQS exceed the costs       of controls by 2 to 4 times.        Like many other states, New York strongly supported EPA's       strengthening of the ozone NAAQS in 2015. This support comes       even though New York faces a substantial burden of achieving       ozone attainment in the New York City metropolitan area.       This-burden, however, is outweighed by the need to address       the serious public health impacts. In New York City,       approximately 1 in 10 emergency room visits for asthma are       attributable to ozone pollution. Rather than seek to delay       its ozone attainment efforts, New York strives to bring the       New York City metropolitan area into attainment as       expeditiously as possible, in order to provide its residents       with cleaner and more healthful air to breathe.           Delaying public health benefits of the 2015 ozone NAAQS         The proposed legislation would harm public health by       delaying the implementation of the 2015 ozone NAAQS (and its       corresponding health benefits) for eight years and further       postponing any future standard for several years beyond when       they are necessary. Current law requires EPA to designate       states under the 2015 ozone NAAQS according to their       monitored air quality by October 2017, and states not meeting       the standards would have a number of years to reach       compliance proportional to the severity of their ozone       problems. However, this legislation would defer action so       that designations would not be made until October 2025, thus       postponing even the beginning of planning efforts until after       attainment would otherwise have been achieved under the       current structure of the Act. For New Yorkers and other       Americans, this would result in a substantial delay in their       ability to breathe clean and healthful air.        Even worse, this proposed bill compounds this public health       harm by allowing the construction of new power plants and       factories without considering their impact on a region's       ability to achieve compliance with the NAAQS. Under current       law, such new and modified facilities located in areas       designated nonattainment are subject to a control technology       review under the Clean Air Act's nonattainment new source       review program, which requires a demonstration of control       technology that would consider the ``lowest achievable       emission rate,'' resulting in the most stringent emission       limit for a certain source class. This bill would eliminate       these new source reviews, which are critical for advancing a       nonattainment area toward NAAQS compliance.        Together, these aspects of the legislation will have even       worse additional adverse impacts on states like New York that       are victimized by upwind air pollution. First, this       legislation will impair New York's relief from ozone       transport from upwind locations. EPA modeling indicates that       between 75% and 94% of the ozone in the New York City       metropolitan area comes from sources outside of New York.       Although New York will continue actions to reduce emission of       ozone precursors, it cannot achieve healthful ozone levels       without a substantial reduction in emissions from states       located upwind, which are responsible for most of New York's       ozone levels. Many of these states encompass areas that are       currently monitoring as nonattainment, and these areas would       have to achieve emission reductions under current law if       designated nonattainment. Postponing a nonattainment       designation for the New York City metropolitan area will have       the unacceptable effect of postponing the ``good neighbor''       obligation of upwind areas to reduce their significant       contribution to New York's nonattainment until sometime after       the nonattainment designation.        Moreover, postponing compliance with nonattainment New       Source Review in areas that would otherwise be designated as       nonattainment with the ozone NAAQS establishes an inequitable       outcome for New York and other states that have already been       designated nonattainment. Under this proposed bill, new       industrial facilities in areas currently designated       nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS or in the Ozone       Transport Region--including all of New York--will have to       comply with nonattainment NSR requirements, yet facilities       located in regions with comparable or worse air quality and       much higher emissions will not have to do so for a decade or       more. As such, states that would otherwise be designated       nonattainment would gain an unfair advantage in attracting       business development under this bill.  [[Page H5949]]        Delaying public health benefits from reducing other criteria pollutants         Aside from ozone, provisions of this proposed bill would       affect future NAAQS reviews for all criteria pollutants, thus       compounding negative public health impacts. For example, the       bill would irresponsibly extend the NAAQS review time from       five years to ten for all criteria pollutants. Retaining the       five-year review schedule ensures that the Administrator       reviews the relevant state of the science while it is timely       and germane. Health science moves quickly; by the time one       NAAQS revision is reaching completion, other pertinent       clinical studies are being published.        This proposed bill weakens public health protection by       making cost and technological feasibility larger factors in       the establishment and implementation of NAAQS. The Supreme       Court has already upheld the notion that the consideration of       costs has no place in the setting of a NAAQS (Whitman v.       American Trucking Associations, Inc., 2001). Instead,       questions of technological and economic feasibility are       considered at the stage of implementing the NAAQS. For       example, the Act's nonattainment area classifications       recognize that areas with more difficult ozone pollution       problems require more time to comply. Unfortunately, Section       3(b) of the proposed bill would change the long-standing       practice of how an Administrator determines the NAAQS by       allowing him or her to analyze, as a secondary consideration,       the likely technological feasibility of a revised NAAQS.       Section 3(c) would expand CASAC's role to providing advice to       the Administrator on adverse economic effects (among others)       prior to the setting of the NAAQS. Taken together, these       proposed revisions would have the effect that NAAQS would no       longer be set at levels that are protective of public health       and welfare.        Finally, the proposed bill unnecessarily redefines ordinary       expected conditions as ``exceptional events'' that need not       be considered by a state in demonstrating attainment. The       intent of the ``extraordinary event'' exception is to allow a       state to discount NAAQS exceedances that result from one-      time, unpredictable, and uncontrollable events such as       wildfires. The proposal, however, would allow commonplace       conditions such as stagnant air masses and ``meteorological       event[s] involving high temperatures or lack of       precipitation'' to be considered exceptional. In their ozone       planning, states should anticipate these conditions, which       are expected to occur each year and promote the formation of       ozone when public health is at the greatest risk.        We also disagree with the proposal to allow sources to       avoid nonattainment new source review until release of the       implementation guidance. EPA's delay in issuing guidance       should not be an excuse to allow new sources in nonattainment       areas to contribute to further air quality degradation. In       addition, the bill's reduction of the time allotted for       states to formulate and submit attainment plans from the       current three years to one year reflects a misunderstanding       of the laborious process for developing these plans.                                  Conclusion         The Clean Air Act is a bipartisan success story. Citizens       across the country have benefited from the Act's clean air       requirements over the last few decades. People can breathe       easier due to the clean air standards that have resulted from       rigorous reviews that are guided by the latest scientific       evidence. Passage of this proposed bill would deprive the       American people of those benefits, worsen air quality and       harm public health substantially.            Sincerely,                                                      Basil Seggos.     Mr. Chairman, the third document I include in the Record  is a letter signed by 15 medical and public health organizations,  again, opposing the bill.                                                      July 17, 2017.        Dear Representative: Clean air is fundamental for good       health, and the Clean Air Act promises all Americans air that       is safe to breathe. The undersigned public health and medical       organizations urge you to oppose H.R. 806, the so-called       ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017.'' A more       fitting name for this legislation would be the ``Smoggy Skies       Act,'' as it delays lifesaving standards to reduce ozone       pollution, or smog, and permanently weakens the Clean Air       Act.        Clear, up-to-date, scientific evidence documented the need       for greater protection from ozone pollution, and drove the       stronger limit on ozone that the U.S. Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) finalized in 2015. To meet the       updated standard, the states have clear authority and plenty       of time to plan and then work to reduce pollution under the       Clean Air Act's long-established, balanced implementation       timeline. Despite those facts, the Smoggy Skies Act imposes       additional delays and sweeping changes that will threaten       health, particularly the health of children, seniors and       people with chronic disease.        The Smoggy Skies Act also reaches far beyond implementation       of the current ozone standards. It permanently weakens the       Clean Air Act and future air pollution health standards for       all criteria pollutants. Specifically, the Smoggy Skies Act       weakens implementation and enforcement of all lifesaving air       pollution health standards, including those for carbon       monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter,       and sulfur dioxide. It would also permanently undermine the       Clean Air Act as a public health law.        The Clean Air Act requires that EPA review the science on       the health impacts of carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen       dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide air       pollutants every five years and update these national ambient       air quality standards according to the current science. The       Smoggy Skies Act would lengthen the review period of the air       pollution health standards from once every five years to once       every ten years for all criteria pollutants. As the science       continues to evolve, the public deserves that their       protections be based on the most up-to-date science,       certainly not a schedule that is twice as long as they       currently have under the law. The work that EPA and states do       to clean up air pollution should be based on the best and       most current science.        Emerging research adds crucial information to our       understanding of the impacts that air pollution has on human       health, and EPA should not have to wait a decade to       incorporate it. For example, on March 29, 2016, a newly       published study, Particulate Matter Exposure and Preterm       Birth: Estimates of U.S. Attributable Burden and Economic       Costs showed new information linking particulate air       pollution to nearly 16,000 preterm births per year. Under the       Smoggy Skies Act, EPA would have to wait as much as a decade       to consider such new evidence when setting standards. Ten       years is far too long to wait to protect public health from       levels of pollution that the science shows are dangerous or       for EPA to consider new information.        In the 2015 review of the ozone standard, EPA examined an       extensive body of scientific evidence demonstrating that       ozone inflames the lungs, causing asthma attacks and       resulting in emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and       premature deaths. A growing body of research indicates that       ozone may also lead to central nervous system harm and may       harm developing fetuses. In response to the evidence, EPA       updated the ozone standards. While many of our organizations       called for a more protective level, there is no doubt that       the updated, 70 parts per billion standard provides greater       health protections compared to the previous standard.        The Smoggy Skies Act would delay implementation of these       more protective air pollution standards for at least eight       years. This means eight years of illnesses and premature       deaths that could have been avoided. Parents will not be told       the truth about pollution in their community and states and       EPA will not work to curb pollution to meet the new       standards. The public has a fundamental right to know when       pollution in the air they breathe or the water they drink       threatens health, and Congress must not add eight years of       delay to health protections and cleanup.        Furthermore, the American public overwhelmingly supports       upholding these more protective limits on ozone. A 2017 poll       found that by a 2-to-1 margin, Americans believe Congress       should leave EPA's updated standards in place, showing clear       public opposition to the Smoggy Skies Act.        The Smoggy Skies Act would also permanently weaken       implementation of the 2015 and future ozone standards. The       Act would delay implementation to a date when the evidence       shows that most states would meet the standard with cleanup       measures already in place. It would also reduce requirements       for areas with the most dangerous levels of ozone. Areas       classified as being in ``extreme nonattainment'' of the       standard would no longer need to write plans that include       additional contingency measures if their initial plans fail       to provide the expected pollution reductions. The Clean Air       Act prioritizes reducing air pollution to protect the       public's health, but the Smoggy Skies Act opens a new       opportunity for communities to avoid cleaning up,       irrespective of the health impacts.        Further, the bill would greatly expand the definition of an       exceptional event. Under the Clean Air Act, communities can       demonstrate to EPA that an exceptional event, such as a       wildfire, should not ``count'' in determining whether their       air quality meets the national standards. This bill would       recklessly expand the definition of exceptional events to       include high pollution days when the air is simply stagnant--      the precise air pollution episodes the Clean Air Act was       designed to combat--and declare those bad air days as       ``exceptional.'' Changing the accounting rules will undermine       health protection and avoid pollution cleanup.        Additionally, the bill would permanently weaken the Clean       Air Act. The Clean Air Act is one of our nation's premier       public health laws because it puts health first. The Act has       a two-step process: first, EPA considers scientific evidence       to decide how much air pollution is safe to breathe and sets       the standard that is requisite to protect public health with       an adequate margin of safety. Then, states work with EPA to       develop a plan to clean up air pollution to meet the       standard. Cost and feasibility are fully considered in the       second phase during implementation of the standard.        This bill states that if EPA finds that ``a range of       levels'' of an air pollutant protect public health with an       adequate margin of safety, then EPA may consider       technological feasibility in choosing a limit within that  [[Page H5950]]       range. Further, the bill would interject implementation       considerations, including projections of adverse economic and       energy effects, into the standard setting process. These       changes will permanently weaken the core health-based premise       of the Clean Air Act--protecting the public from known health       effects of air pollution with a margin of safety.        These changes would reverse the intention of the Clean Air       Act explicitly included by its bipartisan authors in       Congress: that basing the standard on the protection of       public health would push technology to develop new tools and       techniques to reduce emissions. They understood that pushing       the cleanup technology to meet the urgent need to protect       health would help to expand job development and growth. They       were correct, as the emission control industry today has       helped the nation meet stronger standards in creative, cost-      effective ways.        The text also explicitly states that the Smoggy Skies Act       does not authorize any additional funds to be appropriated to       EPA for its work carrying out the bill's provisions. Forcing       EPA to perform the additional work of implementing this bill       with no additional resources could put the agency's current,       lifesaving work at further risk.        Finally, an amendment adopted in committee would eliminate       key enforcement provisions under the Clean Air Act. As       amended, the bill could perpetuate poor air quality in       communities with the highest pollution levels indefinitely.       The provision waives the obligation for states with areas       heavily polluted by ozone or particulate matter to write       effective plans to attain the health standards. Currently, if       an area with unhealthy air fails to write an adequate plan to       meet air pollution standards, EPA can impose sanctions.       Because that enforcement provision exists, EPA has almost       never needed to use it--states wrote effective plans. As       amended, the Smoggy Skies Act would bar EPA from using this       key enforcement tool for especially polluted areas,       essentially eliminating the obligation for states to write a       meaningful pollution cleanup plan that can demonstrate       meeting the health standards.        The Smoggy Skies Act is a sweeping attack on lifesaving       standards that protect public health from air pollution. This       bill is an extreme attempt to undermine our nation's proven       clean air health protections. Not only does it delay the       long-overdue updated ozone standards and weaken their       implementation and enforcement, it also permanently weakens       the health protections against many dangerous air pollutants       and the scientific basis of Clean Air Act standards.        Please prioritize the health of your constituents and vote       NO on the Smoggy Skies Act.            Sincerely,      Allergy & Asthma Network      Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments      American Academy of Pediatrics      American Lung Association      American Public Health Association      American Thoracic Society      Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America      Center for Climate Change and Health      Children's Environmental Health Network      Health Care Without Harm      National Association of County & City Health Officials      National Environmental Health Association      National Medical Association      Physicians for Social Responsibility      Trust for America's Health.     Finally, Mr. Chairman, I include a letter signed by 121  environmental and other groups opposing the bill.                                                     March 21, 2017.        Dear Senator/Representative, on behalf of our millions of       members, the undersigned 121 organizations urge you to oppose       the ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act'' (H.R. 806, S.       263). The innocuous-sounding name is misleading: this       legislation would actually systematically weaken the Clean       Air Act without a single improvement, undermine Americans'       46-year right to healthy air based on medical science, and       delay life-saving health standards already years overdue.        This bill's vision of ``Ozone Standards Implementation''       eliminates health benefits and the right to truly safe air       that Americans enjoy under today's law. First, the       legislation would delay for ten years the right to safer air       quality, and even the simple right to know if the air is safe       to breathe. Corporations applying for air pollution permits       would be free to ignore new ground-level ozone (aka smog)       health standards during these additional ten years. For the       first time the largest sources of air pollution would be       allowed to exceed health standards. The bill would also       outright excuse the parts of the country suffering the worst       smog pollution from having backup plans if they do not reduce       pollution. The most polluted parts of the country should not       stop doing everything they can to protect their citizens'       health and environment by cleaning up smog pollution.        This bill is not content to merely weaken and delay       reductions in smog pollution. It also strikes at our core       right to clean air based on health and medical science. The       medically-based health standards that the law has been       founded on for 46 years instead could become a political       football weakened by polluter compliance costs. This could       well result in communities being exposed to unhealthy levels       of smog and soot and sulfur dioxide and even toxic lead       pollution. The bill would also double the law's five-year       review periods for recognizing the latest science and       updating health standards, which are already frequently years       late; this means in practice that unhealthy air would persist       for longer than ten years.        The legislation also weakens implementation of current       clean air health standards. The bill expands exemptions for       ``exceptional events'' that are not counted towards       compliance with health standards for air quality, even when       air pollution levels are unsafe. This will mean more unsafe       air more often, with no responsibility to clean it up.       Requirements meant to ensure progress toward reducing smog       and soot pollution would shift from focusing on public health       and achievability to economic costs. Despite the bland name       ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act,'' this bill represents       an extreme attack on the most fundamental safeguards and       rights in the Clean Air Act.        Since 1970, the Federal Clean Air Act has been organized       around one governing principle--that the EPA must set health       standards based on medical science for dangerous air       pollution, including smog, soot and lead, that protect all       Americans, with ``an adequate margin of safety'' for       vulnerable populations like children, the elderly and       asthmatics. This legislation eviscerates that principle and       protection. We urge you to oppose H.R. 806 and S. 263, to       protect our families and Americans' rights to clean air.

[[Page H5951]]                                      time  1515     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Chair, two points on the review and the standards.  Certainly not every review would require a change in standards, and I  think that needs to be made clear here. When we talk about the  difficulty of having to respond or achieve the standards that have been  established and then they go stronger, well, on your way to 70 parts  per billion, you are going to be moving through 75 parts per billion as  you reduce those particulates that get emitted into our air. It is only  logical that you could move along and continue to improve those  standards.   This is about maintaining a quality of life, enhancing a quality of  life, cutting into, for public health policy purposes, the devastating  impacts of air pollutants and their relation to our public health.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Barragan).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I want to remind my colleagues, having just heard from a  Californian, that California has nearly 3 million residents with  asthma, including 650,000 children. Why on Earth would we want to put  them at further risk by going backward? I suggest that we keep that in  mind as we vote on this measure.   I heard the comment made about unachievable or unrealistic standards.  Well, how is it that we have been making progress through the years? We  have been growing jobs, and we have been cleaning the air. How is it  that that was deemed unrealistic and unachievable?   Mr. Chairman, I believe in the pioneer spirit of this great country.  I believe in her intellect. I believe in the passion to do the right  thing. And I think that will continue to motivate us as we listen to  scientists who tell us about the standards that we ought to achieve.   On our way to 75 parts per billion, we know that it is continued  progress if we achieve 70; and if we listen to the Clean Air Scientific  Advisory Committee, they will tell us that the air, for safety, with  the safety factor, we should be closer to 60. So we have much more room  for progress, and we have the technological wizardry to make that  happen. Our children and generations unborn are counting on us.   As has been stated many times over today, this is a move in a  backward direction. We are concerned on this side of the aisle about  H.R. 806. We need to know that the standards that are out there are  achievable, that those standards drive technological improvement.   We can grow the economy and clean the air. They are not mutually  exclusive. In fact, we have proven that they are inclusive.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this effort of  opposition to H.R. 806. It is, as many have called it, an effort that  will continue to hold back progress.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment strikes subsection (b) of section  3, which would allow the EPA to consider technological feasibility when  determining what level of pollution is safe.   Health-based standards are the cornerstone of the Clean Air Act-- health-based. The EPA sets NAAQS at levels sufficient to protect the  public health, essentially, the level of ambient air pollution that is  safe to breathe.   While costs are not considered in establishing these standards, costs  can be--and are considered--in developing plans to achieve the  necessary pollution reductions to meet the standards.   Unfortunately, H.R. 806, as currently drafted, would change the  longstanding criteria for establishing an air quality standard from one  that is based solely on protecting public health to one that includes a  consideration of the technological feasibility. This issue has been  long debated and settled by Congress.   Since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, including the 1990 Clean  Air Act Amendments, Congress has excluded technological feasibility  considerations from standard setting to ensure that public health--and  public health alone--would determine the standards for air quality.   In 1970, on the passage of the Clean Air Act, Senator Ed Muskie from  Maine said: ``The first responsibility of Congress is not the making of  technological or economic judgments--or even to be limited by what is  or appears to be technologically or economically infeasible. Our  responsibility is to establish what the public interest requires to  protect the health of persons. This may mean that people and industries  will be asked to do what seems to be impossible at present time. But if  health is to be protected, these challenges must be met.''   For approaching five decades, that has been the guiding tenet of the  Clean Air Act: what is in the betterment of public health.   Guided by this principle, our Nation has experienced a 70 percent  reduction in key air pollutants while tripling the size of the economy.   I believe that a great deal of this success can be credited to  American innovation. Despite assertions that achieving clean air was  not feasible, American ingenuity has consistently risen  [[Page H5957]]  to the challenge and made our country the leader in both clean air and  clean air technology.   Unquestionably, these standards have driven innovation, creating a  thriving domestic pollution control industry.   So I ask my colleagues who are in favor of this measure: What is it  about a can-do attitude that you don't get? Why is it that you have a  lack of trust in the power of American ingenuity?   Had these standards not been ambitious and focused solely on public  health, we may still be relying upon the technology from the 1970s and  breathing the poor air quality from that era along with it.   Available technologies cannot and should not determine what we can  have in terms of clean air. Let's have the scientific and medical  experts guide us, and I have confidence that our engineers and  innovators will find that way. The history of those protections that we  enjoy has been to set ambitious, but achievable, goals. We have  achieved those goals, and we have much cleaner air to show for it.  Let's not roll back this process.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think the insertion of discretion of the  Administrator at the EPA as to the technological and economical  availability, achievable qualities being inserted into this bill tells  me--my interpretation is that the Administrator may not--the  Administrator may not, may not--side with the residents--with the  people of this country and their right to breathe clean air.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
