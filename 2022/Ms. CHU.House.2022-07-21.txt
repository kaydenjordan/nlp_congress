 Madam Speaker, as the chair of the Contraception and Family  Planning Task Force of the Pro-Choice Caucus and as a woman who lives  in America, I rise today in strong support of the Right to  Contraception Act, which would ensure every American has the federally  protected right to access the birth control method that works for them.   Birth control is healthcare, plain and simple, and it is critical to  women's health and women's equality. And no one--not the Supreme Court,  not Congress, not your boss--should be able to interfere with your  family decisions.   We have seen just how far this Court of unelected Justices will go to  erode our constitutionally protected rights, which is why I am proud to  support this very necessary bill today to create a Federal right for  providers to provide and patients to receive contraceptive services.   Madam Speaker, it is of great urgency that this House pass this  critical bill today and afford us the agency to make our own healthcare  decisions.
