 Madam President, Amy Coney Barrett's first Judiciary  Committee hearing back in 2017 has become infamous for the grilling she  underwent for her religion.   Then, as now, she was an outstanding choice who received a rating of  ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association and praise from  peers on both sides of the political spectrum.   But despite her superb qualifications, it soon became clear that more  than one Democrat thought she couldn't be objective and thus shouldn't  be confirmed to the court simply because she was a practicing Catholic  who took her faith seriously.   ``The dogma lives loudly within you,'' the Democratic ranking member  on the Judiciary Committee said, ``and that is of concern.''   ``Do you consider yourself an orthodox Catholic?'' the Democratic  whip asked, while the junior Senator from Hawaii suggested that Judge  Barrett would use her Catholic faith rather than the law to decide  questions.   And while Democrats toned down the anti-religious questioning in  Judge Barrett's Supreme Court hearing last week, apparently realizing  that openly displaying their suspicion of her religion might offend the  tens of millions of American voters who take their faith seriously,  their suspicion of her faith has still been on display.   Meanwhile, Democrats' media allies haven't hesitated to trot out  articles on Judge Barrett's beliefs, usually with the faint--or in some  cases not so faint--suggestion that her adherence to the teachings of  the Catholic Church cast doubt on her fitness for the Supreme Court.   Yesterday's AP article on the fact that Judge Barrett served as a  trustee at her children's Christian school--not exactly breaking news,  as it was something that Judge Barrett had already disclosed--was just  one more example of the media's implicit suggestion that the nominee's  religion makes her unfit for public office.   As a side note, I am still waiting for bipartisan condemnation of  media coverage of Judge Barrett's adopted children. Somehow the New  York Times felt that Judge Barrett's brief mentions of her adopted  children at her introduction and hearing warranted an article full of  unsavory insinuations. I am wondering if Democrats would have found  this appropriate coverage of a Democratic nominee's children.   From the attitude displayed by Democrats and the media, you would  think that Judge Barrett was a member of some remote and bizarre  religious cult instead of one of the largest faith groups in the world.   And Judge Barrett has not been the only judicial nominee subjected to  [[Page S6387]]  scrutiny for her faith. The Democrats' Vice Presidential candidate  grilled one judicial nominee on his membership in the Knights of  Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization known for dangerous  activities like selling Christmas trees and providing coats for kids in  need and partnering with other dangerous charities like Habitat for  Humanity and Special Olympics.   Nor is this kind of suspicion of practicing Catholics and other  Christians limited to the judicial realm. Democrats' suspicion of  religious court nominees is just one feature of the left's growing  hostility to religion generally.   More and more, Democrats and liberals are telling religious Americans  that they should close their mouths and restrict their religion to the  privacy of their homes.   In September, the former Democratic Presidential candidate, Hillary  Clinton, suggested that Christianity has become ``judgmental'' and  ``alienating.''   One of the current Democratic Presidential candidate's staffers  recently said that she doesn't think orthodox Catholics, Muslims, or  Jews should sit on the Supreme Court.   The current Vice Presidential candidate introduced legislation in  this Congress to weaken the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a key  law intended to protect Americans' right to live out their religion.   And forget religious liberty under a Democratic administration. The  Democratic Presidential candidate has publicly announced that if he  becomes President, he intends to go after the Little Sisters of the  Poor--an order of nuns who spend their lives caring for the elderly  poor--to force them--to force them--to offer a health insurance  provision that violates their religious faith.   That is right. The Democrats' Presidential candidate has proudly  announced that his administration will do the heroic work of pursuing a  group of nuns who serve the poor to ensure that they are not allowed to  fully live out their religious beliefs.   Where to start? Perhaps I should start by noting what should be  obvious--that hostility to religion is fundamentally un-American.  America was founded on religious liberty. Long before the Declaration  of Independence or the Constitution was signed, people came to these  shores seeking the right to practice their religion in freedom, and  that concern for religious liberty continued through the founding.   Religious freedom was regarded as so fundamental that it is the very  first freedom mentioned in the Bill of Rights. ``Congress shall make no  law respecting an establishment of religion,'' the Bill of Rights  begins, ``or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''   Now, some have interpreted references to religion in the Constitution  to somehow mean that the Founders were looking to preference secularism  over religion and exclude religion from the public square. Nothing  could be further from the truth. Far from wanting to diminish the place  of religion or exclude it from public life, the Founders saw religion  as something to be fostered. In fact, religion was widely regarded as  an essential ingredient in producing good citizens--the kinds of  citizens who could maintain the republican government the Constitution  had created.   To quote George Washington:         Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political       prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.       In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who       should labor to subvert these great pillars of human       happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and       citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man,       ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not       trace all their connections with private and public felicity.    Democrats would like to reduce freedom of religion to a grudging  toleration and religious people to second-class citizens. That is not  what religious freedom has meant in America. In America, religious  freedom has always been a robust freedom--permission to live out your  faith not just in the confines of your home but in the public square.   I find it the height of irony that critiques of religious people like  Amy Coney Barrett focus on the supposed dogmatism or intolerance of  religious individuals because there are few people as dogmatic and  intolerant as members of the left wing in America.   Remember when the Women's March was founded at the start of the  current administration? More than one pro-life group wanted to join the  march and stand for women's rights, but they were quickly kicked off  the march's list of partners because the grand pooh-bahs of the pro- abortion left have decided that you can't stand for the dignity of both  mother and child and still be a feminist.   It is pretty much the same in the Democratic Party. While a few pro- life Democrats are tolerated in spots where Democrats might not  otherwise win, the pro-life Democrat is on the way to extinction at the  party level. Last year, for example, the Democratic Attorneys General  Association announced that it would not endorse or finance candidates  who do not support abortion. So I find it the height of irony when  Democrats complain about the supposed dogmatism of religious  individuals.   Do Democrats evince the same concerns about dogmatism when avidly  pro-abortion or avidly secular individuals are nominated to the Federal  bench, or do they assume that these individuals can set aside their  beliefs and rule fairly in cases involving abortion or religion? I am  pretty sure they assume these individuals will be able to rule fairly  according to the law. Yet they deny this respect to religious  individuals. Instead, Democrats offer the demeaning and insulting  suggestion that religious people alone are incapable of setting aside  their personal beliefs.   I would like to see the attacks on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's faith  stop, but more than that, I would like to see the Democratic Party  return to a deeper respect for religion and the central place of a  robust religious freedom in American life. I would like to be confident  that future nominees will not face the suggestion that their faith  should prohibit them from participation in the public sphere.   President Obama once spoke of working-class Americans as bitter  individuals who cling to their religion. Needless to say, he didn't  mean it in a positive way, but he should have. Many great Americans  have clung to their religion and been inspired by it to do great  things, from serving the needy to fighting for the oppressed. America  has been made better by individuals who cling to their faith.   I look forward to seeing the great things that are to come from  religious Americans serving in the public square, and we can start by  confirming the eminently qualified Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme  Court   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Florida (Mr. Rubio).
