 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aldelmo Camacho  on the occasion of his 100th birthday.   Aldelmo, commonly referred to as Al, was born in Puerto Rico on May  14, 1923, the youngest of 10 children.   In 1942, at age 19, he joined the Army where he became a surgical  technician. After he was discharged in 1945, Al finished school and  later married his wife, Tina. The couple welcomed two daughters, Ida  and Lillian.   Shortly after the birth of his younger child in 1950, Al moved to  Amsterdam, New York, and was shortly joined by his wife and two  daughters.   Over these last 53 years, he has remained in Amsterdam where he has  helped establish and lead the Spanish American Club where he can often  be  [[Page H2333]]  found playing dominoes, one of his favorite pastimes.   I thank Al for his friendship, liveliness, and character which have  had such a great and positive impact on the city of Amsterdam.   Feliz cumpleanos. Happy birthday, Al.                            ____________________
