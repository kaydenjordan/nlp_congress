 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Massachusetts for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in Joe Biden's America, 70 percent of Americans  describe this economy as poor. It is not hard to see why that is.   Inflation is at a 31-year high. This makes it harder for everyday  Americans to purchase everyday items. It is also wiping out wages.   Gas prices alone are at a 7-year high.   American families are facing the most expensive Thanksgiving on  record.   The backlog of ships that are waiting to deliver goods has grown by  43 percent since President Biden promised to fix our supply chain  crisis last month.   Yet, here we are, about to consider the most expensive bill in  American history. We are doing this instead of addressing the real  problems that are facing real Americans.   Democrats are now doubling down on their failed tax and spend  policies that will make Joe Biden's economic crisis even worse than it  is now.   President Biden once said: ``Show me your budget, and I will tell you  what you value.'' Well, the bill before us today makes one thing clear:  Democrats value millionaires and billionaires over blue-collar workers  and American families.   The Democrats' Big Government socialist spending spree provides tax  cuts of up to $25,900 for millionaires, home buying and childcare  subsidies for couples making over $200,000, and electric vehicle  subsidies for couples who bring in more than half a million dollars a  year.   Those are the values of my colleagues across the aisle. In total,  there are $250 billion in tax breaks for the top 1 percent.   Who will be paying for the wealthy to buy a new mansion or maybe put  a new Tesla in their five-car garage? That is easy. It is going to be  middle-class Americans, working families who have to subsidize these  extravagances.   The left-leaning Tax Policy Center found this bill would raise taxes  on middle-class Americans by 30 percent. That doesn't even factor in  the hidden tax of inflation that is over 6 percent now.   This tax scheme will also destroy up to 1 million U.S. jobs.   Just like millionaires and billionaires, China benefits from this  bill, thanks to a ban on domestic mineral production and policies that  make it better for foreign businesses to manufacture outside the United  States rather than right here in America.   Far-left news organizations also luck out with a new tax cut, while  millions of illegal immigrants will be granted amnesty and will be  eligible for $45,000 a year in government benefits.   Butterflies, freshwater mussels, and desert fish also receive  millions of dollars in this bill. There is also $2.5 billion for so- called tree equity.   How about middle-class Americans? We already know that they will be  paying more in taxes and seeing fewer economic opportunities. But,  surely, there is something in this bill for them.   Well, for starters, Democrats are hiring 87,000 new IRS agents to spy  on their bank accounts. Their proposal will double the chance of being  audited, with nearly half of all audits hitting families making less  than $75,000 a year.   The Democrats are also implementing Big Government socialist price  control schemes on prescription drugs, meaning that fewer cures and  fewer treatments will be available for seniors and patients.   Also, thanks to a natural gas tax and more than $550 billion spent on  Green New Deal policies, Americans can expect to pay higher prices for  home heating costs, electricity rates, and gas prices. Keep in mind  that heating bills are already expected to be up as much as 54 percent  for some American households this winter.   So if President Biden's words are true and a budget is demonstrative  of values, then it is very clear what my friends across the aisle  value, and that is millionaires and billionaires, illegal immigrants,  bugs and fish, and even this concept of tree equity.   Those are the values that are prioritized in this budget over the  concerns and needs of everyday Americans, working-class and middle- class families.   The Democrats' Big Government socialist spending scam is full of far- left priorities and will further fuel the highest inflation and the  highest spike in prices that we have seen in four decades. Sadly, it is  going to be American workers, job creators, and families who will be  forced to foot this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to cite something. While campaigning for  the White House last year, President Biden repeatedly, repeatedly  stressed that he would not directly raise taxes on individuals making  below $400,000.   Information in an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation  released Tuesday showed that the House version of President Biden's  bill will start raising taxes as early as 2023 on middle-class  families.   Additionally, tax increases fall heaviest on the lower and middle  class, while the super-wealthy receive a generous tax cut until at  least 2025.   I know my good friend from Colorado was talking about wages  increasing. What is not being considered is that if wages are not  increasing at the amount of inflation, people are actually having less  purchasing power. So unless your wages have increased by 6.2 percent,  your money earned is actually not what it was just a month or two or  three ago.   So, yes, wages may be rising, but they are not keeping pace with  inflation, so everyday Americans are paying what economists call the  invisible tax of inflation, which hurts working-class and middle-class  families the most, particularly when you look at the amount they have  to pay for gas prices, which are at a 7-year high. By the way, the last  time gas prices were this high, President Biden was again in the White  House.   Additionally, something to consider, the budget resolution has three  committees that are well over the budget resolution amount, which I  believe is going to cause a problem in the Senate.   First, the Committee on Homeland Security was at $500 million in the  budget resolution. It is almost three times that amount on the current  CBO score. It is just under $1.5 billion.   If you look at the Committee on the Judiciary, you had a budget  resolution number of just about $108 billion. The CBO came back at $115  billion, just over $115 billion, with $369 billion from 2032 to 2041.   Then you have the Committee on Oversight, which is almost just as  egregious as Homeland Security's number. It was in the budget  resolution as $7.5 billion. It is almost twice that, at $13.8 billion.   I am not the Senate Parliamentarian, but from my understanding, this  is going to cause significant issues at the Senate.   But, Madam Speaker, I just want to talk about the previous question.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer personally an  amendment to the rule to strike provisions in this bill allowing  millions of illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States  indefinitely and setting them on the path toward citizenship.   Madam Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with any extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and the former  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we are all here to represent our constituents, and I  don't think it is a coincidence that House Democrats represent all but  one of the 25 districts that benefit from the SALT tax provision. That  includes Speaker Pelosi's own district. What this is, it is a tax break  for millionaires and billionaires.   Let's just look at the tax consequences of this bill. Analysis by the  nonprofit Tax Foundation found, ``Over 96 percent of districts across  the United States would eventually see a tax increase'' because of  President Biden's and House Democrats' socialist, Big Government  spending spree. Ninety-six percent of districts will have higher taxes  because of that. This hurts the working and middle class.  [[Page H6602]]    Even the left-leaning Tax Policy Center found that President Biden's  and Speaker Pelosi's spending spree would raise taxes on middle-class  Americans by 30 percent. That is 30 percent that you have to take into  account when you have inflation at over 6 percent. In essence, it is a  36 percent-plus tax increase on middle-class families and working  families.   This bill, though, delivers tax cuts to some people, and that is two- thirds of the country's millionaires. Two-thirds of the millionaires in  the United States under this bill actually receive a tax cut.   Small businesses also get hurt. They don't get favored like  millionaires and billionaires. This includes $400 billion in small  business tax hikes, which some argue would take the effective tax rate  of small businesses in excess of 57 percent.   Additionally, this bill hires 87,000 new IRS agents that are going to  be used to increase audits on everyday, working Americans. Nearly half  of those audits will impact families earning $75,000 a year or less.  About one-quarter affected will be Americans who earn just $25,000 per  year. This will damage the working and middle class severely.                                time  1830    This isn't just numbers. We can talk about tax rates all we want, but  when Americans go to Thanksgiving Day dinner, they will pay more than  ever.   If you just look at how much Americans are paying, steak is up 24  percent. Bacon is up over 20 percent; fish and seafood over 11 percent;  eggs, 11.6 percent. This will be the most expensive Thanksgiving Day  dinner in the history of the United States, thanks to Joe Biden's  economy.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My friend and colleague from Massachusetts was talking about taxes. I  will stand here and talk about taxes all day because, at the end of the  night, the American people will see that the second-biggest provision  in this bill is actually a tax break to millionaires and billionaires.   Facts are facts. If you look at it, the Committee for Responsible  Federal Budgets found that the SALT tax carve-out would ``be nearly 50  times as large as the benefit of the expanded child tax credits for a  typical family over 5 years.''   SALT gives tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires in blue  States. Who pays for that? Working families all over the United States.  [[Page H6603]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   One thing we need to address here also is the tax on natural gas.  This will increase nearly everything everyday Americans buy.   We already know that there are projections that people will be paying  more than ever this winter to heat their homes, almost a 50 percent  increase in some places.   If you look at the fees in this bill, the taxes, a $900 methane fee  phases into $1,500 in production per metric ton. That just sounds like  numbers, but think about it. If we are taxing natural gas, we are  taxing Americans who use natural gas to heat their homes. We are taxing  the industries that use petrochemicals to manufacture everyday products  that we use and manufacture here in the United States. And consumers  end up paying that tax, as well.   We are also making it more expensive to manufacture here in the  United States because as you tax natural gas, it costs more to  manufacture goods here at home. Again, the American consumer will end  up paying this tax.   These taxes on natural gas will do nothing more than make it harder  for Americans to heat their homes. It will make it more expensive for  us to manufacture products, to pay for petrochemicals. It will make it  harder for us to actually rebuild the economy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot tonight about pharmaceuticals. This  bill implements socialist price control  [[Page H6604]]  schemes for prescription drugs that will actually negatively impact  seniors and negatively impact patients and those who have rare diseases  in their families.   There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding about this industry.  On average, it costs $2.6 billion to take a drug to market. We, for  whatever reason, focus on the cost per each dose. By the way,  petrochemicals are used to make our pharmaceuticals, which this bill  also taxes, as I said before. But there is a fundamental  misunderstanding in how drugs are produced. If we get these socialist  price controls in this bill, it will actually kill our innovation, or  deincentivize any pharmaceutical company to actually reinvest and  invest in new drugs and prescriptions, which will actually harm those  with rare diseases and make it harder for those that are suffering from  mental conditions to get the drugs they need.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just note that this bill  does not include the Hyde amendment, which will allow taxpayer dollars  to be used to fund on-demand abortions.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, while I have tremendous respect for  my colleague from Texas, I do want to point out that according to  Moody's Analytics, consumer prices will rise 2.24 percent higher after  the Biden infrastructure and the American Rescue Plan and the Build  Back Better spending spree then in a Biden-free economy.    Madam Speaker, I think it should be noted that  this bill actually impedes and bans domestic energy and mineral  production, which will actually increase our dependencies on resource  suppliers, from OPEC, Russia, and China. I just think that should be  noted.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Cammack), my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, with record high inflation and gas prices, supply  chain shortages, and what is going to be the most expensive  Thanksgiving on record, Democrats should focus on addressing real  economic crises that are facing real Americans and real American  workers every day. But instead, this bill before us would actually  double lower- and middle-income earners chances of being audited. It  would make it more expensive for them to heat their homes and fill  their gas tanks, and it will actually drive businesses and jobs  overseas; further damaging our economy.   Democrats are extending tax breaks in this bill, extending tax breaks  for millionaires and billionaires and jamming through far-left radical  policies that will only drive prices higher and make our paychecks  lower.   If President Biden and congressional Democrats get their way, average  Americans will be pinching pennies while our country's coastal elites  will be legally evading taxes and getting tax subsidies and tax breaks  to put another Tesla in their five-car garage.   Madam Speaker, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,''  and I yield back the balance of my time.                              ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
