 And you testified in your deposition that in       that conversation President Zelensky emphasized that the       military assistance, the security assistance, was not just       important to assist Ukraine in fighting a war against Russia       but that it was also symbolic in nature. What did you       understand him to mean by that?         And, then, if the United States was holding       the security assistance, is it also true then that Russia       could see that as a sign of weakening U.S. support for       Ukraine and take advantage of that?         Now, Mr. Morrison, shortly after you heard the       July 25th call, you testified that you alerted the NSC legal       advisor, John Eisenberg, pretty much right away. Is that       right?         And you indicated in your opening statement,       or at least from your deposition, that you went to Mr.       Eisenberg out of concern over the potential political fallout       if the call record became public and not because you thought       it was illegal. Is that right?         But you would agree, right, that asking a       foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival       is inappropriate. Would you not?         Now, in a second meeting with Mr. Eisenberg,       what did you recommend that he do to prevent the call record       from leaking?         Had you ever asked the NSC legal advisor to       restrict access before?         Did you speak to your supervisor, Dr.       Kupperman, before you went to speak to John Eisenberg?         Did you subsequently learn that the call       record had been put in a highly classified system?         And what reason did Mr. Eisenberg give you for       why the call record was put in a highly classified system?         He said it was just a mistake?         And what did Ambassador Sondland tell you that       he told Mr. Yermak?         And you testified that you were not       comfortable with what Ambassador Sondland had told you. Why       not?         So now there's a whole other wrinkle to it,       right?         And you told Ambassador Taylor about this       conversation as well. Is that right?         And in your deposition, you testified that his       testimony, other than one small distinction between President       Zelensky and the prosecutor general, was accurate as to what       you told him. Is that correct?         And, generally speaking, you confirmed       everything that Ambassador Taylor told you, except for that       one thing and a small other ministerial matter relating to       the location of the meeting. Is that correct?         Now, did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this       conversation as well?         And what was his response when you explained       to him what Ambassador Sondland had said?         Did you go tell the lawyers?         And did he explain to you why he wanted you to       tell the lawyers?         Now, a few days later, on September 7th, you       spoke again to Ambassador Sondland, who told you that he had       just gotten off the phone with President Trump. Isn't that       right?         What did Ambassador Sondland tell you that       President Trump said to him?         And by that point, did you understand that the       statement related to the Biden and 2016 investigations?         And that that was essentially a condition for       the security assistance to be released?         After speaking with President Trump?         Now, you testified that hearing this       information gave you a sinking feeling. Why was that?         Did you tell Ambassador Bolton about this       conversation as well?         And what did he say to you?         And why did he say to tell the lawyers?         Mr. Kent, is pressuring Ukraine to conduct       what I believe you have called ``political investigations'' a       part of U.S. foreign policy to promote the rule of law in       Ukraine and around the world?         Is it in the national interests of the United       States?         Why not?         So, in other words, it is a purpose of our       foreign policy to encourage foreign nations to refrain from       conducting political investigations. Is that right?
