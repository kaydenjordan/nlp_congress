 Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues are presently  fiddling while Rome burns, but I come to praise my Republican  colleagues, not to bury them.   I come to praise my friend Patrick McHenry for his wisdom just 6  months ago when he said that he opposes Speaker McCarthy's plan to use  the debt limit to cut spending; when he said that it is important that  Congress raise the debt limit; when he said that Treasury markets are  the lifeblood of the global economy; when he said it is an important  function of the government for us to make good on the checks we cash.   I come to praise the July 2019 version of Speaker McCarthy when he  said that we should not leave here without doing something on the debt  ceiling.   Where are those brave, principled souls now?   The answer, Madam Speaker, as you know, not here. Empty, inconsistent  rhetoric does not pay the bills.   The American people know that, and I hope the American people will  remind my Republican colleagues of the work requirements of this job  during their upcoming 11-day vacation.                            ____________________
