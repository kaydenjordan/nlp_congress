 Madam Speaker, not long ago, America was the largest  energy producer in the world. Gas was affordable, and groceries weren't  worth an entire paycheck. These are not faraway memories from our  country's bygone golden era--this was the reality for Americans just a  few years ago.   Government spending has increased over $9 trillion since President  Biden has taken office. This predictably resulted in the highest  inflation in four decades. American families have had to bear the brunt  of this crisis, yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle still  seem to have no plan to tackle inflation outside of spending more  taxpayer money.   House Republicans have been clear about our mission in 2023: set our  fiscal house in order so that we can lower the cost of living for  Americans. We can find solutions to our debt crisis by working on new  budgetary framework focused on fiscal restraint.   Republicans' commitment to America offers tangible solutions to set  us on that path--from strengthening our supply chains to enacting  progrowth policies.                            ____________________
