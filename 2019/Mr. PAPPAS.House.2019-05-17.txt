 Mr. Speaker, thank you to my colleague, Representative  Hill from California, my fellow co-chair of the Equality Caucus, as she  rightfully notes nothing--nothing--in the Equality Act infringes upon  women's rights. If it did, we wouldn't be supporting it so vociferously  today.   This MTR is an army of words marching in search of an issue that  doesn't exist. For those of us who have been involved in the fight for  equality, this tactic isn't new or surprising. We have seen it before.  We have seen the deliberate distractions, the unfounded fears, the  faulty arguments on our way toward progress.   This legislation simply gives LGBTQ individuals full equality-- nothing more and nothing less.   When we end legal discrimination in housing, employment, and public  services, we will steer our Nation closer to the full realization of  its founding principles and the notion that we are all created equal.   As a proud member of the LGBTQ community, I can attest that attitudes  in this country have changed for the better, and it is time that our  laws catch up. Congress can send a message to LGBTQ Americans  everywhere that we see you, that we celebrate you for who you are.   This vote will change laws, and it will save lives.   In passing the Equality Act today, we can say, unequivocally, that  everyone matters, that everyone can be themselves, that no one should  live in fear or be treated as a second-class citizen in the United  States of America, not today and not ever--full equality under the law,  nothing less and nothing more.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit. I  welcome you to become a part of history. Join us on the right side of  history. Do the right thing today. Vote ``no'' on this MTR, and stand  for full equality for the LGBTQ community.
