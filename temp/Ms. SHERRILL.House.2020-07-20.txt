 Mr. Speaker, Federal forces should only be deployed in  the United States with the utmost transparency and only when it is  absolutely necessary to protect our country and our citizens. What we  are seeing in Portland and what we saw in Washington is deeply  disturbing, and it is contrary to the values of a democratic society.   As a veteran, I am particularly concerned when it implicates our  military. Congress has a responsibility to exercise oversight over the  use of military force. Unfortunately, in recent months, we have seen  threats of force against U.S. citizens without consulting Congress and  without delineating the legal authorities under which the forces are  operating.   The Insurrection Act has been used with great and important effect to  integrate elementary schools and universities, suppress the Ku Klux  Klan, and to protect the American people. This amendment does not  prevent any President from employing the Insurrection Act should it  become necessary, nor would it prevent the Insurrection Act from being  used to protect Americans' civil rights in the future. It simply  ensures that the Insurrection Act is used in keeping with centuries of  precedent--as a last resort and with strong oversight by Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
