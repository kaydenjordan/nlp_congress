 Madam Speaker, American doctors, scientists, and  researchers aren't alone in racing to unlock treatments, vaccines, and  other lifesaving developments in the fight against COVID-19.   Their counterparts in Israel are making groundbreaking advancements  as well.   Just days ago, an Israeli study indicated that low levels of vitamin  D increase the risk of contracting COVID. Israeli scientists are  developing six different vaccine candidates and more than a dozen  different treatment options for the deadly lung inflammation caused by  COVID-19.   That is why I am asking my colleagues to support this bipartisan  amendment which will fund a new partnership between the U.S. and Israel  to bring leading researchers together to defeat this devastating  disease.   By passing this amendment, we can deepen our expertise in the  development of drugs, vaccines, AI solutions, respiratory assist  devices, diagnostic tests, telemedicine, and more to help save American  lives.   America can't go it alone in this fight. We are stronger when we join  forces with countries that share our values to confront our shared  challenges.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this provision.
