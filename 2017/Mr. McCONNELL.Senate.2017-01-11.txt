 Madam President, when ObamaCare's supporters forced  their partisan law on our country, they promised an easy-to-use  system--one that would lower premiums and out-of-pocket health care  costs, one that would foster choice and allow families to keep the  plans and doctors they liked.   But it didn't take long for the American people to discover the truth  about ObamaCare. Too many have been personally hurt by this law. Too  many feel they are worse off than they were before ObamaCare. Listening  to their stories helps to explain why they might feel this way.   For instance, too many Americans say their ObamaCare plans are too  expensive to actually use. Too many say their ObamaCare premiums have  gone up and up, although their options have diminished. Too many say  their choices on ObamaCare have deteriorated to just one or two  insurers.   These are some of the realities of ObamaCare for too many families in  Kentucky and across the country. These are some inconvenient realities  that those who continue to defend this failed law must finally face up  to. Remember, even former President Clinton called ObamaCare ``the  craziest thing in the world.'' This was Bill Clinton on ObamaCare.   So it is little wonder that 8 in 10 favor changing ObamaCare  significantly or replacing it altogether. We must act quickly to bring  relief to the American people. I hope Democrats will work with us as we  take the next steps toward repealing and replacing this failing law.   Tonight, Senators from both parties will have an important  opportunity to take a vote on the legislative tools necessary to repeal  ObamaCare. Then we can send it to the House and begin taking the next  steps to finally move away from ObamaCare, while we move ahead with  smarter health care policies. This is what the American people have  called for us to do. It is the best way forward for our country and the  people we represent.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
