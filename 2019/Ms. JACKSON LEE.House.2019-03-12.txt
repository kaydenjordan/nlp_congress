 Madam Speaker, I serve on the Homeland Security  Committee, and I have done so since the heinous act of 9/11.   I have a great deal of faith in the aviation industry of this Nation,  but I want to offer my deepest sympathy to the people of Ethiopia and  Indonesia.   In the instance of the Ethiopian flight, some eight Americans died.  Ethiopian Americans have been calling my office saddened by the fact  that some of their relatives, who are very special to them, lost their  life.   I called, earlier today, for the grounding of the 737 Max 8 not  because I don't have faith in America's genius, but because I believe  people are number one and first. Pilots count, fight attendants count,  and passengers count.   It is time for the FAA to remove their fear and to be able to assess  a temporary grounding of this aircraft so that all of the systems can  be checked, even the one that is automatic that the pilot is to  release, which is alleged did not happen, but to release in order to  save lives.   These planes, this aircraft, should be grounded now, and I will be  sending a letter to the FAA to demand that.                            ____________________
