 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9, the Climate  Action Now Act.   Washington's First District is home to some of our Nation's most  beautiful parks, mountains, and waterways, and we are already seeing  the consequences of climate change:   Snowpack in the north Cascades is currently 20 to 40 percent below  normal amounts;   Last year, wildfires ravaged the West Coast, resulting in poor air  quality and public health issues;   Washington State just had the second driest March on record, and  there is a greater likelihood of more fires through the summer.   This is why Congress must take action and pass H.R. 9. We need to be  moving forward, not backward.   President Trump's statement of intent to withdraw from the Paris  climate agreement is a grave mistake that would have lasting effects on  our planet and our economy.   H.R. 9 is an important step forward, ensuring the United States  upholds our commitments under the agreement and leads in the green  economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and  the underlying legislation.
