 Our job right now is to fight.         I agree with tens of millions of Americans who       are very worried that when they cast a ballot on an       electronic voting machine that there is no paper trail to       record that vote.         I know many of the Senators and Members of the       House will fight like hell.        Mr. Perez. We're going to fight like hell.         Political revolution.        That means that millions--        Millions.        Millions.        Have got to stand up--        And fight.        And fight.        And fight.        Stand up and fight back.         Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, has  a question for both the counsel for the former President and the House  managers.   The clerk will read the question, and following our procedure, the  House managers will go first.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House prosecutors have stated over and over again that       President Trump was perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly       claimed that the election was stolen from him and that he       actually won the election by a landslide.        Are the prosecutors right when they claim that Trump was       telling a big lie or, in your judgment, did Trump actually       win the election?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The House managers have up to 2\1/2\  minutes.   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. As we all know, President Trump did lose the  election by 7 million votes, 306 electoral votes. By the time of the  January 6 attack, the courts, the Justice Department, all 50 States  across the country had done--agreed that the votes were counted. The  people had spoken, and it was time for the peaceful transfer of power  as our Constitution and the rule of law demands. Sixty-one courts--61  courts--the President went to. That is fine, appropriate. He lost. He  lost. He lost the election. He lost the court case.   As Leader McConnell recognized the day after the electors certified  the votes on December 14, he said:         Many millions of us had hoped that the Presidential       election would yield a different result, but our system of       government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on       January 20. The electoral college has spoken.    Patriotism. Sometimes, there is a reason to dispute an election.  Sometimes, the count is close. Sometimes, we ask for a recount, go to  courts. All of that is appropriate. I lost my first election. I stayed  in bed for 3 days. We do what we need to do, and we move on. This was  not that because, when all of these people confirmed that Donald Trump  had lost, when the courts, his--his--Department of Justice, State  officials, Congress, his Vice President were ready to commit to the  peaceful transfer of power--the peaceful transfer of power--Donald  Trump was not ready, and we are all here because he was not ready.   Day after day, he told his supporters false, outlandish claims of why  this election was rigged. Now, let's be clear: President Trump had  absolutely no support of these claims, but that wasn't the point of  what he was doing. He did it to make his supporters frustrated, to make  them angry.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.   Counsel for the former President is recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Thank you.   May I have the question read again and not have it count against my  time?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of course.   The clerk will read the question again.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House prosecutors have stated over and over again that       President Trump was perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly       claimed that the election was stolen from him and that he       actually won the election by a landslide.        Are the prosecutors right when they claim that Trump was       telling a big lie or, in your judgment, did Trump actually       win the election?    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel for the former President has 2\1/ 2\ minutes.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Who asked that?    I did.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. My judgment is irrelevant in this  proceeding. It absolutely is. What is supposed to happen here is the  Article of Impeachment----   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.   Senators, under the rules, cannot challenge the content of the  response.   Counsel will continue.   Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. May I have the question read again, please?   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House prosecutors have stated over and over again that       President Trump was perpetrating a big lie when he repeatedly       claimed that the election was stolen from him and that he       actually won the election by a landslide.        Are the prosecutors right when they claim that Trump was       telling a big lie or, in your judgment, did Trump actually       win the election?   [[Page S688]]         Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. In my judgment, it is irrelevant to the  question before this body. What is relevant in this Impeachment Article  is, were Mr. Trump's words inciteful to the point of violence and riot?  That is the charge. That is the question; and the answer is, no, he did  not have speech that was inciteful to violence or riot.   Now, what is important to understand here is the House managers have  completely, from the beginning of this case to right now, done  everything except answer that question--the question they brought  before you, the question they want my client to be punished by. That is  the question that should be getting asked.   The answer is, he advocated for peaceful, patriotic protest. Those  are his words. The House managers have shown zero--zero--evidence that  his words did anything else. Remember, all of the evidence is this was  premeditated; the attack on the Capitol was preplanned. It didn't have  anything to do with Mr. Trump in any way, what he said on that day on  January 6 at that Ellipse, and that is the issue before this Senate.   Now, on the issue of contestin elections and the results, the  Democrats have a long, long history of just doing that. I hope  everybody was able to see the video earlier today. Over and over again,  it has been contested. When Mr. Trump was elected President, we were  told that it was hijacked.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The former President's counsel's 2\1/2\  minutes has expired.   The Senator from Wisconsin.
