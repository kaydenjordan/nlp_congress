 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 1715, the  Advanced Weather Model Computing Development Act. Introduced by  Representatives Deborah Ross and Max Miller, this good bipartisan  legislation significantly advances the weather forecasting and climate  modeling missions of the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration, otherwise known as NOAA, by authorizing  collaborative research partnerships between the agencies.   Climate change is fueling extreme weather events, which poses  significant threats to life and causes massive property damage across  the United States. My home State of California has experienced billion- dollar extreme weather events and disasters. No State in our Nation is  untouched by the damaging physical and emotional impacts of windstorms,  flooding, and other disasters.   Deadly storms across the South and Midwest and entire communities  being washed away in Alaska are only a few of the many challenges that  extreme weather events and climate change pose. In my own district in  California, we have seen flooding in Monterey County, in Pajaro, in  Watsonville, in San Benito County, and great devastation and suffering.  Supporting a robust Federal weather and climate research enterprise is  invaluable to the safety and well-being of the Nation.   This bill is a necessary push forward for our weather and climate  modeling capabilities, as it lets NOAA utilize DOE's high-performing  computing capabilities and expertise. It also would improve the  scientific computing infrastructure between both agencies, a critical  need that NOAA has repeatedly expressed as being a roadblock to more  timely and accurate weather forecasts.   An important aspect of the research which this bill would support is  that it would improve NOAA's ability to accurately forecast weather and  climate events by improving the utilization of preexisting data  streams. This increases the bang for the buck for every taxpayer dollar  spent on acquiring data while also improving our Nation's resilience to  weather and climate disasters.   Madam Speaker, I thank again the sponsors of this legislation. I  strongly urge all Members of the House to support this timely and  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Ross), an enormously talented member of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  [[Page H2149]]  from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), a valued member of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Representative Ross for  the expertise and diligence and hard work that she puts in on the  Science Committee. Her knowledge is invaluable, but there is something  else. In this body, we know there is sometimes acrimony and fighting.  She is someone, along with Mr. Miller, who wants to get things done,  who put aside that kind of dissension and work together for the  betterment of our country. I am grateful to both of them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1734, the TRANQ  Research Act, a bill that I was proud to cosponsor, but I need to thank  especially our colleagues, Representatives Yadira Caraveo and  Mike  Collins, for leading this legislation, as well as Chairman Frank Lucas  for his support.   Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, have taken a terrible toll on  communities all across the country, including in my own district.  Fentanyl is now involved in more deaths of Americans under 50 than any  other cause of death.                                time  1815    As if the opioid epidemic wasn't bad enough already, our communities  now have to deal with various chemicals being added to these drugs that  ``enhance'' their effects and make them harder to detect.   One chemical that criminals have started to use is a common animal  tranquilizer called xylazine. When added to fentanyl, this animal  tranquilizer can have terrible side effects, including horrible wounds  at the injection site.   These additives are also consequential to our first responders and to  law enforcement as they deal with these drugs on the street. Drug  mixtures usually contain a very small amount of synthetic opioids,  which makes it difficult to detect and hard to identify new variants.  Even small amounts of some drugs can be dangerous for law enforcement  and public health officials to handle.   This bill would address these challenges by leveraging NIST's unique  research capabilities to help develop technologies to quickly  characterize and safely handle street drugs.   For decades, NIST, the Nation's measurement laboratory, has helped to  provide safe and effective drug detection techniques and handling  practices. NIST also collects and analyzes drug samples in circulation  to help health authorities, as well as law enforcement, better respond  to this crisis. This bill would codify, as well as enhance, those  ongoing efforts.   This is a fantastic example of how we can activate the unique  expertise in our government laboratories to benefit communities across  the country. We can use science to make law enforcement and first  responders safer and help fight this drug epidemic.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. Caraveo) and recognize her leadership on this matter.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), a valued member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close and yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is another example of how the Science Committee  can successfully follow our history of bipartisan work for the well- being of our country--two freshmen coming together for something that  is important.   Madam Speaker, I also will mention that Representative Caraveo is not  just Representative Caraveo. She is Dr. Caraveo. She comes with  significant expertise to this body and especially to the Science  Committee. We are grateful to her constituents for sending her to us.   She, like Mr. Collins, has only been here several months, but she has  already shown leadership, a focus on law enforcement and health, and a  real willingness to work on a bipartisan basis to solve problems that  face our country.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives Collins and Caraveo for their  hard work, and I yield back the balance of my time.
