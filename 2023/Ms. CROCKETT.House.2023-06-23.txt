 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mourn the loss of my  constituent and a beloved member of the United States Postal Service,  Eugene Gates.   On Wednesday, Mr. Gates passed while delivering mail on his route in  Dallas, Texas, where the heat index reached temperatures of nearly 115  degrees.   My heart breaks for Eugene's wife, Carla, his children,  grandchildren, and everyone in Lancaster, Texas, who called him  neighbor and friend.   Mr. Gates was a 40-year veteran of the U.S. Postal Service and will  be remembered and mourned by many in north Texas who looked forward to  his visits every day. He had the heart of a public servant and will be  missed by all who had the honor of knowing him.   As a member of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, I have  continued to uplift and fight my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for respect and to protect and honor those Federal workers just  like Mr. Gates instead of belittling them. Mr. Gates should be here.   It is past time that we do the people's work in the people's House. I  pray that we honor Mr. Gates' life by offering pragmatic solutions  along with our prayers. We need to do this for Eugene, his family, and  for all of our letter carriers putting public service before self every  single day.                            ____________________
