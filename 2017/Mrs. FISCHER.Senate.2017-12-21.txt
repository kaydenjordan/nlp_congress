 Mr. President, I rise this evening to call up and adopt  a resolution recognizing this year's NCAA champions in women's  volleyball--the Huskers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This  is the program's fifth national championship and second title in 3  years.   During the NCAA tournament, Nebraska played remarkably well, winning  18 sets and finishing on a 19-match winning streak. They were so fun to  watch.   The entire team contributed to the outstanding victory, and I want to  acknowledge their extraordinary effort: Annika Albrecht, Mikaela  Foecke, Hunter Atherton, Hayley Densberger, Allie Havers, Briana  Holman, Kenzie Maloney, Kelly Hunter, Chesney McClellan, Sami  Slaughter, Lauren Stivrins, Jazz Sweet, Anezka Szabo, and Sydney  Townsend all had their hard work pay off and they worked together to  win a championship.   The Nebraska coaches worked hard, helped train our athletes, and  strategized this championship run.   Head coach John Cook won his fourth national champion as a Husker  head coach. He was joined by assistant coach Tyler Hildebrand,  assistant coach Kayla Banwarth, volunteer assistant coach Ryan Coomes,  director of operations Lindsay Peterson, video coordinator Kelly  O'Connor, and graduate managers Joe Klein, John Henry, and Bre Mackie.  Together, as a team, they guided that outstanding group of women to  another national championship. These coaches have created a foundation  and a winning tradition--winning the national championship in front of  a record-setting crowd of Husker fans--the best fans in college  football. Nebraskans couldn't be more proud of this volleyball team and  the coaching staff.   The Huskers won this national championship the Nebraska way--with  hard work, sportsmanship, and determination. They deserve to be saluted  by the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution and  recognize their outstanding accomplishment.   I congratulate them on their victory and know they will continue to  be great role models to girls and athletes everywhere.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 365, submitted earlier today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
