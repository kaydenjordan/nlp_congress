 Mr. President, I rise to recognize and  congratulate the Van Buren Lions Club as it celebrates 100 years of  service to western Arkansas.   The Van Buren Lions Club was chartered on October 10, 1922, only 5  years after the creation of Lions Club International. Since its  founding, its members have committed themselves to making a difference  in the lives of people in the community and around the world.   While it began as a club to support local causes and provide  networking for businessmen, a larger mission came into focus after  Helen Keller spoke at the Lions Club International convention in 1925.  She challenged all Lions to be ``Knights of the Blind'' and her  eloquent plea transformed the organization, making support of sight- related programs the group's primary mission.   Throughout its 100-year history, the Van Buren Lions Club has worked  tirelessly to make a difference for this cause. It hosts annual  fundraisers and works with area eye doctors to recycle glasses,  donating them to people who cannot afford them. In addition, members  support local eye examination programs as well as the Arkansas Eye Bank  and Laboratory, Lions World Services for the Blind, Mid-South Sight and  Hearing Service, Leader Dogs for the Blind, Lions Clubs International  Foundation, Diabetes Education and Prevention, Sight First, and the  Lions of Arkansas Foundation.   As an optometrist, I am proud of the great work done by this club and  Lions chapters around the world. I congratulate the Van Buren Lions  Club on its 100th anniversary and hope these Knights for the Blind  continue to prosper in their mission for years to come.                            ____________________
