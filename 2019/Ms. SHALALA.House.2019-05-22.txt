 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of one of the  greatest public servants of any age, the indomitable Alice Rivlin, who  died of cancer last week.   An intellectual giant with Midwestern sensibilities, she had a resume  that would never be matched: Assistant Secretary for Policy and  Evaluation at HEW, founding Director of the Congressional Budget  Office, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, president of  the American Economic Association, and Vice Chair of the Federal  Reserve.   In between her government service, she sat on a high perch at the  Brookings Institution, producing rigorous, centrist, and insightful  books and articles on a wide range of Federal policies.   In her spare time, she was credited with saving D.C. from bankruptcy.  She never forgot her responsibility to her adopted hometown.   Alice was deeply respected and beloved by her peers and politicians  of both parties. She was one of the first recipients of a MacArthur  Foundation genius award, a tribute to her skill in building one of the  most important public institutions of our lifetime, the CBO.   Her sustained contributions to public policy analysis have  fundamentally shaped our thinking about the impact of public programs  and the budget.                                time  1030    She also constantly reminded us that when we refuse to use evidence  in making policy decisions, we do so at our country's peril.   Alice Rivlin was my dear friend. I met her here in D.C. as a newly  minted Ph.D. She was already famous for her classic book, ``Systematic  Thinking for Social Action.''   She was funny, warm, generous, and welcoming. She wanted all of us  newcomers to love her adopted city as much as she did.   When I returned to Washington to join the Clinton Cabinet, Alice,  along with her friend Meg Greenfield, the powerhouse editorial page  editor of the Post, and Post publisher Katherine Graham, formed the  Smart Women's Club. They invited me to join them in hilarious dinners  with interesting guests, a high point in my career.   One of my fondest memories of Alice took place on a day in the 1980s  when I was still in New York. She called me and asked if I could take a  month off to go to Kashmir to trek in the Himalayas. What an adventure,  the beginning of decades of trekking in some of the most interesting  places on Earth with friends and her patient husband, Sid Winter,  himself a world-class economist.   You learn a lot about people when you share a narrow ledge in a  rainstorm on some of the highest mountains in the world. Alice was  tenacious, brave, cheerful, and the kindest and nicest person I have  ever known.   She was a legend, renowned for mentoring younger colleagues and  helping people of all walks of life with their challenges.   Hers was more than a life well lived. She was a patriot who loved her  country and her city, and she served both with extraordinary skill and  passion.                            ____________________
