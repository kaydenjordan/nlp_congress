 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let's be real clear. There is not a carbon tax bill  before us today. This is a political stunt, and this stunt comes at the  same time that the Republican majority is undermining access to  affordable healthcare for all our constituents.   They are working with this administration to sabotage the healthcare  marketplaces and drive up prices, legislating away coverage and  protections for our constituents. They have gutted resources that help  people enroll in the plans that are best for them. They are expanding  junk healthcare plans that don't provide care if you are sick or  injured, that can charge more for preexisting conditions, that charge  more for older people.   Their scam of a tax bill eliminated the individual mandate, driving  healthier folks away from coverage. That means risk can't be spread and  prices go up. Kids born with heart problems or young adults diagnosed  with cancer will pay a penalty for the rest of their lives.   On top of all of that, the administration has frozen the risk  adjustment payments, which prevent insurance companies from cherry- picking only the healthiest people to cover.   According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Republican sabotage efforts will  increase the cost of health insurance by as much as 24 percent this  year alone.   These are some of the issues that are hurting the middle class now,  and these are some of the issues that we should be focusing on. We  should be holding hearings on these issues.   If you have concerns with other issues, have hearings on them. But  don't bring some political malarkey on the floor and pretend that we  are doing something for the American people.   This is a failure by the majority party. We should be working for our  constituents on real bills that are before us now.
