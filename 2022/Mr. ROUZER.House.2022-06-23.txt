 Madam Speaker, after hearing from my constituent whose  veteran spouse tragically died by suicide, and learning of the  obstacles they faced when trying to receive critical mental health  support for themselves and their children following his death, I  introduced a bill to ensure veteran families struggling from such a  loss have access to the support they need and deserve.   My legislative language, included in this bill before us today, the  STRONG Veterans Act, expands Vet Center eligibility for counseling and  mental health services to families of servicemembers or veterans who  died by suicide. This expansion of services is necessary so that these  families can receive the critical mental health support needed to help  them heal and move forward.   We all know that grief can be extremely isolating, and the families  of servicemembers and veterans who have died by suicide should not have  to worry about enduring this difficult journey alone.   Our military families who support a loved one who is serving, or has  served, make a tremendous sacrifice for our country, as well. We must  ensure they have access to the care that they deserve and the help that  they need when trying to move forward after a suicide has devastated  them and their family.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for  working with me to include this very important piece of legislation in  this package, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
