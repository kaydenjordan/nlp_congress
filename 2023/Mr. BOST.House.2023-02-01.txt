 Mr. Speaker, back in September, President Biden said the  pandemic is over. In early January, he extended his public health  emergency for COVID for the twelfth time. Now he says the public health  emergency will end May 11.   The emergency's been ended, then extended, then expired, when all of  us know that it hasn't existed for months.   I guess we can say now that COVID will magically disappear in May  because he says so. Who knows? We might even get new guidance tomorrow.  I guess the Americans should watch out.   The American people--regardless of what was said on the other side of  the aisle--are tired of this. They want to get back to business as  usual. The American people are fed up with shutdowns that killed our  jobs and restricted our rights.   We are going to end this madness now; we need to, that is why I am a  cosponsor of the bill.
