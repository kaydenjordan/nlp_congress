 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier today I was proud to join my  colleagues in witnessing the inauguration of President Joe Biden and  Vice President Kamala Harris on the west front of the U.S. Capitol.   I remembered, as I walked away from that inauguration ceremony, the  experience I had 4 years ago. There was a luncheon. Traditionally there  is a luncheon given for the new President and Vice President. That  luncheon was my first opportunity to meet President Donald Trump. I had  never met him before.   I went up to him at the head table, and I introduced myself and said:  I just want to tell you that I am working in the U.S. Senate for the  DREAM Act. I believe that these Dreamers deserve a chance to become  part of America's future.   President Donald Trump, minutes after having taken the oath of  office, said: Senator, don't worry about those young people. We will  take care of them.   That was my first conversation with President Trump. What transpired  afterwards is a matter of record in the history of this country. We  know also what happened in this Capitol Building just 2 weeks ago.   That is why this inauguration was so different. We were battling a  deadly virus and possibly a deadly attack by American terrorists. The  U.S. Capitol was as closely guarded as I have ever seen it. We estimate  that 25,000 soldiers--National Guard and Active-Duty soldiers--were in  town to protect us from all around the United States, including 260  from the State of Illinois, I am very proud to announce. They did their  job and did it well. I thank them for their service and sacrifice and  separation from their families. But at the same time, we are facing a  deadly virus. In the midst of a global pandemic, today's celebration  had to be tempered so that people were safe from wherever they sat and  from wherever they gathered.   President Biden and Vice President Harris understand that our Nation  [[Page S67]]  faces a unique set of circumstances. They also understand that we are a  unique nation. What makes us special is that people from all over the  world come to our shores to become Americans, not because of their race  or ethnicity but because they embrace America's values.   Never before in American history have those ideals been tested as  they have been in the last 4 years. A hallmark of the former  administration was a relentless attack on immigrants. One of the main  targets were the very Dreamers whom I spoke to President Trump about,  young immigrants who came to the United States as children.   It was 11 years ago that I joined with then-Senator Dick Lugar of  Indiana on a bipartisan basis to call on President Obama to use his  legal authority to protect Dreamers from deportation. Our argument was  simple: These young people were brought to the United States as  children. Their parents made the decision to come here. They grew up  here, went to school here, pledged allegiance to that very flag every  day in their classrooms, and believed they were part of this country.   Usually sometime in their teenage years, their parents sat down with  them and told them the grim reality: They have no country--not the one  they left nor the one they currently live in.   So I introduced legislation 20 years ago, the DREAM Act, in an effort  to give them a chance, a chance to earn their way to legal status and  citizenship, but I have been unable to enact that into law in both the  House and the Senate in any given year. I have been stymied and stopped  by the filibuster too many times.   President Obama knew that. When he was a Senator here before being  elected to be President, he was a cosponsor of my DREAM Act, so I knew  where his heart was and I appealed to him--could he do something. And  he did. He created DACA.   DACA, by Executive order, provided temporary protection from  deportation to Dreamers. If they register with the government, pay a  fee, and pass a criminal and national security background check, they  could have a temporary right to work here in the United States and be  free from deportation.   More than 800,000 Dreamers came forward with President Obama's DACA.  DACA unleashed the full potential of these Dreamers, who are  contributing to our country this very day as soldiers, teachers, and  business owners. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than  200,000 DACA recipients have been characterized as ``essential critical  infrastructure workers'' during this pandemic. That wasn't my  designation; it was the designation of the Trump administration. Among  those essential workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in the healthcare  industry--doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics, and respiratory  therapists.   Well, on September 5, 2017, former President Trump repealed DACA.  Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers faced losing their work permits and  being deported to countries they barely remembered, if they remembered  them at all.   Last summer, the Supreme Court rejected President Trump's effort to  end deportation protection for Dreamers. In an opinion by Chief Justice  John Roberts, the Court held that the President's attempt to rescind  DACA was ``arbitrary and capricious.''   Today, in one of his first official acts, President Joseph Biden  signed an Executive order to restore DACA. I am eternally grateful for  President Biden's courage and commitment in keeping his word. Without  DACA, hundreds of thousands of talented young people who have grown up  in our country cannot continue their work and risk deportation every  single day.   But the resumption of DACA is just the first step toward long-overdue  justice for Dreamers. Only legislation passed by Congress can provide a  path to citizenship to the Dreamers. I first introduced the bipartisan  DREAM Act 20 years ago, as I mentioned, and I will continue to do so  until it becomes the law of the land.   I am honored that I have a chance to serve as chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee in the 117th Congress. As a child of an immigrant  myself, I never dreamed that I would be blessed with the opportunity to  lead the committee that writes our Nation's immigration laws.   To all of the Dreamers out there, I have told you many times: I have  never given up on you; don't give up on me. I am going to pass the  DREAM Act.   Over the years, I have come to the floor with the most persuasive  approach I can think of to pass the DREAM Act and make it the law of  the land. I tell their stories. These stories show what is at stake  when we consider DACA and the DREAM Act. It is not a theory. It is not  just a law. These are real, human lives.   Today I want to tell you about Hina Naveed. She is the 127th Dreamer  whose story I have told on the floor of the Senate.   Hina was born in Pakistan and came to the United States from Dubai  when she was 10 years old. She grew up in Fall River, MA.   She sent me a letter, and here is what she said about growing up:         I had a pretty typical experience navigating a new country       and new school system. It wasn't until I turned 16 and my       peers were getting their permits and their first jobs that I       really felt the impact of being undocumented.    Hina was an excellent student. In high school, she was president of  the National Honor Society and Key Club. She graduated as the  salutatorian of her class, ranked second out of 350 students with a 4.0  GPA. She received the Outstanding Vocational Student for Health Careers  Award and Overall Outstanding Vocational Student Award.   She went to the City University of New York College of Staten Island,  where she earned associate's degrees in liberal arts and nursing and a  bachelor of science in nursing. She studied at CUNY Law School, where  she graduated with a law degree.   Thanks to DACA, Hina became a registered nurse. She worked as  director of health services for a nonprofit, community-based  organization in New York. Her department provides healthcare services  for children in foster care, many of whom are victims of medical  neglect. She is also a member of the New York City Medical Reserve  Corps. At the height of the pandemic, she volunteered on weekends at a  hospital and at a residential facility with COVID-19 patients.   Hina wrote to me about her plans:         I want to work on health policy reform at a local and state       level in an effort to achieve health equity for all. This       pandemic has highlighted health disparities that have long       existed, and I want to be part of making the change I want to       see and experience.    Here is what Hina said about DACA and what it meant to her:         DACA has been life-changing. It has allowed me to drive,       work, achieve fiscal independence, continue higher education,       and contribute to my community more than I would have been       able to otherwise. However, it is temporary, and with the       benefits it provides, it has also cast a shadow over my life,       forcing me to plan my life in 2-year increments.    Well, let me start by saying thank you to her, to Hina Naveed, for  her service on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. All of us  are in awe of our healthcare heroes. She is an immigrant healthcare  hero. She is a DACA healthcare hero. She has put herself and her family  at risk to protect others. She also shouldn't have to worry about being  deported tomorrow and her family facing division.   Will America be a stronger country if we just up and deport her or if  she became an American citizen? I think the choice is clear.   Hina and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers are counting on  those of us who serve in the Senate. So here is where we stand. The  Senate Judiciary Committee will soon organize--I hope very soon--and I  will have an opportunity to appeal to my colleagues on both sides of  the table to join me in a bipartisan effort to pass the DREAM Act.   President Biden has made it his clear priority, and I share it. I  want this to be the first measure that we consider in the area of  immigration. But I know we live in a 50-50 Senate, and it is possible  that once again I will need to muster 60 votes to pass this on the  floor. So, whatever we do, it has to be bipartisan. That means it won't  have everything in it that I want or everything that maybe Hina or the  advocates want, but we have to take a step forward once and for all to  help these young people.   As long as I am a Senator, I will continue to fight for Hina Naveed  and for people who have come to this country just to make it better. It  would be an  [[Page S68]]  American tragedy to deport this brave and talented healthcare  professional in the midst of a pandemic. We must ensure that she and  hundreds of thousands of our essential workforce are not forced to stop  contributing when the need for their service has never been greater,  and we must give them the chance they deserve to become American  citizens.   I cannot express my gratitude enough for President Biden, in the  first hours that he was in office, recognizing the needs of the DACA  recipients and the Dreamers. I want to work with him and work with both  parties across the aisle to make this dream come true for so many who  deserve it. They have waited long enough.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown) and the  Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.
