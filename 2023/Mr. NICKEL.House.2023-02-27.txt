 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the free and  independent nation of Ukraine.   It has been over a year since Vladimir Putin ordered his tanks and  troops into Ukraine. In the past year, the United States has led an  extraordinary coalition of global partners to stand against Russia's  unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I traveled to Ukraine with then-Vice President Al Gore  in the 1990s as a staffer, and it fills my heart with pride to know  that Kyiv still stands strong. Ukraine is still free, and democracy  still prevails. Our support for Ukraine will not waver.   I wish we didn't have to spend any money in Ukraine, but if Putin  wins, we will spend a thousand times more trying to contain an  emboldened and aggressive Russia.   We must continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom and  democracy.                            ____________________
