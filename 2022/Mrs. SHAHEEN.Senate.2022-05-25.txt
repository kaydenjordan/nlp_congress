 Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the public  service of Craig McLean who retired in April after a distinguished 40- year career within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  NOAA. Within NOAA, Mr. McLean was as a dedicated leader, advocating for  science to advance NOAA's mission to understand and predict changes in  climate, weather, ocean, and coasts.   Mr. McLean has a deep dedication to our oceans and waterways,  garnered from growing up along the Passaic River in Rutherford, NJ. As  a child, he took a small boat out on the Passaic. As a teenager, he  learned to dive and performed decompression diving in order to explore  deep-ocean shipwrecks. These experiences helped inspire his career.   Mr. McLean began his NOAA career in 1981 as a uniformed officer in  the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and served for nearly 25 years  before retiring at the rank of captain. During that time, he was  instrumental to the founding of the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration  and Research, OER. Later, during his 16 years as a Federal executive,  he provided continued leadership in driving forward mapping of U.S.  waters to advance oceanographic scientific knowledge and discover deep  ocean secrets including new species, historical shipwrecks, and  undersea mountains. His leadership underlies OER's astounding  accomplishments including mapping 2 million square kilometers and  collecting ocean data in the waters of 16 countries and the high seas.  This work contributed to key conservation decisions for vital marine  habitats.   Most recently, Mr. McLean served as Assistant Administrator for  NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research--OAR--for more than 6  years,  [[Page S2704]]  leading an enterprise of 10 Federal laboratories across the country and  six major programs performing vital research to understand and predict  changes in climate, weather, ocean, and coasts for the benefit of the  Nation. Mr. McLean's preeminent leadership of OAR enabled vital  advancements, including improved forecasting of weather extremes such  as hurricanes, winter storms, extreme precipitation, and drought as  well as a greatly increased understanding of the Earth's climate  system. His leadership has enabled NOAA to better prepare society in  order to reduce the severe impacts of these events on life and  property.   On the international stage, as the U.S. Representative to the  Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations  Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization--UNESCO--Mr.  McLean's skillful collaborative approach helped advance U.S. scientific  goals and garnered support from our partners in ocean observing around  the world. He helped broker consensus for global biogeochemical ocean  sensors, known as Argo, which enabled a $53 million international  commitment to expand deployments to improve ocean health and climate  forecasting. Through this role, Mr. McLean served as a leader for the  United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development,  championing this global undertaking to provide a common framework that  ensures ocean science can support countries and achieve the United  Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.   Finally, I want to acknowledge Mr. McLean's commitment to scientific  integrity within NOAA. During the last administration, he boldly  stepped forward as a complainant when NOAA experienced political  interference, putting himself at risk to uphold scientific integrity  and the Agency's reputation. He also served as the Department of  Commerce representative on the National Science and Technology Council  Fast-Track Action Committee on Scientific Integrity where he cochaired  a working group to provide responsive outcomes for the Presidential  Memorandum on Restoring Trust in Government Through Scientific  Integrity and Evidence-Based Policymaking. NOAA's science and the  Agency's integrity has been made stronger through Mr. McLean's  commitment and leadership on this issue.   On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire, I thank Craig McLean  for his decades of excellent service to our Nation and wish him well in  his retirement. I hope he enjoys the chance to take his family out on  the water more in retirement and enjoys the oceans he has championed  throughout his career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor to pay  tribute to Edward B. Garone, a long-time law enforcement official in  the Granite State. There are many reasons to salute Ed Garone,  including an incredible 50 years as police chief of the Derry, NH,  police department and an extensive record of local involvement. I join  Chief Garone's colleagues and countless friends in thanking him for his  tireless work and recognizing the qualities behind his many  contributions and accomplishments: a humble desire to serve others and  strengthen his community.   After a 3-year tour of duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, Chief Garone  began his law enforcement career as a police officer in the Lebanon,  NH, police department. He would serve the city of Lebanon for 7-and-a- half years, rising to the rank of captain, before accepting an offer in  1972 to become the chief of police in Derry, NH. At 29 years old, he  moved with his young family--wife Blanche and children Vicky and  Michael--to southern New Hampshire and planted roots in a community he  would serve for the next five decades. A local newspaper noted at the  time that he was ``an experienced officer with a lot of skill.''   Chief Garone would tap into these skills to guide the town of Derry  through a variety of law enforcement challenges. He also managed  considerable growth within his department and witnessed significant  development in the community it serves. Derry's population has nearly  tripled since the 1970s, and its police department expanded from  roughly 20 full-time officers in 1972 to over 70 full-time and part- time personnel today. Chief Garone is their strongest advocate, always  making sure his officers have the most current and effective equipment,  technology, and training. He is also their loudest champion, and he's  quick to deflect any compliment or praise toward his officers who share  his belief of `service above self.'   Chief Garone is a well-respected figure and sought-after voice in New  Hampshire's law enforcement community. He has been on the board of  directors of the Regional Information Sharing Systems--New England  State Police Information Network for 17 years. He remains an active,  50-year member of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police and  has served as its secretary for the past 32 years. So many of his  fellow officers across the Granite State--from the longest serving  chief to the newly-sworn-in patrol officer--look to Chief Garone for  guidance, for leadership, and for encouragement as they work to keep  our communities safe.   Chief Garone's service goes beyond all he has given and all he has  accomplished at the Derry Police Department. He is involved in a number  of community and charitable organizations. Chief Garone is a 45-year  member of the Greater Derry Boys and Girls Club board of directors and  a past president of the club. He is currently the longest serving  member and former president of the Derry Rotary Club. He has led the  Viviana Leon Memorial Foundation, a charitable foundation that provides  funds each year to local groups. He is the current director of the  Derry Veterans Assistance Fund, a nonprofit that seeks to improve the  quality of life for local veterans. Chief Garone also serves on the  board of directors for the Alexander Eastman Foundation and the  Seacoast Child Advocacy Center. He even lends his time  [[Page S2706]]  and expertise to the public safety commission of his hometown of  Bradford, VT.   Exhaustive research conducted by his colleagues concluded that Edward  Garone is the longest serving full-time chief of police in the history  of New Hampshire and quite possibly the entire country. This  distinction is a testament to Ed's unwavering commitment to bettering  his community and helping others. The Granite State and the many  communities he has served are grateful for Chief Garone's many  contributions and acts of selfless service. In the coming month,  friends and fellow officers will gather to salute Ed and thank him for  all that he has given to the town of Derry and the State of New  Hampshire. I am with them in spirit as they honor this good and  generous man.                            ____________________
