 I was laying on the floor trying to, you know,       (inaudible) myself sort of (inaudible). And, you know,       (inaudible) we were concerned that this mob might come in and       that might (inaudible) identify Members of Congress.        I called my wife, and, you know, it wasn't till I heard her       voice that I thought, wow, this is like one of those calls       you hear about.    While most coverage focused on the extreme danger posed to Members  and the Capitol Police, who were targets of this attack, there were  lots of other people in the Capitol working on January 6 as well, from  personal aides to floor employees, cleaning staff, food service  workers. We can't forget all the people who were in harm's way that  day. These employees experienced trauma. Some cowered, hiding places  just a few feet away from where this rabid crowd had assembled. Many  were just kids, 20-somethings who came here to work because they  believed in their country and they believed in working to make it  better. Others were dedicated food service workers, all working  incredibly hard to make sure that we can come here to do our job. These  workers are the lifeblood of the legislative branch. They deserve  better.   You already heard from Speaker Pelosi's staff--staff that was hiding  under the conference table, cowering in the dark, making sure that the  attackers couldn't hear them. I would like to share with you what some  other staffers went through. Listen as two staffers recall what they  experienced that day   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. But then we were seeing on Twitter       and iPhones and hearing from some of the police officers on       the floor that the building had been breached, you know.       ``Building breached''--those are two words I had never heard.        Unidentified Speaker. That was particularly stressful,       being in a room close to where things were happening and not       really knowing what was happening and seeing it come in live       and getting texts from people, you know, ``Are you OK?'' And,       truthfully, I didn't know what was happening. I heard:       ``Shots fired. Shots fired. Shots fired. Show me your hands.       Show me your hands.'' Then I did not know if they were right       outside, if there were lots of people with weapons, if there       were one shooter, if they had--you know, I didn't know what       it looked like. I just knew that there were shots fired       outside of the House Chamber.    According to reports, one Republican Senate staffer whose office was  not far from the floor ``took a steel rod and barricaded his door as  the rioters banged on his door trying to break in.''   The New York Times also reported that a senior Black staffer was  under lockdown for 6 hours during the insurrection and was so disturbed  about these events, she quit her job.   Another staffer who was on the floor of the House that day described  that what happened on January 6 still echoes in his mind. Listen to him  describe the moments just before this indelible image.   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. I heard blasts, and I could see the       window panes on the House main door sort of pop, and I       figured that, you know, obviously I knew they were at the       door, and they figured out a way to break the glass. And the       last thing I remember before I walked off the floor was       several police officers had drawn their guns and had their       guns trained on the door.        Clearly, it was--I didn't think there was anything else I       could do, and I didn't want to be there for what was about to       occur. So I got to the top of the stairs. The stairway was       pretty packed, and right about that point, I don't know       whether it was a police officer or somebody else said, ``They       are right behind us. Run.''        For me, what I keep thinking about--and, again, there isn't       a day that has gone by since January 6 that at some point in       the day I haven't kind of gone back and picked up some little       thing, but the sound of those window panes popping, I won't       forget that sound.    ``I won't forget that sound.'' How long will the sound of window  panes breaking haunt this staffer? And he isn't alone. There are  countless people still living with the trauma of what happened that  day. This includes, by the way, another group of people who were with  us in the Capitol that day, and that is the press. They were in danger,  particularly after years of being derided by President Trump as fake  news.   Kristin Wilson, a reporter for CNN, recently tweeted about her  experience. She said:         I have 14 people on my team. We were scattered everywhere.       Two of them were on crutches and couldn't have run if they       had to. They had to anyway.        One was trapped in the House Chamber and had to crawl out       to hide.        Four of us barricaded ourselves in a room off the Senate       Chamber. Every bang on the door of them trying to come       through I can still hear in my head.    The janitorial and custodial staff in the Capitol, the people who day  after day tend to our home away from home, were also traumatized, but  we don't talk about them and the harm they suffered often enough.   One janitorial worker recounts how he was so scared, he had to hide  in the closet during the attack. He said:         I was all by myself. I didn't know what was going on.    Another employee, a mother of three, said:         The insurrection shattered all my sense of security at       work.    An employee of the Capitol said:         I hope nothing else happens because these people were       talking about killing us, killing Federal employees, killing       the police.    Another employee was afraid to work on Inauguration Day, saying:         I honestly fear for my life. I've got two children at home.    For many of the Black and Brown staff, the trauma was made worse by  the many painful symbols of hate that were on full display that day.  Insurrectionists waved Confederate flags and hurled the most disgusting  racial slurs at dedicated Capitol workers.   Then, after all of that, these same workers, many of them people of  color, were forced to clean up the mess left by mobs of White  nationalists. One member of the janitorial staff reflected how terrible  he felt when he had to clean up feces that had been smeared on the  wall, blood of the rioter who had died, broken glass, and other objects  strewn all over the floor. He said:         I felt bad. I felt degraded.    Let's also not forget that this violent attack happened in the middle  of a  [[Page S656]]  global pandemic. Social distancing was impossible because we were  hiding for our lives in cramped quarters for long periods of time.  Since January 6, at least seven Members who hid with other Members of  Congress have tested positive for COVID-19.   At least 38 Capitol Police officers have either tested positive or  been exposed, and nearly 200 National Guard troops, who were deployed  to our Nation's Capital to provide all of us protection, have tested  positive. The Capitol Police and the National Guard came here to keep  us safe, to serve. They put their lives in danger. They deserve better  than this. We all did.   That brings me to the next harm. Now, all of us in this room made it  out alive, but not everyone was so lucky. Three law enforcement  officers tragically lost their lives as a result of the riot on January  6. These officers were Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, Capitol  Police Officer Howard Liebengood, and Metropolitan Police Officer  Jeffrey Smith. All honorably served to protect and defend.   My colleague Mr. Swalwell told you about Officer Sicknick, who was a  42-year-old military veteran who dedicated his entire life to public  service. On January 6, he fought a mob of rioters as they streamed into  the Capitol and ultimately lost his life protecting us.   Officer Liebengood was a 15-year veteran of the Capitol Police. His  father served as Sergeant at Arms here in the Senate, and Officer  Liebengood followed his extraordinary example of public service.   Officer Smith served 12 years with the Metropolitan Police  Department. He heeded the call of January 6 by coming to stand with  Capitol Police to help secure our democracy.   Earlier, my colleague Manager Swalwell showed you terrible videos of  the police being physically abused and injured. You remember what  happened to Officer Fanone and Officer Hodges of the MPD, but there  were scores of other officers whose names we don't know who were also  brutalized that day. Injuries to the U.S. Capitol Police and the  Metropolitan Police Department were concussions, irritated lungs, and  serious injuries caused by repeated blows from bats, poles, and clubs.   Capitol Police officers also sustained injuries that will be with  them for the rest of their lives. One officer lost the tip of a right  index finger.   In a statement issued on January 7, the chairman of the Capitol  Police Officers' Union said:         I have officers who were not issued helmets prior to the       attack who have sustained brain injuries. One officer has two       cracked ribs and two smashed spinal discs. One officer is       going to lose his eye, and another was stabbed with a metal       fence stake.    In total, at least 81 members of Capitol Police and of 65 members of  the Metropolitan Police Department were injured during the attack on  January 6.   Former Capitol Police Chief Sund described the insurrection as  violent, unlike anything he had seen in his 30-year career in law  enforcement.   DC Police Chief Robert J. Contee III, who had spoken with an officer  who had been beaten and injured with a stun gun, said:         I've talked to officers who have done two tours of Iraq who       said this was scarier to them than their time in combat.    Of course, the physical violence is not the only thing that will have  a lasting effect on our brave sworn officers. Trump's mob verbally  denigrated their patriotism, questioned their loyalty, and yelled  racial slurs. They called them ``traitors,'' ``Nazis,'' ``un-American''  for protecting us.   For example, in our next clip, a rioter wearing a hunting jacket  accosts a police officer.   (Text of video presentation:)         Unidentified Speaker. Are you an American? Act like one.       (Inaudible.)        Unidentified Speaker. Don't yell at them.        Unidentified Speaker. You have no idea what the fuck you're       doing.        Unidentified Speaker. Now once again (inaudible). Not one       idea.        Unidentified Speaker. Stand up for America. Goddamn it.        Unidentified Speaker. Get the fuck out of here.        Unidentified Speaker. Don't talk to me, motherfucker.        Unidentified Speaker. No, they work for us. Fuck them.    Listen to how the Trump mob talked to these officers. You heard that  with your own ears.   (Text of video presentation:)         Unidentified Speaker. Fuck you. Fuck you, bitch. Fuck you.       Fucking traitors. You are fucking.        Unidentified Speaker. You call me a motherfucker.        Unidentified Speaker. You are a fucking traitor to your       country. You are a fucking traitor.        Unidentified Speaker. Yeah, traitor.        Unidentified Speaker. Fucking call me a (inaudible).        ``F'ing traitor''--so much for backing the blue.    Just a couple more examples.   (Text of video presentation:)         Unidentified Speaker. Hand over your paycheck. Fuck you       guys. You can't even call yourself American. You broke your       fucking oath today. 1776, bitch.        Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible) pepper spray, officers.        (People chanting: ``Traitor.'')        (People chanting: ``Go home.'')        (People chanting: ``Fight for Trump.'')        (People chanting: ``Traitor.'')    They called law enforcement officers ``traitors.'' You have to  wonder, who are these rioters sworn to? To whom do they believe the  police owe their loyalty? To the people? To the Constitution? To our  democracy? Or to Donald Trump?   Even those who were not outwardly injured, the mental toll has been  significant. Several Capitol Police officers have reportedly threatened  self-harm in the days following the riot. And in one case, an officer  voluntarily turned in her gun because she was afraid of what might  happen.   Black police officers were also met with racist vitriol. You heard  Lead Manager Raskin reference a Black police officer who was weary from  racialized violence that he had experienced that day, saying:         Tears just started streaming down my face. I said, ``what       the eff, man? Is this America?''    ``Is this America?'' Lead Manager Raskin asked: ``Is this America?''  What is your answer to that question? Is this OK? If not, what are we  going to do about it?   These people matter--these matter who risked their lives for us. So I  ask you, respectfully, to consider them--the police officers, the staff  of this building--when you cast your vote. These people are in deep  pain because they showed up here to serve, to serve the American  people, to serve their government, to serve all of us. And I ask each  of you when you cast your vote to remember them and honor them and act  in service of them, as they deserve.   I also want to recognize that fou individuals--four insurrectionist-- also lost their lives during the attack. These people were led here by  the words and actions of an individual who made them believe that they  were patriots.    The loss of human life is, of course, the most consequential, but  that was not the only damage brought that day. The Trump mob also  damaged this building. They defiled some of the most sacred places:  Statuary Hall, the Rotunda, where some of America's greatest champions,  Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, civil rights heroes, and other  defenders are honored after their death. Trump's violent mob had little  respect for this place.   This video shows the wreckage left in the Senate Parliamentarian's  office by the insurrectionists.   (Text of video presentation.)   A bust of President Zachary Taylor was smeared with what appeared to  be blood. An empty picture frame presumably robbed of its content was  found on the floor. And videos of the insurrection captured one man  stealing a framed photo, another one tearing a scroll from the wall and  ripping it up and throwing those pieces on the floor. A sign paying  tribute to John Lewis was also shamefully destroyed, and only a broken  piece of the memorial was found on the ground next to a trash can. The  photo of Mr. Lewis was gone.   The damage done to this building is a stain on all of us and on the  dignity of our democracy.   The attack we saw had a purpose: Stop the certification. Stop our  democratic process. Fortunately, they did not prevail.   Newspapers across America on January 21, the day after the  inauguration, proclaimed:         Democracy has prevailed.    President-Elect Biden said that in his inauguration speech. The  headline was  [[Page S657]]  in so many places because the world's oldest constitutional democracy  and the principles underlying it had been attacked and challenged.   This wasn't just an attack on the Capitol Building and the dedicated  people inside. It was an attack on what we were elected to preserve-- our democracy.   This attack on our elections, on the peaceful transfer of power from  one President to the next didn't even happen during the Civil War. But  it did just happen because of the cold, calculated, and conspiratorial  acts of our former President Donald J. Trump.   We showed you that the insurrectionists were deliberate, that they  came looking for Vice President Pence and Speaker Pelosi, ready to  kill. When President Trump incited a lawless mob to attack our process,  he was attacking our democracy. He was trying to become King and rule  over us, against the will of the people and the valid results of the  election.   For the first time ever in our history, a sitting President actively  instigated his supporters to violently disrupt the process that  provides for the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the  next.   Think about that for a moment. What if President Trump had been  successful? What if he had succeeded in overturning the will of the  people and our constitutional processes? Who among us is willing to  risk that outcome by letting Trump's constitutional crimes go  unanswered?   The Founders included impeachment in our Constitution, not as a  punishment but to prevent. We have to prevent every President--today,  tomorrow, or anytime in the future--from believing that this conduct is  acceptable.   Today, we have to stand up for our democracy and ensure we remain a  country governed by the people, for the people by telling Donald Trump  and people all across this country and all across the world that his  crimes will not and cannot stand.
