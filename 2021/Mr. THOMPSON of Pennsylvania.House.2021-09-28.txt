 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, we  remembered the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. I rise  today to remember the innocent lives that we lost.   At 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 flew into tower one of the  World Trade Center. Not long after, Flight 175 roared over lower  Manhattan into tower two.   While Americans around the country were grappling with the events  that had just transpired, a third plane, Flight 77, crashed into the  Pentagon, the center of our Armed Forces and national defense.   In southwest Pennsylvania, the fourth flight, United 93, originally  headed to San Francisco, was hijacked and made the abrupt turn toward  Washington, D.C. But because of the brave passengers and crew members  who attempted to take back the plane, it crashed into a field in  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Now, I had the humbling opportunity to join over 450 family members  of United Flight 93 passengers and crew members at the memorial site on  the 20th anniversary of that tragic day. During the ceremony, we heard  from Captain Kurtz, USS Somerset; Governor Wolf; Gordon Felt, brother  of Edward Porter Felt, who perished in the crash; Secretary of the  Interior Deb Haaland, Vice President Kamala Harris; and former  President George W. Bush.    The ceremony was a chance to reflect on the events of that fateful  day and to honor the lives lost and the heroes that united us.   In the days, weeks, months, and now two decades that followed  September 11, our country joined together to face the very evil which  attempted to take us down.   We will forever be indebted to our servicemen and -women who joined  the fight to protect our freedoms. We must remember the sacrifices made  by our servicemembers and the first responders and their families every  day since.   While today's world has grown no less dangerous, we, as Americans,  are resilient. We will continue to fight the evil and terror that  exists today, and we will continue to be a beacon of freedom to the  world.   Let us reflect on the gift of life so tragically lost at the World  Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a  field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Let us honor the memory of every American who perished on that  fateful day. Their legacies will be forever entwined with the strength  and courage that define our great country.   We will never forget, not 20 years later, not ever. May God continue  to watch over our first responders, our men and women in uniform, and  all those who keep us safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for the Bureau of Prisons Reform Caucus and my thanks to  Chairman Fred Keller.   Earlier today, I participated in a meeting discussing the important  issues and the goals of the caucus, which are aimed at improving and  enhancing the existing relationship between Congress and the Federal  Bureau of Prisons. This is done through increased communications,  transparency, and efficiency.   Mr. Speaker, I represent two Federal prisons: Federal Correctional  Institution Loretto, located in Loretto, Pennsylvania, and Federal  Correctional Institution McKean, located in Lewis Run, Pennsylvania. It  is critical Congress continues to support these hardworking men and  women at these Federal institutions.   As a member of the Bureau of Prisons Reform Caucus, I will work to  oversee the implementation of the programs laid out in our legislation.   From improving staffing conditions to implementing the First Step Act  to expanding current technical educational opportunities for inmates as  they look to find a better place in society, it is important we  understand the actions taking place in our Federal prison system.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this caucus continues to meet and  improve the relationship between Congress and the Federal Bureau of  Prisons.
