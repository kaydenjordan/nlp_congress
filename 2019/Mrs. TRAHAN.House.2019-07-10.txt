 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this year's  National Defense Authorization Act. This bill addresses many critical  components of our national defense, including the urgent need to tackle  sexual assault across the United States military.   Recent years have seen significant progress towards reforming how  sexual assault claims are handled. Now it is time for Congress to  confront the conditions that allow sexual assault to happen in the  first place.   We have an obligation to protect and safeguard those who answer the  call to service and wear the uniform of the United States. It is not  good enough merely to have the best training and equipment on the  battlefield; we must also protect our soldiers on base or wherever they  are.   This NDAA includes an amendment I coauthored that does just that by  directing the Secretary of Defense to create a civilian advisory  committee on sexual assault prevention in the military. This committee  would be comprised of civilians with expertise in campus sexual assault  prevention, suicide prevention, public health, and perhaps, most  importantly, culture change of large organizations.   We absolutely can make more meaningful progress to make military  sexual assault a thing of the past. I am glad that opportunity is  reflected in the NDAA before us now. I urge support of this bill.
