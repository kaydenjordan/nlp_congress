 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the body and my colleagues  for joining me today in highlighting the negative impact that  continuing resolutions have on our Nation's military, on our national  security, and on how this Nation addresses the challenges in our  military.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, I would argue that, if you were to come up with  a way not to run a government, if you were to come up with a way not to  run a business, you would come up with a continuing resolution.   We know how problematic those continuing resolutions are for this  Nation. They damage our military readiness. They damage us being able  to make long-term decisions. They put our sailors, our marines, our  soldiers, and our airmen at risk.   This is not the way for this Nation to do business. Yet, year after  year after year, we find ourselves without appropriations bills being  done on time. We find ourselves facing government shutdowns. We find  ourselves passing continuing resolutions in order to continue  government operations.   This is not the way for us to conduct this Nation's business. It is  not what our military needs. It is not what we must do to make sure  there is certainty in the future for what this Nation must do under  Article I, Section 8 of our Constitution.   I have been asked by a number of folks why we need to spend these  dollars on our Nation's military, especially to you, Rob Wittman,  because you are a fiscal hawk. Tell us why the spending is necessary.   Well, I can say this: We have been through, now, almost 8 years of  the continuing resolution facade that is brought to us under the guise  of sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was supposed to be the  avenue to make the tough decisions on spending in this body. Yet, that  didn't happen. And here we are, facing these automatic budgets cuts  every year for our Nation's military.   Instead of making those tough decisions or setting the sequester  aside, we find ourselves in a situation where, each year, it is another  continuing resolution.   I would argue that this is absolutely avoidable. It is avoidable by  this body making decisions on time to get appropriations bills passed  out of the House, get all those done prior to this body going home for  August recess. I want to make sure that those things get done.   I have come to the realization, too, that this body has a variety of  choices. It can make the choice to properly fund our Nation's military.  It can make the choice to get appropriations bills done on time. It can  make the choice to avoid this.   I would argue that, in order to become a more effective and efficient  government, these choices have to be made. I would argue that it is  actually Members of Congress who should suffer  [[Page H7675]]  the consequences if these decisions aren't made on time. That is, if  all 12 appropriations bill aren't done out of the House, I think  Members should have to stay in town until it is done. I think we  shouldn't get to go home on August recess until all 12 appropriations  bills are done.    Our men and women in the military are required to do the job on time,  and it is a performance standard. They don't get to go on leave unless  the mission is accomplished. It should be the same for Members of  Congress.   It is also about making priority decisions, Mr. Speaker. Look at what  this body has to do, and we absolutely have to perform our  constitutional duty. We have to get appropriations bills done to fund  our military. We have to make sure we do that in context of also  addressing the deficit and the debt.   I would make arguments that we have seen that situation the last  several years where it is a matter of priorities. It is a matter of  looking at getting both things done, but doing that in a timeframe.   If you look at what a homeowner might face, let's say a homeowner  owns a two-story home and they find themselves in this situation. They  find themselves, as they drive up the driveway, knowing that their  house has termites rife through the foundation, knowing that before  they got home. But as they pull up in the driveway, they find that the  second floor of their home is on fire.   Now, that homeowner, we know, is going to make a priority decision,  like everybody else, and say: Well, what am I going to do? Am I going  to put the second floor fire out, or am I going to address the  termites?   Well, everybody knows they are going to put the fire out on the  second floor. They are going to call the fire department. They are  going to do everything they can to address the significance and the  priority of the situation that they face in front of them. Then they  will make sure that they call the pest exterminator to come in and get  rid of the termites.   That is the same situation this Congress finds itself in, to make  sure that we take care of the most pressing issue before us as a  priority. That is funding our Nation's military, restoring readiness,  stopping continuing resolutions, making decisions on appropriations on  time, getting that done before the end of the fiscal year so we don't  have to do a continuing resolution.   But it doesn't in any way, shape, or form change the scenario that we  face with the termites in the foundation. The termites in the  foundation of this Nation are our deficit and our debt, and those  things, too, must be done. They are also a priority, just not quite as  immediate as restoring military readiness, as bringing in the fire  department to put out the second floor fire.   For us, the analogy to the fire department is us getting our job done  on time, because there is immediacy to that. There is that requirement  that we take on the lack of military readiness in this Nation, the  challenges that we face.   It is not coming just from this body, Mr. Speaker. It is coming from  Secretary James Mattis. In January of this year, Secretary Mattis said  this: As hard as the last 16 years have been, no enemy in the field has  done more to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined  impact of the Budget Control Act's defense spending cuts and operating  under continuing resolutions. Those two, added together, create the  situation we find ourselves in today.   Mr. Speaker, don't think that our adversaries don't look at that and  chuckle a little bit and say this is an entirely avoidable situation.  This is a situation that the United States has put itself in, that  Congress has put itself in. Don't think that our adversaries haven't  taken advantage of that.   Don't think that China doesn't look at this and go: Wow, here is our  chance to catch up. Here is our chance to put resources in the right  places to gain on the technological front.   In addition to what they steal from us, they also take advantage of  this disparity in what we are not doing to rebuild this Nation's  military readiness and use this opportunity not only to catch up with  us but, in many areas, to surpass us.   The same with Russia. While Russia's economy is much smaller, when we  mark time, when we stop making progress in rebuilding our Nation's  military, when we don't properly fund training, when we don't properly  maintain the equipment that we have, it gives our adversaries an  advantage. Don't think that Russia hasn't taken the same advantage of  this situation to not only catch up and, in other areas, surpass us,  even with the small economy that they have.   The same with North Korea, the same with Iran, the same with anybody  out there that is looking to gain an advantage over the United States.   These continuing resolutions that have happened over the past 9 or 10  years have left us in that situation, where we have allowed training to  atrophy. We have seen that manifest itself in military units not having  the joint training opportunities that they need to have the skills  necessary, so that, if we call them into action, they can go with the  full scope of abilities to take on any challenge that they may face.   We have an obligation as a Nation to make sure that they have the  best training and the best opportunities available, to make sure that  they can face their adversaries, that they can fight to victory, and  that they can come home safe. We owe them nothing less than that.   Continuing resolutions take resources away from that. They create  uncertainty for military leaders to know: Will I have the resources to  put in place the training? Will I have the simple elements of training?  Will I have the fuel? Will I have the ammunition to make sure that it  is a meaningful training exercise?   Those things are lacking when you have a continuing resolution. The  automatic budget cuts that come from sequester also add to that.   When you look at our military hardware and look at the time that it  needs to be maintained to make sure it is in working order, so that  when our men and women in the military need it, when we ask them to go  into harm's way, they have systems that work, they have systems that  function at the highest level to make sure that they are successful. If  we skip maintenance availabilities, if we skip the time necessary, if  we delay maintenance, we place risk right there in the hands of our  soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen.    We have seen, over the past 10 years, our force structure rapidly  diminishing. We see our force structure in the Navy going from 11  carriers down to nine carriers. That is going to happen over the next  30 years because we haven't made the commitment to make sure that we  are building carriers faster than we are retiring them.   We also have to make sure that we are maintaining those ships. That,  too, lends itself to problems--ships having to be in port longer when  we do maintain them because more things have gone wrong, because we  have missed maintenance opportunities.   Our attack submarine force structure is going to be reduced by 20  percent over the next 10 years while, at the same time, our adversaries  are building more submarines. They have submarines with greater  capabilities.   We are missing an opportunity there to do what we need to do as a  Nation. I want to make sure that we are doing those things, and I am  going to talk a little bit later on about the specifics about where  just the Chinese are surpassing our capabilities there within the  submarine realm. We have superiority in the undersea world, but it  doesn't come automatically. It doesn't come without commitment. It  doesn't come without investment.   Those things absolutely have to happen, Mr. Speaker, in the years to  come and, I would argue, not just the years to come, in the days to  come, as we look at the National Defense Authorization Act that,  hopefully, will come up tomorrow in the conference report for this body  to pass, as well as an appropriations bill that will come up that,  hopefully, we will get passed here. If not, we will face more  continuing resolutions.   Now, I know my colleagues who are here with me today express the same  reservations about the impact of continuing resolutions. I am honored  to have with us today the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), and I  yield to the gentlewoman for her perspective  [[Page H7676]]  on what impacts continuing resolutions have on this Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, and I  would like to ask that she maybe elaborate a little bit more.   I think the gentlewoman brings up a great point about the impact on  the Air Force, with Luke Air Force Base being there in her district,  and the impact on airmen, the impact on the job that they do. I would  love to have her share a little bit more about the conversations that I  know she has had a lot with members of the military back in her  district, but especially there at Luke Air Force Base, maybe elaborate  a little bit more on the specific impacts that they deal with on a  daily basis there at Luke Air Force Base.    Mr. Speaker, I agree fully with the gentlewoman from  Arizona, and I thank her so much for being part of this Special Order  this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I think there are a number of important points that the  gentlewoman from Arizona brings up. And she talks about training. I  think training is one of those elements that is absolutely essential  for us to remember that that training doesn't happen by accident. It  happens because of concerted efforts here in Congress, within the  Pentagon, within the service branches, all the way down to the unit  level to make sure that training takes place.   But it doesn't take place when there is uncertainty about funding,  because what is the first thing in a budget that gets put on hold when  it pertains to our service branches? When they look at uncertainty,  what is the place where they have the maximum flexibility? It is  training.   When you look at it, they have money that is already obligated in  programs to do things like build ships, to build aircraft, but the one  place where they can move money around is for training. I can tell you  that that has a tremendous impact on units at the unit level,  commanders trying to figure out: How am I going to make sure my units  get the training?   As I spoke of earlier, it is not just about tactical training; it is  about training at the strategic level. How do you interact with other  service branches so, if you find yourselves in a major conflict, you  can work across service branches to make sure you have the proficiency  to be successful on that mission, to be successful in battle?   Those things are critical, and that doesn't come automatically. That  comes with repeated training at the highest levels, and it comes with  assurance that the resources are going to be there so our military  leaders can plan for that. We want to make sure that that gets done on  a timely basis.    I understand, too, that there is a lot of hesitancy in folks to say:  Well, if we can't reach a conclusion on spending decisions, then the  best thing to do is a continuing resolution.   I would argue that that is not the case. I would argue that this goes  right down to the command level. It goes to our combatant commanders  who have to deal with this every day.   Our combatant commanders are faced with threats that are on their  doorstep every day, and there is no place where this threat is more  apparent on a daily basis than what our Pacific Command faces with the  aggression of the Chinese, with the aggression of North Korea there in  the Pacific.   Admiral Harris, the previous Commander of PaCOM, I think said it  extraordinarily well. He said this:   ``The Pacific is the principal space where submarines are the most  important warfighting capability we have. As far as Virginia-class  submarines, it is the best thing we have. . . . My submarine  requirement is not met in the Pacific Command, and I am just one of  many combatant commanders that will tell you that. . . . ''   That brings us back to the subject of submarines. Attack submarines,  our ability to go undetected around the world to sense what our  adversaries do and also to understand that that threat is real, we  have, today, an advantage in the undersea world, but that advantage  continues to wane because we are not making the progress in keeping up  with building submarines in relation to retiring submarines. That, I  think, is key, Mr. Speaker.   I want to point to this chart on the floor. I am going to walk there.   As we see from the chart, we see the U.S. fleet of attack submarines,  and we see what happens when we come to 2029. We reach a low point, a  low point where this Nation only has 42 attack submarines when we get  to 2029.   You see the chart where our adversaries go. You see where the Chinese  [[Page H7677]]  go: a significant increase in submarines because they see the value of  submarines; they see that attack submarines give them a strategic  advantage in the Pacific.   It is pretty simple, folks. It is a geography lesson.   The Pacific is water, and in order to maintain strategic importance  in that region, you have to control the undersea domain. The Chinese  understand that. We used to understand it, until now, when we see that  our attack submarine force is going down to a low of 42 submarines. We  don't get back to where we need to be to get anywhere close to the  Chinese until 2050.   Now, what happens in the meantime when the Chinese now surpass us,  have that strategic advantage? And I would argue, when the Chinese have  that strategic advantage, it will embolden them. They will look at this  as an opportunity to say: Wow. The United States is really not  committed to a naval presence in this area of the world. We are not  only going to express that naval dominance in our territorial waters,  but we are going to even move out into the South China Sea, move into  the Pacific, into the Indian Ocean, even the Atlantic Ocean.   We look at how they are spreading their influence and presence today.  It is all over the world, folks. So our signal that we are sending to  them, saying, ``Hey, we are just not going to build submarines; we are  going to retire them faster than we are building them,'' has an impact.  And it gets exacerbated when we have continuing resolutions or we don't  make the commitment necessary that comes with getting appropriations  bills passed on time. This puts us at a strategic disadvantage.   If you add, now, attack submarines with ballistic missile  submarines--which, by the way, we are starting down the road to build  the replacement for our Ohio-class submarines that are the most  important part of the nuclear triad, I believe, for this Nation--the  delta gets even bigger, because it is going to be all we can do to  build the replacement submarines for the Ohio-class.   But what is happening is that the Chinese are building even more  ballistic missile submarines. So if you add attack submarines and  ballistic missile submarines, you have a number somewhere around 70  total submarines in 2020 that the Chinese will have.   They, potentially, are building at a rate of five to six additional  submarines each year, combined attack submarines and ballistic missile  submarines, which would put them in the realm, by the time we get down  in 2028, well above 100 total submarines, where we are going to be  struggling with our reduction in submarines at 42 and just beginning to  build the new ballistic missile submarine, and in an area where you  hear from Admiral Harris the most requested asset in the United States  military is the attack submarine. It is where we have dominance. It is  where we are yielding dominance with just the Chinese. That doesn't  even include the Russians, who have developed a very advanced ballistic  missile submarine, the Severodvinsk class, that is an extraordinarily  capable submarine.    If we don't have attack submarines to keep up with their submarines,  a nation that has a large stockpile in inventory of nuclear weapons  that are deployed on submarines, then the question becomes: If you  combine that with the Chinese, where does it leave this Nation? It  leaves us with a strategic capability that is lacking in relation to  our adversaries.   And, folks, if you look at times in the history of the world where  there have been conflicts between major powers, those conflicts have  been a result of a major imbalance between those powers.   If we allow this imbalance to continue because Congress goes down the  road of continuing resolutions, which continues to erode the ability  for us to deploy dollars to do things like build submarines, if we  don't get past the sequester, which puts artificial reductions in our  defense budget while, at the same time, our adversaries are increasing  their efforts, we will find ourselves in that situation in the not too  distant future where we say: How did we get here? How did we find  ourselves in this strategic position where our adversaries now don't  have to do a whole lot to surpass us, where we embolden our  adversaries, where we put ourselves in the position where are  adversaries say: It won't take much for us to take on the United States  and do that successfully?   That, I think, is the key of what we have to address.   Mr. Speaker, I want to yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania for  his perspective, because I think he has a very unique perspective not  just on major powers, but specifically on where Russia plays in this.   We talked about China, but I want to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania to get his perspective on how this major power imbalance  affects the United States' security, affects our strategic ability to  deter our adversaries, and I would like to recognize his perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Rothfus).                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  outlining very in-depth the impact that Russia has on the United  States, the responses that are needed to be strong against Russian  aggression, against the things that they are trying to do to  destabilize this Nation.   I appreciate the gentleman's leadership there in pointing that out  and calling everyone to task to make sure that we, as a Nation, are  acting to make sure we are doing the right things, to make sure, too,  we point out past instances where there have been inconsistencies in  how this issue has been addressed with previous administrations.   I deeply appreciate that. I think it is an important part of our  discussion here today about what we have to do to counter those  threats, the obligation this Nation has to counter those threats. The  gentleman has laid it out very plainly, very succinctly, and very  clearly for what the obligation of this Nation is, and calling upon our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be as committed to  countering Russia as we are on this side of the aisle. So I thank the  gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also point out that it is not just the  strategic impact that continuing resolutions and lack of on-time  appropriations bills has on our Nation strategically. We pointed those  out, the threats that are there, but also the impact that it has at the  individual level; the impact that it has on sailors, on soldiers,  marines, and airmen.   We saw this past year in two ship collisions where 17 sailors died on  board the USS Fitzgerald and the USS McCain. And we see that there was  a contributory factor for the lack of training on those ships, the  issues of material readiness on those ships that goes back to  continuing resolutions and not adopting appropriations bills on time.   The uncertainty that comes with that and the lack of resources  dedicated for proper training, for proper maintenance, did have a  contributory effect there. It didn't create the sole impact necessary  for those unfortunate incidents to occur, but it did contribute to  those incidents.   In avoiding continuing resolutions, we can send a clear message to  our men and women in the military, to their families, that this Nation  is committed to their wellbeing; that this Nation is committed to them  getting the mission done; that this Nation is committed to giving them  the best; to give them the tools that they need to succeed; to give  them the ability, when called upon, to fight to victory and come home  safe.   We, as a Nation, owe them nothing less. And when we have continuing  resolutions, or lack of adopting appropriations bills on time, we are  not sending the message to them and their families that we are  committed to reducing their risk. That is key for us to make sure that  we get that done. And it is also a commitment that we have to taxpayers  to assure them that we will spend money efficiently and effectively to  defend this Nation.   Continuing resolutions are not effective or efficient ways to spend  money. Not getting appropriations bills done on time do not allow long- term planning.   And let me tell you, our adversaries long-term plan. And they look at  our lack of long-term commitment here as a vulnerability. And, indeed,  it is. It is a vulnerability not only for our Nation, but it is a  vulnerability that we see manifested in the risks that our sailors,  soldiers, and marines face, and, ultimately, those who gave their lives  in avoidable accidents on board those ships.   It is not just ships, Mr. Speaker. It is also aircraft. We have seen  an inordinate number of aircraft crashes this year and last year that  are associated with lack of maintenance on those aircraft, in some  instances, tangentially associated with training. Those things are  preventable. They are preventable if we adopt appropriations bills on  time for our Nation's defense, and avoid continuing resolutions.   We must make sure that we get that job done on time. And I can tell  you that it is not just Members that see it that way, but it is also  the Speaker. In fact, Paul Ryan was quoted just yesterday saying: ``We  really just want to get the military funded on time, on  [[Page H7679]]  budget, on schedule this year and that's the primary concern.''   He pointed that out because that is the primary concern for what we  are facing with getting appropriations bills done on time. That is the  primary consideration in getting the National Defense Authorization Act  conference report out of the House tomorrow so that it can get over to  the Senate so that they can get it done on time.   If this gets done this year, Mr. Speaker, it will be the soonest it  has been done in almost 30 years.   Why is this year the exception? This should be the rule. We should be  getting these things done early, getting it done in time so that we can  get an appropriations bill done prior to the end of the fiscal year.  Those are obligations that this Nation has to make sure that we get  that done on time.                                time  1930    The NDAA has some very important elements in it this year that are  critical to our Nation's military readiness, critical to our getting  the job done for our men and women in the military, and critical to  making sure that we can counter the threats that we know are there from  our adversaries. It accelerates U.S. efforts to field conventional  prompt strike capability before fiscal year `22. Those things are  critical. That strike capability is the deterrence for our members of  the military. Those things absolutely must happen, and this bill lets  us get that done.   It also focuses on rebuilding the nuclear deterrence of our Nation.  Nuclear deterrence is the way we keep our adversaries at bay; and when  they look at us and don't see a commitment there that is expressed in  getting appropriations bills done on time and having ourselves in these  continuing resolutions debacles year after year after year, they look  at it as a vulnerability.   It also allows us to improve our missile defense. An aging missile  defense, one that in comparison to upgrades by our adversaries, put us  in a terrible strategic position.   Also enhancing our space warfighting. The disparity that we have in  space operations with our adversaries is mind-boggling. The only way  that we close that delta is to make the commitment and put the  resources in place on time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to put in perspective where we are today and the  waste that occurs with a continuing resolution.   I will conclude my remarks with the comments of Secretary Richard  Spencer that he outlined on our behavior that this body has put in  place since 2011. He actually came before the House Armed Services  Committee and said this, he said:         We have put $4 billion in a trash can, poured lighter fluid       on it, and burned it. $4 billion is enough to buy a squadron       of F-35s, two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, 3,000 Harpoon       missiles. It is enough money to buy us additional capacity       that we need today in order to counter the threats that we       find ourselves facing around the world. Instead, it's lost       because of inefficacy in the ways of the continuing       resolution.    Mr. Speaker, this is an entirely avoidable situation, one that  Congress year after year after year finds itself in a position to  address, yet chooses not to. It is not just a single continuing  resolution. Last year we found ourselves in a situation of having four  continuing resolutions that took us 6 months into the budget year and  then finally coming up with an appropriations bill that finished the  year with 6 months of funding that was supposed to take place over 12  months.   So, Mr. Speaker, not only did you miss out on the certainty with the  first 6 months of funding that was done by continuing resolutions, but  now you take 12 months' worth of money and try to pack it into 6  months, and we wonder why there is inefficiency there. We wonder why  money is pushed out the door in ways that waste money.   The Secretary of the Navy pointed it out and showed us the ills of  our ways, and what we can do to avoid this, what we can do to make sure  that resources will get to the right place, get there on time, can be  efficiently deployed where there is certainty in what our military  needs to plan for the long-term needs that this Nation has left  unaddressed, for the long-term needs of rebuilding readiness.   It hasn't happened, Mr. Speaker, and it is entirely avoidable. We  have that full ability in our grasp to make sure this doesn't happen  again.   Again, if we were to come up with the worst way to run a business and  with the worst way to run a government, it would be a continuing  resolution. It is avoidable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues that when the National Defense  Authorization Act conference report comes up before this body that they  vote ``yes,'' that we do that this year in the quickest timeframe we  have done in nearly 30 years.   And that when the Defense Appropriation bill comes before this body-- after the Senate puts together whatever they will put together--that we  must get the defense of this Nation funded prior to the end of the  budget year.   If we do that, then the 17 billion additional dollars that we put  towards helping our soldiers, our sailors, our marines to do the job we  ask them to do will be there. To deter our adversaries around the  world, the resources in order to accomplish that will be there. To do  anything less is a disservice to this Nation. To do anything less is a  disservice to the men and women who serve in our military. To do  anything less is disrespectful to their commitment to our Nation, and  the commitment that their families make to this Nation.   We can do better. We must do better. And we have an opportunity in  the weeks to come to do better.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to show the same kind of commitment for  this Nation's military through no continuing resolutions and through  passing appropriations bills for our defense on time. That same  commitment should be shown by us as the commitment by our brave men and  women in uniform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
