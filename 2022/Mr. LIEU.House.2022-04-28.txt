 Mr. Speaker, under the American Rescue Plan passed by  Democrats and signed by President Biden, more than 7.4 million jobs  were created in the first 14 months of the Biden administration, the  most in U.S. history.   During that time, unemployment dropped to its lowest in over 50  years. Democrats are building a better America for the people.   What are Republicans doing? I don't know. But I do know that  Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently stated that  the Catholic Church is controlled by Satan. She has not yet apologized  for her bigoted remark.   Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorn tried to board a plane with a  gun for a second time. What has Republican leadership done? Nothing.                            ____________________
