 Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office  estimated that 22 million Americans would lose their health insurance  if the Republican bill from last Congress becomes law. Let's don't make  America sick again.   There should be no repeal of health reform without an immediate,  adequate replacement that achieves the same historic goals in coverage,  ensures people with preexisting conditions aren't blocked or priced out  of the market, and that plans cover a basic set of benefits and  consumer protections.   Repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in place will  cause chaos. Millions will lose coverage; the individual insurance  market will be in shambles; doctors, hospitals, and States will lose  billions; and the economy will be hurt. Without health insurance,  people with chronic diseases will lose care and become sicker.   Every major law that Congress has passed needs oversight and revision  to make sure it is as effective as intended. Congress can amend any  law, but doing so in a way that will cause 22 million of the newly  insured people to be without health insurance is just wrong.  [[Page H315]]    I urge my colleagues to stop working against the health of American  people. We should not be making America sick again.                            ____________________
