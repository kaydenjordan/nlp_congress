 Mr. Speaker, tonight children--2, 3, 4 years old--will  sleep alone in cages on American soil.   Yes, the brutality being perpetrated by the United States Government  is about who we are as a country. It is about morality. It is about  humanity. But first, it is about those kids:   The 5-year-old boy from Honduras who collapsed on a kitchen floor in  Michigan, sobbing for his parents;   The mother who had to listen to her 7-year-old daughter frantically  screaming in a detention room next door as she was hauled away;   The 3-year-old boy who was put, inconsolable, on a flight to the  Midwest after his mother was left behind;   A 4-month-old baby ripped from his father's arms.   I don't care what you believe. I don't care who you vote for or what  you think about the nuances of immigration reform. These children-- babies--need to be with their parents, just like every other child in  this country. Anything less is cruelty in its purest form.                            ____________________
