 Madam President, today the Senate will consider the  nomination of Kenneth Marcus to serve as the Department of Education's  Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights. His resume includes degrees from  Williams College and the California Berkeley School of Law, and his  career has spanned private practice and public service, with  considerable experience in government. I look forward to voting to  confirm Mr. Marcus later today.   Then, the Senate will resume consideration of the John S. McCain 2019  National Defense Authorization Act. It is the result of serious  bipartisan work over the past several months.   Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have engaged in candid  discussions with our Nation's top military leaders. They have heard  about the pressing needs of the men and women who serve in harm's way:  greater readiness, enhanced weapons capabilities in the air and on the  seas, simpler processes for acquisition, and more support for military  families.   This week we have already discussed the array of global challenges  that face our Nation at this critical moment. This NDAA will help to  equip our troops with the latest training and the best technology to  confront those challenges and to keep us safe.   It is also important to reflect on all that this legislation will do  for our warfighters and their families here at home. It will increase  base pay for servicemembers by 2.6 percent, the largest annual raise in  nearly a decade. It authorizes new resources for family housing  construction, improved care for servicemembers' children with severe  disabilities, and programs to better manage opioid prescriptions in the  military health system.   It will authorize continued operations at military posts across our  country that build up our Nation's security and form the backbone of  local communities.   The servicemembers who serve at Kentucky's Army installations and in  the Kentucky Air and Army National Guard are critical to our overall  national defense strategy. I am proud to represent them here in the  Senate.   Fort Campbell is home to the 101st Airborne Division and a number of  Special Operations units. In recent years, many of these servicemembers  have seen a near-constant cycle of deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.   The NDAA ensures that they are not forgotten. Fort Knox hosts the  Army's Human Resources Command and Recruiting Command, where the NDAA  will help to modernize officer personnel management, and this year's  legislation paves the way for new construction projects at both these  facilities.   In Madison County, the Blue Grass Army Depot is responsible for  storing and demilitarizing conventional and legacy chemical weapons. It  is a top-of-the-line facility, integral to our national security.  Passing this NDAA will help to ensure that it can continue safe and  effective operations.   It is my privilege to represent the men and women of the Kentucky Air  and Army National Guard, including the 123rd Airlift Wing. This  legislation will reaffirm our commitment to these citizen soldiers and  airmen who are always ready to respond to emergencies at home or  threats from abroad.   Kentucky is indeed proud of our men and women in uniform. When I vote  for this Defense bill, I will be casting my vote for them.                            ____________________     Madam President, 16 months ago, President Trump and  Republican majorities arrived in Washington with clear instructions  from the American people: Get the Federal Government out of the way. A  decade of Democratic control meant that taxes were too high,  regulations were too burdensome, and America was too difficult a place  to start a small business or hire more workers.  [[Page S3270]]    Republicans heard our marching orders loud and clear. We used the  Congressional Review Act a record 16 times to root out invasive rules  that tripped up small businesses. We uprooted key pieces of ObamaCare  and Dodd-Frank that had burdened the middle class, and we delivered a  long-overdue, comprehensive overhaul of America's Tax Code. It is  helping to rejuvenate the economy and is letting American families keep  more of what they earn.   Today, under this Republican government, the U.S. economy is  healthier than it has been in a long time. We have the lowest  unemployment in 18 years, and more open positions than workers seeking  jobs for the first time since the Labor Department started collecting  these data. There is record levels of optimism among small businesses  and manufacturers. More Americans are saying that now is a good time to  find a quality job than at any point in the last 17 years.   In the Obama years, prosperity was slower in coming. Opportunities  were comparatively few, and what limited growth did occur flowed  disproportionately into America's very biggest urban centers.   Now our economy is starting to work better for all kinds of  communities. I recently heard a few inspiring stories from my friend  Senator Portman. In Zanesville, OH, the owners of GKM Auto Parts spent  much of the last decade watching health insurance premiums soar. By  2016 they could no longer support coverage for their employees, but as  Senator Portman recently explained, one of the first things the company  was able to do following the passage of historic tax reform last year  was to restore that coverage.   He also shared that builders and manufacturers across his State, from  Wolf Metals in Columbus to Advanced Industrial Roofing in Massillon,  are increasing pay and benefits, investing in equipment, and creating  jobs as a direct result of tax reform and this pro-growth economic  climate.   We are hearing stories like these from every corner of our country.   American workers and job creators are turning the page on the last  decade and writing brand-new success stories, and Republican policies  are helping to make that happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
