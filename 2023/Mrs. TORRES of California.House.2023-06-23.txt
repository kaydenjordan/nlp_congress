 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand the  release and safe return of Jamshid Sharmahd.   Mr. Sharmahd, a U.S. national and the father of one of my  constituents, was unlawfully arrested and imprisoned in Iran 3 years  ago in retaliation for simply doing his job as an independent  journalist.   Following a sham trial that was condemned by international human  rights groups, Mr. Sharmahd was sentenced to death. Mr. Sharmahd was  convicted in an Iranian court of ``corruption on Earth,'' a nonsense  charge designed only to imprison and execute political dissidents.   He deserves to be reunited with his daughter in Ontario, California.   Mr. Speaker, I call on the State Department and the White House to do  [[Page H3134]]  everything in their power to free Mr. Sharmahd and ensure his safe  return.                            ____________________
