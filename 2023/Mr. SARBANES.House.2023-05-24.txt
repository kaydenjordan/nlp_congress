 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  resolution, which threatens the financial well-being of millions of  Americans, including more than 260,000 hardworking public servants who  have achieved or are working to achieve student loan relief under the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.   In 2007, I authored the PSLF program to help relieve the burden of  student loan debt for public servants who contribute so much to our  communities but often receive far less pay and fewer benefits than  their private sector counterparts.   Under PSLF, these individuals--teachers, first responders, community  health and social workers, service members and more--are eligible for  forgiveness of their remaining federal student loan balances after  completing 10 years of public service and making 120 qualifying  payments on their loans.   I am pleased that the Biden Administration has made changes to  strengthen PSLF and other student loan programs.   Unfortunately, the resolution before us today would reverse that  progress, causing significant confusion and financial stress for these  individuals.  [[Page H2571]]    By rolling back recent regulations, this resolution could put  millions of Americans in financial jeopardy, forcing them to make  payments on loans they had been told were on pause. It would also delay  PSLF borrowers from getting their forgiveness and turn back the clock  on those who received loan forgiveness during the payment pause.   This is not only confusing--it is just wrong. Rather than renege on  the promise we made to these individuals, we must do everything we can  to strengthen PSLF to give public service workers the relief they have  earned.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
