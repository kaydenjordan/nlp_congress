 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mark  Davis on the occasion of his retirement.   Mark dedicated over five decades to broadcast journalism, including  an impressive near 37 years with News 8. An award winning-radio news  director in Boston, Mark quickly adapted to TV news when he arrived in  Connecticut. Throughout his career, he set an example with his honest,  unstinting reporting. Mark covered the administrations of seven  Connecticut Governors, always speaking truth to power.   His thorough, efficient responses to stories earned Mark the respect  of his colleagues. Holding himself to the highest standard, Mark was  always a consummate professional. Mark's outstanding and reliable work  leaves a remarkable legacy in Connecticut journalism.   As chief political correspondent, Mark remained nonpartisan while  demonstrating tireless grit. He was courageous and never shied away  from asking the tough questions. At the same time, Mark had an uncanny  ability to put politicians at ease, facilitating discussions and  ensuring he could provide a thoughtful, complete story. Trusted by  constituents, he was voted our State's best local TV reporter 2 years  in a row by Connecticut Magazine.   Mark's exceptional record as an insightful, driven, and honest  reporter leaves a historic mark and emphasizes the vital role he and  his fellow reporters play in keeping people well informed in  Connecticut and across the Nation. His professional partnership with  Joe Sferrazza established a model of unmatched teamwork that will have  an impact for years to come.   I applaud his lifetime of tenacious commitment to comprehensive, fair  work focused on uncovering the truth, and I know my colleagues will  join me in thanking Mark for his extraordinary contributions to  regional reporting.                            ____________________
