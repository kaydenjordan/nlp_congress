 Mr. Speaker, the air, land, and oceans of our Earth are in  mortal danger and must be saved. But it is our oceans that are the most  vast and unknown of these and with the most complex and extensive risk  from climate change, to pollution, extraction, and marine debris.   Debris is especially acute in my own Pacific and its epicenter, the  1,500-mile-long Hawaiian Islands chain, which acts as a giant comb for  all manner of marine trash. Fifty-two metric tons of debris clutter our  Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument annually, with tons more on  the shores of the main Hawaiian Islands.   The results are human health and safety problems, habitat  destruction, wildlife entanglements, vessel damages, navigational  hazards, invasive species transport, and beach and coastline  destruction.   The Save Our Seas 2.0 Act ups our national ante on this critical  issue by bolstering and funding actions that can make a real  difference.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage.
