 Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 1422,  which is a commonsense and, up to now, bipartisan approach to  international tax reform. It simply says that under this budget we  would do international tax reform. It would create incentives to have  more jobs here in this country. Those are incentives for both U.S.  companies and foreign companies to create jobs here in America.   This is not a partisan issue; it has been bipartisan. In fact, it was  part of the Simpson-Bowles provisions with regard to tax reform. Only a  couple of years ago, I cochaired a working group on this issue with the  now minority leader, Senator Schumer, where we came up with a proposal  which said that the international system is broken and that we need to  move to one like the one we are talking about in this amendment that  brings back jobs.   One of the problems is that the current Tax Code actually encourages  companies to keep their money offshore. We think we could bring back a  lot of that money. There is probably $2.5 to $3 trillion locked out  offshore. But it is worse than that. It also leads to American  companies being taken over by foreign companies and these inversions we  have heard so much about. In the last 24 hours, we had another major  inversion. Companies that have household names are picking up and  leaving our country and taking their jobs and investment with them.   This amendment is common sense, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support it.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.    Mr. President, as we have just seen, there is no more  decent or honest Senator in the U.S. Senate than the Senator from  Wyoming who just spoke, and that is why we were able to expedite the  process tonight. It may seem like we are here late, but, frankly, we  all expected to be here until 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning, and instead  we worked things out. He is an example of why we did, both in committee  and on the floor. Senator Enzi was able to work with people, be fair,  honest, and that pays off. It gave everybody a fair shot.   I will also say he has produced a budget that does balance, which I  think most Americans agree with. As he said so well, the budget is a  framework. So the budget itself does not have the specific policies in  it. In fact, those have to go to other committees to be passed and then  will be passed by  [[Page S6634]]  the full Senate and the House and signed into law by the President.   What it does do is it prepares this body to do something really  important and really exciting, and that is the opportunity to reform  our broken Tax Code. It is so important because it will give us a shot  in the arm, in terms of our economy. It will get this economy moving  again, and it is going to help people who have been left behind in this  economy. Really, when we look over the past 15 years, so many people  whom I represent and who are represented by the other Members in this  Chamber have not seen their wages go up. In fact, they have been flat,  and what has gone up are expenses--healthcare expenses more than any,  frankly. It is the biggest single increase people see in their family  budget but also food, medicine, and tuition. We have seen flat wages,  not more take-home pay, and higher expenses.   What we have an opportunity to do in this tax reform bill--that is a  framework, not a mandate--that was made possible by the budget that was  passed tonight is we have set the stage for commonsense tax reform that  is essential to this effort to grow our economy and create more and  better jobs and increased wages for middle-class Americans.   We heard a lot of discussion about it adding to the deficit. I will  just add to what has been said already. If we do this tax reform right,  it will not add to the deficit. In fact, I strongly believe it will  reduce the deficit over the next 10 years. Why do I say that?   I am going to talk for a second about some of the things that are in  good pro-growth tax reform that we are planning to implement that will  actually grow the economy that will result in more economic activity  and more revenue coming into the Treasury.   If you assume, as the Congressional Budget Office does, that we are  only going to grow this economy 1.9 percent, which is a pretty paltry  amount over the next 10 years--way below what the average has been for  the past 30 years--then let's say all this tax reform we are doing only  grows the economy by a little bit more. Let's say .4 percent. So  instead of 1.9 percent, let's grow the economy at 2.3 percent. That is  a conservative estimate, I believe, based on the kinds of things we are  talking about. That will mean we actually not only have a revenue- neutral tax proposal, but we begin paying back some of the national  debt by having the deficit, once again, as it was in the years 2000 and  2001, be on a unified basis at a zero deficit.   This is an exciting opportunity to help people be able to seek their  goals in life but also to actually help with regard to the budget  deficit. I agree with the chairman on that. I think we have an  opportunity, if we do the right tax relief, to really help to get the  budget deficit down.   How does this comprehensive tax reform help the middle class? We  talked a little bit about this today. Some offered amendments. I  offered one with regard to the business tax side of things, but I think  it does it in three ways. First, it immediately helps the family budget  by cutting middle-class taxes. So everything that has been laid out in  terms of the proposals tonight on the tax side, we can talk about the  fact that for families who are working families in this country who are  making $30, $40, $50, $60,000 a year, those folks will see a reduction  in their taxes which will help the family budget.   The Tax Code, of course, is very complicated, too burdensome. One  thing we are proposing is to double the standard deduction. That means  for people who take the deduction now--and about two-thirds of the  people I represent do--they will be able to have a doubling of that,  from $12,000 for a family to up to $24,000 for a family. That is a 0  tax bracket for the first $24,000 in income. That is significant  middle-class tax relief.   Second, we are going to expand the child tax credit. That is really  important, not just to provide relief but to help families with kids be  able to afford childcare.   Finally, we will adjust the bracket so people who are beyond the  standard deduction, double or nothing, and who don't take advantage of  the child tax credit also get tax relief.   So these are ways in which folks are going to see immediate help for  the family budget, but it is more than that. It is more than that.   I think, frankly, the most significant part of this reform is going  to be giving the economy that shot in the arm and helping to increase  jobs and improve wages. That is going to happen, I think, through the  business tax relief that we have talked about. First, with regard to  smaller companies, the so-called passthrough companies, about three- quarters of the companies in America pay their taxes as individuals.  This is the corner drugstore; this is the small manufacturing business  in your town. Those folks are going to see a reduction in their taxes  on their business income so they can invest more in that business and  create more jobs, and a lot of the growth is going to come from these  smaller businesses. That is the 25-percent rate people are talking  about as compared to, say, a 35-percent or higher rate for individuals.  That is something that is fair, in part because we are also going to  lower the rates for people who are in the larger businesses. These are  the C corporations that are being talked about. That rate has to come  down. If it does not, America will continue to lose jobs and investment  overseas, and that is what is happening right now.   Just in the last 24 hours, another major American company announced  that they are inverting; in other words, they are going overseas. Why?  Because of the Tax Code. It is amazing that the Tax Code that this  Congress is responsible for improving is so bad that people are  actually voting with their feet and leaving the country and taking jobs  and investment with them. We have done research on this, we have had  investigations on this, and we know what is happening. We know, as an  example, that because of our Tax Code, there are almost 5,000--4,700  companies just in the last 13 years that have become foreign companies  that otherwise would be American companies. Think about that. That is  the Ernst & Young study we recently saw. This is amazing. We know for a  fact that it is not just about these companies leaving America and  going to other countries and doing these so-called inversions--becoming  a foreign company--but it is also foreign companies coming here and  taking over U.S. companies, and, again, what is happening here is that  jobs and investment are going overseas.   Why is this? Well, it is for a couple of reasons. One is that  American companies now have the highest tax rate in all of the  industrialized world. So the 35-percent tax rate you hear about, that  is a high rate compared to every other country in the world that we do  business with. That is a negative, but it is also how we tax. We tax in  a way that discourages us from bringing profits back to America to the  point that, unbelievably, there is between $2.5 trillion and $3  trillion--and some say more--of earnings stuck overseas, locked out of  America, which could come back here to expand plants, equipment, and  jobs, to actually get this economy moving. This is a huge opportunity  for us. We don't want to see these companies go offshore. We want to  see them come back.   Trade policy is important. Regulations are important. Worker  retraining programs are important. Healthcare cost containment is  important. But nothing is more important than fixing this broken Tax  Code if we are going to see the kind of economic growth and improvement  in wages that we all hope for.   There have been a lot of studies done on this, and they say that we  haven't changed our code since the mid-1980s, but every other one of  our competitors have. They have all lowered their rates, and they have  all gone to a system of taxation that is more efficient to get this  money back to their countries.   In 1986, Ronald Reagan was President. He made some great changes.  That was 31 years ago. Things have changed a lot since then. By the  way, back then Pete Rose was still playing for my Cincinnati Reds. That  is how long ago it was.   It is time for us to update this Tax Code, to modernize it, and to  bring back those jobs and that investment. We can do it. We can do it  because of what happened tonight. This creates the framework for us to  able to do this.   In a recent business roundtable survey of 150 American companies-- these are the CEOs--82 percent said that tax  [[Page S6635]]  reform that we are talking about will prompt them to increase capital  spending. Three-quarters of them--76 percent--said that it is going to  increase hiring. And with this reduced tax burden, businesses are going  to have the money to invest in their workers.   I will tell you, with the tighter job market that is out there now as  the economy has begun to improve, this will increase competition for  workers, and this will increase wages. We know that is going to happen.   Every economist agrees that this kind of tax reform is going to  change behavior. Some might think it doesn't improve the economy as  much as others do, but everyone believes this will incentivize us to  create more jobs and improve wages here in the United States of  America.   There is a group called the Congressional Budget Office, a  nonpartisan group up here that we work with. They have a study that  says that as much as 70 percent of the benefit from that lower  corporate rate is going to go to the workers in terms of higher wages,  better benefits. That is the way we are going to help the middle class  also--not just with regard to the tax relief directly but with regard  to helping to improve job creation and increase wages. So I am excited  about this. I think it can happen. I think it is something that is long  overdue.   I think it is something, frankly, that should be bipartisan. This was  what the Simpson-Bowles proposal, which was a totally bipartisan  proposal, said we ought to do. In fact, they took the top rate down to  28 percent--lower than anybody is talking about here. But they said  that we should go to this kind of taxation we are talking about in  terms of international businesses, in terms of corporations, in terms  of creating jobs.   Two years ago, I worked with Chuck Schumer, who is now the Democratic  leader here in the U.S. Senate, and we were asked to cochair a working  group on taxation--particularly folks on the international side--and we  came up with a consensus, which said that we have to fix this broken  Tax Code. It is not working, and we need to bring this money back. We  need to bring these jobs back by going through this kind of system we  are talking about, a so-called territorial system. In the past, this  has been bipartisan, and my hope is it can be again.   Yes, the budget provides the framework for us to get this done, not  on a 60-vote basis but a 50-vote basis. But we should do it with more  than 60 votes. We welcome input from our Democratic colleagues. I  believe, in the end, this will be bipartisan because I do believe that  the vast majority of Americans out there, as they understand this tax  reform proposal will say: Yes, I think middle-class tax relief makes  sense, and, yes, I think we should be bringing back the jobs and the  investment to this country. I think that is going to be something that  Members will hear across this country and across this aisle. When they  do, I believe we will have the opportunity to have the kind of  commonsense, bipartisan tax reform we need in this country. We need to  do it to be able to have a thriving American middle class, and we need  to do it to have a stronger America.   I am excited about this opportunity. I look forward to working with  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. President, I yield back my time on that, but I have another  matter that I need to do, the closing business.
