 Mr. President, I ask to speak for 1 minute as in  morning business.    Madam President, to commemorate this year's National  Police Week, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators on a resolution to  honor these people who lost their lives in order to protect our lives.  The men and women of law enforcement make sacrifices every day to  protect their families and fellow citizens. We are indebted to their  dedication.   I want to express my appreciation for each and every police officer,  firefighter, first responder, and other law enforcement officers who  work diligently to protect our friends and families.   All of those visiting Washington this week to commemorate National  Police Week, if you get a chance to see them on the streets of  Washington, DC, thank them for their service.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
