 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore my  colleagues to come together and pass a COVID relief bill that will help  communities that are still struggling to recover from this pandemic.   Since the beginning of December, over 150 people a day have died from  COVID-19 in Illinois. Across the Midwest, heat maps are glowing red  with the increased rates of transmissions and deaths. We cannot wait  any longer. Families and small businesses are looking for Congress to  act. Time and time again, we have seen the House take action, only to  have the GOP Senate ignore the crisis facing this country. The increase  in empty chairs around kitchen tables and vacant storefronts will only  continue if we do not take decisive action.   Mr. Speaker, a recent study found that 1 in 3 African Americans know  someone close to them who died of COVID-19. I fall into this category,  as I lost my uncle in May, and I know many of my constituents do as  well. Something has to be done. People need money now to meet their  expenses. Businesses need support now to continue operating, and State  and local governments need assistance now to provide services. Inaction  is not an option.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, I say Happy Hanukkah to all our Jewish friends.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 241.
