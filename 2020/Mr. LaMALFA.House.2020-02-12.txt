 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee  had a hearing on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   In the House, Democratic leadership continues to block the near 80  times that my Republican colleagues and I have tried to consider this  legislation on this floor, let alone even holding a hearing.   I am willing to bet most Americans assume that doctors and nurses  will do everything they can to help a baby that has somehow  miraculously survived an abortion. They would be surprised and sad to  know that that is not always the case.   In 2002, Congress recognized the simple fact that an infant who  survives an abortion is indeed a person. So why is there no legal  protection for those newborn babies who have run the gauntlet, who  survived and have been born alive after a failed abortion attempt?   It is way past the time to hold abortion providers accountable for  ensuring the best possible care for any newborn baby, despite what the  Governor of Virginia might say, regardless of whether that baby  survived an abortion.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, Whip   Steve  Scalise and Representative Ann Wagner, for their great work on this  issue. It is time the House passes this important legislation to  protect the sanctity of innocent newborn life.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from Idaho for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 2546. This package of land bills will  impact California, Colorado, and Washington creating nearly 1.5 million  acres of new wilderness.   H.R. 2250, one bill included in this package will impact northern  California, my area. It adds 262,000 acres of new wilderness  designations, despite concerns from local communities as to how they  would be impacted.   We have seen the devastation that wildfires cause in northern  California time and time again, so why are we putting more land into  this restrictive wilderness category, which will make it even more  difficult to properly manage forests and to access them?   Potential wilderness is typically treated as wilderness anyway, so  you have 51,000 acres that will probably be enforced as if it were  wilderness.   We should be prioritizing forest management, not making it more  difficult for access and the work needing to be done desperately. In  rural northern California, much of the land is already owned by the  Federal Government. The local economies depend on access and use of  these lands to thrive.   Seventy-six percent of Trinity County is controlled by the Federal  Government. Ninety-five percent of the land added to wilderness  designation by 2250 is located there.   The town of Weaverville located in Trinity County has had several  occasions where fire has burned right up to their doorsteps, and even  then, we still pursue endangering them because these lands are not  managed.   Even due to the best efforts of our firefighters, our CCC groups out  there trying get ahead of it, we put ourselves behind by having  wilderness designations that take away options, take away ability to  access and properly manage these lands.   Currently within that county, 520,000 acres, or 25 percent, are  designated as wilderness. It would increase that number to 770,000, or  37 percent of the county.   There are concerns with these lands being designated as wilderness  that should have been addressed with the local communities, ranging  from questions about forest management, grazing implications, to road  decommissioning and stewardship contracts. How does that help the  public have access? How does that help our firefighters and CCC have  access to do the work?   Consensus from these local communities most impacted by these  designations should be a priority. This legislation does not do that.   None of the language changes recommended to help mitigate local  concerns were accepted, so I urge you to vote in opposition.   If it is all about protecting lands, what is it we are actually  protecting when we are endangering them even more so?
