 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  beloved figure in the Senate community, the late Barbara A. O'Malley,  who passed away on January 6.   For three decades, Mrs. O worked in the office of our former  colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. She ran the front  desk, which means I had the pleasure of seeing her regularly on the way  to and from my nearby office. Especially in the mornings, she and I  would chat about the news, the Senate, our families, and whatever else.  She always greeted me with tremendous affection and kindness and baked  some of the most delicious cookies I and my staff have ever had. We  will miss her greatly.   Mrs. O deeply loved her family. She was married to her husband,  Thomas Martin, for 52 years until his death in 2006. Together, they had  six children: Peter, Paul, Patrick, Martin, Eileen, and Bridgett; 15  grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.   She also loved airplanes. While still in high school, she was among  the first women to volunteer for the Civil Air Patrol during World War  II, earning her pilot's license and taking to the skies. Later in life,  she volunteered at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to bring her  love for aircraft and flight to all those who visited.   The saying goes, if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. Mrs.  O proved that wrong. She treated everyone with good will and offered an  important example of friendship to Senators and staff alike. Mrs. O  lived her life in service to her Catholic faith, to her beloved State  of Maryland, and to the Senate. I am proud to have called her a friend.                            ____________________
