 Mr. Speaker, it is National Police Week. After serving in  law enforcement for over 30 years, I can think of no better story to  share today than the story of my family's more than 110 years of law  enforcement service.   It all started with my father, Edwin Nehls, who, after returning home  from Korea as the recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, began  serving with the Dodge County Sheriff's Office in the State of  Wisconsin. He served for over two decades, starting as a traffic deputy  and eventually working his way to serving as the elected sheriff, a  position he held for 8 years.   My older brother Todd Nehls served in the Dodge County Sheriff's  Office for 34 years, serving more than 10 of those years as the elected  sheriff.   And my identical twin brother, Trever Nehls, served in law  enforcement for over 30 years in Fort Bend County, Texas, starting in  the early 1990s. He just retired in March of this year after a  successful career.   I could not be more proud of my father and brothers' service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as a 30-year law enforcement veteran, I have  seen the very best of our law enforcement officers, brave men and women  who put their lives on the line each and every day to protect and serve  our communities.   I have seen law enforcement officers jump into flood waters to save a  pet, run into a fiery crash to save an unconscious victim, resuscitate  and save the life of a criminal who had just tried to shoot and kill  them.   I have also seen the dangers of serving in law enforcement. Hundreds  of law enforcement officers are killed every year in the line of duty  across our country. In 2021, 394 names of law enforcement officers  killed in the line of duty were added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, right here in Washington, D.C., and 59 of those  brave men and women were from my home State of Texas.   How many people in this Chamber or watching at home can name any of  the officers who died in the line of duty this year?   I would say a very small percentage, if any at all.   But how many know the name of George Floyd or Freddie Gray or Breonna  Taylor?   I would say the vast majority.   What does that say about our media? What does it say about our  culture?                                time  1800    I think it is a testament to just how divided our country is today, a  time where some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  actually believe defunding or abolishing the police is a good idea. My  friends, it is not rocket science to conclude that the society, our  society is built on rule of law and it requires law enforcement.   Rather than recognize the bravery and service of the over 800,000 law  enforcement officers in this country who do their job honorably, the  far left has sought to demonize and defund our law enforcement, based  off the actions of a few--a few--who have failed to uphold their oath.   Their hateful rhetoric has led to violence and destruction in cities  across our country. We saw it in Seattle, Minneapolis, Portland. City  blocks burned, businesses destroyed, and lives ruined forever. When  faced with this violence in the streets, the far left doubled down on  their hateful anti-law enforcement rhetoric and encouraged even more  destruction.   It may come as a surprise to many, but there are over 10 million-- yes, 10 million--arrests in our country every year. Most Americans  never hear a word about the millions of arrests that happen without  incident. And why is that? Because it doesn't sell headlines. It  doesn't sell headlines, and it doesn't fit the left's narrative.   Darian Jarrott of New Mexico, Chris Ward of North Carolina, James  Smith of Iowa, and Chad Walker from the great State of Texas. Know  their names? I am sure you don't, because their death didn't fit the  left's narrative or sell headlines. All four of them were murdered in  the line of duty for just trying to protect their communities.   Are their years of service or sacrifice not worthy of remembrance or  recognition? The media doesn't seem to think so. But the Republican  Party, we stand with law enforcement. We support law enforcement. We  celebrate law enforcement. We are the party of law enforcement.   That is why I am proud to stand here today as a 30-year law  enforcement veteran during National Police Week to say to all my  brothers and sisters in blue, we have got your back.
