 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6387, the School and  Daycare Protection Act.   This bill establishes a school security coordinating council within  the Department of Homeland Security to ensure the coordination of  security plans and policies regarding terrorist threats.   Importantly, the bill requires consistent reporting to Congress on  metrics regarding the efficacy of such activities and any engagement  with the stakeholder community outside of the Federal Government.   Additionally, it ensures that DHS is involved in Federal efforts to  maintain and publicize a clearinghouse of resources for schools to  assist them in security preparation and planning.   The Federal Government must do all it can to be a resource and to  offer support to schools in the face of terrorism.   I commend the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership on this  important issue and ensuring security for all schools.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6387, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5633, the Department of  Homeland Security Inspector General Transparency Act.   An important element of all Federal departments and agencies,  especially DHS, is the Office of the Inspector General. Although we all  wish there was no waste, fraud, or abuse within government, the reality  is it does exist, and it is the inspector general's mission to help the  Department identify and address those issues as much as possible.   I am fully supportive of the critical role that IGs play throughout  the Federal Government, including my own time serving in the military.  They are vital to ensuring accountability and transparency into each  department and agency's activities.   This is especially important in a department like DHS with a mission  so vital to the security of our country. DHS is tasked with  safeguarding the American people, our homeland, and our values against  all enemies foreign and domestic.   To do this on a daily basis, we must ensure that the men and women of  the Department are able to focus on their mission, and the IG's office  ensures this is done with integrity and honor.   This bill, introduced by Chairman Thompson, requires the DHS  inspector general to submit to Congress various reports that until now  have not necessarily been provided or available to the public. The  American public deserves to know.   The requirements in this bill would help to make the IG's office and  its important work more transparent not only to Congress but also to  the American people.   I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 5633, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am prepared  to close. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just as a side note here, we have been talking about  transparency in this bill, and I think it is important that we do keep  in mind that this is something that helps us in a nonpartisan way,  regardless of the administration, and regardless of ``who is in power  at that time.'' It is my sincere hope that this particular bill will  actually advocate for the mission of DHS and not for political gain,  not for political outcome.   It has been my experience in Federal Government that a well-operating  and well-oiled machine within the inspector general's office can help  to be that check and that balance. And I think at this point in our  history in the Department of Homeland Security, we face threats that we  have probably never faced in six or seven decades. And we haven't seen  the level and the intensity and the magnitude of those threats since  before World War II, in my humble opinion.   I believe, with this piece of legislation, that we can get to a point  where the Department of Homeland Security does have that check and that  balance, and provides the American public the information that is  needed and the transparency that is needed.   Whether it is on issues that are cyber; whether it is on issues that  are directly targeting our homeland, or even on border issues, we do  deserve transparency, and I think that is what the American public is  asking for. I believe that is what this bill would do, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1540, the Reporting Efficiently to  Proper Officials in Response to Terrorism, or the REPORT Act.   Too many times, when a terrorism incident occurs within the United  States, consistent and accurate information is not communicated to  Congress. Many of us, especially from Texas, experienced this firsthand  recently, when a British national, Malik Faisal Akram, took hostages at  the Beth Israel Congregation in Colleyville, Texas.   And not only were the initial facts and circumstances of the incident  unclear, but many questions remain unanswered regarding Akram's travel  and admission into the United States.   This is completely unacceptable. Not only should Congress have all of  the necessary information regarding terrorist attacks and other  terrorism incidents, but the American people deserve to know what  happened and how our government is responding.   The REPORT Act requires the DHS Secretary, the Attorney General, the  FBI Director, and the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center,  to submit an unclassified report to Congress regarding any incident of  terrorism that occurs in the United States. The report must include the  following:   A statement of facts; any gaps in our homeland or national security  that could be addressed to prevent future acts of terrorism; and  recommendations for additional measures, or legislative issues, to  improve homeland or national security and prevent future acts of  terrorism.   I commend my colleagues, and specifically my colleague from  California, for bringing this legislation before the Homeland Security  Committee and to the floor today.   I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 1540, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I think this bill really strikes at the heart of what the  Constitution says. We are a coequal branch of government, and the check  and the balance on the executive branch, the executive agencies, is  very important. We are elected, and we have a responsibility to go to  our districts to report back about incidents that are affecting our  country negatively.   And it is heartbreaking to hear any sort of terrorist attack, any  sort of incident that is aimed at undermining our national security.  That is why this committee was formed in the wake of 9/11. The purpose  of our committee is to make sure that we have the ability to give the  tools to those that are carrying out these missions; whether they are  Customs and Border Protection, whether they are TSA agents, or any  other agency that is entrusted with protecting the American public.   We deserve to have that transparency, as we have mentioned in a  previous bill, and now to be able to report back. So I commend my  colleague for bringing this up. And it is my sincere hope, similar to  the other bills that we have discussed, that we can, as a coequal  branch of government, offer that check and that balance on the  executive branch, regardless of who is in power, regardless of the  administration, to provide the necessary tools to continue to protect  our country and all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4209, my bill,  the DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act. I thank my colleague  from New Jersey for his support.   It is important to say that this is one step. It is not the solution  for all the problems that we face at our southern border, but it is one  important piece.   Since President Biden took office in January 2021, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection has had over 2.2 million migrant encounters along the  southwest border.   Due to the sheer numbers of migrants that are flooding across the  border, CBP personnel, including Border Patrol agents, are often  diverted from their essential jobs, their daily tasks to process  migrants, most of whom crossed the United States-Mexico border  illegally between ports of entry.   With Border Patrol agents occupied with other tasks and not  patrolling the border, the security of our southwest border, and,  therefore, the security of our Nation, has been crippled while cartels  take full advantage.   In addition to the record number of migrant encounters, CBP has been  interdicting growing quantities of illegal narcotics, especially  methamphetamines, fentanyl, and other fentanyl-laced drugs, along the  border.   For the first time, the United States has reached a tragic record, an  unfortunate number of over 100,000 drug overdose deaths in a 1-year  period. I want to repeat this: over 100,000 overdose deaths directly  related to fentanyl in this past year, the most ever recorded in the  United States. Additionally, according to the CDC, fentanyl is now the  leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.   In one of the communities that I represent, Odessa, Texas, law  enforcement officials have reported 22 fentanyl overdoses in just 90  days. Parents nationwide are scared for their kids, and there is good  reason for that fear. Fentanyl-related deaths nearly doubled the death  rates from COVID-19, car accidents, cancer, and even suicide.   We need a plan, a strategy. A cornerstone of this strategy must be to  stop the supply of drugs that are flowing into our country.   Mexico is now the primary source of fentanyl and synthetic opioids  entering the United States. Of course, smuggling those drugs across the  border comes with the risk of packages being seized by our border and  law enforcement agencies. To minimize this risk, in 1989, the Sinaloa  Cartel built their first-ever narco tunnel, as has been heard this  morning on this House floor.   Back then, narco tunnels were short and unsophisticated. Over time,  the cartels have learned and perfected these tunnels. They are longer,  more sophisticated. They come with lights, with ventilation systems,  with rail carts. They facilitate the movement of drugs and other  illicit commodities, including the trafficking of people, bulk cash,  and weapons.   Since 1990, law enforcement officials have discovered more than 230  of these cross-border tunnels, and there are likely more tunnels that  exist between Mexico and the United States that are yet undiscovered.  That is the heart of this bill.    CBP's tunnel technology program has matured over the years. Under the  direction of U.S. Border Patrol, this program has been testing and  acquiring technologies that do three essential things: predict tunnel  locations, detect and project the paths of the tunnels, and confirm a  tunnel's existence and location through mapping and measurements.   As CBP develops enhanced capabilities that will do the detection of  the tunnels, drug cartels have become more emboldened, and they are  creating more elaborate and harder-to-detect tunnel systems. Without  this critical legislation, CBP truly lacks the ability to scale their  tunnel interdiction and remediation operations.   The DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act addresses this issue  by requiring CBP to develop a counter tunnel operations plan that would  address risk-based criteria for interdicting and remediating illicit  tunnels.   They will also look at the processes for sharing information on these  tunnels, key indicators of tunnel construction to educate field  personnel, and require an assessment of technology and personnel needs.   Additionally, this legislation would authorize funding for CBP to  counter tunnel interdiction and remediation operations.   With the surge of illicit border activity both above and below  ground, CBP needs resources to combat illicit cross-border tunnels to  secure our homeland and protect our national security.   Passage of this legislation will disrupt and dismantle cartel  smuggling operations, safeguarding American communities from the  illegal narcotics problem that we see is completely devastating our  country, including my home State of Texas.   Border security is national security. I thank Chairman Thompson and  Ranking Member Katko for bringing this important legislation to the  floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my bill, H.R.  4209, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Katko), who is the ranking member of the Homeland Security  Committee and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker I think it is important to note here that we are not  going to declare victory. Celebrations will be minimal should this bill  pass, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye.'' I appreciate the  support of the gentleman from New Jersey, of the chairman, and of the  ranking member.   This is step one out of 100 different steps. As somebody with a  military background who was charged with protecting airspace, defensive  counter-air, the border is very similar. It is layered. It is not just  one piece that really is the magic solution. There are many different  approaches that need to be considered.   This is one, as I said, out of hundreds of steps that need to be  accomplished to prevent the fentanyl that we just heard about that  could kill every American multiple times, to prevent the rest of the  drugs that are flowing into our country, to prevent the trafficking and  the crime, and really the overwhelming of our local communities.   As I mentioned, in Odessa, Texas, recently, we uncovered the fact  that in 90 days we had almost 20 overdoses from fentanyl. It is a  layered defense that is required, so many more steps need to be taken.  I am proud to sponsor this legislation to continue to push for that  defense and that architecture to be in place.   We need strength, we need deterrence, we need resolve, and, most  importantly, we need the political will in a nonpartisan way to bring  America back together and the Committee on Homeland Security to secure  the safety of every single American.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4476, the DHS  Trade and Economic Security Council Act.   The past few years have been incredibly difficult for Americans  across the country, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain  crisis, and record inflation, among many others. These challenges have  shown all of us the importance of our economic security and the impact  that our economy can have on both our homeland and/or national  security, and that of our partners and allies.   Our reliance on foreign products and manufacturing, from personal  protective equipment like masks and gloves to key technology components  like computer chips, have had drastic impacts on this country over the  past few years.   While there is ongoing work within the Federal Government with regard  to trade, supply chain, and economic security, it is clear that we  still must do more.   The Department of Homeland Security has a unique position within our  government to safeguard the homeland and the American people. This is  no longer only limited to overt acts of terrorism as we have talked  about today, but the security and stability of our economy is critical  to our national security. H.R. 4476 addresses this by codifying the DHS  Trade and Economic Security Council as well as the DHS Assistant  Secretary of Trade and Economic Security. This will ensure better  preparedness of U.S. supply chains in the face of future pandemics,  disasters, and emergencies.   I commend my friend from Michigan for his leadership on this issue,  and I encourage DHS to lean into its unique role to strengthen our  economic security.   Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4476, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer), the leader of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
