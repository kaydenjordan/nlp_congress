 Madam Speaker, the midterm elections delivered a strong  message to the GOP: Politicians should keep their hands off women's  reproductive decisions.   Voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont enshrined abortion access  into their State constitutions, and Kentucky voters rejected a ballot  measure threatening abortion protections.   Postelection polls show a majority of voters want to see Congress  protect abortion rights. But regardless of how unpopular their views,  Republicans in Congress doubled down on their attacks on women's  bodies.   We know it is going to be an uphill battle to codify Roe, and House  Republicans made it clear they won't stop with banning abortion. Last  July, 193 House Republicans voted against my bill to protect the right  to birth control, a measure 95 percent of voters agree with.   The right to abortion and to birth control are critical issues for  the American people. So, I ask my colleagues across the aisle: Why  aren't they critical to you?                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  bipartisan Speak Out Act.   One in three women in our country experiences sexual harassment in  the workplace at some point in her career. This appalling behavior is  unacceptable, but it will not stop if survivors are silenced.   Let me be clear: any person who experiences sexual assault in the  workplace or otherwise should be able to speak out and seek justice.   NDAs and nondisparagement clauses have been used for far too long to  silence survivors of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace and  instead shield abusers and the companies that enable them. The Speak  Out Act helps to fix this flawed system and restores survivors' voices.   Contrary to some of the comments made by my colleagues across the  aisle, this is a reasonable act that explicitly protects trade secrets  and other proprietary information. It is carefully designed to remove  the protection of predators. That is something we should all be in  favor of.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join me in  supporting this critically important legislation so that those who wish  to do so can hold perpetrators accountable and share their stories.  This is something that should be important to all of us.
