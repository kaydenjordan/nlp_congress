 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to Republican  efforts to block President Biden's student loan debt relief plan,  rescind the payment pause extension, and upend the lives of millions of  hard-working Americans.   Now, it is no surprise that Republicans have prioritized an effort to  block the President's plan to deliver critical relief to 43 million  working- and middle-class student loan borrowers. Republicans in  Congress have shown time and time again that they would much rather  deliver relief to giant corporations and protect tax cheats than help  working Americans whose biggest sin is to try to get an education.   I support the President's actions to help these hard-working  Americans. But let's be very clear. The Republican plan goes far beyond  rescinding President Biden's plan to cancel student debt. Republicans  could have written their resolution to simply overturn debt  cancelation. But, instead, they demanded something that is much more  extreme. The Republican proposal would void the student loan payment  pause that was in effect from last September through last December  during the pandemic.   This means that if this CRA passes, it would rescind the President's  plan to cancel debt for families that need it most. But it also means  that everyone--everyone--whose payment was paused would immediately owe  4 months of back payments, plus interest. Republicans are asking  Americans who benefited from a pause in payments to immediately pay  back potentially thousands of dollars to Uncle Sam. Nearly 40 million  Americans who are saving an average of $233 a month from the pause  would be called on to cut a check to the Government for months of  retroactive student loan  [[Page S1816]]  payments, plus interest, all because they relied on the U.S.  Government's statement that their loan payments were paused.   This extreme Republican resolution would harm millions of hardworking  Americans. But there is even more. By rescinding the payment pause  extension, this Republican legislation also endangers our public  servants: teachers, nurses, firefighters, servicemembers, and others  who are working toward paying down their debt program through the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or PSLF.   If you are a public servant enrolled in public service loan  forgiveness, every month of the pause counts toward your total of 120  payments before your balance is forgiven.   According to the Department of Education, more than 400,000 borrowers  received Public Service Loan Forgiveness credit during September  through December payment pause last year. This CRA would retroactively  disqualify those months of credit toward PSLF, leaving teachers and  nurses and firefighters further behind on their path to being debt- free.   And if you are one of the 260,000 public servants around the country  who received credit for your final payment since September of last  year, and you finally got your student debt balance forgiven, you,  under the Republican plan, would be at risk of seeing your relief  clawed back and being thrown back into debt.   Just to give an example for that: In Massachusetts, more than 5,500  public servants across our Commonwealth could see their loan balances  restored. So they owe the money again.   In Louisiana, more than 3,600 of Senator Cassidy's own constituents  could see their Public Service Loan Forgiveness taken away, and they  would have to now pay more money.   Republicans have tried to sell this CRA as their attempt to block  President Biden from canceling up to $20,000 of student debt for the  working families that need it most. And they say there is nothing more  here to see.   But make no mistake: Voting for this CRA is not just a vote against  the President's student debt cancelation plan. It is also a vote to  force nearly 40 million hardworking Americans to immediately pay back  months of student loan payments and interest and restore an estimated  $20 billion of student debt to the balances of tens of thousands of  public servants.   Regardless of your feelings about student debt cancelation, that is a  slap in the face to middle-class families, to working families  everywhere in this country. And that is why labor unions, civil rights  groups, and even centrist policy organizations are fighting against the  Republican CRA, and it is why I urge every one of my colleagues to join  me.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Rhode  Island for his leadership. He has worked hard to make sure that the  Senate Armed Services Committee works in a bipartisan manner to keep  our country safe. His steadfast approach has rightfully earned him  respect from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I  appreciate his being here tonight on this issue.   Mr. President, several weeks ago, I came down to the Senate floor to  ask the Senator from Alabama to reconsider his unprecedented action of  blocking hundreds of promotions earned by our men and women in uniform.  He refused, so I am here to ask again.   As I said the last time I spoke about this, most people are aware  that the Senate votes on nominees appointed by the President to occupy  top roles in government--Cabinet Secretaries, judges, Ambassadors. Less  well known is the fact that the Senate must also vote to approve  thousands of military promotions each year. If a colonel has done  really well on the job and their services promotion board decides that  they are ready to be a brigadier general, the Senate must vote to  approve this promotion before it can go through.   Typically, this vote is a formality. These promotions are processed  in big batches rather than one at a time, and they nearly always happen  without taking a recorded vote. But right now, the Senator from Alabama  all by himself is blocking every single senior military nomination and  promotion from moving forward. This means that one Senator is  personally standing in the way of the promotions for 221 of our top- level military leaders, holding up pay raises for 221 men and women in  uniform, blocking 221 senior military leaders from taking their posts,  and jeopardizing America's national security.   In April, I sent a letter to Defense Secretary Austin asking about  the impact of holding up these military promotions. Secretary Austin  didn't pull any punches. He said:         The longer that this hold persists, the greater the risk       the U.S. military runs in every theater, every domain, and       every service.    He went on to point out that these unprecedented and unnecessary  holds are creating ``rising disquiet from our allies and partners at a  moment when our competitors and adversaries are watching.''   There is bipartisan opposition to the Senator from Alabama's actions.  Thanks to Chairman Reed, seven former Defense Secretaries, including  ones who served under President Trump and President George W. Bush,  sent a letter stating that leaving senior positions ``in doubt at a  time of enormous geopolitical uncertainty sends the wrong message to  our adversaries and could weaken our deterrence.''   The Senator from Alabama hurts Active-Duty military. He also hurts  their families. In this letter describing the consequences of the  Senator from Alabama's hold, Secretary Austin noted that it places an  ``unconscionable burden on families that are already making significant  sacrifices.''   There are mounting worries that the negative impacts on military  families is threatening our military's ability to retain leaders who  have completed thorough, months-long reviews to earn those promotions.  [[Page S1828]]    At a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, the Secretary of  the Air Force said:         One of the things that motivates our people in terms of       retention . . . is how they feel that their families are       being treated.    He said that he also knows that these families do not want to be  treated liked the Senator from Alabama's political football.   The Senator from Alabama is punishing 221 dedicated men and women who  serve in our military because he disagrees with one of the Pentagon's  policy decisions. He is opposed to a Department of Defense policy  established to help members of the military and their families access  healthcare--specifically, reproductive healthcare.   I strongly support this particular policy, but it is no secret that I  disagree with a lot of other policy positions at the Pentagon. And, as  I reminded the Senator from Alabama the last time we had this  discussion on the Senate floor, as Senators, we have many tools we can  use to shape and influence government policy without putting our  national defense at risk.   We can pass laws; we can conduct oversight; we can meet with  administration officials; we can hold hearings. From time to time,  Senators object to an individual nomination, usually to express  opposition either to the nominee or to ensure that the Senator gets  answers from a Federal Agency. I have done this in the past as have  many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   That is not the approach the Senator from Alabama has taken. Instead,  he is blocking every single top military leader from advancing  indefinitely. The last time I came to the floor, he was holding up 184  nominees. Now he has snared 221 top-level servicemembers who are  currently slated for advancement. He has stopped every one of them dead  in their tracks.   The Senator from Alabama is singlehandedly holding up three 4-star  commanders, 35 3-star commanders, multiple Silver Star and Purple Heart  recipients, the next commander of our Fifth Fleet in the Middle East,  the next commander of the Seventh Fleet in the Pacific, the Navy's air  and surface warfare commanders; and as a preview of coming events, the  Senator from Alabama has already promised to block the next Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   The Senator from Alabama has already held some of these nominees for  as long as 3 months. That is 3 months that they won't have time in  their next roles. That is 3 months that they won't get a pay bump, and  there is no retroactive pay here. That is 3 months that they don't get  the experience and the responsibilities of their new duty stations.  That is 3 months, and there is no end in sight.   How many blows to their military careers and to their families do  these men and women have to suffer before some of them simply walk  away?   This isn't right.   The Senator from Alabama has not raised any objections to the process  by which these men and women were vetted and nominated. Each of these  nominees has undergone a thorough review, first by their military  service and then by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the  Secretary of Defense. Months after those reviews, their nominations  were sent to the White House for additional scrutiny and then to  Congress to officially authorize the promotions.   These are our military's best leaders, and they have proven  themselves to the highest degree. As a reward for their service and  their exemplary dedication, the Senator from Alabama holds them  hostage, with no concern for what it means to their careers, to the  servicemembers depending on them for leadership, or to their families.   The Senator from Alabama's actions are not just the usual back-and- forth in Washington. His holds pose a grave threat to our national  security and our military readiness. They actively hurt our ability to  respond quickly to threats around the world. That is not my conclusion;  that is the conclusion of the Secretary of Defense.   When I tried to move these nominations forward the last time, I said  I was concerned about how the actions of the Senator from Alabama were  undermining military readiness. The Senator responded that he knew that  I had sent a letter to Secretary Austin to ask him about the impact of  the holds on military readiness but that the Secretary had not yet  responded. The Senator said the last time we were on the floor here  together that he would consider Secretary Austin's concerns. In fact,  he said that he ``can't wait to read it,'' but he would not budge in  the meantime.   So I am here this evening to place into the Record Secretary Austin's  reply. In his letter, the Secretary makes his concerns clear. He  explains how the actions of the Senator from Alabama pose a grave  threat to national security by harming military readiness. The  Secretary also explains how the Senator from Alabama harms military  families.   I sincerely hope that the unvarnished assessment of our Secretary of  Defense will be enough to move the Senator from Alabama to lift his  holds and let these nominations go forward.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Austin's letter  be printed in full in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Hon. Elizabeth Warren,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warren: Thank you for your letter requesting a       full accounting of the impact on our national security and       the risks to our military readiness resulting from Senator       Tuberville's indefinite hold on the confirmation of our       general and flag officers.        I appreciate and share your deep concern over this hold,       which is unprecedented in its scale and scope. Delays in       confirming our general and flag officers pose a clear risk to       U.S. military readiness, especially at this critical time.        The Department of Defense has 64 three- and four-star       nominations pending for positions due to rotate within the       next 120 days. These include the Chief of Staff of the Army;       the Chief of Naval Operations; the Commandant and Assistant       Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director of the National       Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber Command;       and the Commander of United States Northern Command.        Additionally, several one- and two-star nominations are now       on indefinite hold for general officers and flag officers       slated to take command or support critical positions across       the Joint Force. Within the next nine months, approximately       80 three- and four-star rotations are projected across the       Department. Those positions include the Chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, and the       Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. In total, between now       and the end of the year, the Department projects that       approximately 650 general and flag officers will require       Senate confirmation.        This indefinite hold harms America's national security and       hinders the Pentagon's normal operations. The United States       military relies on the deep experience and strategic       expertise of our senior military leaders. The longer that       this hold persists, the greater the risk the U.S. military       runs in every theater, every domain, and every Service.                              Mission Vacancies         The tenure of Service Chiefs is limited by law, and thus,       incumbents must vacate their positions at the appointed time       and may only be extended under extraordinary circumstances.       Collectively, these positions oversee more than 1.2 million       active and reserve component Service members and provide       Service personnel and resources to the commanders of the       unified combatant commands. By law, Service Chiefs preside       over the capabilities, requirements, policies, and plans of       their Services and serve as the principal military advisors       to the Secretaries of the Military Departments. Put simply,       our Service Chiefs train and equip the Joint Force. Without       these leaders in place, the U.S. military will incur an       unnecessary and unprecedented degree of risk at a moment when       our adversaries may seek to test our resolve.        The hold causes especially acute, self-inflicted problems       in new domains of potential conflict. The Director of the       National Security Agency and Commander of United States Cyber       Command, is responsible for supporting every combatant       commander and Service member around the globe--including       troops in hostile or hazardous areas--with actionable signals       intelligence and cybersecurity support. The Director also       ensures that military communications and data remain secure       and out of the hands of our adversaries, safeguarding our       advanced command, control, communications, computer       intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities       against the People's Republic of China, Russia, Iran, North       Korea, ISIS, and more. Failing to fill this position weakens       the cybersecurity of the United States.        Furthermore, delays in confirming a large number of one-       and two-star general and flag officers jeopardizes our       current and future readiness. The Department relies on these       experienced leaders to execute tactical actions every day and       extend our strategic advantages for the long term. General       and flag  [[Page S1829]]       officers at this level are responsible for executing       strategy, acquiring new technologies, enhancing tactical       effectiveness, conducting joint training, and strengthening       global alliances. These general and flag officers also       provide direct leadership and mentorship to thousands of       enlisted Service members and junior and field grade officers       across the Department. Their importance cannot be overstated.                           Power Projection Abroad         General and flag officers provide oversight of the       Department's military and civilian staffs, help decide how we       employ our forces, and take care of the Service members,       civilians, and families in their organizations. Delays in       confirmation will soon foist vacancies on the most senior       military positions across each of the Services, imposing new       and unnecessary risks on U.S. warfighters across multiple       theaters of operations.        The hold also makes it harder for the United States to       fulfil its global leadership responsibilities, including to       our treaty allies and our valued partners around the world.       Our smoothly running normal processes and predictable       military transitions have long set helpful expectations among       allies and partners. Now, however, this hold has created       unnecessary uncertainty. That diminishes our global standing       as the strongest military in the world, which is in large       part based on our stable processes and orderly transitions.        General and flag officers have the authority to make       decisions and commit resources, develop key policies, work       with our allies and partners, and confront our rivals and       foes. The full impact of this hold may not be immediately       noticeable because of the resilience built into our military       organizations, but over time, the hold will cause cascading       impacts to our readiness and needlessly hinder our ability to       meet our strategic objectives in the Inda-Pacific, Europe,       the Middle East, and beyond.        The absence of experienced and Senate-confirmed senior       leadership limits our ability to deepen our cooperation with       our allies and partners through multilateral training and       cooperative engagements. Recent exercises, such as Balikatan       2023 with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or joint U.S.-      Israeli naval activity in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, may       become even more difficult if delays in confirmation force       other leaders to take on the responsibilities of officers       held up by the Senate. This hold could force senior leaders       to become dual-hatted, which would force them to juggle       competing priorities and sap their ability to excel.                           Knowledge and Expertise         Our general and flag officers cultivate their expertise and       experience over decades of service. Military units need       leaders, and our Service members deserve to be led by fully       confirmed general and flag officers. The failure to confirm       leaders in key roles transfers strategic risk down the chain       of command and forces our units to operate with less       experienced decision makers in charge. By destabilizing the       senior military promotion and rotation process, we put our       short- and long-term readiness at significant risk.        Failure to fill these positions in a timely manner is       simply irresponsible. We owe it to our Service members to       provide them with the best leadership possible, and the       current hold jeopardizes the continuity and effective       transition of leadership.                         Service Members and Families         This hold disrupts not only our most senior military       leaders but their families as well. Service members and       military families are resilient, but the current hold adds       another layer of stress and unnecessary uncertainty.        The damage here includes not just the disruption to our       most senior officers, but also profound confusion and       disturbance to our rising one- and two-star general and flag       officers and their families. Extended holds increase the time       from selection to promotion, which could further delay       promotion timelines by 12 to 24 months. This impedes not only       the current cadre of officers but those in the groups behind       them as well.        General officer and flag officer end strength is tightly       controlled by statute. Promotion of one cadre of officers is       possible only with the retirement of others. Long-term holds       have a corrosive and cascading effect: they prevent our       rising officers and their families from being able to predict       promotion and rotation windows, which can increase the       pressure to leave the military in favor of greater stability.       The more our normal promotion processes are jolted, the more       we risk the loss of the diverse warfighting and technical       expertise that America needs to confront its 21st-century       security challenges.        The current hold also means delaying or canceling permanent       change of station moves--not only for those now nominated and       on hold but also for numerous officers and their families who       must be extended on station to prevent critical gaps.       Military children will be unable to move to new schools when       the next school year begins, which imposes needless       additional stress on those students and their families.       Military families enrolled in the Exceptional Family Member       Program may endure serious delays or be unable to access the       services and support that they need and deserve when they       transition to their new duty stations. And outstanding       military spouses may not be able to accept or start new jobs       because they cannot predict when they could start. The       families of our general and flag officers serve right       alongside their Service members. The current hold imposes       additional burdens upon our military families that are both       unnecessary and unconscionable.                             A Perilous Precedent         As such, the Department urges the Senate to resolve the       current situation as swiftly as possible to limit these       serious consequences. Never before has one Senator prevented       the Department of Defense from managing its officer corps in       this manner, and letting this hold continue would set a       perilous precedent for our military, our security, and our       country.        The ripple effects of this unprecedented and unnecessary       hold are increasingly troubling. Ultimately, the breakdown of       the normal flow of leadership across the Department's       carefully cultivated promotion and transition system will       breed uncertainty and confusion across the U.S. military.       This protracted hold means uncertainty for our Service       members and their families and rising disquiet from our       allies and partners, at a moment when our competitors and       adversaries are watching.        As public servants and officials sworn to protect and       defend our Constitution, I hope that we can all acknowledge       the national security risks posed by these needless delays       and come together to safeguard the lethality and readiness of       the most powerful fighting force in human history.        Thank you for your continued strong support for our Service       members and our national security. I again urge swift action       to confirm all U.S. general and flag officers.            Sincerely,                                              Lloyd J. Austin, III.     I am here today to ask my colleague from Alabama to let  these promotions move forward and to find other ways to continue  advocating for the policy changes that he wants to see. I am hopeful  that he will do the right thing and allow these servicemembers to carry  out their responsibilities to our country.   In a moment, I will be asking the Senate to confirm Calendar No. 204.  This nominee is a native of Pittsfield, MA. If confirmed, he would be  the Navy's next sub boss, making him the most senior operational  submariner in the Navy. The Submarine Force is integral to deterring  our enemies and keeping America safe.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 204; that the Senate vote on  the nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to  the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, let's be clear what is at issue here.   Servicemembers and their families don't get to decide where they  serve. The policy that is at issue here allows servicemembers who need  reproductive healthcare to request time to travel to receive the  treatment that they need. The treatment could be an abortion, but it  also could be IVF. It also could be helping a servicemember or a family  member receive treatment after a miscarriage. Commanders respect a  servicemember's privacy, and they don't want to be required to ask why  the servicemember is taking leave. Now, I understand that the Senator  from Alabama doesn't like that. He doesn't think that the Department  should be facilitating certain types of reproductive healthcare in any  way.   The administration--let us be clear--is not breaking the law.  Chairman Reed has already gone through all of  [[Page S1830]]  the legal precedent and the legal opinion that states that what the  Department of Defense is doing is absolutely within its purview. The  Department of Defense is following the law. I understand that the law  could be changed, and the Senator from Alabama can advocate for the  bill that he cosponsors that would ban the Department from providing  paid leave or transportation to access legal reproductive care.   I think that such a policy would have a terrible impact on the  privacy of our servicemembers and their families who would have to tell  their commanding officers intimate details of their medical situations  in order to get the time they need to seek care for things like IVF or  a miscarriage. It could prevent servicemembers or their families from  accessing important, legal care that would require them to travel or to  take time away from work.   It would also have negative impacts on our commanders officers, who  would spend less time training against our national security threats  and more time asking invasive questions about their employees' health  conditions or those of the employees' families.   Even so, the Senator from Alabama is free to advocate for this  policy. As I have said before, the Senator does not have the votes in  Congress for a bill like that. I think the Senator from Alabama knows  that, which is why he has taken this radical step of opposing the swift  passage of every high-level military nomination pending before the  Senate.   This approach is dangerous. Many of us are frustrated by executive  branch policies and actions, but that frustration is not an excuse to  endanger our national security and to deprive servicemembers of the  leaders they need.   The Senator from Alabama and I fundamentally disagree on the issue of  abortion and on the DOD's policies, but we should all be able to agree  that a blockade of the promotion of every senior member of our Nation's  military creates unacceptable risks to our national security.   In a moment, I will be asking the Senate to confirm Calendar No. 192.  If confirmed, this nominee would be the first female Superintendent for  the Naval Academy. Of course, she is no stranger to breaking down  barriers. She was also the first Hispanic woman to command a Navy  warship. We are in the middle of a recruiting crisis. She is precisely  the kind of leader we need to inspire our next generation to serve.   I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island. Then I will make my motion.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Reed for underscoring the  point that the Department of Defense is not breaking the law. There is  legal precedence for what the Department is doing, and it has been  reviewed by the Department of Justice that the Department of Defense is  fully in accord with current law.   With that, I would like to go back to the nominee who would be the  first female Superintendent of the Naval Academy. Mr. President, I  renew my request with respect to Calendar No. 192.    Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama earlier claimed  that the Department of Defense's policy violates the law. The Senator  from Utah then made a slight shift in how he described his complaint  with the Department of Defense policy. He said it violates the spirit,  if not the letter, of the law, and therein lies the difference.   The law that we are talking about here is the Hyde amendment, and  that is a congressional prohibition on the Federal government paying  for abortions.   Let's be clear about the Department of Defense policy. Servicemembers  remain personally responsible for bearing the medical cost of abortion,  just like they did before the Dobbs opinion, just like they did the  year before that and the year before that and the year before that, and  all the way back to when the Hyde amendment was passed.   Instead, what DOD policy does is it clarifies that servicemembers who  need to travel out of State to access any kind of reproductive  healthcare that is not available where they are stationed can request  the time off to go get that care for themselves or a family member.  That is it.   That is what people in the Peace Corps can do. That is what people in  Federal prisons can do. And that is what our servicemembers can do.  That is not a violation of the explicit language in the Hyde amendment.   And to stand up and claim that somehow what the Department of Defense  has done is violate the law is simply not to read the law. The law is  clear, and the Department of Defense continues to follow it.   But there are real consequences to this argument. I understand that  there are Members of the Republican Party, Members of the Senate, who  would like to change that policy. They would like the Department of  Defense to follow a different policy. They can try to change the law.  They can introduce an amendment. In fact, they already have introduced  an amendment. But, in the meantime, they cannot hold hostage the  promotions of our top military leaders. This jeopardizes our national  defense.   Secretary Austin's letter that I earlier entered into the Record goes  into great detail about how these holds that the Senator from Alabama  has put on our top military leaders create mission vacancies that  ``incur an unnecessary and unprecedented degree of risk at a moment  when our adversaries may seek to test our resolve.''   He goes on to explain that the holds undermine power projection  abroad, which, ``diminishes our global standing as the strongest  military in the world, which is in large part based on our stable  processes and orderly transitions''--precisely what the Senator from  Alabama is holding up.   The risks are even greater in new domains of potential conflict, and  Secretary Austin does not mince words on who benefits.   Who benefits? Our Secretary of Defense identifies them: China,  Russia, Iran, North Korea, and ISIS. The leaders whose nominations  currently stand in purgatory are responsible, according to Secretary  Austin, for ``executing strategy, acquiring new technologies, enhancing  tactical effectiveness, conducting joint training, and strengthening  global alliances.''   This isn't rhetoric. These are specific examples of U.S. national  security interests that are endangered by these reckless holds.   I understand that the Senator from Alabama may not be persuaded by  Secretary Austin's letter, but we have to face reality here. While we  argue over the fact that the Republicans want to change current law  under the Hyde amendment, we are endangering our national defense.   We need to move forward on the nominations that have already been  approved by the servicemembers, by the White House, by our own  committee. In the Senate Armed Services Committee, we need a vote so  that these people can move to their next posts and do their jobs.   In a moment, I will be asking the Senate to confirm Calendar No. 199.  If  [[Page S1833]]  confirmed, this nominee would be Deputy Commander for Air Force  Materiel Command, which employs nearly 86,000 military and civilian  airmen and manages a $71.3 billion budget.   She is also a mama. She calls her kids the ``Three Musketeers'' and  says they are the center of her universe.   These holds are the hardest on military families who are trying to  figure out how to sign up for new schools, trying to establish their  lives in their next deployment.   This nominee has already moved 17 times during her career, and she is  now held by the Senator from Alabama, cannot move to her next  deployment, cannot establish herself and her ``Three Musketeers'' and  get them settled in school, and get her family in the place where they  will be so that she can do her job for the American people.   We need people with decades of logistics management experience, and  we need to treat them with some respect.   I renew my request with respect to Calendar No. 199.    Madam President, the Department of Defense has adopted a  healthcare policy that is both legal and necessary to protect the  readiness of our forces. It also protects our national defense. These  policies were also reviewed by the Department of Justice.   The prohibition to which my colleagues refer is the prohibition in  the Hyde amendment of using Federal dollars to pay for abortions. Let  me say this as clearly as I can. Under the Department of Defense's  policy, servicemembers remain personally responsible for bearing the  medical cost of abortion. That is true today; it was true last week; it  was true the day after the Dobbs opinion; it was true the day before  the Dobbs opinion; and for years, that has been the policy.    What has changed is that the DOD has clarified that servicemembers  who need to travel out of State to access any kind of reproductive  healthcare that is not available where they are stationed and what kind  of healthcare might not be available--it might be abortion care; it  might be IVF; it might be care for someone who has suffered a  miscarriage--that any person who has suffered that personally or  someone in their family can request time off to go get that care for  themselves or for a family member. That is it. That is all we are  talking about here.   Servicemembers do not get to decide where to serve. I am proud to  support the DOD in saying that a change in station should not mean a  change in your basic rights.   I appreciate that my colleagues have strong views on abortion. So do  I. We are not going to agree on that. But all of us should be able to  agree that we should not take steps that harm the people who  volunteered to serve in our military; that if they need care that they  cannot get in the State where they are, they should have an opportunity  to go somewhere else. That is it.   There is no prohibition in law. There is no Hyde amendment violation  here. Instead, what we have is wholesale holding up the nominations of  more than 200 of our top military leaders who cannot advance to the  posts that they have been thoroughly vetted and are ready to be  promoted into, cannot advance to their duty stations, cannot settle  their families in their next assignments, cannot receive the increase  in their pay that they are entitled to.   So, in a moment, I will be asking the Senate to confirm Calendar No.  90. This is the person who would be America's military representative  to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but is currently being held  up by the Senator from Alabama.

They are in it  all the way. They are capable. They are talented. They serve our  country. And right now, they have become the political football for the  Senator from Alabama, and that is wrong.   These people deserve their promotions. They deserve to be treated  with dignity and respect for the work they have put in for our Nation.  It is the least we can do for them, for their families, and for the  national security of the United States of America.   We need these people. We don't need to tell them we don't care about  them. We need them. We need to retain them. We need to promote them. We  need to use their talents.   Madam President, I renew my request with respect to each of the  calendar numbers I have identified.    I will yield to the Senator from Utah.    Madam President, the Senator from Utah and the Senator  from Alabama have repeatedly said that the Department of Defense is  somehow violating the law.   Let's pull the statute out and just take a look at it. I want to read  the words into the Record.   Under part (a) Restriction on Use of Funds:         Funds available to the Department of Defense may not be       used to perform abortions except where the life of the mother       would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a       case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape       or incest.    Period. That is it. It does not say that funds from the Department of  Defense may not be used for travel. It does not say that people may not  have time off. It does not say that people may not be allowed to travel  out of State. It has exactly one thing that it prohibits Federal funds  from being used, and that is ``may not be used to perform abortions.''   Let me say again as clearly as I know how: The Department of  Defense's rule clearly states that the servicemember will pay for her  own medical services. It will not be the case that the Department of  Defense will pay for abortion.   If the Senator from Utah wants to change that law, he certainly can  introduce an amendment to do that. The same with the Senator from  Alabama. But right now, the Department of Defense is following the law  in the United States.   The Senator from Alabama's actions pose a grave threat to our  national security and readiness. That is not just my view. It is the  view of the Secretary of Defense and the former Secretaries of Defense  serving in both Democratic and Republican administrations.   If the Senator from Alabama stays on this path, his actions will soon  endanger the nomination of the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, an  action we have never seen in the history of our Nation. We have 221  good people who have earned their promotions, who are ready to go to  their next duty stations and serve their nation. They are being treated  with disrespect; and this action is undermining our national defense.   I urge the Senator from Alabama to release his holds immediately and  allow these senior military officers to receive the promotions that  they have earned.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
