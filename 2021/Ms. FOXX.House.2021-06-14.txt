 Madam Speaker, recently, my friend Jean Donaldson was  driving home late one afternoon and had a tire blow out.   Jean stopped in the parking lot of the business Clean & Dry, where  Chase Grogan, an employee of the business, noticed her plight and  offered to help.   Despite it being near quitting time, Chase insisted on helping Jean  and proceeded to change her tire so that she could get home. Jean was,  of course, grateful and offered compensation, which he declined.   We often come to the floor to praise people who have done  extraordinary acts, and we should continue to do that. However, it is  good for us to acknowledge all the Chase Grogans of the world who,  every day, do extraordinary acts of kindness with little recognition.   By acknowledging Mr. Grogan, we are acknowledging all who do those  kindnesses every day.                            ____________________
