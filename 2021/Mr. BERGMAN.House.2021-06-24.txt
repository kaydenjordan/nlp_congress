 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my deep  disappointment with President Biden's fiscal year 2022 budget request-- more specifically, the President's removal of longstanding pro-life  protections such as the Hyde amendment.   The Hyde amendment prohibits Federal funds from being used to pay for  abortions. Historically, this policy has shared strong bipartisan  consensus in the House.   I made a promise to my constituents to protect the unborn and to give  a voice to those who have no voice. Since coming here to Congress, I  have consistently supported pro-life policies. This is a value in the  First District of Michigan that is shared across party lines.   Yet, this President's budget request forces American taxpayers to  fund abortions, a denial of the basic human right to life.   I strongly urge my colleagues in the House to not follow in those  footsteps and to oppose this proposal.   As we work through the Federal appropriations process, it is  imperative Congress maintains these basic protections and opposes any  other policies that would promote abortions here in the United States  and throughout the world.   Let us, the United States of America, be an example to the rest of  the world that, no matter how much we may disagree, we can come  together for the protection of human life both before and after birth.                            ____________________
