 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3630, the Lymphedema  Treatment Act, introduced by my friend and fellow Committee on Energy  and Commerce member Jan Schakowsky, as well as the Subcommittee on  Health member Buddy Carter, along with myself and more than 350 Members  on both sides of the aisle.   This legislation would create a new Medicare benefit category,  lymphedema compression treatment items, including standard and custom- fitted garments, and other items determined by HHS, for treatment of  lymphedema.   As many of us know, thanks to a passionate and committed group of  patient stakeholders, lymphedema is a chronic condition that may cause  significant swelling and discomfort. It is often located in the arms  and legs but can also occur in other parts of the body.   Unfortunately, there is no cure today for this condition, but  patients are able to receive care that can mitigate some of the  symptoms caused by lymphedema. One of the most basic elements of care  is the application of compression garments to swollen body parts.   As it stands today, fee-for-service Medicare covers various forms of  treatment for lymphedema but does not cover the basic compression  supplies typically used in the regular treatment for this condition.  This is a result of the outdated structure of traditional fee-for- service Medicare, which does not have an existing benefit category that  works for lymphedema compression garments.   This legislation is yet another reminder that the fee-for-service  Medicare as structured today under part B simply cannot keep pace with  medical innovation. Private payers, including Medicare Advantage plans,  have more flexibility to provide coverage for these products,  especially if they add value to the care patients need.   As the popularity of Medicare Advantage demonstrates, there is a  built-in incentive to provide better value for patients, meaning better  outcomes and lower costs. It has been proven.   It has been discouraging to see an ever-growing number of situations  where a particular drug--for instance, an entire class of Alzheimer's  drugs recently restricted by CMS--or other medical products are not  covered for seniors in Medicare fee-for-service when other patients in  the private market, or even in Medicare Advantage, may have them  covered.   I am hopeful that bills like the one that we are here to discuss  today, where Congress continues to patch the inefficiencies in the  Medicare program, not only benefit seniors but also help all of us  recognize that seniors deserve greater Medicare reforms. Those reforms  should empower patients with greater control over their healthcare  decisions and more ability to tailor their health benefits to their  personal needs, all with the goal of no senior being denied or having  to lobby Congress to get the medical products they need. It makes  sense.   Finally, I am encouraged to see that the new mandatory spending in  this legislation will be fully offset, and I encourage my colleagues to  continue to insist that we fully offset mandatory spending now and into  the future. This is responsible. It is responsible legislating.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors for this bill, H.R. 3630, and the  chairman, of course, and the ranking member of the full committee. I  fully support this legislation and recommend a ``yes'' vote on final  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a real good bill, a bipartisan  bill. We worked very hard on it, and we have a great sponsor here and a  Republican sponsor in Representative Buddy Carter, and I urge that we  pass this as soon as possible. I assume the Senate will get to work and  get this done, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4275, the Ensuring Phone  and Internet Access Through Lifeline and Affordable Connectivity  Program Act, which was unanimously reported out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   The FCC currently administers two subsidy programs to help low-income  Americans get connected, the Lifeline program and the Affordable  Connectivity Program. The FCC uses criteria such as household income or  participation in other Federal subsidy programs to determine  eligibility.   The FCC's inspector general identifies fraud and risk in certain  qualifying programs, highlighting the importance of congressional  oversight.                                time  1615    H.R. 4275 will help provide Congress with important information  regarding how low-income Americans qualify for these programs as we  continue our oversight duties.   Specifically, this bill will require the FCC to report to Congress on  which eligibility criteria Americans use to qualify for the lifeline of  affordable connectivity programs. In carrying out this report, the FCC  will be limited to using existing data they currently can access to  verify eligibility. It also requires the FCC to report on the outreach  and publicity efforts to promote enrollment in these programs.   This legislation is an important first step toward oversight of the  FCC and its administration of these programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I rise today in support of H.R. 6290, the  Manufacturing.gov Act.   H.R. 6290 will require the Department of Commerce to designate a  portion of the Manufacturing.gov website to serve as a source for  businesses to have access to information relating to Federal  manufacturing programs.   As part of the website, the Department of Commerce must make  available contact information for relevant program offices carrying out  manufacturing programs, web pages that focus on topics such as trade,  workforce development, and small and medium manufacturers, as well as  provide an avenue for public input and feedback related to Federal  manufacturing programs.   Our country faced many challenges, as our chairman said, during the  COVID-19 pandemic, especially our manufacturing businesses.   I thank Representative Tonko, Representative Axne, and Representative  Upton, former chairman of the full committee, for their work on this  legislation to provide such businesses with resources to help them get  back on their feet. This is so vitally needed, Mr. Speaker.   I urge my colleagues to pass this particular piece of legislation,  and let's get it to the Senate as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage us to pass this bill as soon  as possible in a bipartisan fashion, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5441, the Prevent All  Soring Tactics Act of 2021, or the PAST Act.   Soring is the practice of using chemicals, sadly inflicting pain on  the front feet of a horse when they touch the ground, with the intent  to cause the horse to quickly raise its feet high off the ground.   This legislation will require the Secretary of Agriculture to issue  rules for licensing, training, assigning, and overseeing persons to be  qualified to detect and diagnose a sore horse and will prohibit the use  of certain devices on horse breeds that have a history of being sored.  This legislation will also increase capabilities for the USDA to  enforce soring violations under the Horse Protection Act.                                time  1630    Americans throughout the country hold horses in high regard, myself  included, including constituents, of course, in my district, who care  deeply for the humane treatment of these beautiful animals.   I thank Representative Cohen and the 263 cosponsors of this  legislation for their work to protect horses, and I urge my colleagues  to support this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose), the great State of Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I wish this bill would pass  in a bipartisan fashion, so that we can get it to the Senate. I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5502, the INFORM Consumers  Act.   This is a big deal, Mr. Speaker. It really is. We worked really hard  to get consensus on this particular bill in the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   I commend the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; the  ranking member, Cathy McMorris Rodgers; and the chair of the  subcommittee, my colleague, Jan Schakowsky. She is the lead sponsor of  the bill, and I am the Republican sponsor of the bill. It is a great  accomplishment.   At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when physical storefronts  were unable to open their doors, many consumers turned to online  marketplaces for all of their goods. However, with such a rise in  online purchases, criminals saw a new way to prey upon innocent  consumers.   These storefronts were now bombarded with thousands of similar  products with little to no information about the background of the  goods. Some of the goods available were originally stolen from retail  stores, counterfeited--and this happens in all our congressional  districts--counterfeited from a foreign nation, or even made with  dangerous components or forced labor.   That is why this bipartisan, bicameral legislation is necessary to  increase transparency and safety online, and I am proud to help co-lead  this bill with the chairwoman of the subcommittee, Ms. Schakowsky.   If H.R. 5502 is signed into law--and I think it will be--consumers  and storefronts will be armed with information to understand where  these products come from and whether they are real or not. That is not  much to ask for.   It also provides protections to our small sellers and local mom-and- pop stores whose privacy is protected while also being able to operate  with clear guidelines and one set of rules for doing business in all 50  States.   The INFORM Consumers Act establishes a uniform national standard to  protect consumers from bad actors and online marketplaces by requiring  certain large sellers of new and used consumer goods to verify their  contact information, such as email, phone number, and business tax ID,  within days of being listed as a high-volume seller on an online  platform.   I thank, again, Chairwoman Schakowsky, for working with me in good  faith to make this a strong product with broad consensus from  Congress--it takes both parties to get these things done--and from a  diverse set of stakeholders like Etsy, Poshmark, eBay, Amazon, but also  retail industry leaders such as Home Depot, Walgreens, and Walmart.   The support around this legislation demonstrates what happens when  Congress works together to move important legislation that will protect  all Americans. That was our goal. I am glad to see that this bill will  move forward in regular order, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support this legislation out of the House today. Let's get this signed  into law as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the staff for doing an  outstanding job on this bill. It was not easy to find consensus, but we  persevered. We did not give up. We didn't give up, and guess what? The  American people are going to be benefiting from this. That is the most  important thing. Our constituents will benefit from this bill.   Again, my subcommittee staffer, Tim Kurth, has done an outstanding  job, along with the other members of the staff and Jan's staff, as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we pass this bill unanimously, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
