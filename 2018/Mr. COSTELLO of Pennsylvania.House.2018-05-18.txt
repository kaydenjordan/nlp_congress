 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, we all care a great deal about supporting the next  generation of farmers, and my amendment would expedite the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's loan application process for young farmers  who are in the process of securing farmland, providing funding for the  farmers market promotion and local food promotion program, and also  extend the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, which  awards grants to organizations for education and mentoring purposes  through a competitive grant process.   A constituent of mine, Frank Kurylo, the organizer at the Young  Farmers Coalition of Southeastern Pennsylvania and co-owner of the  community-supported Kimberton CSA in my district, said it best:         Without support of this amendment, we risk losing our       Nation's future farms and farmers. 100 million acres of U.S.       farmland is expected to change ownership in the next 5 years.       We need to be able to connect young farmers to the land and       provide the resources to help make farming a viable option       for the next generation. The Young and Beginning Farmers Act       is critical to reaching these goals and reconnecting people       to a food system built around the sustainable principles that       drive our access to healthy food.    Madam Chair, I would like to thank the chairman for his support,  encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Chair, I want to thank my  legislative aide, Andrew Furman, for his work on this. I encourage all  of my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
