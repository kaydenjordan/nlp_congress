 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a very heavy heart upon  learning of the passing of a great human being: San Francisco's Mayor  Ed Lee.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family--his wife, Anita, and two  daughters--and the entire city and county of San Francisco and the bay  area.   My condolences are also with Leader Pelosi and Congresswoman Jackie  Speier, two San Francisco leaders who loved Ed and will miss him  tremendously.   Ed was an unshakable champion for social justice, a tireless public  servant, and, personally, a friend. He always put a smile on my face  when he considered me as and called me his sister, being two Lees.   He was such a kind and thoughtful person and a truly great leader.  Even before he was mayor, Ed was a champion for the people of San  Francisco as a community organizer and a civil rights attorney. As the  first Asian-American mayor of San Francisco, he broke new ground for  the city. As mayor, he fought to expand affordable housing, address the  homelessness crisis, and ensure that residents could earn a living  wage.   Ed will be missed tremendously. He helped so many people in his life  and he touched so many lives. Mayor Lee set the higher standards for  mayors and all elected officials as a true public servant. As we  grieve, we take comfort in knowing that he has left an inspiring and  lasting legacy of uplifting and empowering families. We will always  remember his beautiful smile and his passion for making life better for  others. May his soul rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly for her tremendous  leadership on so many fronts, especially as chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus Health Braintrust and for her tireless work in helping us  focus on the fact that gun violence should be treated as a public  health crises and that it is just that.   Congress needs to do something to stop this epidemic of gun violence  that is destroying so many communities all around the country. On an  average day, 93 innocent lives in America are cut short, due to gun  violence. These senseless deaths also disproportionately impact  communities of color.   As a Representative from California's 13th Congressional District, I  know all too well the devastating impact that gun violence has on our  communities.   In fact, the Center for Disease Control recently reported that  African-American children have the highest rates of firearm mortality  overall. They are about 10 times more likely than White children to be  killed by guns. Latino children are twice as likely as White children  to be killed by guns. But no child--and I mean no child--regardless of  their background, wealth, ZIP Code, or race, should be killed by gun  violence. No child. It pains me, and I know it pains their parents and  family members, to know that such promising young people have left us  too soon.   Tonight, let me just read the names of a few of Oakland's children  who have lost their lives to gun violence this year:   Anibal Andres Ramirez, who was only 13. He was Oakland's youngest gun  victim this year. He was shot outside the new Walnut Plaza community  center in east Oakland.   Luis Urquidez, who was 17 when his friend accidentally shot him. What  in the world was that gun doing around this young boy?   Deangelo Hal, who was 17 when he, once again, accidentally shot  himself with a stolen gun.   Keith Lawrence, who was 17 and a student at Skyline High School.  Keith was found shot dead in a parking lot.   Soane Mausia, who was 18 when he and his brother were shot by men  outside of their east Oakland home.   Joaquin Byrd, who was 18 and also a student at Skyline High School.  He was shot during a fight at a fast food restaurant.   Sultan Bey, who was 18. He was college-bound and had dreams of  becoming a computer engineer. He was shot while picking up a friend.   Mr. Speaker, this only happens in America. There are too many guns in  America. At some point, we have to stand up and say: Enough is enough.   Let me say that 5 years ago this week, a deranged gunman walked into  Sandy Hook Elementary School and massacred 20 children--20 beautiful  elementary school children, whom we continue to remember, murdered in  cold blood. Yet Republicans in Congress refuse to lift a finger in  support of legislation to prevent these kinds of tragedies from  happening.   Shame on every Republican who chooses devotion to the NRA over the  lives of Americans. We simply must take action to bring commonsense gun  reform to our Nation's gun laws. That is what the American people sent  us here to do, to govern in their best interest.   That is why we stand here tonight with Congresswoman Kelly and demand  that the Speaker take action and bring commonsense legislation for a  vote.   Give us a vote, Mr. Speaker.
