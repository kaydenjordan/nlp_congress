 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  September as National Suicide Prevention Month.   Every year, close to 800,000 people die by suicide, leaving their  family and friends to navigate the tragedy of loss. This is one death  every 40 seconds.   Studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that  suicide rates are rising, and suicide is the 10th leading cause of  death in the U.S. for all ages.   This important month is a time to share resources and stories in an  effort to shed light on this stigmatized topic. It is beneficial to  learn and pay attention to the warning signs of suicide and  periodically check in with friends and family members, especially  during these challenging times.   Additionally, talking about suicide in an open and caring way can  help those who are having suicidal thoughts. As the isolating effects  of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to grip our world, it is imperative  we take our physical and mental health seriously.   I encourage everyone to educate themselves about suicide and the  patient-centered resources available so we can help protect those in  our communities, friends, and loved ones.                            ____________________
