 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the dangerous path  that national Democrats are spiraling on down and to caution our  countrymen not to follow them. Radicals on the far left have hijacked  an otherwise righteous cause and are in command of a once proud  political party that traces its heritage back to Jefferson and Madison.   The violence the radicals have unleashed threatens lives. The cancel  culture they imposed curtails liberty. And their misguided means of  creating economic equality endangers the pursuit of happiness.   Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and their hand-picked Democratic candidates  are  [[Page S5633]]  empowering the radical wing of today's national Democratic Party--the  same people responsible for the chaos now on full display across our  country. The national leaders of the Democratic Party offer them  sanctuary.   They make excuses for radicals' destructive behavior, the way an  embarrassed parent does for a mischievous child. To them, the riots  that are occurring from Minneapolis to Indianapolis are only peaceful  protests. Promises to defund police departments are just ways of  reimaging police--whatever that means. It is the same sleight of hand  that turns government-run healthcare into Medicare for all who want it.   Most Democrats will not publicly embrace the socialist policies the  mob howls for because they know the American people will not buy it.  But once in power, they will be all too happy to implement these  radical policies, and that means a mainstream national Democratic  agenda that will abolish and defund police departments; take away on- the-job insurance; pack the Supreme Court of the United States; raise  taxes; give Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico the same number of U.S.  Senators that the State of Indiana has; eliminate the legislative  filibuster and, therefore, the right of the minority within this  institution; and spend trillions of dollars of new government programs  that Americans don't need or want.   They are allies--the destroyers and these national Democrats I  reference--only they can't be straight with the American people about  their alliance, and their leaders just can't seem to summon the simple  moral clarity that says racism is evil and so is using it to justify  violence and vandalism.   Blessedly, in my State, local Democratic elected officials have had  enough. In fact, in recent weeks, several Hoosier public servants have  left their party and they have become Republicans. To clearly  understand the choice before us, we need only listen to their  explanations why.   This is Brian Snedecor, mayor of Hobart, who just switched from a  Democrat to a Republican. He says:         I must be true to my God, my family, myself and those that       have supported and believed in me . . . I want Hobart to be a       place for business to come and the American Dream to be       achieved.    And then we have Dave Wedding, Vanderburgh County sheriff, who also  just became a Republican. Sheriff Wedding says:         I'm tired of seeing fires set in our streets. I'm tired of       people defying God, our church, our police, our government       and everything we stand for.    I happen to believe that every regular American feels the same way,  and they will look to us to protect the American Dream and put out the  fires--literal and figurative--in our streets.   The choice that each of us must make in the coming weeks is pretty  darned clear: law and order or anarchy; an economy that is growing or  employers and workers which are grounded; citizens who are free and  flourishing or subjects dependent on government.   What the radicals don't understand is that though we were born by  revolution, the history of America is one of steady progress--a  determined march together for the common good and towards an ever  better union. We have to lead that march.   When far-left Democrats offer dangerous ideas and unfulfillable  promises, Republicans will counter with innovative thinking and  results-driven policies. We will create ways to help every American  access affordable healthcare, afford a college education, advance their  careers, raise a family, and buy a home that they can call their own.   Republicans will play a part in the reinvigoration of economically  disadvantaged areas, both rural and urban. Ours is an America where  everyone lives free of fear and is able to speak their mind, and where  citizens, no matter their color or their ZIP Code, can climb as high  and fly as far as their ambition and ability allows.   Their way leads to a dead end, ours to an endless frontier. They tear  down. We will build. The path forward is clear.   I yield the floor
