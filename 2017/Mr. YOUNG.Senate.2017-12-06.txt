 Mr. President, today I wish to formally recognize  the 40th anniversary of the National Interscholastic Athletic  Administrators Association, NIAAA, which is headquartered in  Indianapolis, IN. Since its founding in 1977, the NIAAA has established  itself as a leading professional organization for educational-based  athletic programs for academic institutions nationwide. This  association plays a critical role in the development of our young  people as athletic administrators work tirelessly to provide access to  extracurricular activities, teach strong work habits, and promote civil  engagement.   December of 2017 will mark the 40th year since launching the NIAAA  mission. The organization has since grown to over 11,000 members  nationwide. Currently, its core curriculum consists of 45 courses with  a budget over $1.8 million. Despite the known fact that physical  activity improves the overall personal development of young adults,  evidence argues that the quality of coaching impacts the developmental  effects of extramural sports. To ensure that positive, professional  development is preserved, the NIAAA offers resources for secondary  school athletic administrators to manage safe, high-quality athletic  programs for all students. Along with professional educational  opportunities, the NIAAA has participated in 10 years of scholarship  donations totaling to $120,000 and recognizing 600 students as  scholarship essay winners.  [[Page S7891]]    The NIAAA's commitment to its mission and its efforts to provide  developed leaders is inspiring. In acknowledgement of its success, the  NIAAA became the first national association to be accredited by the  North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School  Improvement in the postsecondary division. The NIAAA has also developed  the only all-inclusive Professional Education Program and Certification  Program for secondary school athletic administrators.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the NIAAA for their  renowned administrators and for their dedication to America's youth. As  one of Indiana's Senators, I am honored to represent the NIAAA and  commend their commitment to responsible athletic  administration.                            ____________________
