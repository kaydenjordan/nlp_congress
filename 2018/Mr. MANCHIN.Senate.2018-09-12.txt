 Mr. President, today I rise with immense pride in  recognizing 85 heroic military veterans who will travel to Washington  from West Virginia on the Honor Flight Huntington this week. During  their time in our Nation's Capital, they will visit the monuments built  in their honor. This truly moving event serves as a unique opportunity  for us to honor and share our deepest gratitude for these individuals  who have sacrificed so much in the service of our great Nation.   With one of our country's highest per capita rates of military  servicemembers and veterans, West Virginia is undoubtedly one of our  Nation's most patriotic States. Throughout the history of the Mountain  State, our citizens have demonstrated the bravery and selflessness time  and again in making tremendous sacrifices to keep our homeland safe and  free. According to the Department of Defense, West Virginia had the  highest casualty rate in the Nation during the Vietnam war, and I am so  proud that the Honor Flight Huntington will allow these West Virginia  veterans to tour the monuments that have been constructed in their  honor. I want to express my utmost gratitude to these special men and  women for their noble sacrifice and extraordinary bravery and  patriotism to keep our country free and safe.   The 85 veterans participating in this week's Honor Flight Huntington  truly embody the Mountain State's history and contributions to the  safeguard of our American freedoms. Of the patriots attending, Billie  Barton served in World War II, Robert Duvall, Francis Figler, Okey  Gallien, Walter Kulczycki, Rodney Murphy, Robert Sullivan, and Freddie  Wells served in the Korean war, Robert Montgomery served in both the  Korean war and the Vietnam war, and 73 served in the Vietnam war. These  men represent our Nation's best, and their sacrifices and valor embody  American patriotism. They engaged in combat all over the world and  fought in pivotal wars in a critical time for our Nation.  Unfortunately, as the years go by, we are losing so many of our  veterans, so we must show them our utmost gratitude each and every day.   Showing our appreciation to those who have served is something that  we should do each and every day, but today is a special day to pay  tribute and thank those who have volunteered to put their lives on the  line for our freedoms. The memorials our Honor Flight participants will  visit today serve as an important reminder to us all that our freedoms  and liberties come at a steep cost. However, I know our veterans will  find special meaning and potentially long-lost emotions when they tour  such touching sites.   Our nation would not enjoy the freedom and liberty we do today  without the commitment and sacrifice of the veterans who have served  throughout our history. Their bravery and sacrifice know no bounds, and  for this, we are forever grateful. With this week's Honor Flight  Huntington, we celebrate and give thanks for these veterans and all  they have done for our country.   God bless all our servicemembers and veterans, God bless the great  State of West Virginia, and God bless the United States of  America.                            ____________________
