 Mr. Speaker, the Republican Party has total control of  Washington. Yet, instead of fulfilling their responsibilities to fund  the government, President Trump and the Republicans wasted the last 4  months on their tax scam.   Because they haven't done their jobs, Republicans now tell us we need  to kick the can down the road again. Minnesotans and Americans deserve  better. We need a budget deal that keeps our government open, protects  our national security, meets our commitments to hardworking families.  We need to reauthorize community health centers which will otherwise be  forced to lay off healthcare workers. We need to protect workers'  retirements by enacting responsible pension reform. And, yes, we must  pass the Dream Act.   There is bipartisan support for these priorities. The only thing  standing in the way is Republican's failure to govern responsibly.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for President Trump and the Republicans to  end the chaos and to work across the aisle to meet the urgent needs of  the American people.                            ____________________
