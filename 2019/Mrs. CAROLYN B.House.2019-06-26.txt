 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the clock is  ticking down to the hour when the Supreme Court will make its initial  decision on whether to include a citizenship question in the 2020  Census.   This administration has repeatedly told the American people, this  Congress, and the Supreme Court that its reason for wanting to include  the question is to ``help enforce the Voting Rights Act.''   It turns out, all that was a lie, and I have the documentation to  prove it on my website.   Newly discovered documents and court records clearly show that the  only goal was to achieve the desired effect of diminishing the  representation of communities of color while also entrenching the power  of ``Republican and non-Hispanic Whites,'' according to the masterminds  of the citizenship question.   This may, understandably, sound to some like an outrageous claim to  make, but we have the documentation to prove it. You can go to my  website to see it. These documents were uncovered thanks to the  courageous efforts of a woman who discovered and turned over thousands  of documents from her father's hard drive to pro bono lawyers  representing Common Cause in its litigation against gerrymandering.   In doing so, she uncovered evidence that is more powerful and  convincing than a smoking gun. It is basically a signed and sealed  confession.   The documentary trail of deceit begins on January 7, 2015, when a  Census Bureau employee used her private email account to contact a  Republican redistricting expert and urged him to push for a citizenship  question in the 2020 Census.                                time  1015    The Census Bureau employee, a Christa Jones, went on to become a  political appointee in the Census Bureau. Ms. Jones then became part of  Secretary Ross' core team on the citizenship question.   The redistricting expert she reached out to was Dr. Thomas Hofeller.  Hofeller was widely known as the Michelangelo of gerrymandering for the  Republican Party.   This conspiracy picked up steam in August of 2015 when Dr. Hofeller  concluded in a secret study he had written that simply adding one  question, a citizenship question, to the Census would facilitate a  redistricting overhaul that would be, and I quote from his work:  ``advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.''   In late 2016, Dr. Hofeller became the first person to push the  incoming administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020  census. Not long after, Hofeller ghostwrote a letter that became, word  for word, the basis of the Justice letter that had been cooked up by  Commerce to be sent to them that set forth the knowingly fake voting  rights rationale.   In October of 2017, Secretary Ross' general counsel arranged for his  key Census advisor to hand-deliver the Hofeller letter to a top  Department of Justice political appointee at a secret meeting. That  fake Voting Rights Act rationale then appeared in the letter that the  DOJ political appointee sent to the Commerce Department, and the U.S.  Secretary of Commerce sat before Congress and lied to our faces in an  effort to cover up their illegal and immoral activities.   Let no one be misled about the purpose of these efforts. They are a  concerted effort by the current administration to undermine the bedrock  principle of one person, one vote. Its purpose is to undermine the  ability of non-White, non-Republican people and communities of color to  have equal representation here in the people's House.   These deceptive and anti-democratic efforts must not stand. Even if  the Supreme Court rules against us, we will continue to fight for the  principles of one person, one vote and the Constitution's requirement  that all inhabitants must be counted. Democracy depends on it, our  people deserve it, and we will fight until we achieve it.                            ____________________
