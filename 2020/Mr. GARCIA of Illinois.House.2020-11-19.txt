 Madam Speaker, on November 8, we lost a  trailblazer for the Latino community due to COVID-19.   Maria Cerda was the first Puerto Rican woman and first Latina  appointed to the Chicago Board of Education.   In that role, she secured funding for bilingual education programs  and culturally responsive curricula that helped children like me, whose  first language was not English, succeed.   She went on to cofound the Latino Institute and later served as an  appointee to President Jimmy Carter's National Council on Educational  Research.   In the 1980s, Mayor Harold Washington appointed Maria Cerda to head  the Office of Employment and Training to oversee Federal job training  programs.   The role she played in turning Chicago into a sanctuary city also  deserves recognition.   Maria was once accosted by immigration agents in a clear case of  racial profiling. The incident prompted Mayor Washington to issue the  Nation's first ordinance preventing harassment of people of immigrant  background.   We celebrate her for her outstanding commitment to social,  educational, and economic equity for Latinos in Chicago and throughout  our country.   Rest in power, Maria Cerda. We are eternally grateful for your work.                            ____________________
