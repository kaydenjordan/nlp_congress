 Mr. Speaker, a point of parliamentary inquiry.    Could the Speaker inform us as to what the privileged  motion is.    A further parliamentary inquiry.    Could the Speaker inform us as to what the  parliamentary privileged motion was that was previously referenced just  a couple of minutes ago, that was to be taken up immediately, for which  we heard no vote.    I appreciate the answer, Mr. Speaker. Thank you very  much. That is illuminating.   A further parliamentary inquiry.    Can the Speaker advise me as to why the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) was not recognized to call for the ``yeas'' and  ``nays'' on the previous question related to the continuing resolution.
