 Mr. President, in keeping with their promise to  fundamentally transform the country, Joe Biden and the Democrats have  done everything in their power to fundamentally transform the Federal  judiciary. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been able to  interact with many of these nominees, and I have to say that I fully  believe the American people deserve better.   There was Charnelle Bjelkengren, Joe Biden's nominee to the Eastern  District of Washington. Now, she couldn't tell the committee what  article II of the Constitution says, but I expect my Democratic  colleagues will send her nomination to the floor this Thursday.   Dale Ho, who received the unanimous support of committee Democrats to  serve in the Southern District of New York, referred to himself as a  ``wild-eyed sort of leftist'' and disparaged members of the committee  on Twitter.   Before she was nominated to serve on the Fourth Circuit, DeAndrea  Benjamin released multiple people on bond who went on to commit more  violent crimes. She, too, received the unanimous support of committee  Democrats.   Todd Edelman, who is well on his way to becoming a district judge  here in the District of Columbia, also displayed soft-on-crime  tendencies. He released a known criminal who then went on to  participate in the murder of a child. He received yet another vote of  unanimous support from committee Democrats.   Marian Gaston, nominee to the Southern District of California, wrote  a policy paper arguing that we should do away with residence  restrictions for convicted child sex offenders.   Orelia Merchant, nominee to the Eastern District of New York,  couldn't define ``originalism.''   This is an embarrassment, and it gets even worse, and it gets even  worse when you look at the lack of qualification of the nominees the  Democrats are sending for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench.   Few nominations have been as disturbing as President Biden's  elevation of Michael Delaney to the First Circuit. To date, Mr.  Delaney's most noteworthy contribution to his profession is the vicious  intimidation of an underage sexual assault survivor who dared to speak  out against one of his clients.   My colleagues on the Judiciary Committee already know the story of  what Mr. Delaney did to Chessy Prout and her family, but I am going to  repeat it here for my colleagues who are unfamiliar with this nominee's  background. You should vote against this nominee, and here is why.   When she was a freshman at the elite St. Paul's Boarding School,  Chessy Prout was sexually assaulted by an older student participating  in ``senior salute.'' This was a campus-wide competition that  encouraged senior men to commit statutory rape.   The perpetrator was ultimately found guilty of misdemeanor statutory  rape, but the Prouts wanted their day in court with a civil suit. They  had evidence that the powers that be at St. Paul's knew about this sick  tradition.   Mr. Delaney represented the school, and he decided he was going to  play hardball. He moved to have Chessy, who was a minor child, named  publicly in a lawsuit that had garnered national attention. That is  right--let's publicly name this child in a lawsuit that had garnered  national attention.   I would ask my colleagues, does that sound like an action that  someone who is going to sit on the Federal bench should be taking?   Mr. Delaney knew that if he exposed Chessy as Jane Doe, he would put  her at risk of bullying, social isolation, and physical harm. He knew  that, but it was worth it to him because it meant he could silence  Chessy Prout, and he could go on and protect an elite private school  that had a sick tradition. Their leadership knew about that sick  tradition.   Most of my Republican colleagues came to Mr. Delaney's confirmation  hearing, and they questioned him about this action. Only two of my  Democratic colleagues chose to attend the hearing and to question him.  Why? Because even my friends on the other side of the aisle who have  rubberstamped each of President Biden's unqualified nominees, no matter  how controversial they were, they knew this guy, Mr. Delaney, is unfit  to sit on the bench.   I would say two things to Chairman Durbin and the rest of my  Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. First, even a cursory  glance at this nominee's record should have landed his file in the  trash can. You don't do this. You do not do this to minor children. But  now that his nomination is facing a vote, you need look no further into  Mr. Delaney's record than what has already been laid out before us. He  harassed and threatened a 15-year-old little girl who survived a sexual  assault and who was just trying to protect other young women at that  school from that same fate. That should be enough for every single  member on the Judiciary Committee to oppose this nomination. It should  be enough for every Member of this Chamber to oppose his nomination and  confirmation.   Confirming Mr. Delaney would send a chilling message--a chilling  message--to victims of sexual assault. No victim would ever be able to  walk into his courtroom and feel that they would be treated fairly  under the law after seeing the way he treated Chessy Prout.   I wanted to let Chessy speak for herself in a letter she submitted to  the Judiciary Committee. My concern is that many of my colleagues in  this Chamber have not seen this letter. Indeed, I am concerned that  Members of the Democratic caucus who did not attend the  [[Page S515]]  hearing are unaware of this letter. So I will allow her to speak.   I quote:         If Michael Delaney is confirmed--if an attorney who       brazenly intimidated a minor victim of sexual assault is       given the distinct privilege to serve as a judge for the       United States Court of Appeals--YOU--    Meaning every single one of you who would vote for him--       --are telling victims and survivors that you not only approve       of victim intimidation tactics, you reward their enactors       with one of the highest legal appointments in the state of       Massachusetts.        I expressed my concerns to . . . the Department of Justice       when Michael Delaney was first nominated in April of 2022,       and today I am urging you to vote ``NO'' to Michael Delaney's       nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Chessy's full letter be  printed in the Record alongside my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To: Senate Judiciary Committee      From: Chessy Prout        Dear Senators: My name is Chessy Prout, and I'm writing       about President Biden's nomination of Michael A. Delaney to       the US Court of Appeals in Boston. I am asking that you vote       ``NO'' to his nomination. Michael Delaney is not ethically       qualified to sit on the bench.        I believe the justice system needs to serve all involved in       court proceedings--the victim/complainant and the defendant/      institution. A lawyer who practices victim intimidation is       doing nothing for the greater good of the community; he       stands in the way of justice and furthermore keeps his       community in a toxic cycle of harm and silence.        I was the State of New Hampshire's primary witness in their       case against Owen Labrie in 2015. When I was fifteen years       old in 2014, I was sexually assaulted by Owen Labrie during a       spring rite of passage at St. Paul's School in Concord, New       Hampshire called the ``senior salute'', a ritual involving       upperclassmen soliciting sexual favors from underclassmen       before graduation. The terminology ``Senior Salute'' was       published in the school newspaper (a documented exhibit in       the trial), the Rector Michael Hirschfeld's wife received a       ``senior salute'' by email from a student, and the Rector       Michael Hirschfeld was the faculty advisor for a handbook       outlining colloquial terms among the student body, including       a definition of the ``senior salute.''        During the trial of the State's case in 2015, multiple St.       Paul's School students were called to testify to Labrie's       premeditation. The day of the students' scheduled testimony,       I walked into the Merrimack Courthouse through the back doors       with a bailiff to avoid the news cameras at the front of the       courthouse (I was a minor and Jane Doe in the case.) In a       conference room on the first floor by the back door entrance       I saw my former classmates, those who were scheduled to       testify and some who were mere spectators, speaking with       Michael Delaney. My father, Alexander Prout, and the director       of public affairs for the New Hampshire Coalition Against       Domestic and Sexual Violence, Amanda Grady Sexton, also       witnessed the group assembled in the conference room. We       notified state prosecutor Catherine Ruffle of what we saw.        When the students took to the stand, the pre-trial get-      together Michael Delaney was involved in and seemingly       coordinated on behalf of St. Paul's School began to make       sense. The students had a new, carefully worded response when       defining the ``senior salute'' to the jury, and all denied       the school had any knowledge of the insidious nature of the       ritual. From the scene that I witnessed in the courthouse       conference room with the students and Michael Delaney to the       new, stilted, coordinated definitions of the students       testifying, I believe Michael Delaney tampered with the       witnesses on behalf of his client, St. Paul's School.        When I learned the extent to which St. Paul's School knew       of my perpetrator's prior abuse, my family and I sued the       school in 2016. Michael Delaney, in response to our suit and       as St. Paul's School's counsel, submitted a motion to strip       my anonymity. I refused to allow this textbook tactic of       victim intimidation to silence me, so I came forward publicly       with my name and my story in an attempt to use my voice to       shed light on the experience of a teenaged survivor of sexual       assault.        I remember so clearly reading Michael Delaney's motion       front to back when I came home from my new high school one       day, processing what it meant, and then defiantly stating to       my parents that after everything I'd been dragged through       (from anonymous death and rape threats on the internet to the       betrayal of and backlash from my closest friends at St.       Paul's School), I wasn't going to let Michael Delaney's dirty       tactics bully me, then 16, into shame and silence.        When survivors of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse       come forward to seek some semblance of justice, there is an       army of attorneys with a tried and true playbook of tactics       to discredit, pressure, and manipulate survivors and victims       into silence. What these attorneys don't seem to realize is       that most survivors are simply seeking an acknowledgement of       harm and an actionable plan to make their community a safer       place.        Every 68 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted; every       nine minutes, that victim is a child. According to the USDOJ,       63% of sexual assaults are not reported to the police. Of the       37% who do report, only 2.5% get some form of justice. This       staggering statistic should give everyone, especially those       in the legal field, pause.        If Michael Delaney is confirmed--if an attorney who       brazenly intimidated a minor victim of sexual assault is       given the distinct privilege to serve as a judge for the       United States Court of Appeals--YOU are telling victims and       survivors that you not only approve of victim intimidation       tactics, you reward their enactors with one of the highest       legal appointments in the state of Massachusetts.        I expressed my concerns to Attorney from the Department of       Justice when Michael Delaney was first nominated in April       2022, and today I am urging you to vote ``NO'' to Michael       Delaney's nomination.            Sincerely,                                                      Chessy Prout.     The White House knew that Mr. Delaney was unfit to  serve, but they nominated him anyway.   For the sake of young men and women around this country who are  survivors of sexual assault, I urge President Biden to withdraw Michael  Delaney's nomination, and I call on my Democratic colleagues to urge  the White House to withdraw this nomination. If they do not withdraw  this nomination of a man who intimidated a minor child, exposing a  minor child, who is unfit to serve--I urge you to vote no if the White  House does not pull this nomination.
