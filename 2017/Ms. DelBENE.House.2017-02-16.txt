 Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing important  legislation to ensure that all perpetrators of child abuse are held  accountable. It closes a Federal loophole that wrongly denies justice  for some survivors, like Penny Saum from Washington State.   Last month, I heard from Penny directly about the horrific abuses she  faced at the hands of her father. He was convicted, sentenced to  prison, and ordered to pay $5 million in damages. But because he is a  military retiree, Federal law has shielded him from paying a cent of  the restitution that he owes. It is unacceptable.   Congress already passed a law in 1994, holding Federal retirees  accountable for abusing a child. Now it is our responsibility to apply  the same standard to all perpetrators.   I am honored to be working with my colleague from Washington State,  Congresswoman Herrera Beutler, to close this heartbreaking loophole. In  these challenging times, this is exactly the kind of bipartisan  solution we can all work together on.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, another week, another attack on women's  health. Only 6 days ago, the Senate confirmed a Secretary of Health and  Human Services who opposes women's access to no-cost birth control--a  man who claimed that not one woman has struggled to afford  contraception. Now, House leaders are working to eradicate the number  of places where women can access birth control. It is unacceptable.   For more than 40 years, title X has been a bipartisan program that  helps vulnerable Americans get basic health care like cancer  screenings, HIV tests, and contraception. In 2014 alone, it prevented  over 900,000 unintended pregnancies. But if this resolution passes,  millions will find themselves without access to the essential care that  they need, especially those in rural and underserved communities.   I have said it before and I will say it again: Our constituents  deserve better. It is time to focus on the priorities that matter to  the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
