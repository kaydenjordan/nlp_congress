 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 74, which terminates  the national emergency pertaining to actions and policies that threaten  the very tenuous diplomatic progress that we have achieved in Yemen.   Active American diplomacy has supported a very fragile U.N.-mediated  truce, but lifting the national emergency prematurely would undermine  the nascent progress that has been made over the past several years.   Sanctions are leverage. If the United States Government unilaterally,  and without receiving anything in return, grants amnesty to Yemeni  figures seeking to undermine the country's fragile cease-fire, we would  potentially be enabling even more conflict.   The list of individuals sanctioned under the Yemen executive order is  quite short, but let's take a look at some.   Mansur al-Sa'adi is a Houthi commander of Yemen's Naval and Coastal  Defense Forces. He led attacks against international shipping in the  Red Sea and smuggled Iranian weapons to Yemen.   Ahmed Ali Saleh is the son of former dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh.  President Obama sanctioned Saleh, as he played a critical role in  destabilizing the country in 2014 and 2015, and is still seeking to  reignite his family's legacy of ruling the country.   Now, I could go on, but the individuals currently sanctioned under  the Yemen emergency executive order are on the sanctions list for a  reason. They have violated human rights and acted against American  national interests, including abducting locally employed staff at the  United States Embassy in Yemen.   I am a strong supporter of using diplomacy over military force to  bring about a stable, long-term peace in Yemen, but let's be clear. We  must use every diplomatic tool at our disposal to bring about that  result. Throwing out one of the most powerful weapons in that  diplomatic arsenal, economic sanctions, will not result in peace.  Rather, it is much more likely to cascade Yemen into more chaos and  more violence.   That is why I oppose this resolution and urge all of my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, let me say I share the sentiment of the gentleman from  Arizona about engaging Congress more regularly on these issues. I would  like to see Congress reassert itself on issues of foreign affairs. I  think we can actually all agree on that.   However, the notion of terminating these executive orders only to  return assets to terrorists and some of the worst malign actors in the  world strikes me as a real threat to the United States of America,  counter to the principles of Democrats and Republicans.   That is why, for the reasons that I stated in my opening remarks, I  believe a termination of this national emergency will actively  undermine our diplomatic efforts and further destabilize Yemen.   We cannot and must not allow people who seek to undermine Yemen and  the Gulf to obtain funds that would allow them to accomplish those very  ends. That is why I have opposed H.J. Res. 74, and I encourage all of  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 71.   As a Gold Star son who lost his father in the Vietnam war, I  understand firsthand the human cost of war. I also know my colleague  from Arizona (Mr. Crane) knows that cost, as well, as a veteran of our  armed services, and I honor that.   That is why, since I came to Congress, I have worked in a bipartisan  fashion to repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF and have consistently  supported the repeal of the 2002 Iraq war AUMF, as well. I wish we had  been able to get that legislation through the Senate last Congress, but  I remain hopeful that we can do so this year.   All of this is to say that I do not have a hawkish position on Iraq,  but sanctions and military force are not the same thing. Again,  sanctions and military force are not the same thing. Terminating the  national emergency with respect to Iraq would trigger the immediate  release of currently sanctioned assets of persons who the U.S.  Government has determined are a threat to Iraq's stability and reform  efforts, including terrorists and others who have committed acts of  terrible violence.   This is not an exaggeration. Numerous Shia militia fighters and ISIS  terrorists are sanctioned under the Iraq program. The Iraq executive  order is reviewed every year. Perhaps it is not a surprise that the  Bush administration renewed it annually, and also the Obama  administration, even though President Obama formally ended the Iraq war  in 2011 and ran for President in part based on his opposition to it.   The Trump administration also renewed the EO every year. Despite  President Biden professing his full support of repealing the 2002 AUMF,  the Biden administration also has sought to continue the Iraq sanctions  program.   As Members can see from successive renewals and the ongoing situation  in Iraq, these sanctions target groups and individuals that continue to  operate against U.S. interests in Iraq and the region and are closely  monitored on an ongoing basis.    We do not want terrorists to access funds to kill civilians and  destabilize Iraq or the region, let alone target Americans overseas. It  is important for our national security for these sanctions to remain in  place, and I strongly urge Members of this body on both sides of the  aisle to forcefully and in a bipartisan manner oppose this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, my argument is very simple: We cannot and we must not  allow terrorists to obtain assets that could help them perpetuate  attacks against their government, against civilians, or against  Americans.   I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 71, and I urge all my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 79, which terminates  the national emergency pertaining to actions and policies that have  existed for years, enjoyed bipartisan consensus, and underpinned a  significant portion of the U.S.-Syria sanctions architecture.   More specifically, this measure targets an executive order that was  issued based on legislation that Congress passed with broad bipartisan  consensus: The Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty  Restoration Act, which over 400 Members of the House, including 200  Republicans, voted in support of.    For over 12 years, Syria's Assad regime has perpetrated a heinous  campaign of genocide and unrelenting violence against the Syrian  people, who rose up for their basic rights and freedoms after years and  years of oppression.   This unceasing campaign of brutality has been aided and abetted by  Assad supporters in Tehran and Moscow, and amounted to countless war  crimes and the most egregious violations of international humanitarian  law of which I am aware.   Relevant to this legislation, the Assad regime has served as a  fertile and pliant jurisdiction for Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies  to shuttle arms throughout the region, as well as grow in numbers and  capabilities in support of the Assad regime's actions against the  Syrian people.  [[Page H3669]]    At the same time, actors ranging from the remnants of ISIS to other  violent extremist organizations like al-Qaida-affiliate Hurras al Din,  and others continue to terrorize civilians, and threaten to  reconstitute and, again, use Syria as a launchpad for attacks into  Europe and the rest of the world.   Active U.S. efforts to counter and degrade these very groups and  support networks--those targeted by the sanctions--would be undermined  by abruptly repealing and stripping away such important authorities.  Preemptively abandoning these policy tools and sanctions authorities  through a rushed, poorly conceived legislative effort undermines our  national security interests and those of our closest partners.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me in opposition to this measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   I agree with my colleague from Florida on a couple points. I abhor  war like he does, and I wish Congress would reassert itself, but I must  say, we should legislate it, not terminate it.   Abruptly terminating this national emergency will simply undermine  U.S. national security interests and those of our allies. The  resolution would further destabilize Syria and the entire region, be a  gift to the violent and oppressive Assad regime, and create space for  terrorist organizations like ISIS to grow in numbers and capabilities.   I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 79 and urge my colleagues to do the same.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle join me in opposing it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
