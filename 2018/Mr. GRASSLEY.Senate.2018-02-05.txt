 Mr. President, I wish to speak on the nomination of  Andrei Iancu to be Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of the U.S.  Patent and Trademark Office.   Intellectual property is critical to our national economy because it  encourages the innovation that improves lives and creates jobs. The  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office plays a critical role in fostering  innovation by protecting intellectual property rights, so it is  important that the office have strong and accountable leadership.   Mr. Iancu holds a B.S. and M.S. in engineering from the UCLA School  of Engineering and a J.D. from the UCLA School of Law. He currently is  the managing partner of the Los Angeles law firm Irell & Manella, where  he has practiced intellectual property law since 1996. Mr. Iancu has  represented both patent owners and accused infringers, large and small  companies, and individuals in a large number of patent cases.   Mr. Iancu possesses strong legal qualifications, has a proven record  in the field of intellectual property law, and is well respected in the  intellectual property community. Last December, the Senate Judiciary  Committee approved Mr. Iancu's nomination by a voice vote. I support  Mr. Iancu's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to vote for him.  [[Page S602]]
