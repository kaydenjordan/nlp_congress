 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Sarah  Tyree, a passionate advocate who spent her career fighting for farmers,  advocating for rural and urban agriculture, and working to end hunger.   Sarah dedicated herself to ending hunger and spent her life working  on issues like promoting nutrition and reforming our food system to  make eating locally grown foods more accessible to everyone.   After starting her career on Capitol Hill, Sarah worked for the  Biotechnology Industry Organization and then the Missouri State  Department of Agriculture, helping to establish the Missouri  Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program.   Sarah served as vice president of the agricultural consulting firm  AgriLogic, and then spent the last 15 years of her career at the  financial cooperative CoBank here in Washington, D.C., where she most  recently served as vice president for policy and public affairs.   Madam Speaker, the impact of Sarah's commitment to agriculture and  local farming cannot be understated. She established a partnership  between CoBank and the D.C. Central Kitchen, which allowed for the  kitchen to significantly expand their local purchasing power. Her  efforts helped many farmers keep land that they may have otherwise lost  due to the pandemic.    Sarah was a devoted member of the D.C. Central Kitchen board of  directors for many years, and she served as chair of the board between  2013 and 2018. In this capacity, Sarah continued her amazing work to  end hunger and played a major role in securing funding to establish  D.C. Central Kitchen's new location and expand its reach.   Sarah was unbelievably generous in her support of a cause that was  dear to me, Monte Belmonte's annual march across Western Massachusetts  to end hunger and to help support the Food Bank of Western  Massachusetts. She poured her energy into supporting local and national  efforts to end hunger while also empowering the next generation of  leaders in combating hunger through her work as a board chairman of the  Campus Kitchens Project.   Sarah never stopped imagining a bigger and brighter future. She  believed in harnessing the power of community to make America the best  that we can be, promoting nutrition, supporting local farmers, and  fighting to end hunger along the way. Sarah approached her work and  this life with an open heart and a genuine desire to do good. She cared  about improving the lives of others in a touching and rare way and has  left an immeasurable impact on this world.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, and all those  whom Sarah's light touched, it is my great privilege and honor to  celebrate and recognize the wonderful life of the late Sarah Tyree.   I want to say that I think I speak for all of my colleagues in this  Chamber when I extend our condolences to her husband and her family. I  hope that they all get comfort out of the fact that Sarah made such a  difference for so many in this country and around the world.                            ____________________
