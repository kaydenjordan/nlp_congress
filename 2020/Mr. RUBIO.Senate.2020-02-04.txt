 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I honor a  small business that demonstrates America's unique entrepreneurial  spirit. I am pleased to recognize a business that has been a notable  member of their local community for nearly 30 years. Today, it is my  pleasure to name Sun Harvest Citrus of Fort Myers, FL, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 1990 by Sandy McKenzie Nicely, Sun Harvest Citrus is known  for their high-quality citrus products, which makes them a premiere  Fort Myers destination. Their produce is sourced from citrus groves  originally purchased by Sandy's grandfather Robert Edsall, Sr., in  1940. The grove, located along the east coast of Florida and consisting  of approximately 800 acres of land, has passed through her family for  three generations and is now managed by her brother, David McKenzie.  Sandy became inspired to open the Sun Harvest Citrus store in 1990 when  the Florida citrus industry dealt with overproduction. The store became  a great way to sell the surplus citrus from the groves, while offering  a location for customers to gather. Since 1990, they have expanded  their products to offer several different types of citrus produce,  juices, candies, and sweets, as well as serve as a tourist attraction  for the Fort Myers area.   Today, Sun Harvest Citrus employs more than 25 Floridians and  produces a diverse variety of orange and grapefruit products. The store  sells seasonal citrus baskets and produces up to 2,500 gallons of juice  a day. One of their most popular products is the Orange Vanilla mix  soft-serve ice cream that has become a well-known tourist stop for  people traveling down the west coast of Florida. Many of their products  are seasonal, such as Valencia oranges or Honeybell tangelos, with Sun  Harvest Citrus providing each seasonal fruit and juice during the  months they are produced.   In addition to their store and citrus groves, Sun Harvest Citrus has  become a centerpiece in the Fort Myers community. USA Today listed Sun  Harvest Citrus as one of the 10 best places to shop in the Fort Myers  area. Sun Harvest Citrus also distributes their juice to local  businesses and community events. For example, in an effort to spread  Christmas cheer, Sun Harvest Citrus provided their fresh orange juice  to patients and families at a holiday event hosted by the local Fort  Myers Kiwanis at the John Hopkins All Children's Outpatient Care  center.   Sun Harvest Citrus is an excellent example of a family run business  that is making a positive impact in their community. I commend this  Florida business for its dedication to providing great products to the  community and creating a gathering place where all local residents and  visitors are welcomed. I am proud to recognize everyone at Sun Harvest  Citrus, and I look forward to seeing their continued success.                            ____________________
