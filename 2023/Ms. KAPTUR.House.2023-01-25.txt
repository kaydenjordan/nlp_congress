 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the delivery of Abrams  tanks to our European allies, including Ukraine. Let us fulfill any  backup supply to assure NATO can check aggression by Russia anywhere on  that continent.   Liberty for Ukraine needs no Neville Chamberlain moments. Delivering  Abrams tanks will help Ukraine push toward victory sooner rather than  later. Liberty's mission must be victory.   Russia's cruel and unprovoked war on Ukraine has produced a nation  soaked in blood from one end to the other. Putin views weakness and  appeasement as a recipe for failure.   Across Ohio, which I am privileged to represent, and the Great Lakes  region, our fellow citizens and families have survived and often, too  often, have fled oppression in central Europe at the hands of a  predatory Russia.   We know the price of liberty. Our patriotic men and women in the  United Auto Workers proudly manufacture the Abrams tank in Lima, Ohio.  They guard liberty every day.   Our workers build the finest equipment in the world, so critical to  victory. Americans know what brave Ukrainians are fighting for and  against.   Hasn't enough innocent blood been spilled already?   Onward Abrams.                            ____________________
