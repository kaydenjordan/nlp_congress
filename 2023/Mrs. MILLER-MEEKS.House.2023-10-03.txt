 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate James  Simmons, a dedicated construction teacher at North Scott High School in  Eldridge, Iowa, who will receive the Harbor Freight Tools for Schools  Prize for Teaching Excellence. This prestigious national recognition  awards Mr. Simmons with a $50,000 grant for his school's skilled trades  program.   Teachers, students, and the North Scott principal have been working  together to surprise Mr. Simmons today with his award by orchestrating  a surprise celebration at his school, held outdoors by the tiny homes  his students tirelessly built.   The Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize spotlights the exceptional  yet often overlooked contributions of high school skilled trades  teachers. This year, the program saw a record number of applicants,  with over 1,000 teachers from all 50 States competing in the rigorous  selection process.   We are immensely proud of Mr. Simmons. I congratulate him on this  well-deserved honor.                            ____________________
