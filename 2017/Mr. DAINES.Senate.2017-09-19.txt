 Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS,  is tasked with keeping the American public safe in the homeland. Its  mission ranges from thwarting terrorist attacks to responding to  natural and manmade disasters, from interdicting the movement of  illicit drugs at the border to combating human trafficking and  protecting its victims. Nearly one-quarter of the population within our  borders are children They have unique needs, and we must ensure those  needs are met in the face of threat and in recovery.   For example, when children are stranded at school because of a  terrorist attack or a natural disaster, they need a planned route and  means to get home safely. A child is caught up in a drug cartel and  used as a trafficking mule--the child is a victim, not a criminal. He  needs help breaking the addiction. An adolescent, promised a better  life, has her passport stolen and forced to sell herself. She needs  help escaping her captors and healing.   The recent tragedies of wildfires in Montana and across the Northwest  and Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are all too recent reminders that we  need to plan for the needs of children in both building resiliency and  responding to disasters. That is why I am introducing the-Homeland  Security for Children Act. This legislation would simply ensure DHS's  Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans includes input from  organizations representing the needs of children when soliciting  stakeholder feedback and developing policies. Further, a technical  expert at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be authorized  to lead its external collaboration and policy developments to integrate  the needs of children into its activities to prepare for and respond  to, disasters.   I thank Senator Hassan for being an original cosponsor of this bill,  as well as Representative Donald Payne of New Jersey for leading in the  House of Representatives. I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in  support of this important legislation.   Mr. DAINES Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the legislation be printed in the Record.
