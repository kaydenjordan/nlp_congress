 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 190) to provide for consideration of the extension under the Energy  Policy and Conservation Act of nonapplication of No-Load Mode energy  efficiency standards to certain security or life safety alarms or  surveillance systems, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 190         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Power And Security Systems       (PASS) Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NONAPPLICATION OF NO-LOAD MODE ENERGY                     EFFICIENCY STANDARD TO CERTAIN SECURITY OR LIFE                     SAFETY ALARM OR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS.         (a) Section 325(u)(3)(D)(ii) of the Energy Policy and       Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(D)(ii)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``2015'' each place it appears and       inserting ``2021''; and        (2) by striking ``2017'' and inserting ``2023''.        (b) Section 325(u)(3)(E) of the Energy Policy and       Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(u)(3)(E)) is amended--        (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``July 1, 2017,'' and       inserting ``the effective date of the amendment under       subparagraph (D)(ii)''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(iv) Treatment in rule.--In the rule under subparagraph       (D)(ii) and subsequent amendments the Secretary may treat       some or all external power supplies designed to be connected       to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system as       a separate product class or may extend the nonapplication       under clause (ii).''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 190.   External power supplies are used for all sorts of devices, and we  have learned from experience that the Federal energy efficiency  standards sometimes don't work in the ways we want them to. In  particular, we need an exemption from these rules for the security and  life safety alarms and surveillance alarms.   S. 190, the Power and Security Systems, or PASS, Act, provides  targeted exemptions that allow these critical uses to stay on the  market.   Devices like home security alarms or fire detection need to be on 24/ 7, 365, but the 2007 energy law on energy efficiency standards for  external power supplies does not allow for this. Since then, Congress  has created exemptions for these ``always on'' devices, but this  exemption ended on July 1 of 2017. S. 190 extends this exemption out to  2023.  [[Page H7946]]    The result of this bill would be that these important security  systems will continue to be available, preserving the jobs of those who  make them, and, most importantly, the safety of those who use them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I close with a short and sweet: good bill,  vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, S. 190.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 920) to establish a National Clinical Care Commission.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Olson) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record.  [[Page H7947]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record.  [[Page H7947]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 920, the National Clinical  Care Commission Act, a bipartisan bill that has received unanimous  support within both the House and the Senate Chambers. S. 920 is the  Senate companion to my bill, H.R. 309, which is cosponsored by over  half of my House colleagues.   It has this level of support because our Nation faces an epidemic.  Diabetes or prediabetes affects over 100 million Americans. Nearly one  in three of our neighbors is affected.   This legislation will also help many others who are affected by other  diseases like heart disease, obesity, and many others.   When I first came to Congress in 2009, it was crystal clear that we  had a big problem. The benefits of all the Federal research dollars  going into these diseases were simply not making their way to patients.  Researchers at the NIH, the CDC, the DOD, the VA, and the FDA weren't  sharing diabetes research. Who knows? Sharing information may have put  us on a path to cure diabetes.   It was clear then, and it is still clear today: we need a laser-like  approach to improve patient care by pursuing a strong Federal focus on  research.   This bill accomplishes that goal by creating a National Clinical Care  Commission comprised of doctors who specialize in diabetes care for  patients.   This commission will have 3 years to strengthen the partnership  between Federal stakeholders and health professionals who will bring  hands-on, clinical experience to improve care.   This is not a new, unending bureaucracy. After 3 years, this  commission will sunset. In 3 years, it will be gone.   We have already made such a huge investment of taxpayer dollars into  research. It is time to leverage that investment into meaningful  prevention and effective treatment options.   President Reagan once said: ``There is no limit to the amount of good  you can do if you don't care who gets the credit.''   That is why I stand here today in strong support of my bill, which  became Senator Shaheen's bill, because this bill will help so many  Americans who are suffering from diabetes.   So today I ask my colleagues to again help all those who suffer from  diabetes and other complex metabolic and autoimmune disorders by voting  for S. 920.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Iowa for those kind  words, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, short and sweet. This is a good bill.  It is the first step towards actually funding a cure for diabetes.  Maybe we will do that. By the way, it leaves here and will be signed  into law before this week ends. I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye''  when this vote comes up for a final passage vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, S. 920.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
