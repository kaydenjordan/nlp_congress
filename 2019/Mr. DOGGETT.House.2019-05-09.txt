 Madam Speaker, after so many failed attempts to repeal  our access to healthcare, Trump and his Republican cohorts are finding  new ways to take away coverage from millions of Americans who suffer  with preexisting conditions.   Now, Republicans have hijacked the mechanism that was designed to  promote State healthcare innovation to subvert that very innovation.   What they call ``innovation'' is finding new ways to destroy  protections for preexisting conditions and to promote junk insurance  plans that cover--well, they cover what you don't need most.   If you really need it, if it is for your medical condition, they are  unlikely to cover it.   How outrageous.   A waiver of Federal regulations designed to encourage innovation that  just waves goodbye to the safeguards that an estimated 40 percent of  Texans with preexisting conditions really need.   So, while Trump continues to hide his tax returns, he cannot hide the  fact that he is sabotaging the healthcare protections for millions of  Americans.   After bankrupting his own businesses and leaving creditors at a loss  for decades, Trump would bankrupt families with serious medical needs.   And it is almost a joke that he tells us he's got a great plan to  solve all of our healthcare needs--he said it again at the White House  this morning--but he is going to wait until after the next election to  show us what his secret plan is, which sounds a lot like the failed  plan that he advocated in the last election.   Let's just pass this bill and tear down the wall that Trump and his  cohorts want to build between too many Americans and their doctors.
