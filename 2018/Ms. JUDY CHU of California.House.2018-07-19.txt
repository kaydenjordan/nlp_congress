 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to H. Con. Res. 119. This resolution is nothing more than an election  year stunt by Republicans to distract from the growing list of issues  they failed to address this Congress.   Let me be clear: This vote is a sham. If Republicans truly wanted to  debate the merits of a carbon tax, they would allow the Ways and Means  Committee to hold hearings with expert testimony and robust discussion.  In fact, multiple members of our committee have already introduced  bills that tackle the ever-pressing issue of climate change, which is  impacting the health and well-being of American families and future  generations more and more each day.   This is not just a Democratic concern either. There is even a  Republican carbon tax bill expected to be introduced in the coming  days.   Instead, here we are, wasting what little time we have left this  Congress, debating a pointless resolution while there are urgent  problems waiting to be resolved. Congress should be passing legislation  to address the double-digit increases in healthcare premiums caused by  the repeal of the individual mandate by the GOP tax scam or reuniting  immigrant children with their parents.   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, this vote is a wasted opportunity and just  another example of Republicans placing political expedience over  regular order.   As a member of both the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition  and the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, I would love to  participate in a real debate about how we can address climate change.  My constituents are clamoring for us to act. But if Republicans are  going to continue to ignore and deny the existence of this crisis, the  least they can do here, in Congress, is to use this time to legislate,  not electioneer.
