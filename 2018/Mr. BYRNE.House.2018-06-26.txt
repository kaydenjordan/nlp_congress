 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to congratulate Dr. Bill  Lawrence on his retirement after over 30 years as a principal in  southwest Alabama.   For the last 21 years, Dr. Lawrence worked as principal of Foley  Elementary School in Baldwin County. Prior to that, he served for 10  years at W. H. Council Traditional School in Mobile County.   Being a principal is a tough job, but Dr. Lawrence thrived in the  role throughout his career. He overcame many obstacles and always  provided steady leadership for his students, teachers, faculty, and  parents. I know that personally because I am one of those parents.   Dr. Lawrence would always go above and beyond the job description. He  said that one of his proudest accomplishments was starting the Turkey  Takeout program to help provide families in poverty with a free  Thanksgiving meal.   On behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District and the countless  students positively impacted by Dr. Lawrence over his career, including  my daughter, Laura, I want to wish him all the best upon his  retirement.   Foley Elementary School and public education in Alabama will not be  the same without him.                        Congratulating Victor Helmsing     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Victor Helmsing on his  retirement after 35 years serving as a teacher at St. Paul's Episcopal  School in Mobile.   Throughout his time at St. Paul's, he held a range of teaching  positions, including everything from senior government and economics to  AP U.S. Government and politics, to Western civilization.   He also helped lead various extracurricular programs, including the  Key Club for 28 years, and serving as senior class sponsor for 35  straight years. He has also been a leader among his peers, serving as  chair of various administrative committees.   During various time periods, Victor served as associate headmaster,  assistant headmaster, and director of the upper school, but his true  passion has always rested in the classroom. I know every former student  has their own story about something Victor Helmsing taught them or a  way he had a lasting impact on their lives. That is just the type of  teacher and leader he has always been.   So on behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, I want to  wish Victor and his wife, Vaughan, all the best upon his retirement.  His impact on St. Paul's and his former students will be felt for years  to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  appreciate her steadfast leadership on behalf of our Nation's  servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, we are in the process of a long-needed rebuilding of our  Nation's military, and this funding bill will ensure the rebuilding  process continues.   I have spoken on this floor many times about the readiness crisis  facing our military. We are finally getting our planes back in the air  and troops who are fully prepared to deploy. This readiness crisis  hurts our overall national security. But, Mr. Speaker, it also puts our  servicemen and -women at great risk.   Last year, we lost four times as many servicemembers in training  accidents as we lost in combat. We owe it to these men and women to do  everything in our power to avoid more of these accidents. That duty  requires consistent and robust funding for all aspects of our defense.   I am pleased to say that this funding bill builds on the progress  made over the last 2 years, and I am proud to support the Defense  Appropriations bill and this rule.   This bill sets aside $674.6 billion for the Department of Defense,  which is consistent with the National Defense Authorization Act that  passed out of this body earlier this year.   Importantly, the bill will help us recruit and retain the greatest  fighting force on the face of the Earth. That includes full funding for  a 2.6 percent pay raise for the military and an increase in overall end  strength.   The bill makes much-needed investments in training and equipment  acquisition to ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources  and tools they need to safely and successfully defend or country.   As vice chair of the House Seapower and Projection Forces  Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased to see the  bill make progress toward rebuilding a 355-ship Navy fleet. The bill  funds the construction of 12 new Navy ships, including three littoral  combat ships.   The bill also funds the procurement of additional F-35s, F/A-18 Super  Hornets, Black Hawk helicopters, Abrams tanks, and C-130J aircraft,  among many others.   Given the current threat environment, the bill invests in our  Nation's missile defense programs and ensures support for some of our  key allies around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, peace through strength should always be the position of  the United States. There is no greater deterrent to war than a strong,  fully equipped U.S. military.   I want to thank Chairwoman Granger and her subcommittee for their  work on this legislation, and I look forward to a strong bipartisan  vote later this week.
