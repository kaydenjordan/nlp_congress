 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Brenau University's 10th president, Dr. Anne Skleder, who tragically  passed after bravely battling cancer at Emory University Hospital in  Atlanta.   Born in Pittsburgh, Anne studied psychology at the University of  Pittsburgh and later earned her doctoral degree from Temple University.  Dr. Skleder then incorporated her passion for people and learning into  a successful career in academia--mentoring, teaching, and serving  students for years.   Breaking glass ceilings, Anne went on to become the 10th and 1st  woman president of Brenau University in Gainesville, Georgia. Yet it  was not the title that she cherished, but rather the opportunity to  improve the lives and futures of Brenau University students.   Her leadership extended beyond the campus, as she served on the  executive committee of the Atlanta Regional Council of Higher Education  and was a board member for numerous organizations, including the  Women's College Coalition, National Association of Independent Colleges  and Universities, and the Greater Hall Chamber of Commerce.   Our sincere condolences are with Anne's family as they mourn her  loss. While her leadership and impact on our community will surely be  missed, we cherish Dr. Skleder's legacy and find comfort in knowing  that she has found eternal peace with her beloved parents and brother  in the presence of our Heavenly Father.   Georgia's Ninth District will always remember the incredible impact  that Dr. Skleder had on students at Brenau University and on our  community as a whole.              Honoring Exceptional Businesses in Lumpkin County     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional  businesses in Lumpkin County. The  [[Page H6873]]  Dahlonega-Lumpkin County Chamber of Commerce recently held its annual  State of Economic Development meeting to recognize outstanding  businesses in our community.   On behalf of the Ninth District, I would like to honor this year's  winners.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Development Authority of Lumpkin  County's Economic Investment Award recipient, DahloneGO, a successful  transportation and tour company in north Georgia. This honor is well- deserved as DahloneGO continues to make incredible investments in the  Lumpkin County community.   Additionally, I recognize this year's Corporate Responsibility Award  recipient, R-Ranch in the Mountains, which creates a positive impact in  Lumpkin County by offering northeast Georgians and tourists alike  exceptional experiences through its more than 800 acres of campsites,  trails, and lodging. Nestled in the beautiful north Georgia mountains,  R-Ranch brings tremendous value to the community through its unique  amenities and activities, cultivating economic growth and providing  memorable adventures for families and outdoor enthusiasts.   I also congratulate Blue Coolers, the recipient of the Workforce  Development award. In addition to manufacturing top-notch, durable  coolers, this thriving company received this exciting honor for its  impressive initiatives to train and equip individuals with skills and  knowledge needed to maintain a strong workforce.   Next, I recognize Satellite Industries, a leading innovator in the  portable sanitation industry, for receiving the Business of the Year  Award.   For over 65 years, Satellite Industries has been advance engineering  their products, such as portable restrooms and restroom trailers to be  strong and user-friendly for customers across the country. I  congratulate Satellite Industries on this outstanding achievement.   In addition, the city of Dahlonega Downtown Development Authority  recognized several downtown businesses for their significant impact on  the community this year.   These honors include Black Bear Mercantile as Emerging Business;  Dahlonega Inn on Main for Downtown Investment; The Station, as the  Local Favorite; and Connie's Ice Cream and Sandwich Shop for Downtown  Business of the Year.   I congratulate the Dahlonega-Lumpkin County Chamber of Commerce's  2023 State of Economic Development award winners.   Mr. Speaker, I thank each of the recognized businesses for positively  impacting our community, strengthening the future workforce in north  Georgia, and fostering economic prosperity in Lumpkin County.                             Single Subject Rule     Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the former majority leader on  the Democrat side, just reminded us of our single subject rule that our  Speaker cosponsored back in 2015. That is the current rule of the  House, and yet my Democrat colleague wants us to violate it by lumping  in aid for Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel together with border security in  one bill. No.    We have already passed a bill to support Israel. We have already  passed a border security bill, H.R. 2. Both are languishing in the  Democrat-controlled Senate. Where was the call for the Senate to stay  here and do their job? He should have called upon the Senate, as I do  now. Pass the Israel bill, pass the Secure the Border Act, and give  both countries a merrier Christmas.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank both of my friends from Texas. What  an incredible job they have done so far in communicating that the  swamp's compromise NDAA is, indeed, woke, weaponized, and wrong for  America.   Why, you may ask.   It is because during backroom negotiations, virtually all of the  conservative wins that the House Republicans fought for were removed.  This is a disaster for both our military and the American people.   Now, due to the so-called compromise, this year's NDAA green-lights  the Biden administration's horrendous policies of treating our military  like a social experiment.   For a long time, I have firmly believed that our Nation's incredible  military will never be defeated by an outside force before we rot from  the inside first, and that is exactly what these woke policies are  doing. It is the real reason that recruiting is at rock-bottom levels  for our military.   For example, the NDAA fails to eliminate the Pentagon's chief  diversity officer, it fails to ban mask mandates on military  installations, and it fails to prevent the Department of Defense  education activity from teaching radical gender and racial ideologies.    Not to mention, the NDAA allows Joe Biden's Department of Defense to  waste taxpayer dollars on transgender surgeries, drag queen shows, and  abortion travel. Abortion travel, imagine that. The radical left will  stop at nothing to advance the evils of abortion, even if their vile  efforts violate Federal law.   Additionally, a vote for this year's NDAA is a vote to reauthorize  warrantless surveillance on the American people. That is right. To make  matters worse, a clean reauthorization of FISA 702, which has been  dangerously abused to illegally spy on Americans--literally, last year  278,000 times--was attached to this year's National Defense  Authorization Act.   So let me be perfectly clear: the Fourth Amendment is not a  suggestion, and I certainly will not be fearmongered by the  intelligence community in order to allow this egregious and  unconstitutional abuse to continue.   So either get a warrant or let FISA go dark, which means let FISA's  authorization expire on 12/31.   Furthermore, FISA's reauthorization should never have been attached  to the NDAA in the first place. An extension of FISA is not germane to  the NDAA, meaning this legislation violates our January agreement of  germane, single-subject bills.   Nevertheless, since leadership plans to pass the NDAA under  suspension of the rules, Members will have no opportunity to raise the  appropriate point of order against this nongermane matter.   Madam Speaker, this is not how Washington should operate. Members  deserve the opportunity to debate legislation and vote on these matters  separately. That is what we agreed to in January, and that is the  standard we must now follow.   For all these reasons, I am a hard no on the fiscal year 2024 NDAA,  and I urge all my colleagues to join me in taking a firm stand against  this bad bill. As a 28-year Navy combat veteran, I am disgusted by the  Biden administration's ongoing efforts to weaken our great military  with woke and weaponized policies.   I am greatly disturbed by this body's blind acceptance of these  nefarious efforts, so they can go home early for Christmas. Our  military and our Nation deserve better.
