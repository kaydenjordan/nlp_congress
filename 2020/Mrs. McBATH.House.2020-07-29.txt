 Mr. Speaker, the childcare industry has suffered  tremendous losses since the start of this pandemic. Centers are facing  increased operating costs and are working overtime to provide adequate  PPE and sanitation materials to keep our children safe.   Countless American families rely on the childcare industry, and we  must provide them with the materials and equipment that they need to  give our children the best possible care. To help small businesses  grow, support hardworking Georgians, and uplift our economy, parents  must have a safe place to send their children.                                time  1200    Truly, the childcare industry helps give our kids the foundation for  their future, and it needs our help.   Hardworking families deserve our support, and the Child Care Is  Essential Act would give providers the funding and resources they need  to nurture the next generation.
