 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because America's livestock  industry is in crisis. In southern Minnesota and across the country,  this has particularly hit our hog farmers. They are in big trouble.  Packing plant disruptions have led to excess hogs and the actual  destruction of animals and not even using the meat for the food supply.   The situation is so bad that, this week, I introduced legislation to  mitigate losses in this area. I introduced the Livestock Producer  Assistance for COVID-19 Damages Act. This bill will expand the USDA's  Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Catfish  Program to cover income losses for farmers and producers who have been  unable to market livestock due to packing plant closures.   In Minnesota, our hog operators make a significant contribution to  our State's economy. According to a study from the University of  Minnesota, current disruptions in the pork supply chain, coupled with  the current 15 percent unemployment rate, could result in an estimated  loss of $660 million of economic activity in our State. The researchers  also concluded that a 15 percent drop in hog production would lead to  an estimated loss of 2,100 Minnesota jobs.   While these statistics are rightfully alarming, this problem is not  unique to Minnesota. States like South Dakota, Missouri, North  Carolina, Virginia, and Iowa have similar issues. Pork and livestock  producers are suffering huge losses, financial and otherwise, and all  through no fault of their own.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  supporting this bill. We must stand with our family farmers and defend  the interests of rural communities, the American economy, and our food  supply.                            ____________________
