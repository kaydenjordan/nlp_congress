 Madam Speaker, I rise today because every State is now a  border State. A border crisis is now a fentanyl crisis. But don't take  it from me, take it from the sheriffs in my district.   Bartholomew County Sheriff Matt Myers said, ``Fentanyl is coming into  our country from our southern border. It is becoming an increasing  problem, and it is killing our citizens.''   Randolph County Sheriff Art Moystner said, ``Our guys on the ground  tell us they know these drugs are coming through Dayton via the  southern border.''   Hancock County Sheriff Brad Burkhart said, ``Illegal drugs coming  across the border affects everyone, and Indiana is not immune.''   In Decatur County, Sheriff Dave Durant explained it like this,  ``Fentanyl in our communities is not just a thing, it is the thing.''   Democrats, stop downplaying this crisis. It is killing Hoosiers in  Indiana.                            ____________________
