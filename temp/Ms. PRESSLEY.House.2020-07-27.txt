 Mr. Speaker, today I rise on behalf of every Black man  and Black boy who has been dehumanized, surveilled, and targeted by the  policies drafted and debated within the walls of this very institution  and institutions of power throughout our Nation.   I rise today to offer my unwavering support and to thank  Congresswoman Wilson for laboring in love to see the Commission on the  Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act become a reality. It is long- overdue legislation that will push our Nation one step closer to  grappling with the systemic racism and structural barriers that have  robbed us of the lives of our Black husbands, our Black brothers, and  our Black sons.   Passage of this bill today is a testament to the longstanding calls  and efforts in communities, including in my own Boston. When I was on  the Boston City Council in 2014, we attempted to establish a commission  like this, and that effort was vetoed. So it feels so good to see this  happening on the Federal level.   The passage of this bill today is a testament to the longstanding  calls and efforts throughout our Nation to examine and combat the  systemic inequities and disparities impacting Black boys and men from  education and employment to health and to housing and to incarceration.   With this bill's passage today, we declare on the floor of the House  of Representatives, the people's House, that we are our brother's  keeper, that Black lives matter, that Black men matter, and that our  Black boys matter.
