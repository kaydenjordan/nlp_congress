 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I urge all of our colleagues who have  come to me and to the Senator from Maine to talk about the need for  regular order to vote yes now on this motion to proceed. I will have  more to say about what we all need to do to keep this process moving,  but this vote is important if we want to make sure that Senators will  have the opportunity to speak out for their values and their  constituents.   So I urge a yes vote on the motion to proceed, and let's get going on  an agreement, as soon as possible, so Senators can vote and debate and  act on amendments. That is what regular order is, and that is what  everyone has told me is exactly what they want and what I have been  hearing all year from Senators on both sides of the aisle.   Let's keep up the bipartisanship. Let's get to work.                                Vote on Motion     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I call up my amendment, No. 1205, and  ask that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  substitute amendment No. 1092 be considered an Appropriations Committee  amendment for purposes of rule XVI, with no other rule XVI points of  order waived by this agreement; that H.R. 4366, H.R. 4368, as reported  in the House of Representatives on June 27, 2023, and H.R. 4820, as  reported in the House of Representatives on July 24, 2023, serve as the  basis for defense of germaneness under rule XVI for any floor  amendments and that it be in order for floor amendments to amend the  substitute in more than one place; further, that it be in order for the  following amendments to be made pending and that, at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican  leader, the Senate vote on the following amendments to the Murray- Collins substitute amendment No. 1092, with 60 affirmative votes  required for adoption and with no further amendments or motions in  order to the amendments: Paul No. 1157, Vance No. 1125, Ernst No. 1123,  Blackburn No. 1155, Lee No. 1121, Stabenow No. 1115, Peters-Cornyn No.  1122, Rosen No. 1117, Padilla No. 1139, and Schatz No. 1120.    Mr. President, let's be clear. To all of my colleagues  who told me and Senator Collins and the American people that we have to  get back to regular order, that is exactly what we are working to do  here. We have been working in good faith to set up amendment votes and  to get the ball rolling on this bill. Now there are a few colleagues on  the other side of the aisle who are dismissing all of this out of hand,  any kind of reasonable agreement to move this process forward, and  blocking all of the agreements we put together to move forward.   Listen to this. If we all want regular order, a key part of this is  allowing Senators to come down, have amendments voted on, and moving  forward  [[Page S4505]]  with an amendment process so Senators can make their voices heard on  our funding bills. So we can't move at a glacial pace, and we can't  have Senators obstructing this process needlessly.   I do hope they reconsider and work with us on a timely, serious  process so all Senators, especially those who do not serve on the  Appropriations Committee, can come here and speak up for their values  and their constituents.   I know colleagues are ready to bring forward amendments, some of  which I don't agree with and will likely vote against, all of which I  am prepared, with my colleague from Maine, to discuss and debate. But  the Senate should be allowed to work its will and to debate these  issues here on the floor, and the American public should be able to see  for themselves where their elected leaders stand on those issues as we  consider the legislation that will fund the U.S. Government.   That is regular order, but that cannot happen until everybody in this  body gets serious about coming to this agreement about how we move this  process forward, period.   Now, I want to be clear. While there are a few Senators who are  determined now to derail this process--this bipartisan process--the  vast majority of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have put  forward serious efforts into crafting these genuine bipartisan bills. I  know that because the Senator from Maine and I took great pains to make  sure everyone could weigh in here. We made extraordinary progress in  the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have heard about it from so many  of you, on both sides of the aisle, all week.   How did we do it? We agreed early on to have an open, bipartisan  process for our funding bills--exactly what many Senators have been  calling for. We said: Let's stick to the bipartisan debt limit deal,  which we all passed in July, and let's keep out partisan poison pills,  and let's give Members a chance to weigh in and make their  constituents' voices heard. In other words, let's show the American  people Congress can actually work.   Let's be clear. The bills we are considering aren't Democratic or  Republican spending bills. They are bills both sides--Democrats and  Republicans--wrote after a lot of negotiation and compromise. Together,  this package that we have reflects input from Senators from across the  country and across the political spectrum, working on behalf of the  people who sent them here. That is exactly why all of these bills in  this package passed our committee unanimously.    The American people are watching. They are wondering can Congress  still work, if we can actually come together and reach common ground,  even on something as fundamental as funding our government. They do not  want to see grandstanding or chaos. They want to see results. The vast  majority of this body wants to show them that we take this job  seriously, that we take their problems seriously, which the Senator  from Maine and I greatly appreciate.   I hope that the few holdouts who are now keeping us from moving  forward and reaching an agreement so we can line up amendments and  votes will see reason. Let us show the American people that Congress is  still capable of working in good faith to help people and solve  problems, just like they sent us here to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Boozman for being  such a great partner and for his work on this bill and all the  appropriations bills. I look forward to working with him as we continue  to try to bring this up and get it rolling and moving on the floor. So  I thank him very much.   Mr. President, as I said, we are working in good faith to set up  amendment votes and get this ball rolling on the bipartisan  appropriations package that the senior Senator from Maine and I  assembled, along with all of our colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee, so we can return the Senate to regular order for the first  time in a long time, which many of our colleagues have called for.   In the meantime, today, I want to talk about the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill that is  included in this funding package and why the investments in this bill  are so important for our military readiness, for our military families,  and especially for veterans across our Nation who have sacrificed so  much for us.   As chair of the MILCON-VA Subcommittee, I worked closely with the  senior Senator from Arkansas, who just spoke, to get input from our  colleagues on both sides of the aisle and draft the strongest possible  bill, even under tough top lines from the debt limit deal. I am very  pleased that the bill we put together, which did pass our committee  unanimously, makes crucial investments and gets our military and our  veterans the support they need.   This bill provides $19.1 billion for military construction--that is  an increase over the fiscal year 2023 level--and supports hundreds of  construction projects at base installations so we can improve the  quality of life for our servicemembers and families, modernize  maintenance and training facilities, and make military installations  more resilient against growing threats like climate disasters.   The $2.4 billion for quality-of-life improvements in this bill will  support projects like building new barracks and housing and, just as  critically, maintaining existing housing so that the  [[Page S4506]]  homes military families are living in right now do not fall into  disrepair. I am proud that our bill provides funding for eight new  child development centers so we can expand childcare access for our  military families. These types of quality-of-life investments are  essential to our recruiting and retention and overall readiness. More  importantly, they are what our troops deserve and what we owe them for  the sacrifices they make.   This bill also funds other essential military construction projects  like training and vehicle maintenance, improving energy resilience on  bases, and making sure that our installations are better prepared to  face severe weather events because, as our generals and admirals have  made crystal clear, climate change is a national security threat, and  we absolutely cannot afford to let it undermine our troops and our  military readiness.   The bill we are considering also includes investments to strengthen  our alliances and partnerships around the world, including by  supporting NATO infrastructure projects and providing funding to  strengthen our global presence, including over half a billion for this  work in the Indo-Pacific.   I am also glad we were able to include funding to address PFAS and  other toxins--forever chemicals--at former installations that could put  our communities and military families especially in harm's way. PFAS  are a serious health hazard, and they have been found in the water  supply at hundreds of military bases across our country, including in  my home State.   Then, of course, there is the VA funding in this bill, which is just  as essential. I am someone who previously chaired the Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee. I specifically asked to be assigned to that  committee as soon as I came to Congress, and I am really honored to  have been the first woman ever to serve on that committee because, as  the daughter of a World War II veteran, I take our Nation's commitment  to care for our veterans personally.   When my father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which  eventually forced him to stop working, his VA benefits were crucial to  making sure he could get the care he needed. So I know firsthand how  essential VA care is for veterans and their families, and I am  constantly meeting with veterans in my State about their experiences  too.   Living up to our obligation to those who served our country is simply  nonnegotiable for me. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle feel the exact same way, and that is especially true for my  partner across the dais on our subcommittee, the senior Senator from  Arkansas. We have worked closely together for many years on the Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committee, so I knew when we started on this bill  that he was someone who cares deeply about our men and women in the  military and takes our obligations to our veterans seriously. In other  words, he is exactly the kind of partner you want across the table to  negotiate a bill like this with.   I am pleased to say we were able, together, to draft a bill that  ensures that we keep our promises to servicemembers and veterans by  fully funding the VA's budget request.   That means increasing funding for mental health and suicide  prevention programs since we know, tragically, that suicide is the  leading cause of death for veterans, especially our younger veterans.   It means increased funding for rural healthcare so veterans in every  corner of the country can get the care they need, homelessness  prevention programs that help with the challenges of returning to  civilian life, and for the caregivers program, which I fought to expand  along with so many of my colleagues last year.   Of course, it means increased funding for women veterans' care. Women  are the fastest growing demographic of our veterans.   I am also especially pleased to say this bill includes funding to  expand the childcare pilot program that I helped establish because, as  I always remind my colleagues, we have a childcare crisis in this  country, which is why I worked to include funding to expand childcare  sites at our VA facilities so lack of childcare doesn't keep our  veterans from getting the care they need.   In addition to the VA funding in here, let's not forget that last  year we actually passed the largest expansion of VA care in decades by  passing the bipartisan PACT Act, and earlier this year, Congress worked  to live up to that expansion by passing more than $20 billion in  funding for the Toxic Exposures Fund, as part of the Fiscal  Responsibility Act. This is already making a difference for veterans  who were exposed to burn pits and other toxins.   Another crucial investment in this bill is the funding increase for  VA infrastructure because we cannot let veterans' healthcare be  undermined by the challenges related to VA's aging medical facilities  or, for that matter, jeopardized by botched rollouts like we saw with  the electronic health record modernization program. I was glad to see  that the VA did put a pause on the rollout of the EHR earlier this  year--something I had been pushing them to do--and we made sure that  pause was reflected in our funding bill because I was raising the alarm  from day one about how the botched EHR rollout was hurting Washington  State veterans. It is a challenging situation now with EHR. We can't  just flip on a switch and fix it, much as I wish we could.   But I am watching closely to make sure we see changes that provide  real results for our veterans and our VA providers because, at the end  of the day, these investments are not just about programs and  contracts; this is about our promise to get our veterans the benefits  they earned and need to stay healthy--prescriptions, mental health  care, cancer screenings, and so much more--and to make sure every woman  and man who serves our country in uniform gets the support and the  training and the equipment they need to be at their best.   Before I wrap up, I also want to say a little bit more about some of  the items in this bill I fought hard for that are especially important  in my State.   When it comes to military construction, there are several projects  that I worked very hard to get funding for, like new barracks and a  parachute rigging facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord; bulk storage  tanks at the fuel supply in Point Manchester; updated electrical  infrastructure at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to help prevent  unexpected power outages; and funding to advance other projects across  my home State, like equipment, maintenance, and platoon training  facilities.   When it comes to support for our veterans and our VA facilities, I  pushed to make sure this bill includes funding to help the American  Lake VA Medical Center upgrade its facilities and provide quality care  and funding for the Tahoma National Cemetery and its work to ensure we  honor the veterans we have lost.   It is worth noting that while those are some of the projects I am  most excited about in my State, we made sure that all Senators on both  sides of the aisle could weigh in on this bill, and I know many other  Members worked very hard to support similar projects and get funding  that is important to their States.   So I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and talk about some of  the projects you have in this bill and why this funding is so important  to your families back home. I also invite them to talk to me and the  Senator from Maine about amendments and ideas for how we can make these  bills better. Our staffs are working around the clock, and so are we.   We do want to set up a managers' package. We do want to set up votes  on amendments. We want to get this funding package passed in the Senate  and passed into law because--let's be clear--this is a bill that can  actually be passed into law, and that is because of all of the hard  work and careful consideration and, in many cases, compromise that went  into producing this bipartisan bill.   This is a responsible bill that we wrote together, Democrats and  Republicans. How? By listening to our communities and listening to each  other so we can help people solve problems. That is how this process  should work. That is what we were all sent here to do.   So let's work together and show the American people that Congress can  do its job, that it can actually give our communities the resources  they need in a timely and responsible way and help people and solve  problems.  [[Page S4507]]    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I submit the following notice in  writing: In accordance with Rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate,  I hereby give notice in writing that it is my intention to move to  suspend Rule XVI for the consideration of amendment No. 1092 to the  bill H.R. 4366.                            ____________________
