 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have images of three politicians in my office: Abraham  Lincoln, Robert F. Kennedy, and Samuel H. Bellman, who was the first  Jewish person ever elected to the Minnesota Legislature, a great  champion of civil rights and civil liberties in the Constitution and of  the creation of the  [[Page H5496]]  State of Israel, the Jewish democratic state in 1948. He was my  grandfather.   He was elected at a time of terrible anti-Semitism, not unlike today.  Minneapolis was actually called the anti-Semitism capital of America,  and my grandpa told me a story I will never forget.   The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and Republican Caucuses both had  their annual retreats at a country club that did not allow Jews or  Blacks to enter. My grandfather complained privately to the speaker  about the fact that he wouldn't be able to go to his own retreat. The  speaker apologized but said that it was a tradition.   So my grandfather, the only Jewish person in the chamber, spoke on  the floor about anti-Semitism. He was booed and jeered at, and members  left as he tried to speak.   When the minority leader asked me to manage our time today, I thought  about my grandfather and how he must have felt on that day. I rise here  not in spite of the fact that I am a Jewish American who supports the  Constitution and the Jewish democratic state and hates all the anti- Semitic tyrants and terrorists of the world, from Putin in Russia and  Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia to Hezbollah in Hamas. I am here  because of these things and because of everything that I believe in and  stand for.   At this moment when democracy is under siege all over the world,  America must stand tall for the Constitution of the United States. This  resolution is about one thing and one thing only: the punishment of  speech.   We have the chance to show the world what the American Constitution  means and how we hold fast to our core principles even when we are  drawn away from them by our passions and our righteous anger.    The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the very heart  of it is our First Amendment, which protects every citizen's freedom of  speech and says Congress shall make no law abridging it.   The freedom to speak includes the freedom to disagree, the right to  think radically differently from the majority about important things,  or else it is no freedom at all. It is easy to defend freedom of speech  for people when you agree with them. The test for each Member today is  whether you can defend freedom of speech for people when you most  fundamentally and vehemently disagree with them.   The First Amendment is like an apple, and everybody wants to take  just one little bite out of it--leftwing speech, rightwing speech,  sexist speech, feminist speech, homophobic speech, pro-LGBTQ speech,  anti-war speech, pro-war speech, religious speech, sacrilegious speech.  Everybody wants a bite out of the apple.   At the end of the day, after everybody has taken his or her bite, do  you know what is left? Nothing. There is nothing left.   If you want to save the apple, you have to learn to tolerate not just  the speech you love the most but the speech you hate the most.   Now, like the First Amendment, the Speech or Debate Clause embodies  this central value in the proceedings of this body. It states that  Members of Congress ``shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and  breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance  at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and  returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House,  they shall not be questioned in any other place.''   In the two-and-a-half-century history of this great Chamber, Members  have been overwhelmingly censured for their actions, not for their  speech--actions like participating in the violent assault against  Charles Sumner of Massachusetts; assaulting Representative Grinnell, of  Iowa, with a cane; selling military academy appointments; taking  bribes; engaging in mail fraud and payroll fraud; improper spending of  campaign funds; embezzling congressional money; engaging in sexual  misconduct with a House page.   Do you see the difference? It is not what they said. It is what they  did.   I can find only three categories of cases where speech is the sum and  substance of the charge, and all are exceptions that have been ratified  by the Supreme Court:   One, violent threats against other Members of this body, which the  Court has found, as recently as April, are not protected by the First  Amendment.   Two, fighting words: the use of unparliamentary or aggressively  insulting language on the House floor that constitutes a direct affront  to another Member. The Supreme Court has said that fighting words are  not protected.   Three, speech advocating or promoting treason, secession, or  insurrection, all of them outside of the First Amendment because of  numerous provisions in our Constitution condemning and opposing  insurrection.   That is it: violent threats against other Members, fighting words on  the floor, speech inciting insurrection.   The resolution offered against the gentlewoman from Michigan is all  about censuring her for her political speech and literally nothing  else. No actions, no conduct, is being alleged or punished. The entire  motion is about her speech and how much we hate it and how wrong we  think it is, and all of that is fine for all of us to express  individually on the floor, in the media, on social media.   I have said to Ms. Tlaib myself that the phrase ``from the river to  sea'' is abhorrent to me, even with her published explanation of what  she means by it, which is very different from what Hamas says about it  and how Hamas uses it, but I would never think of punishing her or  disciplining her because we disagree about that.   The resolution proposes to condemn her for quoting this objectionable  phrase in her video, a video which is indisputably protected speech  under the First Amendment.   Unlike the gentleman from New York, Mr. Santos, whose proposed  expulsion by members of the majority was rejected by a commanding  bipartisan majority last week because he has not been convicted of  either the criminal or the ethics charges outstanding against him, Ms.  Tlaib has been criminally charged with nothing. She has been civilly  sued for nothing. She has no ethics charges outstanding before the  Ethics Committee in any way.   It is easy to see why. She cannot face criminal punishment or civil  liability for her speech because, in the United States of America, we  don't punish people for their political ideas, no matter how  wrongheaded or offensive we think they are. The majority might think  they are, or it might not, but in any event, it doesn't make any  difference.   She won reelection with 71 percent of the vote in Michigan's 12th  District, and if anyone is going to punish her for her political ideas  or performance, it must be the people of her own district who sent her  here to represent them.   Mr. Speaker, the disciplinary process should never be used to punish  the political speech or viewpoints of a Member of this Chamber just  because the majority disagrees.   The punishment of political viewpoints will mean that Members will be  censured just for being in the minority rather than in the majority,  and that will come to stifle our dialogue and haunt all of our work.   For example, the good Speaker of the House, who is my friend from the  Judiciary Committee, has taken positions in the past arguing that sex  between consenting gay adults should be a crime, that the Supreme Court  was wrong to strike down sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas and wrong to  give gay people the right to marry in Obergefell, a right that he said  is ``the dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy that could doom  even the strongest republic.''    The vast majority of Americans reject these positions as extreme in  public opinion polls and believe all citizens should have the freedom  to pursue their own love lives and to marry.   If the House majority changes hands, should we actually censure the  former Speaker of the House for his constitutional apostasy and thought  crimes against the rights of millions of Americans? I sure hope not  because the gentleman from Louisiana is absolutely entitled to his  political and religious views, no matter how far outside the  constitutional and American mainstream they are.   Under the First Amendment, extremism is in the eye of the beholder,  but how will we resist the temptation to punish him in the future if we  set a precedent today that Members can be censured and canceled simply  for their  [[Page H5497]]  political heresies in the eyes of the majority controlling the House?   If we say the gentlewoman can be punished because her views of  history are wrong, as I heard my friend say, can we then punish Members  of this body who refuse to vote to take down in our Halls the statues  of Members of Congress from the 19th century who joined the Confederacy  and committed treason against the Union, people like John Breckinridge,  a former Vice President and U.S. Senator who was expelled from the  Senate after he defected to the Confederacy? Should we use the  disciplinary process to impose historical orthodoxy?   If anything, there is a stronger constitutional case for punishing  the 120 Members of the House who voted against taking down statues of  Confederate traitors because multiple provisions of the Constitution  explicitly forbid and punish participation in insurrection. Do Members  who voted that way want to risk being censured in the future by  establishing that divergent minority views on history are a legitimate  matter of institutional discipline?   What about the Members who defended conspiracy theorist Alex Jones  and stated that Sandy Hook and Parkland mass murderers of dozens of  schoolchildren were staged by Hollywood to generate support for gun  safety? That is not even a matter of opinion but adjudicated positive  fact, and still, the Constitution protects your right to be wrong about  facts unless you are deliberately defrauding or cheating someone out of  something like money or campaign contributions.                                time  1500    What about all of those Members who have followed the former  President in advancing the big lie that he actually won the 2020  election? Should we convert the 60 Federal and State court decisions  rejecting claims of election fraud and corruption into discipline and  punishment of Members who still cling to that view?   What about the 11 Members of this body who lost the 405-11 vote in  2019 recognizing that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks  during World War I was a genocide? Does their denial of the genocidal  character of the deaths of more than 1 million Armenians qualify them  for collective punishment today, institutional punishment?   Can we convert differing interpretations of history into the basis  for disciplinary action?   Well, perhaps you say political dissent should be uniquely punishable  when it comes to foreign policy. Of course, the First Amendment doesn't  distinguish between speech having domestic or foreign policy content.  All of it is protected. If not, every Member of this body who has voted  against aid to Ukraine and praises Vladimir Putin, as the former  President did for his ``genius'' and his ``savvy,'' or says Putin is  not our enemy, as a number of Members have, could be censured for it by  this body.   This resolution not only degrades our Constitution but cheapens the  meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit  wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault, and so on.   When people are punished for their political ideas and expression,  they will wear it as a badge of honor. They will fundraise on it.  Millions of dollars will flow to people who are punished that way, and  they will join the public in mocking the new speech censors of  Congress.   A secure constitutional republic, which actively protects the freedom  of dissenting speech to allow for serious debate and growth as society,  shows its strength, not its weakness.   As Thomas Jefferson, whose beautiful statue is right outside of this  room, put it: ``If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve  this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed  as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be  tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it.''   Now is a moment when we will get to see who in the House of  Representatives believes in the freedom of speech, even the speech they  hate, versus those who want to impose a new political straitjacket of  cancel culture on America and Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the ranking member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Bowman).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Carson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I don't think that my  colleagues have caught us in any kind of contradiction when they raised  the case of Representative Gosar, who posted a video on social media  depicting himself killing our colleague Representative Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and also attacking President Biden. This was a true  threat. These were fighting words. This is something that is totally  within our First Amendment tradition.   Mr. Speaker, we live in a time of terror and war, great polarization  and trauma across the world. We must grapple the rule of law to our  souls with hoops of steel at this moment. In a time of all kinds of  storms all over the world, the rule of law, the Constitution, is our  shore, and now is a moment to hug the shore.   Let's defend the freedom of speech for today, for tomorrow, and going  forward in the Congress of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
