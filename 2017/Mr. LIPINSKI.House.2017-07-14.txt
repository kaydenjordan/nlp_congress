 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and  I want to make one thing perfectly clear. American taxpayers want their  tax dollars to go to putting Americans to work. This amendment means  buy American and hire American. So I just want everyone to be clear. We  hear a lot about Buy American, Hire American. This is what this  amendment would do, and I urge all my colleagues to support this  amendment.
