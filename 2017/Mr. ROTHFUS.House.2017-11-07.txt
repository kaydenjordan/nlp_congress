 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Huizenga for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Pittenger) for leading on this important legislation.   I rise today to express my support for the Clarifying Commercial Real  Estate Loans act.   The Financial Institutions Subcommittee has spent a significant  amount of time analyzing the state of bank lending. Not surprisingly,  aside from loans from major banks to major corporations, we found that  bank lending in today's regulatory environment is weak. We need to  jump-start our economic growth once again, so we are going to need to  find ways to address some of the unintended consequences of the rules  coming out of Washington, D.C.   The high volatility commercial real estate loan designation is one  such feature that has inhibited growth and opportunity. The complexity  and ambiguity of HVCRE makes it hard for banks to comply. This drives  up borrowing costs for real estate developers and prevents  entrepreneurs from engaging in the types of activities that create jobs  and opportunity.   This legislation will bring clarity and common sense to HVCRE  requirements, and I ask that my colleagues support the Clarifying  Commercial Real Estate Loans act, which is important legislation.
