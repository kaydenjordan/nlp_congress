 Madam Speaker, President Biden's failure  to safely withdraw our troops from Afghanistan has resulted in American  civilians being attacked in broad daylight on the streets of Kabul as  they attempt to reach the airport.   As I speak today, Americans are being stranded behind enemy lines.  Our top priority must be to bring them home safely. Now is not the time  for taking vacations or giving canned remarks from the west wing.   Now is the time for American leadership, and President Biden has  failed us in this regard. The evidence is clear, the fall of  Afghanistan is Joe Biden's Saigon.   Today, my prayers are with the military that they have redeployed and  are working to end this crisis. They are also with the American  citizens who remain today stranded in Afghanistan.  [[Page H4359]]                                ____________________
