 Mr. Speaker, we have an incredible opportunity to pass  tax cuts for the American people. I appreciate President Trump's  leadership on this issue as well as the leadership of Chairman Brady in  working to pass the President's tax plan.   While we are working on tax cuts, I rise today to urge the chairman  and the Ways and Means Committee to also eliminate tax credits for  illegal immigrants. Most Hoosiers get it: we can't continue to reward  people who come to our country illegally while those who work hard and  play by the rules struggle to get ahead.   I have authored legislation to close the loophole that allows $7  billion in refundable child tax credits to be paid out to illegal  immigrants every year. This money should be used to increase the child  tax credit for law-abiding American families. President Trump included  this proposal in his budget request to Congress, and I believe it  should be included in the President's broader tax plan.                            ____________________
