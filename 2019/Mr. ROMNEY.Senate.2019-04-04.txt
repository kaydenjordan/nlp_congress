 Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to  Captain John ``Jack'' Frederick Wilson, who celebrated his 100th  birthday this past Tuesday, April 2.   Born on April 2, 1919, and raised in Park City, UT, Jack is one of  only a small handful of pilots trained at Brigham Young University. He  joined the Army Air Corps on December 11, 1941, just 4 days after the  Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.   After training in the B-24 Liberator bomber, he was made a pilot in  the 90th Bombing Group in the Fifth Air Force of the Army Air Corps and  was deployed to New Guinea. He and his crew were eventually assigned to  reconnaissance missions in the North China Sea tracking the Japanese  fleet, and his B-24 was stripped of all bombs, machineguns, and  defensive measures to be replaced with extra fuel tanks. Jack said of  that time, ``My career as a B-24 pilot basically consisted of long  periods of boredom punctuated with moments of terror.''   He was a member of the Jolly Rogers and has carried his membership  card his entire life, which says, ``Having been assigned to the best  damned heavy bomb group, and having paid his dues, Captain Jack F.  Wilson is hereby considered a member in good standing of the Jolly  Rogers.''   As a typhoon threatened the island airstrip where he was stationed,  locals from Okinawa showed him a cave that he and his B-24 crew  sheltered in, saving their lives. Despite popular opinion at the time,  Jack never demonized the Japanese people. He believed ``there are good  people everywhere'' and taught his children and grandchildren the same.   After the war, Jack used his flying skills to help locate wildfires  and pioneered the ``interagency'' concept, establishing the National  Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID. The main headquarters building  bears his name.   In honor of a native Utahn and one of the last remaining B-24 pilots  from World War II, the U.S. Congress extends warm greetings to Mr.  Wilson on April 2, 2019, his 100th birthday. We commend him for his  life of service and his valor in defense of his country.                            ____________________
