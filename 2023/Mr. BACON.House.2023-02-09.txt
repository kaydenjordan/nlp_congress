 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 117.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the President's  hypocrisy when it comes to the debt ceiling. He opposed raising the  debt ceiling three different times.   Here are some of those quotes when he voted to oppose debt ceiling  increases. He said, ``My vote against the debt limit increase cannot  change the fact that we have incurred this debt already, and will no  doubt incur more.''   He also said, ``It's a statement that I refuse to be associated with  the policies that brought us to this point.''   He also said, ``There is just so much of our debt that other nations  want to hold. The more of it they accumulate, the closer we are to the  day when they will not want any more.''   He also said, ``Our interest rates will go up, the value of their  U.S. bonds will drop, and we will have big problems.''   The roots of that threat lie in the disastrous policies of this  administration. I could go on and on. It is all in the Congressional  Record.   Three times he has opposed raising the debt ceiling. The way you  spell hypocrisy when it comes to the debt ceiling is simple. It is B-I- D-E-N.
