 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Corpus Christi  Army Depot, which celebrates its 60th anniversary today.   CCAD is the premier rotary-winged helicopter repair and maintenance  facility for the U.S. Army.   Like a battle-hardened soldier, CCAD remains strong, committed, and  dedicated to answering the Nation's call and keeping the Army flag  flying.   The freedom and security that Americans enjoy today are a direct  result of the hard work and continuing commitment of CCAD to the  mission given by the U.S. Army.   Thousands of military, civilian, and contractor employees have walked  the halls, worked in the hangars, turned the wrenches, flown the  aircraft, and dedicated themselves to the operation that began in 1961.   The community leaders and citizens of Corpus Christi, Texas,  recognize and appreciate the service of all personnel of CCAD, past and  present.   We salute this great organization's unending mission. I wish the  Corpus Christi Army Depot a happy 60th birthday today.                            ____________________
