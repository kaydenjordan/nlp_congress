 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, or  better known as the GOP tax scam.   This bill provides tax cuts for corporations and multimillionaires at  the expense of hardworking middle class families. Massive corporate tax  cuts do not guarantee job growth or higher wages. The only thing  guaranteed is the $2.3 trillion that this scam adds to the deficit.   Democrats are serious about passing comprehensive tax reform that is  fair and that puts a little more money in the pockets of working  Americans. This fiasco of a bill is not fair.   Corporations get a massive 15 percent tax cut, but what do working  families get? They get nickeled and dimed.   Despite student loan debts surpassing $1 trillion, this bill  eliminates the student loan interest deduction, which only allows those  earning $80,000 or less to claim it in the first place, squarely  hurting middle class Americans who are trying to pay off debt, save for  a home, or buy a new car.   Teachers will no longer be able to deduct expenses for school  supplies that they purchase with their own money for their classrooms,  yet corporations are able to deduct the cost of those same supplies  that they purchase.   Seniors and people with chronic illnesses would no longer be able to  deduct some of the cost of their treatment. At a time when many  families are feeling the pressures of affording care for their children  and their aging parents, this bill takes money right out of their  pockets.   Under this bill, 29 million households would lose their property tax  deduction. Eighty percent of middle class homeowners would lose,  compared with just 13 percent of high-income earners. Does that sound  fair?   Finally, the elimination of the State and local income tax deduction  disproportionately impacts middle-income families, especially those in  California, whose residents would see an overall net tax increase of  $12.1 billion.   The Tax Code is a reflection of our values. The Republicans have  clearly chosen who they serve--the wealthy and corporations--but I am  concerned about the 36 million Americans who will see a tax increase,  teachers and their students, and people with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disaster of  a bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to  this bill, one from SEIU and one from the AFL-CIO.                                                           SEIU,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways & Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of       the House Committee on Ways & Means: On behalf of the two       million members of the Service Employees International Union       (``SEIU''), I write to strongly oppose H.R. 1, the       misleadingly named ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.'' H.R. 1 would       double down on the same failed trickle down policies that       have hurt working families for decades. Once again, major       legislation is being drafted behind closed doors, out of the       view of the American people and without any input from       Democratic members of Congress.        It is unconscionable that elected representatives would       mark-up and jam through a bill that significantly affects the       financial security of their constituents without appropriate       time for non-partisan analysis and for all Americans to       properly understand the real impacts on their everyday lives.       There is no need to rush legislation of this magnitude       through Congress due to artificial political timelines.       Instead, there should be an open process by which all       stakeholders including working people and not just corporate       lobbyists are able to provide input.        Although this bill pretends to benefit the middle class,       the tax cuts proposed under this bill would go overwhelmingly       to high-income households and large corporations. And this       bill would actually raise taxes for some low- and moderate-      income households, while making it harder for states to fund       healthcare, education, infrastructure and other investments.       History has shown us that these types of tax breaks never       `trickle down' to working people and will result in cuts to       healthcare, education and other programs our communities       depend on. If passed, this legislation would give       millionaires and corporations a reason to celebrate but would       hurt working Americans who are trying put food on the table,       start their first businesses, send their children to college,       or save for their retirement and buy homes.        For these reasons, SEIU urges you to oppose H.R. 1 and       instead, work in a bi-partisan  [[Page H9401]]       and transparent manner on policies that will improve the       lives of working families. If you have any questions, please       contact John Foti.            Sincerely,                                                         John Gray,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you       to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1). H.R. 1 is not a       ``jobs bill,'' it is a job killer that gives huge tax breaks       to companies that outsource jobs. It is also the poster child       for the failed ``trickle-down'' economic theory that has       never worked and has repeatedly stuck working people with the       tab for tax giveaways for millionaires, big corporations, and       Wall Street.        The Republican leadership wants to pay for these giveaways       with drastic cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, education, and other       programs that working people depend on. The price tag of H.R.       1 is $1.5 trillion over 10 years, while the budget resolution       includes $5 trillion in budget cuts, including $1.5 trillion       from Medicaid and
