 Mr. President, I oppose the confirmation of California  Attorney General Becerra to be the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.   Our future HHS Secretary will be at the helm of rebuilding our  country toward normalcy and preparing to address the weaknesses in our  healthcare infrastructure, brought to light by the pandemic. It will be  no small task, and its handling will have an impact on America for  years to come. It will require a leader at HHS who has the trust of the  public and the requisite healthcare experience. Unfortunately, those  two factors are missing from the nomination of Attorney General  Becerra.   In recovering from a once-in-a-century public health emergency,  Americans need to have the confidence that our HHS Secretary  understands the intricacies of healthcare policy and has an eye to the  future as we improve upon our prepandemic vulnerabilities, protecting  future generations from experiencing similar pandemic situations.   While Attorney General Becerra served on a healthcare-focused  subcommittee as a U.S. Representative, he has no further experience in  public health or medicine. He also lacks the executive experience that  would be useful in running a complex executive branch Department like  HHS, which is involved in the nationwide vaccine rollout and now the  regulatory implementation of the recent $1.9 trillion package.   The American people need to trust that their HHS Secretary will work  for them, regardless of disagreements over ideology. Like a President,  Cabinet officials work for the entire country, and broad public trust  is essential. As Mr. Becerra was serving in his current role in  California as attorney general, the Trump administration was making  significant regulatory changes to protect the sanctity of life.  Attorney General Becerra then spent much of his time attempting to  overturn or ignore those changes.   Most recently, Attorney General Becerra actively defended a  California law requiring abortion coverage in insurance plans offered  by churches. The Office of Civil Rights at HHS ruled on January 24,  2020, that the State's abortion mandate violated Federal law, but  Attorney General Becerra refused to comply.   Ideological or moral disagreements should not be met with legal  challenges. Americans need to know that  [[Page S1586]]  their government is working to find a common ground that will protect  all strongly held personal and religious beliefs, including the belief  in the sanctity of life.   Thoughtful healthcare policy matters to Kansans and Americans now  more than ever. We need a leader at HHS who is eager to serve all of  the country, even in the face of disagreements--one who has the  necessary healthcare expertise to be successful in this position and  will be an asset to our country in this time of rebuilding.   I oppose this confirmation and urge my colleagues to join me.    Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee is  considering a grave threat to the right of conscience. The House  recently passed the Equality Act, which would demolish religious  liberty protections, ironically making Americans of certain beliefs  decidedly unequal under the law. In other words, for something called  religious protections, the Equality Act would diminish the capability  to be considered equal under the law.   It is not an accident of careless drafting that permits this outcome.  The language is both so expansive and so explicit that it must be  intentional and it must be intentionally hostile to people who hold  such beliefs.   The language expands the definition of public accommodations to  include prohibiting discrimination by ``any establishment that provides  a good, service, or program, including a . . . food bank, service or  care center, [or] shelter,'' and any organization receiving Federal  funding. Religiously affiliated entities seeking to put their beliefs  into action outside their church, mosque, or synagogue must comply.   The authors know such an expansive definition infringes on the  constitutional rights of religious liberty. That is because this  legislation would explicitly--explicitly--deny recourse to the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, a bill that was passed with  overwhelmingly bipartisan majorities in both Chambers of Congress  before being signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.   This denial cuts off two legal paths for people of conscience. One,  an individual or institution cannot sue the Federal Government to  prevent enforcement of this act without statutory--explicit statutory-- authority of RFRA. And, two, the individual institution that is sued  for discrimination under this bill cannot rely on RFRA as a defense   It is not an exaggeration to say that the five lines related to RFRA  in this bill represent one of the most dramatic assaults against  religious faith and conscience that I have seen in my time in Congress.  The effects will be damaging to communities in Kansas and across the  country.   If passed, people of faith must decide whether to adhere to their  deeply held beliefs or to the law. This law effectively says it is  better to have fewer doctors in rural Kansas, which desperately needs  them, than it is to have doctors of moral conviction; that it is better  to shutter social services administered by faith-based groups that fill  gaps in our safety net than to allow them to remain true to their  mission; or that it is better to force the closure of religious schools  in urban areas, which so often provide a path out of poverty, than to  allow them to remain open and teach principles of faith.   In response to the Obama contraception mandate a decade ago, I  warned: ``If the government can compel an individual or group to  violate one's conscience, then there is no limit to government power.''  That remains true now, nearly 10 years later, and remains true into the  future.   I will oppose the use of such government power to infringe on matters  of religious belief and conscience, and I stand in opposition to the  Equality Act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on Monday, March 15, the community  of Ashland, KS, celebrated the career of someone who dedicated nearly  45 years to the Stockgrowers State Bank. Walter Frank York has called  Ashland home since the day he was born. His parents, Russell and  Marjorie, brought him up in a modest home on a farmer's income during  the 1950s and 1960s. Frank, as he came to be called by his family and  friends, went on to study finance at Kansas State University, but the  Vietnam war draft up-ended his plans before graduation.   Frank ultimately did not serve due to a back injury incurred while  playing football for Ashland High, but the draft experience took him to  Eagle County, CO, where he used his education to assist his sister with  a new business that she was operating in Vail Village near the well- known ski resort. While taking on this challenge in Colorado, he  finished his degree at CU Boulder, despite his long-lasting love for  the K-State Wildcats. After earning his degree, his route led back home  when he applied for a vacant position at a bank in Ashland. His first  day at Stockgrowers State Bank was March 15, 1976.   Working as a loans officer, Frank added a sense of small-town care  for each of his customers over the years. After all, he would  frequently see his customers at church, at the grocery store, and at  Friday night sporting events in Ashland and surrounding communities in  southwest Kansas. In 2007, he earned the title of executive vice  president after years of loyally helping customers. One recent  highlight from his career was being awarded as a recipient of the  Pioneer Award in early 2020, which is given annually by the Kansas Ag  Bankers division of the Kansas Bankers Association. When he achieved  the award, one customer of his remarked to the Kansas Ag Bankers:  ``Frank just makes it simple to do business and helps keep me connected  to the Ashland community.'' In return, Frank likes to share that his  clients and colleagues became ``family'' to him. Being surrounded by  good people in an enjoyable community helped keep Frank at Stockgrowers  for the entirety of his banking career.   I would be remiss if I did not speak of community involvement while  sharing about Frank York. Whether it was being involved in his  children's Boy Scouts troop, coaching local youth baseball programs in  the summer, announcing football games for Ashland High, broadcasting  SPIAA League high school basketball tournaments, or serving on the  board of organizations near and far in Kansas, Frank has done it all.  He currently serves on the board for KJIL Great Plains Christian Radio,  in addition to the Kansas Leadership Center's board, and serves as  president of the alumni board for his K-State chapter of Delta Upsilon  fraternity.   I have had the joy of getting to know Frank on a more personal level  in this past decade, as his son Tyler joined my staff after earning his  degree at K-State. Frank lives in the same farmhouse that his  grandfather built in 1912, just a few miles outside of Ashland. Farming  and ranching has been a side passion and a hobby for him since he  returned home for a career at Stockgrowers. It is something that he  intends to continue for years ahead, thanks to the local volunteer  firefighters that spared the York farmstead from destruction in March  2017 as wildfires burned close to 80 percent of Clark County. He  considers himself blessed to have been of the more fortunate residents  of the area. While I have appreciated his friendship over the years,  Frank was an invaluable resource to me in the aftermath of the Starbuck  Fire. Along with many others from Clark County, he informed me on ways  we could help direct the USDA and other governmental agencies to  coordinate in providing assistance to those that were severely  affected.   The announcement of retirement from Frank came in mid-2020. His  emotional final day at Stockgrowers State Bank was on December 31,  2020. Due to the challenges that the pandemic brought to communities of  all sizes, a celebration of his retirement, unfortunately, had to be  postponed. However, I couldn't think of a better date to celebrate the  career of Frank York than the 45th anniversary of his first day of  employment at Stockgrowers State Bank. While the difficulties of the  pandemic will still prevent many well-wishers from making it to Ashland  to personally offer their congratulations, I know that the amount of  lives that have been positively affected by Frank are plenty and  stretch far beyond Ashland. His family--including wife, Sue, and  children Joshua, Tyler, Emily, Adam, and Jennifer--should all be  extremely proud of Frank's career. I offer my sincere congratulations  to someone I am proud to call my friend, Frank York.                            ____________________
