 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an op-ed that I wrote  in January called ``A one-stop-shop for private space exploration.''                              [Jan. 22, 2018]               A One-Stop-Shop for Private Space Exploration                         (By U.S. Rep. Brian Babin)         In the inaugural meeting of the reconstituted National       Space Council, Vice President Mike Pence called for an       overhaul of how the U.S. regulates commercial space       activities. The potential of a robust economy in space will       ``unlock new opportunities, new technologies, and new sources       of prosperity,'' Pence said.        The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act (H.R.       2809), recently passed by  [[Page H3486]]       the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee,       accomplishes the vice president's goals. This bill places       authority over private sector space activities in the agency       best equipped to foster economic growth, the Commerce       Department. The bipartisan legislation streamlines regulatory       processes, limits government intrusion, promotes American       innovation and investment, protects national security and       satisfies our Outer Space Treaty obligations.        As chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology       Committee's space subcommittee, and as a member of the       Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I have the       unique perspective of overseeing both of these agencies.       Because of this perspective, I believe placing this       responsibility at the Commerce Department is a good long-term       decision for the United States and the space industry.        The Obama administration proposed giving the Federal       Aviation Administration (FAA), housed within the Department       of Transportation (DOT), responsibility for managing a broad       interagency review of all private sector space activity       proposals through an opaque process without defined approval       timelines, regardless of how benign those activities may be.       My committee held numerous hearings on this idea to hear       directly from experts and stakeholders. We found that FAA       accomplishes its current mission--managing launches and re-      entry--very well. However, the agency is challenged to meet       its existing obligations to regulate launch and reentry, and       should not be burdened with the additional responsibility of       authorizing and supervising private activities in space.        Moreover, current law actually prohibits DOT from       regulating activities in space. It only has the ability to       deny a launch if no other agency has licensed the activity.       Congress did not intend or design this authority to create       regulatory authority for on-orbit activities, or       authorization or supervision process for Outer Space Treaty       compliance.        In contrast, the Commerce Department's mission is to       ``create the conditions for economic growth and       opportunity,'' and that mission runs deep through the       culture. As the space economy develops, in-space activities       will focus more on commerce, less on transportation       logistics. Mining, habitation modules, and satellite       servicing are only a few of the novel ideas that American       innovators are proposing. These activities are not related to       transportation, and DOT has no experience in this field. The       Commerce Department, however, is familiar with the issues       that future stakeholders will need to consider, including       international trade and technology.        The bill also streamlines the federal space bureaucracy       within the Commerce Department itself. It merges the National       Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)       responsibilities over space-based remote sensing into the       already-existing Office of Space Commerce within the Commerce       Department. NOAA is itself housed within the Commerce       Department, so having two separate offices handling the same       responsibilities makes no sense.        Reforming this splintered regulatory process minimizes the       burden on other agencies and makes the Commerce Department a       one-stop shop for Outer Space Treaty compliance. Giving DOT       authority, as proposed by the previous administration, would       split the regulatory system, requiring remote-sensing       satellite operators to seek regulatory approval for their       operations from both DOT and the Commerce Department.        Indeed, placing this authority at the Commerce Department       is a continuation of long-standing law and national policy.       Since 1984, Commerce has been the only federal agency with       the legal authority to authorize and supervise space       activities. While the Federal Communications Commission       regulates spectrum and DOT regulates launch and re-entry,       neither has the authority to authorize and supervise space       activities generally to assure compliance with the Outer       Space Treaty.        Some stakeholders have questioned whether the Office of       Space Commerce can handle remote-sensing licensing and       supervising general space activities. The answer is yes. The       Commerce Department already has expertise authorizing and       supervising remote-sensing systems, and the bill's       streamlined review process is more transparent, quicker, and       less burdensome on staff. Importantly, Commerce also has       expertise in balancing national security with commercial       interests, working with American industry internationally and       in regulating space dual-use technologies through the Export       Administration Regulations.        The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act declares       that America is open for business in outer space. The only       agency with the long-standing experience and culture to       regulate and foster the budding space economy is the Commerce       Department.        With this innovative legislation, which builds on that       culture of transparency and clarity, we position the American       space industry as a leader in growing a robust and lawful       economy in space.     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2809, the  American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act.   The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act is a commonsense  bipartisan bill that streamlines the regulatory processes, limits  burdensome government intrusion, promotes American innovation and  investment, protects national security, and satisfies our international  obligations.   One of the fundamental drivers for this legislation has been that  innovative American companies are pushing the boundaries. And when the  Senate ratified the Outer Space Treaty 50 years ago, free enterprise in  outer space was an idea but was not reality.   Today, not only does U.S. free enterprise exist in outer space, but  it is innovating at an unprecedented pace. From astroid mining to  private Moon missions, to satellite servicing, to remote sensing  constellations, there is great promise that American enterprise will  soon unlock new wealth and scientific benefits.   But this promise is threatened; threatened by expansive, unchecked  regulatory authority, cumbersome non-transparent regulatory processes,  and misperceptions about the United States' Outer Space Treaty  obligations.   For several years, we have heard concerns from stakeholders that they  need greater regulatory certainty to attract investment and to succeed.  Stakeholders also reported that while they want to stay in America, due  to regulatory burdens and uncertainty, they might need to go overseas.   The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act addresses these  concerns without compromising our cherished principles of liberty and  freedom.   It provides for presumptions of approval and requires the government  to take affirmative steps before conditioning or denying proposed space  or remote sensing operations.   It places the burden of demonstrating inconsistency with Outer Space  Treaty obligations and national security requirements of the United  States with the government and not the applicant.   It curtails vague, overreaching regulatory authority and prevents  tolling of statutory adjudication timelines. It ensures U.S. industry  receives a timely and transparent determination on applications.   The bill recognizes legitimate national security equities and  provides for the condition or denial of authorized space activities  with remote sensing systems that are a significant threat to U.S.  national security in certain circumstances. But it protects against  abuses of interagency discretion by requiring an explanation and  evidence of the threat before conditions or denial can be made.   In order to ensure the Office of Space Commerce is empowered to  represent the interests of our citizens and the private sector, the  director of the office is elevated to be the new assistant secretary  for Space Commerce.   The act also advances important public policy interests. The bill  establishes a mandatory safety consultation between private and Federal  Government operators. The goal of this consultation is for the affected  parties to reach a voluntary agreement to mitigate safety risks.   For parties subject to U.S. jurisdiction, the act provides for  Federal district court jurisdiction for any civil action resulting from  certified or permitted space operations.   To protect against foreign harmful interference, the act directs the  President to protect against acts of foreign aggression and foreign  harmful interference.   The act also addresses concerns of harmful contamination of the Earth  or celestial bodies. Pursuant to our international obligations under  the Outer Space Treaty, operations may be conditioned or denied by the  Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with appropriate agencies such  as NASA to address harmful contamination.   The bill posits longstanding U.S. policy, confirmed by both  Department of State and NASA, that COSPAR planetary protection  guidelines are not international obligations of the United States. This  was done to allow all stakeholders, including the scientific community  and industry, to work together as activities expand beyond scientific  exploration and to address mutual interests, not by proscribing COSPAR  guidelines as binding international law, but by allowing the Outer  Space Treaty to guide our activities.   I am grateful to have worked with Chairman Smith and Representative  [[Page H3487]]  Bridenstine, recently confirmed as NASA administrator, in the  development of this bill.   I am also very glad that this is a bipartisan bill, with the support  of Representatives Perlmutter and Kilmer and Bera.   I strongly support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.   Again, my op-ed is a very, very telltale reason and shows exactly why  this is a great bill to put this under the Department of Commerce and  take it out from under the Department of Transportation. For many  reasons, I hope that this would be a source of debate and where we will  get the reasons for what we are doing with this.
