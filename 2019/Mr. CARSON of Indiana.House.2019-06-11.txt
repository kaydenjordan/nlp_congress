 Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that Americans pay  too much for their prescription drugs, and something must be done.   That is why I am pleased House Democrats are addressing the rising  costs of these medications. We have passed legislation like H.R. 987  and H.R. 1503, both of which can lower the cost of prescription drugs  by helping to bring a greater number of generic drugs to market, but we  can't stop there.   We must act boldly and in a bipartisan manner, Mr. Speaker, to  confront the obstacles that stand between hardworking Americans and  affordable prescriptions necessary for their well-being. In the  wealthiest nation in the world, Mr. Speaker, no one should have to face  these barriers to affordable, quality healthcare.                            ____________________
