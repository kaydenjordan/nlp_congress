 Mr. Speaker, as a result of failing  policies by Biden and the Democrat-led Congress, American families  continue to feel the impact of 40-year-high inflation in their  pocketbooks. Last year, the cost of everyday products and services rose  exponentially, destroying jobs.   Since Biden took office, there has been a $10 trillion increase in  spending above projections, $2.5 million increase on interest payments  on growing Federal debt, $1.9 trillion on the American Rescue Plan,  $745 billion on the inflation expansion act, $3.4 trillion on the  infrastructure investment act, and $1 trillion in Biden executive  actions.   This irresponsible spending has hurt all Americans, and we must  address it. The newly elected House Republican majority, ably led by  Speaker Kevin McCarthy, is committed to creating jobs and a government  that is accountable to the people. We must reestablish fiscal sanity.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.    Just yesterday, another terrorist was caught crossing the southern  border.                            ____________________
