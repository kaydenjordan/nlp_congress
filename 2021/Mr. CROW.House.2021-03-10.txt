 Mr. Speaker, I grew up a gun owner. I have been hunting  since I was 12 years old. I became an Army Ranger and went to war for  this country, where I led over 100 combat missions, carrying weapons of  war at war in defense of our Nation.   But I am also a father, and I also represent a district that has been  hit by some of the worst mass shootings in our Nation's history. I  learned in the Army years ago that citizenship comes with duties and  rights come with responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, we are failing each other in this country. It is time  that we start fulfilling our duties and our responsibilities to each  other. We have the opportunity to do that now and to save thousands of  lives.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues to join with me and to pass the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act.                            ____________________
