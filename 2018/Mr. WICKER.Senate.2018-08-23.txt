 Mr. President, I agree with my Seapower Subcommittee  colleague, and his approach is consistent with the fiscal year 2019  NDAA, which the Senate approved in a vote of 87-10. The President has  signed the bill into law. I join with my colleague in asking for the  two-ship carrier buy to be supported, as we did in the NDAA, subject to  the requisite requirements that includes a Secretary of Defense  certification based on significant savings and other supporting  information.
