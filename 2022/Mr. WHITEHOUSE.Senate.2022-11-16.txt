 Madam President, I rise today for my 286th ``Time to  Wake Up'' speech, in this case to report back from the United Nations'  27th Conference of the Parties, or COP, the annual meeting where the  nations of the world work to combat climate change. The Paris  Agreement, for instance, sprang from the COP. Senators Cardin, Markey,  and I went to this year's COP in Egypt. Speaker Pelosi led a separate  House delegation, and President Biden traveled there with a large  executive branch delegation to make some important announcements.   Our Senate delegation met with government officials from many other  countries, with American officials, with UN leaders, and with dozens of  business leaders, labor leaders, environmental groups, environmental  justice advocates, and oceans advocates.   We consistently heard that the work we accomplished right here in  this Chamber through the Inflation Reduction Act and by ratifying the  Kigali Amendment brought our country back into global leadership on  climate. But we know that our work to tackle climate change is not  over--not by a long shot.   Emissions from fossil fuel are still growing. 2022 fossil fuel  emissions will blow right past previous record highs. Things are not  getting better yet; they are getting worse. We need additional  ambitious climate policies, both at home and abroad, to reduce those  emissions.   And because climate disasters so often fall upon the most vulnerable,  particularly in developing nations, we need the wealthier nations and  the ultrawealthy corporations responsible for the lion's share of  climate upheaval to step up to finance the clean energy transition for  those countries.   So, what are the things the United States and other nations should  do? At the COP, I spoke a lot about the upcoming European Union carbon  border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM. The EU already applies a carbon  price to energy-intensive manufactured goods. That is one of the main  policies that is driving decarbonization in Europe, and they will  start, later this decade, imposing a carbon tariff on goods from  countries that don't impose a comparable carbon price on those imported  goods.   My message to the COP: The EU CBAM is good policy. It creates an  incentive for lower carbon manufacturing, no matter where the goods are  produced. The United States should not--I repeat--the United States  should not complain about the EU CBAM. Our manufacturers are among the  least carbon intensive in the world, and they will pay far lower carbon  tariffs than, for instance, Chinese manufacturers. That makes American  companies more globally competitive and will move jobs and  manufacturing our way to our shores.   So instead of complaining, we should match the EU CBAM or beat it  with our own carbon border adjustment plan. And, by the way, we should  urge the British and the Canadians and the Japanese and the  Australians, anyone else interested in lowering emissions, to do the  same. We should all pull together.   The beauty of a well-designed carbon border adjustment is that it  prevents cheating by polluters to cross borders and pollute elsewhere  for free.   A carbon border adjustment regime will drive decarbonization  everywhere--in China, India, and around the world. If their  manufacturers want to compete, they will have to reduce their  emissions. So, yes, let's meet or beat the EU CBAM, not fear it or  resist it.   By the way, when we heard quibbles about our IRA incentives for clean  energy and electric vehicles and low carbon manufacturing being unfair  to our foreign trading partners, my response was the same: Meet us or  beat us. Pass incentives as good as ours or better. Let our IRA be an  example that can be replicated around the world. As I mentioned  earlier, President Biden came to the COP with ambitious proposals. He  unveiled a new EPA proposal to reduce methane emissions from oil and  gas production and transport by almost 90 percent.   This is--as President Biden might say--a ``BFD'' as methane emissions  are responsible for about 25 percent of observed warming. The EPA  proposal is a huge step in the right direction. It would create a new  process for third-party monitoring of methane emissions. There are  already a number of private and public entities that monitor methane  emissions around the world using satellites, aircraft, drones. Utilize  this data to quickly identify and eliminate large sources of methane  emissions.   We should stand up an enforcement task force to make sure leakers  promptly face the best enforcement methods to stop their leaks.  Combined with my methane fee, which was adopted into the IRA as the  Methane Emission Reduction Program, we now have the platform for the  EPA, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and  interested State, local, and tribal authorities to, as they would say  in the military, find, fix, and finish methane leak sources.   Given that methane emissions are a global problem, particularly in  fossil fuel-producing countries like Russia, I also urged the U.S. and  foreign officials with whom we met to stand up an international task  force to identify overseas methane emissions and sanction parties,  companies, and countries that don't eliminate them.   Buried within EPA's methane proposal is another important  announcement, an updated social cost of carbon, pegged at $120 per ton,  more than double the Obama-era estimate. This too is a ``BFD.'' But  only if the Office of Management and Budget follows up and spreads its  use beyond just the EPA and this regulation into rulemaking,  procurement, grantmaking, investment decisions, leasing, trade policy,  just to name a few. It would be transformative; and given the scale and  scope of the Federal Government, it would have the power to move  markets.   One note of warning, our success in the United States, as well as in  countries around the world, will, in significant ways, be determined by  the behavior of big corporations.   Corporate America has built the biggest political influence operation  the world has ever seen. It surrounds this building, surrounds us here  in Congress. Lobbyists, dark money, trade associations, political  contributions, phony think tanks--it is an awesome apparatus, and it is  one that corporate America has yet to switch on for climate  legislation. They either sit out there doing nothing or they actually  oppose it.   Despite often admirable corporate work to decarbonize their own  operations and even their supply chains, much of the corporate  political apparatus is actually actively hostile to real climate  legislation. And on top of that, of course, is the fossil fuel  industry's inveterate, ceaseless obstruction machine.    So I was pleased to see the United Nations Secretary General announce  new criteria for assessing corporate climate pledges--criteria that  will include their lobbying and advocacy behavior. The report states:         [Companies] must align their external policy and engagement       efforts, including membership in trade associations, to the       goal of  [[Page S6733]]       reducing global emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and       reaching net zero by 2050. This means lobbying for positive       climate action and not lobbying against it. [Companies]       should publicly disclose their trade association       affiliations. They should encourage their associations to       advocate for positive climate action and have an escalation       strategy if they do not, including the option of leaving the       association if the necessary changes are not made.    I could not agree more. At COP, I repeatedly made the argument that  companies should actually be required to file audited climate political  footprint statements. Too many companies have been two-faced for too  long. That climate political footprint statement should be the ticket  that admits companies to COP and to other environmental gatherings.   But instead of corporate transparency about their political  activities, more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists swarmed this COP. Coca- Cola, the world's largest plastics polluter, was a leading sponsor.  That ``worst climate obstructor''--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--hosted  the big dinner and put on a speech by a fossil fuel services company  president. It is hard for people around the world to take COPs  seriously when the fossil fuel industry and other large polluters have  such a prominent presence at the COP and they haven't had to even  disclose their political efforts to undermine that very COP.   Instead of welcoming the big polluters to COPs, we should hold them  accountable for the damages their pollution is causing. A windfall  profits clawback on global excess fuel profits, just like the  conservative Tories did in the UK, could help fund remediation,  transition, and adaptation efforts in developing countries. It is a  commonsense principle that polluters should pay for the harm that they  cause.   At the end, I left this COP with a sense of pride that the Senate and  the U.S. Government are finally getting going on climate, but also a  sense of the awesome difficulty of the task ahead to bend that global  emissions curve, to hit nature's emissions reduction targets.   Our work is not close to done. In fact, it has only just begun. After  decades of delay, deliberately caused by the fossil fuel industry's  multibillion-dollar campaign of denial and obstruction, we are now in a  marathon that we will have to run as a sprint. But this past year  proved that we are finally up and running, and the announcements at COP  will pick up our laggard pace. Our joints may be stiff from disuse, our  breathing may be ragged from years of lassitude on the couch, but we  have at last begun to run. And, boy, does it feel good. We will only  speed up and do better. Powered by the energy and enthusiasm of legions  of young voters, we are, I dare to say, at last coming awake.   I will close with this last slide which shows how important it is to  see this as a global problem.   Those are emissions from China, from the United States, from India,  and from the EU. When you add them up, you see the global figure. If we  address each of these or just our own, it does not help enough to avoid  the consequences of that continuing upward emissions trajectory.   So that is where an internal social cost of carbon that cuts across  every aspect of government, buttressed by a carbon border adjustment of  the world's major economies--that is what can drive that line down and  put us on a pathway to safety.   I yield the floor.
