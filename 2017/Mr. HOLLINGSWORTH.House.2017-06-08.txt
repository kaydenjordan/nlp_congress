 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee for his hard work, and the entire Financial Services  Committee for all the effort they have undertaken in today's debate of  the Financial CHOICE Act.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to the Financial  CHOICE Act of 2017. This amendment would allow for certain closed-end  funds to be considered well-known seasoned issuers.   Ultimately, the proposed amendment is built upon the foundation of  lowering costs and increasing access for investors by allowing  companies that meet certain criteria to have the same equivalence as  bigger companies that also have access to capital markets by making  them available to those fast lanes that allow them to issue shares.   In 2005, the SEC put in place significant reforms that sought to  modernize registration, communication, and offering processes for  traditional operating companies. These reforms were designed to  streamline the registration process, especially those for large  reporting issuers or well-known seasoned issuers. Unfortunately, the  SEC excluded registered closed-end funds from those reforms.   A closed-end fund is nothing more than a pooled investment fund with  a fixed number of shares that is structured, listed, and traded just  like a stock on the stock exchange. Closed-end funds are crucial to  retirement  [[Page H4792]]  savings and investment vehicles that many retail investors use. About 3  million mom-and-pop investors rely on closed-end funds to meet their  investment needs. These funds serve as a long-term source of capital,  which, in turn, promotes job creation--something we can all agree needs  to happen more in this country.   Closed-end funds, though, are currently under attack by unfair  onerous filing and offering regulations. This commonsense amendment  would provide parity for these certain closed-end funds by streamlining  their registration process, offering and communications processes that  are currently available to other publicly traded companies. This unfair  exclusion of closed-end funds has created an unlevel playing field.   Giving qualifying closed-end funds the ability to enjoy well-known  seasoned issuer status would help those funds better evaluate and  assess the market for their offerings and would enable them to more  quickly access capital markets. Those closed-end funds, an important  vehicle for retail investors, would allow them to get capital to more  job creators.   There has been a steady decline in the number of closed-end funds and  the number of new closed-end funds offerings because of this unlevel  playing field. Since 2007, the number of closed-end funds has dropped  by 20 percent.                                time  1500    In 2007, there were 42 new closed-end fund issuances; in 2016, there  were only 8. That is an 81 percent decline.   What we can all agree on is that Americans need access to capital.  They need access to the capital markets that will provide them the  capital to thrive as they have created new products. Retail investors  also need access to those investments in order to meet their particular  needs.   These closed-end funds should not have been hamstrung in their  ability to access the advantages afforded to operating companies. It is  time we provide parity in this marketplace by leveling the playing  field.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  left?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the subcommittee chair.    Mr. Chair, I would just build on that to say that  every WKSI goes through the SEC review and comment period.   What we are doing here is removing the duplicative SEC review and  comment period, which only serves to delay capital getting out to  businesses, which only serves to add cost to retail investors that use  these pools.   So I support the amendment, and I support the Financial CHOICE Act of  2017.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
