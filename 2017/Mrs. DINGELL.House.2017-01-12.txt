 Mr. Speaker, last weekend, I held a roundtable  discussion in my district with healthcare providers, hospitals,  doctors, nurses, clinics, labor leaders, and working families  [[Page H455]]  to talk about what the Affordable Care Act means to them. All of them  are opposed and concerned for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   We talked about how important it was to protect the 695,000  Michiganders who have gained coverage since the ACA was enacted and the  fact that the uninsured rate in Michigan has been cut in half.   The story that struck me the most was from a local clergyman, Bishop  Walter Starghill, who gained coverage for the first time through  Medicaid expansion. He told me:         The impact on Black men with increased access to insurance       coverage is big. We didn't take care of ourselves until it       was too late. We ended up in the emergency room and some of       us died. Now we can get checked out early.    I heard from another local UAW worker who said:         I come from a family where many members have struggled with       cancer. We wouldn't have healthcare coverage after leaving       our jobs or we'd have gone bankrupt without the ACA.    Everywhere I go in the district, people are frightened and come up  and say: What will happen?   Tomorrow, you need to look people in the eye and tell them why you  are taking their insurance away.                            ____________________
