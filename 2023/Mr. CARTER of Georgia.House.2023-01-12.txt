 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 22 because there is nothing  strategic about an empty Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   What is worse than not having a strategic reserve is selling it off  to adversaries so they can build their own?    That is exactly what has been happened over the past 2 years. While  our SPR has been depleted in an attempt to cover up the failed energy  policies of this administration, China is taking advantage by building  up their own reserves.   The worst part is that their build-up has come from the U.S.  reserves. Let me repeat this. President Biden has sold our valuable  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China while Americans face the highest  energy prices in a generation and a Federal Government that has failed  to adequately address it by unleashing our own energy potential. And  every barrel sold to China makes that decision even more damaging.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 22 to prevent the  administration from selling any SPR products to the CCP or related  entities.   Stop the attacks on American energy, unleash it, and make us energy  independent.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and  celebrate the life of C. Lee Butler of Savannah, Georgia.   Lee was born in Chicago in 1926 and graduated from New Trier High  School in Winnetka, Illinois, in 1944.   Five days after his 18th birthday, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and  served on the Italian front in World War II. While in law school at  Northwestern University, Lee met and married Betty Stanley. Lee and  Betty have four children, Darsey, Julia, Malcolm, and Margaret.   In 1970, Lee founded his own business, the Fiduciary Services  Corporation, now the Fiduciary Group, a successful investment  management firm. Lee served at Memorial Medical Center and on the board  of St. Joseph's Hospital of Savannah.   He was a member of Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church since  first coming to Savannah in 1957.   On behalf of myself and the entire First District of Georgia, we are  sorry for the loss of this great American.                            ____________________
