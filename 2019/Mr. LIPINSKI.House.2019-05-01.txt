 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be cosponsoring H.R. 9,  which we will be voting on this week.   H.R. 9 reaffirms the United States' commitment to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions. It is long past time that we do more to fight climate  change.   Fighting climate change has been a priority of mine since I got to  Congress more than a decade ago. In 2007, in an era of divided  government, we were able to make some progress. I was able to get two  bills passed into law that address climate change. One required the  Federal Government to cut energy usage by installing energy-efficient  light bulbs in Federal buildings. The other created a new prize  competition to encourage development of clean transportation fuel. It  seemed that we were starting to take climate change seriously.   In 2009 and 2010, more steps were taken. In order to make a major  breakthrough, in 2009, I helped introduce the first bipartisan bill to  impose a revenue-neutral carbon fee. However, in 2010, Congress failed  to pass major climate legislation, and since then, we have failed to  make more progress.   Today, I have renewed hope. H.R. 9 is a good first step, but much  more needs to be done. I am an original cosponsor of the bipartisan  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which would institute a  carbon fee with the revenue returned to Americans with a dividend  check. This bill would bring greenhouse gas emissions down 90 percent  by 2050.   I have sponsored several other climate change bills, including the  Challenges & Prizes for Climate Act, which would incentivize and reward  development of innovative solutions with direct benefits to the  climate. These are all ways to harness American ingenuity to solve our  climate crisis.                                time  1030    In doing so, by coming up with an American solution, we could build  our economy and create more jobs. We know, as Americans, that we can  get this done, and we must do it. Now is the time for us to act.                            ____________________
