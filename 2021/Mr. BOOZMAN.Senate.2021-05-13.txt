 Mr. President, I rise to honor the inaugural  graduates of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine, ARCOM, as  they prepare to receive their hoods and diplomas on Saturday, May 15,  2021.   After 4 years, this class of 145 doctors will move on to residencies  throughout the region and the Nation, but first, they will celebrate  their unique role as leaders and standard-setters within what has  already become a vitally important and game-changing institution in  western Arkansas.   ARCOM welcomed its first class of medical students in 2017. Four  years later, the school celebrated its first Match Day with 95 percent  of students placed into residency programs. Of those moving onto  residences, 7 percent will work in primary care and almost two-thirds  received placements in Arkansas and surrounding States. Studies show us  that a majority of doctors stay and practice in the region they are  educated, so I was also pleased to see that more than 50 percent of  ARCOM's first class of graduates matched in States that are considered  in the bottom 10 percent for access to medical care. This is where they  are needed and speaks to the mission and importance of ARCOM, not only  to Arkansas but our entire region.   As part of the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education, ACHE, ARCOM is  transforming healthcare education and helping prepare future doctors to  practice in medically underserved regions. It is inspiring to think  about the efforts it took to make this day possible. The need for more  medical professionals in Arkansas is great, and the work put in by the  students community leaders, generous donors, and true visionaries who  saw the need should be applauded today.   In addition to this inaugural class of osteopathic physicians, ACHE  is celebrating its second commencement for graduates receiving a master  of science in biomedicine. The campus is now also home to the School of  Physical Therapy, with its first class starting instruction in June  2021, and the School of Occupational Therapy, which expects to welcome  students in January 2022.   I am grateful for the incredible work being done by administration,  faculty, staff, and students. The campus is a cornerstone for new  medical facilities, housing, and opportunities in western Arkansas and  continues to draw new resources to the area. Its impact has been  significant and stands to grow well into the future.   I am also proud of these graduates. They have prepared for their  medical careers during a challenging time, with full understanding of  the importance of their charge and the task ahead. As they embark on  their careers, I know they have seen and experienced more than they  expected. They have chosen this path for a reason, and our State and  Nation are stronger because of their commitment to serving others.   Congratulations to the 2021 class of ARCOM and to everyone who made  this dream possible for them and for Arkansas.                            ____________________
