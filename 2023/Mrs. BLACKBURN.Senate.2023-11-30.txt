 Mr. President, the United States has a long history  of standing for freedom and self-determination.   From the 1940s through the 2010s, under President Trump, our Nation  has stood with Israel, in defense of Israel. We were there in 1948 when  Israel became a country. We stood with them through the Six-Day War and  the Yom Kippur War, the Camp David peace talks, negotiations with the  PLO, two intifadas, and multiple attempts to implement a two-state  solution.   Under President Reagan, we fought the spread of communism across  multiple continents because we understand that the unchecked spread of  Marxist influence will threaten our very survival. This wasn't just  ideological saber rattling. The Soviets had a staggering number of  nuclear warheads at their disposal. It was important to eliminate as  many of those as we could. Reagan was remarkably clear-eyed about this.   Again, it wasn't a question of politics. It was a matter of  recognizing the danger and then finding a way to neutralize that  danger. We accepted that it was our duty to protect global security  because no one else had the power or the resolve to do that.   And since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the United States has been  a leading provider of aid to the Ukrainians because Vladimir Putin has  the same propensity toward violence and conquest that motivated his  predecessors.   This is also why we have fought so hard to provide our partners in  Taiwan with the weapons and funding they need to defend themselves  against communist Chinese aggression.   Over the past 3 years, our reputation--our Nation's reputation--as a  champion of freedom has become tarnished by Joe Biden's foreign policy  and his policy of appeasement. Nothing has been more damaging than his  refusal to protect our sovereignty here at home. A strong border is the  most basic element of our national defense. It is what guarantees our  right to exist as a country, and Joe Biden has abandoned it entirely.   When he took office and declared law and order obsolete, he didn't  just invite millions of migrants across our border; he invited the new  axis of evil--Russia, China, Iran, North Korea--to declare open season  on their neighbors. China became more aggressive toward Taiwan. Putin  invaded Ukraine. And Hamas violated a ceasefire and slaughtered  Israelis in their beds.   The Biden administration's response has only made things worse. They  exploited the plight of the Ukrainians as  [[Page S5688]]  a distraction from their own terrible policies. They have all but  ignored China's human rights violations. And, to date, they put more  pressure on Israel than on Hamas to lay down arms.   Joe Biden's attempts to curry favor with the new axis of evil won't  keep us safe because these nations aren't here to make friends. Their  goal--the goal of that axis of evil--is to exploit our weaknesses until  it becomes impossible for us to fight back.   This is a battle over borders, and, if we want to win, we need to  lead by example and reassert our right to exist as a sovereign nation.  We should start by securing our very own border.   In fiscal year 2023, the Border Patrol recorded more than 3.2 million  enforcement actions along our southern border. In addition, we caught  151 known and suspected terrorists trying to illegally enter our  country.   The Senate will have an opportunity to address this before the year  ends, but I fear my Democratic colleagues will block those efforts or,  worse, offer a half-baked solution and call it a job well done.   The majority leader insists that the issue of border security is just  too partisan, and the majority whip insists that since we let the issue  of border security go unattended for 30-plus years, we can afford to  let it go just a little bit longer.    This is absolutely nonsense. I think it is also dangerous. If Joe  Biden refuses to defend the sovereignty of his own country, our  adversaries will assume they can act as aggressively as they want  without any meaningful resistance from the United States.   If we refuse to defend ourselves, how can we be effective in  defending Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East?   Israel's sovereignty has been established across thousands of years  of history, and still Hamas denies Israel's right to exist. That is how  they justified violating the ceasefire and declaring war on the world's  Jewish community, and it is frightening to see so many people in this  country defending that decision. Every one of those individuals should  watch the videos that we have watched from the GoPro cameras of those  Hamas terrorists. It is revolting.   No peace plan is possible until Hamas is eliminated and the  Palestinians recognize Israel's right to exist. To make this happen, we  need to set an example by securing our own borders and then passing a  stand-alone and straightforward aid package to help Israel do the same.   We all know that giving humanitarian aid to Gaza at this point means  letting it go to terrorists. I would ask the majority leader and my  Democratic colleagues to give Israel this funding without attaching  dangerous conditions that will force them to undermine their own  security.   Ensuring a free and sovereign Ukraine is also an important element of  our foreign policy, but how can we speak with any real authority about  Ukrainian self-determination while holding ourselves to a lower  standard?   When Putin attacked, the United States backed Ukraine with our words  and our actions because we knew that if we didn't, millions of people  would pay the price for our appeasement. We have a historic obligation  to Ukraine, and continuing to send aid will serve as a powerful  deterrent.   The American people understand how important it is to maintain that  pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin, but they don't think they should  have to sacrifice their own security to do it. They also are very  concerned about the total lack of transparency surrounding these aid  packages.   Here is a stat. Since February of 2022, the United States has  approved $113 billion in total aid responding to Putin's war. This  includes defense items sent via the Presidential drawdown authority,  with no oversight. It is imperative that we have oversight and  transparency around every single dollar that is going into Ukraine.   The reason? Right now Americans can't afford to spend even one more  cent on gas or groceries, thanks to Joe Biden's Bidenomics. So they  need to see that their money is actually going to be accounted for and  that it is actually going to make a difference. We owe them a full  accounting of how their money is being spent in Ukraine, how long we  will maintain the flow of aid, and when they can expect to see us match  those efforts here at home with our own border security plan. They also  want to know: What is the strategy, and how are we going to make  certain that Vladimir Putin does not win?   Joe Biden's actions speak much louder than his words. For 3 years  now, he has projected nothing but weakness. He has sent a parade of  diplomats to legitimize relations with the Chinese Communist Party. He  has enabled Iran and its terrorist proxies--Hamas, Hezbollah, the  Houthis, ISIS Iraq, ISIS in Syria--and he has sent billions upon  billions of dollars in security aid overseas without giving a second  thought to securing our own border.   At the height of the Cold War, Reagan said:         [I]f history teaches anything, it teaches that simpleminded       appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is       folly. It means the betrayal of our past [and] the       squandering of our freedom.    There is a lot of wisdom in that. We need to think about that  history. Thousands of innocent people have already paid the ultimate  price because Joe Biden has refused to heed that warning.   It is time to abandon this failed strategy of appeasement. It is time  to project strength and resolve. It is time for our allies to know that  they are our allies, that they can count on us. It is time for our  enemies to fear us. It is time for us to make certain that we get an  aid package--an aid package--to Israel. It is time for us to secure our  southern border. It is time for us to know who is coming into this  country and why they are coming into this country.   If Joe Biden doesn't act to secure our border and defend our right to  exist as a free and independent country, we are going to see the  violence that threatens the sovereignty of Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan  bleed onto American soil, and no level of negotiation or appeasement  will be able to stop it.   I yield the floor.
