 Mr. President, for the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation I report favorably the following nomination lists  which were printed in the Record on the dates indicated, and ask  unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive  Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the  information of Senators.
