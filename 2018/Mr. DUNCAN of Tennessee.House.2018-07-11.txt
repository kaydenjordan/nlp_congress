 Mr. Speaker, I voted for the first Gulf war  many years ago because our leaders at that time said Saddam Hussein was  the greatest threat since Hitler and told us all about Hussein's  powerful, elite troops.   I then saw these same elite troops surrender to CNN camera crews and  empty tanks. I realized then, and many times since, that the threats  had been and continue to be greatly exaggerated. For this and many  other reasons, I voted against the second Gulf war in 2002.   Most of these threats are more about money and power than they are  about real danger to the U.S. They also seem to be because many of our  leaders seem to be a little too eager to go to war and want to be new  Winston Churchills and prove how tough they are, how patriotic, and how  they are great leaders. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not patriotic at  all to send young Americans to fight very unnecessary wars.   With these thoughts as background, I would like to read part of  conservative syndicated columnist Eric Margolis' most recent column.   First, let me say that President Trump is correct in saying that NATO  countries should not continue to expect the U.S. to pay for their  defense needs.   Mr. Margolis' column, in part, is as follows:         Germany is reported to have less than 20 operational tanks.       Canada's armed forces appear to be smaller than the New York       City Police Department.        But the Europeans ask, ``Defense against whom?'' The Soviet       Union was a huge threat back in the Cold War when the mighty       Red army had 55,000 tanks pointed west. Today, Russia's land       and naval power has evaporated. Russia has perhaps 5,500 main       battle tanks in active service and a similar number in       storage, a far cry from its armored juggernaut of the Cold       War.        More important, Russia's military budget for 2018 was only       $61 billion, actually down 17 percent from last year. Russia       is facing hard economic times. Russia has slipped to fourth       place in military spending after the U.S., China, and Saudi       Arabia.        The U.S. and its wealthy allies account for two-thirds of       world military spending. In fact, the U.S.' total military       budget, including for nuclear weapons and foreign wars, is       about $1 trillion, 50 percent of total U.S. Government       discretionary spending.        In addition, Russia must defend a vast territory from the       Baltic to the Pacific. The U.S. is fortunate in having Mexico       and Canada as neighbors. Russia has North Korea, China,       India, the Middle East, and NATO to watch.        As with its naval forces, Russia's armies are too far apart       to lend one another mutual support. Two vulnerable rail lines       are Russia's main land link between European Russia and its       Pacific Far East.        Trump's extra supplemental military budget boost this year       of $54 billion is almost as large as Russia's entire 2018       military budget. As for Trump's claim that Europe is not       paying its fair share of NATO expenses, note that Britain and       France combined together spend more on their military forces       than Russia.        In Europe, it is hard to find many people who still       consider Russia a serious threat, except for some dipsy       Danes, right-wing Swedes, and assorted Russophobic East       Europeans. The main fear of Russia seems concentrated in the       minds of American neoconservatives, media, and victims of the       bizarre anti-Russian hysteria that has gripped the U.S.    Mr. Speaker, that is from the Margolis column, and I hope that  Members in this Congress will keep those words in mind.                            ____________________
