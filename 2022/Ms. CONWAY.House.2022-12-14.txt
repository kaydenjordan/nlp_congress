 Mr. Speaker, while my service in Congress has been brief,  it has been the privilege of a lifetime. When Congressman Devin  Nunes'--who was my Congressman--district was redistricted away, I felt  that perhaps my prior service as a county supervisor, as the minority  leader in the California State House, and as a Presidential appointee  might lend me some expertise to finish the term for Congressman Nunes  and represent the constituents of California's Central Valley.   I must say that I felt very welcome here by the California delegation  on  [[Page H9735]]  both sides. I had served with many of them in other capacities, so I  felt very welcome.   I want to mention very quickly my staff, my prior staff, and my staff  now. They know once you have served with Ms. Conway, you are a staffer  for life.   I also want to thank the staff of this building. Even coming here  today I got a little turned around. I know where I am going  politically; I am just not sure of the building. So all the staff has  been very gracious. I think they actually all know me by first name:  the effervescent Ms. Conway.   When I was sworn in, I promised the good people of California's  Central Valley that they would be the only special interest I  represent. I hope they believe that I kept my word.   Congress is not a particularly popular institution right now, and a  good dose of the criticism is well-deserved. Serving in Congress  doesn't make you a hero and should not break any privilege except the  privilege of serving this country. Instead of citizen-legislators, we  have many professional politicians today, and perhaps some Americans  would prefer that more Members served just 6 months, like I am, rather  than for decades.   Nevertheless, I have always had a healthy respect for anyone who puts  themselves out there and runs for public office. We need public  servants to develop good ideas for solving problems, to present these  ideas to their communities, and to advance those solutions in Congress.   In short, this country--the leader of the free world--is worth the  conversations, the efforts, and the fights that happen here and on the  campaign trail, notwithstanding all the messy unpleasantness that goes  with the process.   As Americans it is easy for us to forget how rare and precious self- government has been throughout the world. Each and every day that I  have stepped into this historic Capitol, I have stood in wonder and awe  of how truly amazing this place is and how truly amazing the  opportunity is to serve this country.   In Washington I have found that despite all the current bitterness in  Congress--I am getting a little emotional--there were a range of  issues, including the California water crisis, in which there is a good  chance for bipartisan cooperation.   Moving forward, I urge my colleagues to explore every possibility to  work together on water, wildfires, energy, and other pressing issues,  knowing that families are counting on us to solve the big problems that  impact them daily.   As my service nears its end, I would like to thank my family. They  did not take the oath of office, but they have certainly shared with me  in this. My heartfelt appreciation--and I use the word heart--goes to  my husband, Craig, who actually, 8\1/2\ weeks ago, had a heart  transplant and is doing well thanks to God; my sons, Anthony and Tim;  and my dear grandchildren, Caine and Autrey. I also can't forget our  dog, Jake, who doesn't miss me, but I do miss him a lot when I am here.   Finally, I would like to say a few words about my constituents back  home. The Valley's agricultural communities work hard to feed the  Nation. Most people buying their produce, meat, and milk at stores  throughout the country have no idea where that food comes from or all  the effort it took to get it to them.   Maintaining the well-being of these communities is a national  security issue. Unfortunately, many Americans will only realize that in  the most dramatic way if conditions in these communities become so  difficult that people simply decide they can't continue working and  growing any longer.   In California, especially lately, Silicon Valley gets all the  headlines. While I am sure the tech executives deep down inside are  nice people and they are smart people, they don't feed a lot of the  families.   The Central Valley of California is the main pillar of our Nation's  food chain. Its residents are my heroes. They are people who get up  every day, go to work, pay their taxes, worship at their place of  choice, and donate to charity when they can. I think all they really  want to accomplish is to live their best life and maybe go to their  kids' or their grandkids' soccer games on the weekend. Most people  don't live and breathe politics like we do, but their work ultimately  funds everything we do in Washington, and we can never forget them and  that we are here with the single purpose of serving them.   So I would like to sign off by expressing my love and pride in the  people of California's Central Valley who sent me here in the first  place and to whom I shall return.                            ____________________
