 Mr. President, pending before the U.S. Senate is the  nomination of Mick Mulvaney, a Congressman who is seeking to be the  Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   If you were to ask the people of America about the Cabinet positions  filled by the President, the one they probably would miss is the Office  of Management and Budget. It turns out to be one of the more important  positions, but it is not as well known historically as Treasury  Secretary, Secretary of State, and Attorney General. It is an important  job. It is one of the most consequential jobs because the Director of  the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for preparing the  President's budget, setting the priorities of the Federal budget, and  overseeing the performance of Federal agencies. It is a big and  challenging job.   Many other nominees for positions in the Cabinet are well known and  have been debated on the floor of the Senate. Today I come to say a few  words about the record of this Congressman, Mick Mulvaney, who is  seeking this directorship of the Office of Management and Budget. It is  a very interesting record.   It is not unusual for Members of the House and the Senate to have  unusual positions on issues. I guess each one of us has something we  believe intensely that other people question. When it comes to  Congressman Mulvaney, there is a long litany of positions he has taken  that are far out of the mainstream of either political party. Yet  President Donald Trump decided this is the man, this is the person he  wanted to head up his budgeting effort. This is the person he wants to  set the priorities for spending in the United States of America during  his Presidency.   If you look at the record of Mick Mulvaney, you will find that he has  had an eagerness to dictate large and draconian cuts across the Federal  Government in some of our most important and most cherished programs.  Let me tell you about a few that highlight his record in Congress. Each  one of these that I will speak to, if advanced by the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget, would have far-reaching consequences  on families and individuals across the United States, not only in the  operation of government but also in the effectiveness of our Federal  workforce.   To start with--and this, I think, is the right place to start-- Congressman Mulvaney, who seeks the position of Director of the Office  Management and Budget, has repeatedly led efforts to shut down the  Federal Government. When Mr. Mulvaney and the Republicans succeeded in  shutting down the government for 16 days in 2013, it cost the American  economy $20 billion. Do you remember that?   Rush Limbaugh got on his radio show and said: If they shut down the  government, no one will even notice.   Guess what, Mr. Limbaugh. They noticed.   All across America, working families paid the price for that foolish  political act of shutting down the government. The real cost of the  government shutdown is not just measured in dollars. The real cost is  in hardships unnecessarily created, hardships for Federal employees who  didn't receive their checks on a timely basis, hardships for people  struggling to survive in America, who relied on programs like food  stamps. We call them SNAP benefits now. They had their food in jeopardy  and endangered because Congressman Mulvaney and his friends thought  that a display of political power--shutting down the government--was  the right recipe for America.   These government shutdowns delayed 2 million Federal workers from  receiving their checks, real people with real families to feed.  Congressman Mulvaney doesn't seem to care about these real-world  consequences of a shutdown. Instead, he called the shutdown of the  Federal Government ``good policy.'' Those are his words: ``good  policy.''   Then, when we finally reached an agreement to reopen the government,  he was one of the few Members of the House to vote against the  compromise in reopening the government.   In recent years, he has repeated his calls. He is willing to shut  down the government of the United States of America to defund Planned  Parenthood. This man wants to craft our national budget, and he would  shut down the government over one provision in that budget? That is  what he said.   Time and again, he has taken extreme positions on the Federal budget.  We have a standing tradition in the House and the Senate. Since not one  of us can predict when the next natural disaster is going to occur, we  try to help one another.   I have voted for funds during the course of my congressional career  for disasters in probably every State in the union. Do you know why?  Because I knew the day would come--and it did, several times during my  tenure in the House and Senate--when there would be a natural disaster  in my State, and we needed a helping hand, emergency disaster  assistance. That is a tradition which has been around Congress--I can  go back almost centuries to see it in past history.   Listen to what Congressman Mulvaney did. He tried to block emergency  disaster assistance to States that desperately needed the help of the  Federal Government in their recovery efforts. He offered a poison pill  amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief package that would have  required across-the-board cuts in military spending--military  spending--to pay for disaster relief from Hurricane Sandy. Then he went  further and said: Not just military spending, I want cuts in  entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid. Let's cut the healthcare  assistance for Americans to pay for that disaster. That is his idea of  social justice.   Despite President Trump's campaign promises to rebuild the Nation's  crumbling infrastructure, Congressman Mick Mulvaney has taken an  extraordinary and extreme view. He wants to eliminate Federal funding  for transportation projects. He cosponsored a bill that would slash the  Federal gas tax. That is how we pay for repairing Federal roads and  mass transit across America. He isn't interested in fixing the highway  trust fund solvency problems. His solution is to bankrupt it.   This is the man who wants to write the budget for America? His  extreme ideology would threaten billions of dollars that my State  receives in Federal transportation funds. We put money into the Federal  highway trust fund,  [[Page S1195]]  too, every time we buy a gallon of gas in Illinois. He would cut back  on the resources coming back to my State and others to repair the very  roads we drive on.   He has consistently supported across-the-board cuts for the  Department of Defense, regardless of those affected. Just a few minutes  ago, Senator John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, came to the  floor to announce that because of Congressman Mulvaney's positions on  cuts in the military, he--Senator McCain--would oppose the appointment  of Mulvaney as head of OMB. Senator McCain said that it is a rare day  when he comes out against a Presidential nominee of his own party. But  he thinks Mulvaney's record is worrisome, and I couldn't agree  more. The positions that Congressman Mulvaney has taken are reckless  and would jeopardize the economic security of working families and put  our Nation and economy at risk.    Possibly one of the most troubling positions that Congressman  Mulvaney has taken is the fact that he is opposed to the Federal  Government spending funds for medical research. Last year when Congress  was deliberating how to combat the Zika virus, Representative Mulvaney  wrote this on his Facebook page: ``Do we really need government-funded  research at all?''   Let's think about that for a moment. Do we really need government- funded medical research in the United States? Do we need the National  Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the Veterans'  Administration investing in trying to find new cures for diseases?   Government-funded research in the Department of Defense has produced  fascinating insights into the biology of breast cancer that have  greatly impacted the treatment of that disease and saved lives in  America. Look at the revolutionary Department of Defense-funded work  that led to the development of the innovative drug Herceptin.  Government-funded research, which Congressman Mulvaney does not believe  we should do, at the National Institutes of Health has accomplished the  following. It has cut the U.S. cancer death rate by 11 percent in women  and 19 percent in men. And Congressman Mulvaney says: Do we really need  to do that? Is that important? I would guess that his family, like  every family in America, has a story to tell about cancer--what it has  meant, the devastation it has created, the deaths that have resulted.   But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it. He just doesn't understand  anything as basic as investing in medical research to save lives. HIV/ AIDS is no longer a death sentence in America. I saw Magic Johnson just  a few weeks ago at a farewell party for President Obama. I remembered  the day in the House of Representatives when I was told that he had  AIDS. We assumed he would die in just a short period of time. But that  was over 25 years ago. He has survived because of research that was  done at the National Institutes of Health, and he is not alone. There  are thousands just like him.   When I was a kid, polio was something every mother and father were  frightened of. What in the world was happening? How could your child be  infected with polio and end up being crippled for life? Our Republican  leader here, Mitch McConnell, went through that in his childhood and  has talked about that episode in his life and how devastating it was.  He has had a full life since then, but he has overcome the problems of  that disease. I remember as a kid in grade school, when they announced  that our government research had come up with a vaccine that would  protect kids from polio. That, to me, was a breakthrough, and one that  I welcomed and our family welcomed.   Congressman Mulvaney questions whether or not medical research should  continue, even in the light of the achievements in eradicating polio  and small pox and other diseases in our country. These advances didn't  just magically happen because of the miracle of the marketplace. They  occurred because of sustained taxpayer investment in Federal medical  research.   I will tell you this. If he wants to make a referendum in the Senate  or the House on medical research a part of his budget debate, I welcome  the challenge. I believe that Members of both political parties would  stand up for medical research, despite Congressman Mulvaney's extreme  positions.   So when someone asks if we really need government-funded medical  research, the answer on behalf of cancer patients who are beating the  disease, on behalf of HIV/AIDS patients who are living longer and  normal lives, on behalf of all those families hoping and praying that  some Federal researcher will come up with a breakthrough for  Alzheimer's, for autism, or Parkinson's or diabetes--the answer,  Congressman Mulvaney, is unequivocally, yes. America needs to invest in  medical research. And the fact that you would question it really raises  the question of your judgment.   Let me tell you another thing that he is for, which I think is the  single most irresponsible budgetary position he has taken. He has been  an opponent of raising the country's debt ceiling.   What is the debt ceiling? That is America's mortgage. That is the  amount of debt we incur as a nation. It is a mortgage that is incurred  for things that we have already spent money on. So when we come and  vote for $600 billion for the Department of Defense and the  intelligence agencies and we don't have enough money coming in taxes to  pay for it, we have to extend America's mortgage to cover it.  Congressman Mulvaney says that is the wrong thing to do--extending the  debt ceiling of this country. While running for Congress, Congressman  Mulvaney, who now wants to manage our Nation's budget, pledged he would  never ever vote to raise the country's debt ceiling. He voted against  it four different times.   In 2011, when we were just about to breach the debt limit and default  on our national debt for the first time in the history of our country,  Mulvaney was a leading voice in support of default. He called it a  ``fabricated crisis,'' and accused both parties of ``fear mongering.''   I am not sure what is more disturbing--Mr. Mulvaney's willingness to  default on our country's obligations, the full faith and credit of the  United States, or his lack of appreciation for the devastating economic  consequences which would follow. I can tell you what is at risk with  that kind of reckless attitude toward our Nation's debt. What is at  risk are the savings and investments and retirement accounts of  ordinary Americans across the Nation. Mr. Mulvaney may be willing to  gamble the full faith and credit of the United States; I am not.  Forcing the Federal Government to default on the Nation's debt would  harm the economy and affect the government's ability to make payments  to Social Security and Medicare recipients, military personnel,  veterans, Federal employees, defense contractors, State governments,  and to the bondholders of the United States, here and overseas.   We would lose our credibility if Mr. Mulvaney had his way and allowed  us to default on our national debt. We should not ever consider  confirming an OMB Director who has repeatedly risked the economic  security of our Nation to score political, rhetorical points.   Throughout his campaign, President Trump promised to protect Medicare  and Social Security and make decisions that would ``benefit American  workers and American families.'' That is a quote. However, instead of  making good on the promise, President Trump has chosen a man to head  the Office of Management and Budget who has led calls for devastating  cuts to Federal programs that millions of Americans rely on every day.   Mr. Mulvaney has said he wants to ``end Medicare as we know it,'' and  he has called Social Security a ``Ponzi scheme.'' He has called for  raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70, from the 67 that  it currently is. Well, 3 more years at work may not mean much to a  Member of Congress, because we sit down a lot in these comfortable  chairs and people bring us things when we need them. But 3 more years  of working before you qualify for Social Security means something to a  waitress, whose hips and ankles and knees have been bothering her for  years, but she has no choice but to get up every morning, go to work,  carry those trays, and try to bring enough money home to help a family.  It means something to someone who works in a coal mine--I guarantee you  that--3 more years at work, exposing yourself to the lung diseases and  other things  [[Page S1196]]  that might come with the job. It means something to a truckdriver,  spending days and nights on the road. It means something to people who  have to move freight around. It is the kind of thing that means a lot  to ordinary working people. It clearly doesn't mean anything to  Congressman Mulvaney. Three more years working, as far as he is  concerned, is an acceptable alternative.   He wants to privatize Medicare and turn Medicare back into the loving  arms of private health insurance companies, and let's see what seniors  end up experiencing. Almost 60 million Americans now rely on Medicare.  In Congressman Mulvaney's point of view, the guarantee of Medicare  would end. This is the man President Trump has chosen to head the  budget for the United States of America. Mulvaney has called repeatedly  for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, including a ``cut,  cap, and balance'' budget, which would cut each of these programs by 25  percent. When you say the word Medicaid, people have an image in their  mind: Oh, that is health insurance for poor people. And that is  generally correct, although it also covers disabled Americans. But do  you know who the major recipients of Medicaid are in America? The  largest single group of people receiving help from Medicaid are  children--children in poor, low-income families who get medical care  through Medicaid. The biggest expenditure for Medicaid is not children  though. The biggest expenditure is for the elderly Americans who are  living largely at institutional settings, in these care homes, nursing  homes. Medicaid keeps them in that place with adequate medical care. So  now comes Congressman Mulvaney and says: Let's just cut those by 25  percent. There is one good way to reduce Federal spending.   Really? So that means fewer immunizations for children. What does it  mean for your mother or your grandmother in the nursing home when it is  announced that we don't have enough money to cover the cost to keep her  here in a good, safe, positive environment? For Congressman Mulvaney,  it is just numbers on paper. For real families across America, it is  the reality of life.   Much like our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congressman  Price, Representative Mulvaney wants to dramatically undermine the  Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors. Let's look at what Medicare  has meant to our country since it was created in 1965. Before Medicare,  only 51 percent of Americans 65 and older had health care coverage.  Nearly 30 percent lived in poverty. Today, 98 percent of seniors have  health care, and less than 10 percent live below the poverty line. Has  Medicare work? You bet it has. It has provided health insurance for  seniors, and it has given people dignity and independence in their  senior years--something that everyone should value. And, incidentally,  the life expectancy of Americans has grown by 5 years since we created  Medicare. It is working. Medicare helps seniors, helps their families,  and it helps America. But Congressman Mulvaney doesn't get it.   This man has been chosen by President Trump to write the budget of  America. Why is Congressman Mulvaney so hell-bent on ending a program  like Medicare that 98 percent of our Nation's seniors depend on? Well,  I can tell you, if his comments on Medicare scare you, on Medicaid he  is even worse. This program, combined with the Children's Health  Insurance Program, ensures health coverage for 70 million Americans.  One out of every five nationwide depend on Medicaid. It helps low- income families, pregnant women, children, and those with disabilities.  Currently, if you qualify for Medicaid, you are guaranteed to get  health coverage. Congressman Mulvaney thinks he has a better idea. He  wants to change that.   Congressman Mulvaney wants to significantly cut the Federal funding  for Medicaid and leave States to fend for themselves when it comes to  caring for these 70 million Americans. Faced with less Federal funding,  States would be forced to find ways to cut spending and save money.  They might start Medicaid waiting lists or impose work requirements or  slash benefits. At the end of the day, the result would be  catastrophic.   I just spent the last weekend in Southern Illinois. We had a  roundtable down there to talk about the impact of the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act. These hospital administrators from smalltown  hospitals came in to tell me that losing Medicaid reimbursement could  force them to dramatically cut their workforce and maybe even face  closure. Here is Congressman Mulvaney suggesting: Let's just do that  across America. I wonder where he lives. I wonder if there are any  small towns or rural areas near him. I wonder if he values those  hospitals the way the people living in communities that I represent  value them. These are not only lifelines for people who desperately  need timely, professional medical care, but they are the source of the  best jobs in the community. Congressman Mulvaney could care less: Let's  just keep cutting on Medicaid and see what happens.   What will happen will be devastating.   Mr. Mulvaney isn't content with just throwing seniors off Medicare  and low-income families off Medicaid. He wants to punish women by  taking away their healthcare providers and inserting his own decisions  into their medical decisions. Mr. Mulvaney has repeatedly attempted to  defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide women and men  with important cancer screenings, family planning, STD testing, and  other important health care services.   The laws of the United States of America provide that not one penny  can be given to Planned Parenthood for abortion services--not one penny  under the law. Most people, if asked what percentage of the Planned  Parenthood budget is actually spent on abortion services would get it  wrong. The actual number is 3 percent. Ninety-seven percent of what  Planned Parenthood does, in terms of family planning, cancer screening,  STD screening, has no relation directly to abortion services, and that  is compensated, but abortion services are not under the law.  Congressman Mulvaney could care less. He would close down the sources  of family planning in small towns and communities around America.    The concerns I have laid out today are just a few that I have about  this nomination. The millions of hard-working Americans who believed  President Trump's campaign promises, and as a champion for the most  vulnerable, deserve far better than Congressman Mulvaney.   There are real problems facing this Nation. Far too many people are  struggling, and there is a lot of work to do. We cannot afford to risk  our economic recovery, the retirement plans and savings of working  Americans, the health of our children, the kind of care we want for our  mothers and grandmothers--we cannot afford to risk them by appointing  OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.   I have no choice but to oppose Mick Mulvaney's nomination for  Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   Mr. President, Mick Mulvaney is a founder of the House Freedom  Caucus, which has made repeal of the Affordable Care Act--without a  replacement--one of their main causes. This is not about good policy or  the real consequences for people around the country. This is about  ideology.   Mr. Mulvaney wants to rip health insurance away from nearly 30  million people and deny people the important consumer protections they  have come to depend upon. He would once again allow insurers to impose  pre-existing condition exclusions and discriminate based on gender and  cut off coverage when someone gets sick and needs it most.   His answer to fixing our health care system is ``free-market  competition'' and ``crackdown on frivolous lawsuits. Those might make  good talking points, but they will not stabilize our insurance market  and help people in need.   The Illinois Hospital Association estimates that Republican plans to  repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in the loss of up to 95,000  jobs in Illinois--in hospitals, doctor's offices, construction, real  estate, and beyond.   Over the last month, I have been going around my State, meeting with  hospitals and providers, talking to them about what repeal would mean.  They are worried.   You see, Illinois hospitals and health systems generate nearly $90  billion in the State and local economies each year, and 1 in 10 jobs in  Illinois is in  [[Page S1197]]  health care. Hospitals are vitally important to our State's economy and  vitally important to patients in need.   Don't just take my word for it, Franklin Hospital CEO, Jim Johnson  told me:         In our community, at the time that the hospital in West       Frankfort closed, we [Franklin Hospital in Benton] managed to       stay open . . . they're just eaten up that they don't have a       hospital anymore. It's incredible what the loss of a hospital       can do to a small community. And I'm down there talking to       those guys every day because naturally I like them to use our       hospital . . . but those conversations, it has just torn this       community apart.    In Illinois and nationwide, rural hospitals would be particularly  hurt by Mr. Mulvaney and Republicans' prescription for chaos.   In Illinois, 62 of our 102 counties are rural. We have 51 Critical  Access Hospitals, which are the hubs of their communities. Rural  hospitals typically are more reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, and have  tighter operating margins.   So what has the ACA meant for them? In States that expanded Medicaid,  like Illinois, rural hospitals have seen greater financial stability  thanks to the decrease in uncompensated care--or charity care--costs.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in rural  communities has dropped by nearly 40 percent. This is not only great  for those individuals obtaining insurance, it is also great for the  rural hospitals who are now getting paid for the health services they  provide.   Community Health & Emergency Services CEO Fred Bernstein told me:         You can look at Cairo as the ghost of the future. Because       there is not much left that we have to lose . . . We've lost       the only grocery store, and the only drug store in Cairo. If       this Affordable Care Act thing isn't resolved and if we go to       block grant in the Medicaid program, there's not going to be       any resolution to those problems down there. We are not going       to be able to stay open. At least 72-74 percent of my       patients depend upon Medicaid . . . Without the expansions of       Medicaid that we've already seen, and without some of the       subsidies that those who can get some insurance will get to       keep that insurance, there's not going to be the ability to       afford any care for most of the people we serve.    Since 2009, the number of rural hospitals in Illinois operating in  the red has decreased by 46 percent. Put another way, 16 rural  hospitals in Illinois are now on much more solid financial footing  thanks to the ACA.   I yield the floor.
