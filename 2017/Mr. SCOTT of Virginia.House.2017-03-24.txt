 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to manage the balance of the time remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the Affordable Care Act, I think it is  important to remind ourselves of the situation before it passed: costs  were going through the roof, those with preexisting conditions could  not get insurance, women were paying more than men, and every year  millions of people were losing their insurance.   We passed the Affordable Care Act. Since then, the costs have  continued to go up, but at the lowest rate in 50 years. Those with  preexisting conditions can get insurance at the standard rate. Women  are no longer paying more than men. Instead of millions of people  losing their insurance every year, more than 20 million more people now  have insurance.   The full name of the Affordable Care Act is the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act.   Now your coverage can't be canceled if your insurance company decides  that it has paid too much. Preventive services, such as cancer  screenings, are free with no copays and deductibles. We are closing the  doughnut hole. Those under 26 can stay on their parents' policies.   We also funded community health centers, made investments in  education to produce more doctors, nurses, and other professionals.  Through all of that, the Medicare trust fund is more solvent than it  was before.   Still, the law is not perfect. But if we are going to make any  changes, we ought to improve the law, not make it worse.   Incredibly this bill makes it worse. Now, the CBO has separated  promises and press releases from reality. Twenty-four million fewer  people will have insurance, and the Republicans call this choice in  freedom to be uninsured. Most everybody else will pay more and get  fewer benefits. All of those consequences will occur if the proposal  actually works.                                time  1515    A number of States have done what this bill tries to do, and that is  cover people with preexisting conditions without universal coverage.  All of those attempts failed.   So the question we must ask is: Who will be better off if this bill  passes? Certainly not older people who will face the bill's age tax.  Certainly not veterans who will lose benefits. Certainly not senior  citizens in nursing homes and people with disabilities because Medicaid  is cut. Even the solvency of the Medicare trust fund will be worse.   But millionaires will get tax cuts.   Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing a lot of complaints and  shortcomings about the Affordable Care Act, but if we are going to make  any changes, we should improve it. Unfortunately, this bill makes  things worse: 24 million will lose their insurance, most everybody else  will pay more and get less. This bill should be defeated.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my distinguished  colleague from Virginia that his vote for this bill will result in  56,100 more people from his congressional district in Virginia losing  health care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the Mariana  Islands (Mr. Sablan).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this bill will result in 63,900 people from his congressional  district in Florida losing healthcare coverage and care.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his  vote for this bill will result in 51,700 people in his district losing  their coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American  Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American College of Physicians, the American Congress of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists, and the American Osteopathic Association in  opposition to the legislation.   [From the American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of   Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, The American Congress of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Osteopathic Association, Mar.                                  7, 2017]     America's Front Line Physicians Express Serious Concerns With the                          American Health Care Act         Washington, DC--After the release of the two budget       reconciliation bills today, the physician leaders of our       organizations, representing over 500,000 physicians and       medical students, visited with members of the House of       Representatives to urge that they ``First, do no harm'' to       our patients by rolling back key coverage, benefits and       consumer protections as required under current law, including       the Affordable Care Act. We are concerned that by rushing to       a mark-up tomorrow in the Energy and Commerce and Ways and       Means Committees, there will be insufficient time to obtain       non-partisan estimates of this legislation's impact by the       Congressional Budget Office, or for medical organizations       like ours and other key stakeholders in the health care       community to offer substantive input on the bill.        During our meetings with members of the House of       Representatives today, we shared our joint principles for       health care reform. They reflect our collective expertise,       and represent the health care needs patients present to our       members every day. We urge Representatives to utilize these       principles to evaluate any legislation to modify current law,       and ensure that patients and providers are not adversely       affected. While each of our organizations individually are       still reviewing the changes proposed by the American Health       Care Act, released just hours ago, we share a concern that it       will not meet our principles because it will likely result in       less access to coverage and higher costs for millions of       patients.        We urge House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and the chairs of       these two committees to reconsider the decision to move       forward with mark-up, and instead allow the time needed for a       thorough review of the bill to ensure that it meets our       overarching principle, ``First, do no harm'' to patients.
