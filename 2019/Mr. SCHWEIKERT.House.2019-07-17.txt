 Mr. Speaker, tonight is a continuation of a series I  have been doing on the floor every other week, depending on the chaos  of the floor schedule. I take about a half an hour and walk through  things I see in the numbers and, in many ways, express my intense  frustration at both the Democrats and many of my brothers and sisters  on the Republican side for not taking a step backward from the daily  chaos that has become the House of Representatives to realize that the  single biggest threat to the cohesion of our society is demographics. I  am going to walk through what that means.   The reason I always put up this particular board is that we have  developed, in our office, a five-prong attack on what society does  financially to be able to keep the promises of Social Security and  Medicare.   The demographics I was speaking of are those of us who are baby  boomers. There are 74 million of us born, functionally, in an 18-year  period, with 10,300 of us retiring or turning 65 every single day.    The math is devastatingly ugly. My instinct is maybe that is why it  is avoided in conversation around here, because the math is difficult.  It is uncomfortable. It is also real.   Something I don't often do, but I want to read a simple paragraph  from a June 11, 2019, analysis from the Manhattan Institute that was  analyzing the numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. They are  talking, right now, about just Social Security and Medicare. ``Over the  next decade, 91 percent of the projected increase in budget deficits,  which are set to approach $2 trillion, comes from the increased cost''  of Social Security, Medicare, and the associated interest.   Think of that. In the next decade, when we talk about the growth of  the debt and deficit, 91 percent of that is just, functionally, the  demographic growth for Social Security and Medicare.   Another way to think about that is, every 5 years, just the growth in  Social Security and Medicare equals the entire Defense Department.   If we are going to keep our promises as a society--these are earned  benefits. We made a promise as a society, avoiding the reality of the  math.   Think about this part of this paragraph. ``Over the next 30 years,  Social Security and Medicare are projected to run a $100 trillion cash  shortfall, including resulting interest costs, while the rest of the  budget is projected to run a $16 trillion surplus.'' Think about that  one more time--over the next 30 years.   I have a 3\1/2\-year-old little girl. Doesn't she deserve to live in  an America that continues to be prosperous?   With these sorts of numbers, it is impossible. Functionally, our debt  deficits, the attempt to try to keep some of our promises, is going to  consume everything around us.   In previous times on the floor, and I know I am going to be doing it  again, we brought in a series of what the left often says: ``Well, we  will tax the rich more. We will do this and this.'' They only cover  tiny portions. The scale of this doesn't work in our modern rhetoric.   Think about that last sentence again. If you remove Social Security  and Medicare, over the next 30 years, the budget has a $16 trillion  surplus. One of our boards has a higher number because the board is a  bit out-of-date. But the budget is what we call a cash surplus. The  associated revenues exceed the associated expenses.   If you add in Social Security and Medicare, it is a $100 trillion  deficit, with its associated interest costs.   What are we going to do? We believe we have a fighting chance. There  was a time, a decade ago, if you did certain senior options and those  things in Medicare, gave some pricing power and options, you could see  where you could flatten out some of that debt-to-GDP curve and make the  baby boomers survivable, economically.   We have waited too long. We have missed that window. Now our argument  is that we have to do everything. We have to do things that grow the  economy, a Tax Code that maximizes economic expansion, trade that  maximizes economic expansion, regulations, smart regulations, using  technology that maximizes economic expansion.   Labor force participation, what do you do to encourage workforce  entry? We are doing remarkably well right now. We still have a problem  with millennial men. We still need to find ways to create some spiffs  within the Tax Code, within the retirement parts of the code, to  encourage seniors who are healthy, wish to do it, and are prepared to  do it, to stay in the labor force.   We have to do things to encourage family formation and to move to an  immigration system that is talent-  [[Page H5992]]  based, so it maximizes economic vitality.   We are going to have to look at the earned entitlement and things we  can do to put spiffs and incentives within there to change the cost of  healthcare, to encourage staying in the labor force, smart  decisionmaking.   One of these is really important to me. I have spent a lot of time on  the floor--aggressive adoption of disruptive technology, particularly  in healthcare.   In this body, we have a running debate. The Republicans say our  healthcare reform is who should get subsidized, who shouldn't, and we  will add some market forces. The Democrat side is: Well, we won't add  market forces. We will do a collectivization, but we will see who pays  and who gets subsidized.   We are having an argument about the money, on who gets to pay, not  what to pay.   There is technology, and we have done this over and over on the  floor, that is about to crash the price of healthcare. If this body is  prepared to have that Blockbuster moment--and when I say, ``Blockbuster  moment,'' I mean Blockbuster video moment, where technology changes  things. We no longer go down to the neighborhood shopping center and  get a little silver disk to shove into our player at home. Instead, we  go home and hit a button.   It turns out, in healthcare, you have two sides. You have technology,  everything from something you can blow into that tells you if you have  the flu, to the thing you wear on your body that helps diagnose you, to  the autonomous healthcare clinics that are going up around Phoenix, to  the other side, the single-shot cure for hemophilia, things that  actually cure disease.   If we can get our heads straight and say we need to crash the price  of healthcare--it will be hard. That type of economic technology  disruption is going to scare a lot of our friends, whether those in  certain medical practices or those who offer certain services. But we  don't have a choice.   I want to walk through some. First, some of the good news and the  reality on the math because this place is substantially a math-free  zone.   Last week, I had floor time scheduled, but the floor ran long  because, well, the chaos on the floor. I ran into one of my friends, a  Democrat from the Midwest, and we were talking about the speech I was  about to give.   His immediate reaction was: Well, David, you had that tax reform a  couple of years ago, and that is the real reason.   You look and say, no. If you think about what has happened in labor,  in tax revenues, in the dramatically fewer people who actually need  social services, it has been incredibly positive for the economy.                                time  2045    So I put this board up for him. Take a look. If you actually take a  look at these years, the middle bar chart, that is 2018. The blue is  2017. The gray is 2019 fiscal year.   This is the first 9 months of what we call receipts. For those of us  on the Ways and Means Committee, this is substantially our  responsibility is these receipts. Highest revenue first 9 months in  U.S. history. Adjusted for constant dollars, the second highest in U.S.  history. The doom and gloom and the crazy things that were said about  tax reform aren't true, and the math says so.   We don't have a choice. If we do not substantially grow this economy,  dramatically grow this economy over the next couple decades--not the  next couple years, but next couple decades--you can't mathematically  cover the promises we have made on Social Security and Medicare.   And I don't know why it is so terrifying for elected Members to  actually be honest about the math. The chart is there. If you don't  believe me, go onto the Treasury's website, look at the receipts that  have come in--highest in history; adjusted for inflation, constant  dollar, second highest in history.   It is working. It is working.   There are other things that are also really optimistic. We are  getting one of those--do you remember our five points? Getting the  economy to grow long term with stability, you all saw the June labor  force report, jobs report--incredibly good numbers, far beyond our  expectation.   But what was also really optimistic for those of us who are trying to  build these models is the number of the population who were coming back  into the labor force.   And I know this is geeking out, but when you actually see more job  postings than you have available workers, amazing. If I told you that a  couple years ago, you would have laughed at me, but it has happened.   But the other thing we also start to look for is, even if you see  little ticks up in the unemployment, the number going up, if it is not  because of the falling available jobs but because those reentering are  choosing to enter the labor force, that is really powerful because that  labor force participation number has a sense of the productivity of our  society.   We have already seen some pretty impressive productivity step-ups. We  have actually seen a constant wage gain, particularly for our brothers  and sisters who were at, the technical term, the lower quartiles, which  I always thought would bring joy across the body.   But it almost now seems this body is incapable of embracing good,  optimistic, joyous numbers of how many of our brothers and sisters out  there who had a pretty crappy previous decade are actually doing well  now. There should be optimism about this. There should be joy about  this, but would that be giving one party kudos against the other?   How about for a moment you just drop the party labels and understand  the math? There are pretty impressive numbers coming out of this  economy right now. What do we do as policymakers to keep it going as  long as possible?   So let's go back to that other leg. How many of our brothers and  sisters are actually in the labor force? I can show you some papers  from just a few years ago that, as the baby boomers are starting to  move into retirement, labor force participation numbers were supposed  to collapse, and you actually see a little bit of that. If you look at  the 10-year labor force participation and then overlay our demographics  as we are getting older as a society, you see those numbers fall.   But take a look at this chart, and this is just the last couple  years. We are back up kissing up against a 63 percent labor force  participation. I know this is geeky, but I can show you papers from a  few years ago. It said we were never getting back close to this number  again, at least not for decades and decades and decades. Well, we are  there.   This is really important to the economic vitality of the society. And  it is not just tax revenues. When you have a population that is  working, you have more of your Americans who are receiving employer- based healthcare. They are not receiving certain social welfare  benefits. They may not be prospering as you might turn on television  and look at the dreams of people who win lotteries, but there are  things working.   You can drive through some of the neighborhoods in parts of my  district and you just look around at the number of people who are  remodeling their homes or putting a new roof on. There are good things  happening out there in society, and you see it in the data.   So why do I come to the microphone almost every week with this sort  of chagrined look, terrified we are not having the difficult  conversation of what do we do to deal with the reality of the promises  we as a society have made to our seniors, that retirement security, to  keep those promises?   Well, let's actually walk through some of the really difficult math,  because this is what drives that $100 trillion, and that is inflation- adjusted dollars, $100 trillion shortfall that comes from Social  Security and Medicare in the next 30 years. This board right here is  the number one driver.   If you need to understand something, just understand this board. This  is basically someone who moves into retirement today, they will have  paid about $161,000 in Medicare taxes. That is a lot of money. But that  senior who has paid in $161,000 in Medicare taxes, they will be taking  out, and this is the average, $498,000.   So take that differential, multiply it times 74 million baby boomers,  and that is the math. That is substantially the driver of a completely  [[Page H5993]]  unsustainable math that blows up everything in our lives. Yet we are  terrified to talk about this. We all know it. We all walk around with  these reports here, though I wonder how many people ever open them up  and read them. But that is the math.   We can manage this, but we have to do it with a level of creativity  and understanding that it is not one solution; it is dozens of policies  coming together to make it work. So let's see what that shortfall  actually does.    This board now is maybe a year out of date, so I need some updating  on it, but it functionally shows the shortfall in Social Security.  Total Social Security shortfall over the 30 years is about $31  trillion.   What you see in the blue is interest. What you see in the purple is  just what we call the cash balance shortfall. But the real difficulty,  the honest difficulty is Medicare.   Medicare produces about a $72 trillion cash shortfall over the next  30 years, where, if you look at the last bar, it is actually green. It  is in the positive. The rest of the budget is positive.   This isn't Republican or Democrat math. It is just demographics. It  is what we are as a society. But yet we will weaponize this.   So if the Democrats do certain things, we are going to attack them on  it. If we do certain things, they are going to attack us. Yet this is  the fragility of our society, and it is almost impossible around here  to talk about because there is folklore around here.   I can't tell you how many public events I have done over the years  where you will get someone to come up to you and say, ``Hey, if you  just take care of waste and fraud,'' ``if you just take care of this,''  ``if you take care of that''; anyone who says that today, particularly  if they are an elected Member of Congress and they come behind a  microphone and say, ``If I take care of waste and fraud, that deals  with the debt and deficits that are coming,'' they are not telling you  the truth. That is not what the calculator says. It is a rounding  error. But that is not part of our political folklore in this culture.   So back to analyzing these numbers.   Projected 2049 deficit, solely Social Security and Medicare. If you  actually see the dedicated revenues, this one is purely on GDP, the  percentage of the GDP in 30 years that is going to have to be dedicated  just to covering Social Security and Medicare. We will be taking in  about 5.8 percent of taxes equal to GDP, that is dedicated to Social  Security and Medicare, but we are going to be spending 17.9.   Remember, if we are going to tell the truth, for many of us, it is  now a battle to keep the ratio of our Nation's debt to the size of our  economy from blowing through that 100 percent. Can we find a way to  stabilize it in that 90, 95 percent area?   It is my goal, it is my dream to come behind this microphone and say  we have balanced the budget, we are paying off the debt. But  demographically, that math is almost impossible.   So our job is to balance it, so, as we are getting older as a  society, we don't blow through that debt-to-GDP ratio which all the  sudden blows up our interest costs, which consumes every next  incremental dollar.   And you start to see, when you look at charts like this, it helps you  understand the growth and the amount of our entire society's economic  productivity that is just going to go to cover these promises. They are  earned benefits, but it is going to consume a huge portion of our  entire economy's vitality just to cover those benefits.   So my friends on the left will often come and say, well, raise tax  rates. Except you have a classic problem. We actually have decades and  decades and decades and decades of data.   So you see the black line here? It is when we have had very high  marginal tax rates. It is when we have had low marginal tax rates. It  is when we have taxed capital gains aggressively, when we haven't taxed  capital gains aggressively. The reality of it is, or somehow it may be  a law of nature or maybe a law of economics or a law of taxation, taxes  always fall back into a certain range of the amount of GDP, the size of  the economy. And this has been under liberal Congresses, conservative  Congresses, liberal Presidents, conservative Presidents.   If you look at that black line, it has always fallen back into, sort  of, a certain range of a percentage of the size of our economy comes in  as Federal taxes: payroll taxes, the FICA we are talking about, and  income taxes over here. It is just history. And there has been all  types of tax schemes attempted.   So from a public policy standpoint, adopt those policies that grow,  that grow the size of the economy, because if you are always going to  come back and get a certain percentage of the size of the economy, how  do you get more revenue? You grow the size of the economy.   Mr. Speaker, may I request the amount of time remaining.    I have come up this year, this may be the two dozenth  time, walking through both the math, the reality. Some of the times I  am behind the mike I am much more optimistic because there is a  technology disruption, there is economic growth, there are things  happening around us that give us a fighting chance.   But some nights I will sit down and I sit here and highlight the  different reports, and I am terrified for my little girl and what her  future will be like because, right now, the math says her marginal tax  rates have to be more than double what I pay today just to maintain,  just to keep the wheels on. The economic growth crashes in our society.  The opportunity is taken away.   And then we have crazy around here where we are getting proposals  from the majority that offer another $40 trillion-plus of spending in  the next 30 years.   Help us find our calculators. Help us find some compassion, some soul  that we can make this society work. But you can't do it by living in a  fantasy world. The math is the math, and pretending it isn't dooms our  future.                                time  2100    I truly believe we are at a moment of inflection where if we do the  right things, we actually could have a couple of great decades ahead of  us, my three-and-a-half-year-old can have an amazing future, every  other child can have an amazing future, every retiree will know they  are secure.   But if we don't take care of these things, how do we deal with the  other wave that is coming at us: the multiemployer pension crisis, the  municipal pension crisis, the State pension crisis, the amount of our  brothers and sisters heading towards retirement that actually have  almost no capital set aside for their retirement other than that Social  Security and those medical benefits that are Medicare?   If you love and care about people, learn the math, tell the truth  about it, and work with those of us who are passionate on working to a  solution, instead of chasing the shiny object of the daily chaos that  is the House of Representatives right now, on what gets you the most  clicks on your social media, what might get you a television hit  tonight.   This is not particularly sexy, this is not exciting, this is not what  a lot of our constituents want to hear, because it is painful.   It is also the single most important thing any elected Member of this  Congress can do, is fixing the greatest threat to our society, and that  is $100 trillion of promises over the next 30 years to our seniors that  there is no mathematical way to cover.   Let's go do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
