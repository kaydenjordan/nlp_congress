 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Keep Kids Fed Act,  which will aim to ensure our communities, schools, and daycares can  provide healthy meals to children this summer.   At a time when parents are struggling to put food on the table and  prices at the grocery store are at an all-time high, I am grateful for  this bicameral, bipartisan effort to address food insecurity.   Throughout my career, I have focused on making sure to stay in touch.  I had the opportunity to sit with over 60 nutritionists for the school  lunch programs, who had a sense of urgency and concern not about their  jobs, but about the rising costs and their ability to make sure that  young people, K-12, are able to have the meals in a dignified matter,  to be able to be educated and overcome obstacles, and to make sure that  they were fed and ready for class.   That being said, today, I thank Chairman Scott and all my colleagues  for their example to solve this immediate and pressing challenge, and I  look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues to ensure  that we create the ideal environments that allow all students to learn  and thrive.
