 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute  to an extraordinary Iowan with whom I shared a decades-long  friendship--a very prominent Democrat from my State.   Over this past weekend, former Iowa Congressman Berkley Bedell passed  away at the age of 98. For nearly a century of life, Berkley took his  grandmother's advice to heart: ``You can do almost anything within  reason if you will only set your mind to it.''   From an early age, Berkley Bedell set his mind to a high standard of  achievement. He set an example for the rest of us. He practiced what he  preached and he made a difference in this world.   As a child raised during the Great Depression, Berkley became a  soldier in the U.S. Army. He was, obviously, a World War II veteran, an  entrepreneur, a job creator, a philanthropist, a policy influencer,  and, most of all, a devoted husband and father.   What I left out is how I got acquainted with him. He was a fellow  Member of the House of Representatives during my early years and for  some time after I came to the Senate. Our decades-long friendship began  when Berkley and I were elected to serve Iowans in the House of  Representatives in 1974. Soon after the orientation for new Members,  Barbara and I developed a close relationship with Elinor and Berkley.  This friendship remained for the next 45 years.   Looking back, those were lonely days for a freshman Republican House  Member. That is when the Watergate scandal upended the midterm  elections. Voters elected 91 new House Members to that Congress. I  happened to be the only Republican in the Iowa congressional  delegation. Among our so-called Watergate class of 1974, I was joined  by Iowans Tom Harkin, Michael Blouin, and Berkley Bedell. We were all  freshman Members of Congress. We joined then with more senior Members  from the State of Iowa--Neal Smith, who went on to serve 36 years in  the House, and Ed Mezvinsky. The Democrat Senators from Iowa were Dick  Clark and John Culver. Berkley would go on to represent Iowa's Sixth  Congressional District for six terms, from 1975 to 1987. Even though he  lived about another 32 years after that, I presume he would have served  a lot longer if his health had held out.    Although Berkley and I didn't share the same political points of  view, we did share a common approach for representative government,  meaning with dialogue and feedback from Iowans that was very necessary  if we were going to represent them properly. Most often, the forums for  that were our respective townhall meetings.   Throughout our service together in Congress, party labels didn't  displace our ability to work with and for Iowans. As one example,  during the farm crisis of the 1980s, which was much worse than this  farm crisis we have right now, we used our voices to raise public  awareness and steer help to struggling farm communities in our home  State. We did everything possible to shape farm policy and restore hope  to thousands of farm families who were coping with double-digit  inflation and with the farm debt crisis.   As a Federal lawmaker, Berkley took his oversight work seriously.  Even though I take oversight seriously, I didn't do it in quite the way  he did. His was kind of an unorthodox approach. He just ventured,  willy-nilly, into a Federal bureaucracy here or a Federal bureaucracy  over there. He took the liberty of dropping by in person at these  agencies. He would go up to people and ask: What is your job? I don't  know exactly the questions he asked, but in knowing Berkley the way I  did, I think he probably wanted to have very calm conversations with  them to determine what they did and maybe even see if they were doing  it right, particularly if they were spending the taxpayers' money  right. He did this to keep tabs on how these Federal employees in these  various bureaucracies were serving the Nation and, particularly,  serving Iowans. Now, that is what I would call an in-the-flesh gut  check--a very different type of oversight from what I have done.   Berkley was born in Spirit Lake, IA. I assume he lived his entire  life in Spirit Lake, IA, except for the period of time he was in the  military and until he spent some retirement time in Florida. Spirit  Lake, IA, is a close-knit farming community in Dickinson County. His  neck of the woods is located in the Iowa Great Lakes region--a regional  destination for fishing, boating, and outdoor recreation. I will bet  the Presiding Officer has been there many times.   The area is fondly known as the University of Okoboji, where  generations of families go year after year to vacation and enjoy life.  By the way, the University of Okoboji is not really a university but is  very much a selling point for that part of the State, from an economic  development point of view, and it has worked very successfully.   As I just described, this is where Berkley's insatiable work ethic  took root. It guided him for his nearly 100 years of life on Earth.  Through philanthropic good works, he leaves behind a legacy of  conservation, stewardship, and historic preservation. With his wife, he  helped to launch the Okoboji Foundation more than three decades ago.  Since then, the foundation has awarded millions of dollars to scores of  nonprofit organizations in that lakes region of Iowa.  [[Page S6972]]    In other words, Berkley believed in paying it forward. He cared  deeply about giving back to his community for future generations to  enjoy. As you would expect an Iowan to do, he rolled up his sleeves,  opened his wallet, and pitched in to make a difference. By my measure,  his represents a life well lived, and he lived life well.   As I mentioned earlier, Berkley and Elinor became steadfast friends  with Barbara and this Senator. We shared an abiding mutual respect, and  we cherished their gracious regard for that friendship. After the  Bedells moved to Florida in their retirement, Barbara and I enjoyed an  annual gift from the Bedells each February. It was a very simple annual  gift but one that had a lot of meaning to it--more than the material it  represented. They sent us a box of oranges from their home in the  Sunshine State. Just as regularly as a clock, we received these over  many, many years.   Through these many years, their annual Christmas letter was something  that we looked forward to. In many years, in personal notes in those  very letters, they even thanked us for our friendship. Berkley also  stayed in touch with a friendly Valentine note each year to Barbara, my  wife. With Berkley's passing, we are saddened to know that these tokens  of friendship have now come to an end.   Berkley's story is an inspiration for younger generations of  Americans who are pursuing their dreams. It is never too early to dream  big. This was how Berkley Bedell was dreaming as a 16-year-old: He  became an entrepreneur. Berkley launched a fishing tackle business with  Jack, his brother. It was called the Berkley Fly Company. I am told he  started the company with $50 from paper route money. He started tying  fly fishing lures in his bedroom.   Pouring years of sweat equity into the family business boosted the  local economy and created jobs in his beloved Iowa Great Lakes. His  tenacious leadership developed a strong workforce for what was then  called Berkley Industries. That company, which is now called Pure  Fishing, is today one of the leading fishing tackle manufacturers in  the world.   At 98 years young, Berkley didn't let age slow him down by any  stretch of the imagination. He remained active in public policymaking  and immersed in electoral politics in Iowa. Usually, at least once a  year, he called on me here in Washington, in the Hart Office Building,  to tell me about some legislative issue he was interested in, and we  worked together on some of those legislative issues. Everything here in  Washington is so political, so this may sound very unusual, and maybe  it is unusual today: Despite our differences in political  philosophies--he was a Democrat; I am a Republican--we both appreciated  how crucial it was to engage the next generation in civic life.   Berkley's leadership and legacy will be remembered for generations to  come. I am proud to have called him a very good, good friend.   Barbara and I extend our condolences to his sons, Ken and Tom, and to  Joanne, his daughter.   Your dad made a big footprint in his life's journey.   As my former colleague in the House of Representatives, Berkley later  became my constituent when I was elected to serve here in the U.S.  Senate. I never knew Berkley Bedell to stop advocating for his  community or for the good of our Nation. It became Berkley's lifelong  hallmark to leave God's green Earth better than he had found it for  generations to come.   I wish Godspeed to my good friend Berkley Bedell, who joins Elinor,  his beloved wife, in eternal life.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes.    Mr. President, last week, despite the objections of the  United States, the World Bank adopted a plan for lending more than $1  billion annually to China.   China is the world's second largest economy, and its per capita  income is well above the level at which countries are supposed to  graduate from needing World Bank assistance. American tax dollars  should not be used, even indirectly, for lending to wealthier  countries, particularly when they violate human rights.   China seeks legitimacy through international institutions for its bad  practices, including for its own predatory lending through the Belt and  Road Initiative. Despite what the recent World Bank Group's Country  Partnership Framework reads, China is not an example developing  countries should follow.   To sum up on this point, China has the second largest economy in the  world, and it still wants to be considered a developing country and  lend taxpayers' dollars around the world in order for there to be a  greater Communist influence. As taxpayers, we should not stand for that  to happen.                78th Anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor    Mr. President, on another point, this past weekend marked the 78th  anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor--a raid that plunged the  United States into World War II. Almost 2,500 U.S. soldiers lost their  lives that day.   I am proud of the many Iowans who have served and sacrificed for our  great country. Earlier this year, three of these people returned to  Iowa to be laid to rest--Robert J. Bennett, William L. Kvidera, and  Bert E. McKeeman.   I honor them and all of our servicemembers for their sacrifices in  serving our people, protecting our constitutional rights and the  freedom and liberties we have.   I yield the floor.
