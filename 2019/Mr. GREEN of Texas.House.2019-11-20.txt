 Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   I rise today for a very special purpose. I rise because this House on  Monday passed H.R. 3702, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2019.   I rise today, because in thanking people on Tuesday, I neglected to  thank one person who was extremely important in the passage of this  legislation. The majority leader Mr. Hoyer not only worked to help us  bring the legislation to the floor, Mr. Hoyer also improved the  legislation. When it left our committee, it was a good bill. It had the  unanimous consent of the committee.   Some things bear repeating. One hundred percent of the people on the  Financial Services Committee supported this legislation.   Mr. Hoyer helped us by infusing it with some additional language that  deals with resiliency that will help us to rebuild better and stronger  after there has been a disaster.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoyer for his leadership. Especially he is  thanked for making a good bill a much better bill.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise  tonight with a degree of sadness because we have this day, this  national Transgender Day of Remembrance.   It is a sad thing such that you have to have an occasion such as  this. You should never have to set aside time annually to remember  those who have lost their lives to violence. But because it happens, we  must be here.   What Dr. King reminds us was right then and is right now: ``Injustice  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' Injustice against the  trans community is a threat to every community.   It seems that murder of Black transgender women is becoming almost a  crisis in this country. Fatal antitransgender violence in the United  States is on the rise, and most of the victims are Black transgender  women: the largest number of transgender homicides, a record number in  2017, 29 killed; last year, 26 killed, most of them Black.   Why is this happening? Well, one reason might be because this  administration tends to promote a narrative that marginalizes people  who are already being marginalized. Such a narrative has a means of  trickling down.   The tone and tenor of society is set by those at the top. Those at  the top have to be mindful of the messages that they send.   So I am honored to observe this day, and I would like to speak very  tersely about someone whose story cannot be told in 5 minutes.   Itali Marlowe was my constituent. She was found in the driveway of a  local residence, shot multiple times, the 19th trans person to die by  violence in our Nation this year. All but one of these victims has been  a trans woman of color.   This day allows us to memorialize those who have been murdered as a  result of transphobia. But I pray for a day when this day will no  longer exist, when all people will be accepted in a society that  proclaims liberty and justice for all.
