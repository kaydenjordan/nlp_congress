 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule  and to the underlying legislation, H.R. 5.   Contrary to what has just been said on the floor, this bill does not  end discrimination. In fact, the Equality Act imposes top-down,  government-led discrimination against all Americans who hold a  differing view of human sexuality and gender.   This grossly misnamed bill punishes everyday citizens, silences free  speech and viewpoint disagreements, and discriminates against people of  faith. In reality, this bill should be called the women's inequality  act.   The policies of H.R. 5 have already been used to trample female  athletics, eliminate safe spaces for women, harm children, terminate  parental rights, and undermine the free exercise of religious freedom.   The legislation also provides for a universal right to abortion,  compromises taxpayers' safeguards against funding abortion, and  eliminates conscious protections for healthcare providers that do not  want to participate in an abortion.   As a former track coach, I am deeply committed to providing women and  girls with a level playing field. Title IX, however, becomes irrelevant  under the women's inequality act.   Vulnerable women seeking haven in homeless women's shelters will be  revictimized under H.R. 5. This is already happening.   In California, women who were sexually harassed in the shower by a  biological male were threatened with expulsion from the women's  shelter.   In Alaska, a women's shelter is being sued for sending a  transitioning individual to the hospital instead of letting him sleep 3  feet away from rape victims.   This is absurd. Under H.R. 5, women-only spaces will be a thing of  the past.   This bill also places children at risk of medical experimentation and  bleak futures when they are given the right to hormone blockers and sex  change operations.                                time  1300    Most children, 98 percent of boys and 88 percent of girls, who  question their gender identity will grow into their birth gender after  passing through puberty.   Parents who dare to oppose doctors using off-label drugs that may  sterilize their child, or performing life-altering surgical procedures,  will be considered abusive and neglectful. This has already happened  with an Ohio couple who lost custody of their daughter.   For the first time ever, H.R. 5 waives the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act, enabling unhindered government discrimination against  the faith community. It also actively prohibits the religious community  from partnering with the Federal Government.   Catholic schools will no longer be able to participate in the  National School Lunch Program. Jewish synagogues will lose Federal  grant funding to protect against terror threats, and houses of worship  will lose FEMA disaster aid unless--here is the catch--they abandon  their core teachings on morality, marriage, and sexuality.    Madam Speaker, Members from both sides of the aisle,  [[Page H3806]]  especially those who claim to be pro-women and pro-children, need to  stop this devastating legislation.   The future of women's rights, privacy, protection, and athletic  potential depends on it.
