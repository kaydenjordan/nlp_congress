 Mr. President, I rise to speak on a topic I have often  spoken about on the floor.   We have been at continuous war since September 14, 2001, when  Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force to go after  the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. That was 16 years, 1 month, and  18 days ago as of today.   The war in Afghanistan is the longest armed conflict in America's  history, and it shows no signs of abating, even 6 years after the death  of Osama bin Laden. The conflict has been going on for so long that  many are somewhat immune to it. I heard a high schooler recently say:  War is all I have ever known. It is the status quo. It is the  background music to daily life.   Yet only 0.4 percent of the population of the United States serves in  the military. That is down from 1.8 percent in 1968 and 8.7 percent in  1945, so it is increasingly unlikely that many of us even know those  who are deployed and fighting in this ever-expanding global conflict.   Sadly, last week, for tragic reasons, these issues were brought to  the forefront with the death of four brave American servicemembers in  Niger: Army SGT La David Johnson, SGT Bryan Black, SGT Jeremiah  Johnson, and SGT Dustin Wright.   Two of those killed--the two Sergeants Johnson--were part of a 12-man  patrol whose mission is not clear. We know that their trained military  occupational specialties--vehicle mechanic and chemical-biological  specialist--were outside traditional combat roles.   In a June war powers letter, the Department of Defense described the  mission of over 645 military personnel in Niger as ``advise and  assist,'' but none of the varying accounts of what took place in early  October seem to support that seemingly benign summary of what occurred.   Frustration over this lack of understanding of that mission and the  events that transpired were shared by everyone from Secretary Mattis to  all the Members here. I can't imagine what the servicemembers on duty  and their families must be feeling. We see the strain that an ever- expanding operational commitment is having on our  [[Page S6895]]  military, from our servicemembers relying upon foreign countries or  contractors to provide critical air support where servicemen are  stranded on the battlefield for over a day, to our warships, for which  schedules have been so strained that their crews are unable to safely  navigate international waters.   Being a Senator from Virginia, a State with one of the largest  military presences that is home to tens of thousands of servicemembers  and their families, I have a personal responsibility to ensure that  these strains don't lead to any more tragic mistakes.   The attack in Niger has also laid bare other issues: how little  information is provided to Congress about U.S. troops deployed abroad  equipped for combat; how little Congress exercises the authority and  oversight of these issues and demands information to debate before the  public; and the possible ``mission creep'' and growth of military  forces in Africa--an increase by a factor of 17 over the past decade-- in which hundreds of missions are being run daily in over 20 countries  where there is no specific authorization for use of military force  provided by Congress. The Niger operation really identified a gray area  between advising and assisting in combat operations, which keeps some  deployments just beyond the tripwire of requiring congressional  notification.   SASC held a briefing last week with the Department of Defense to try  to understand the scope of the Niger mission, the reason for the  escalation of our footprint, and why this surprising attack left our  troops without support for so long.   But beyond the immediate tactical answers, we need a strategic and  fundamental understanding of how and where this country engages in  military operations and if the war on terror has become the ``forever  war'' with ever-changing objectives and no end in sight, absolving the  need for Congress to weigh in and speak.   Yesterday, in Foreign Relations, we held a much overdue hearing on  legal authorization for military force. We heard solid testimony and  straightforward answers by Secretaries of State Tillerson and Mattis. I  am encouraged that we had the hearing, and I am encouraged that our  chair, at the end of the hearing, expressed the desire to move forward  to finally, after 16-plus years, engage in a debate and a congressional  vote on war authorization.   I was disappointed that the two Secretaries, who were being candid,  took the position that the Trump administration needs no more legal  authority to do what they are doing. But I have to acknowledge the  position they take is actually the position that the Obama  administration took, and it is exactly the position that the Bush  administration took, so I was not completely surprised. In fact, we  shouldn't be surprised when the administration says: We don't need any  more authority. But of course, we are not playing ``Mother May I'' on  this question. It is Congress's role, pursuant to article I, to declare  war.   I disagree with the legal analyses offered by all three  administrations. I was tough on President Obama about this, as well,  that the 60-word authorization from 2001 covers military action all  over the globe. But there is some legal dispute about the question,  still.   Beyond the legal question, there are also questions of moral  authority, political authority, and the abdication of responsibility in  this body. Seventy-five percent of the Members of Congress today were  not even here when the 2001 authorization was passed and, thus, have  never had to cast a vote on it, even as our men and women risk their  lives and, in some instances, are killed in action.   Simply put, the 2001 AUMF has become a golden ticket that justifies  U.S. military action against terrorist groups all over the globe  without the need for additional congressional approval. I am not  surprised the Executive wants to keep it that way. Who wouldn't prefer  such flexibility? But we have a job to do.   Here is what we need to do. This is what I think needs to happen. We  need to end the legal gymnastics with the 2001 AUMF--a 60-word  authorization against the perpetrators of 9/11. Applying that now to  the fight against ISIL, Boko Haram, and others is a stretch. The AUMF  outlines the focus of military action as follows: ``Nations,  organizations, or persons [the President] determines planned,  authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on  September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons.''   There were 19 hijackers for the 9/11 attacks, and we have now used  the 2001 AUMF in 37 instances to send forces prepared for combat and  engaged in combat to 14 nations, including Libya, Turkey, Georgia,  Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia,  Kenya, the Philippines, and Cuba.   Were all of these instances and nations and places really associated  with planning or support of the attacks of 9/11? These legal  interpretations are in addition to now countless ``train and advise''  missions around the world, to include those that took the lives of the  four servicemembers in Niger.   This was not an unforeseen combat environment. I found this  interesting. In April of 2014, the U.S. Government--the Department of  the Navy--solicited contractual bids for ``Personnel Recovery, Casualty  Evacuation, and Search and Rescue,'' aviation support in ``at risk''  environments in the following 14 countries: Algeria, Burkina Faso,  Chad, Libya, Mali, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire,  Ghana, Benin, Togo, Tunisia and as directed by operational  requirements. Only 5 of those 14 countries have ever been notified to  Congress, pursuant to war powers letters, but we are planning to engage  in casualty evacuation in connection with high-risk activities in all  of these countries in Africa.   I would like to have a process that informs Congress--and informs the  public--that is equal in transparency to what we put in contracting  documents to inform military contractors. So Senator Flake and I have  introduced an authorization for military force intended to keep the  Congress and the American people not only informed of our military  operations but also engaged in carrying out our constitutional duty.  The intent is to recognize the fluid environment in which our military  must operate to implement the counterterrorism campaign.   Terrorist organizations don't necessarily operate in just one  country. They don't follow Geneva Conventions. It is a different kind  of military action, but the requirement for congressional approval is  no less important. We need to make our legal authorities, which are now  dated, current and appropriately scoped.   I applaud my Foreign Relations chair, Senator Corker, who, after the  hearing yesterday, said that we would move to a markup and clearly, I  suspect, an amendment of the proposal Senator Flake and I have put on  the table. We have done a lot of work on it. A war authorization should  be bipartisan. If anything in this body should be bipartisan, I think a  war authorization should be. We don't pretend that we have thought of  everything; we don't pretend that the bill cannot be improved.   In conclusion, I want to make a few comments. This week, the New York  Times reported that President Trump has approved--without providing  Members of Congress any information on why these changes are  necessary--changes giving the Department of Defense and the CIA more  latitude in pursuing ``counterterrorism drone strikes and commando  raids'' against Islamic terrorist groups scattered across the world,  all while using the 2001 AUMF as its legal justification. This  expansion of war will only continue to magnify and mutate and will do  so without public scrutiny, unless and until Congress steps up to  provide the oversight and legal authority we are required to do.   I have come to the floor of the Senate since I came here in 2013 to  speak about war powers, to speak about a need to revise the War Powers  Resolution of 1974, to critique and challenge President Obama around  the Libya mission, which had no vote from Congress, and to critique  President Obama--who is a personal friend--over the offensive campaign  against ISIL without requiring a congressional vote. Since I was clear  and repetitive in my critiques of President Obama for using war powers  without Congress being involved, I am going to do the same with respect  to President Trump.  [[Page S6896]]    At the end of the day, my critique is more about this body. An  Executive will overreach. An Executive will act, but that does not  excuse inaction in this body.   I do worry about a progressive loosening of the rules from the Bush  administration to the Obama administration to the Trump administration,  which eventually has turned the 2001 AUMF into a golden ticket that  allows for action against nonstate terrorist groups anywhere in the  world on a Presidential say-so.   We shouldn't take our institutions and, frankly, the fairly radical  rebalancing of powers in the Constitution for granted. When Madison and  the other drafters put the declaration of war authority in the hands of  Congress, they knew they were doing something pretty radical. They knew  the world of the day--1787, 230 years ago last month--was a world of  Kings, Emperors, Monarchs, Sultans, and Popes. War was primarily for  the Executive, but they decided they wanted to do something different.  Ten years after the Constitution was done, Thomas Jefferson, as  President, was grappling with a nonstate terrorist group in Northern  Africa--the Barbary Coast pirates--and what could be done about them?  He wrote a letter to James Madison and asked what was behind the war- making powers in the Constitution's article I. Madison described it  very well. He said: Our constitution supposes what the history of all  governments demonstrates, that it is the Executive most interested in  war and, thus, most prone to war. For this reason, we, with studied  care, granted the question of war in the legislature.   They were trying to change human history. They were trying to say  that we shouldn't be at war unless there was a legislative, collective  judgment--not 116 years ago by 25 percent of the people who were there  then, but a legislative, collective judgment expressed in an  authorization that we should be in war. We are lacking that now.   It is not hard to imagine a future President, whether it is President  Trump in the remainder of his term or Presidents in the future, using  the expanding war authorities to increasingly justify initiating war  without the permission of Congress.   We asked President Trump for the legal authority justifying the  Syrian missile strike on Syria that he made in March, and they have not  yet provided an answer about their legal authority. What Congress has  done is basically told Presidents: You can do whatever you want. That  has a way of creeping and growing, and I think it already has. I think  the American people deserve better, but, especially, our troops deserve  better.   I have said it before; I will say it again. I can't think of anything  more publicly immoral--public, civic immorality--than ordering troops  to risk their lives and be killed, as the four were in Niger, while  Congress is unwilling to cast a vote because this would be a  politically difficult vote: I would rather not vote; I would rather  make the President do it and blame the President if it works out badly.  A political calculation has caused Congress to abdicate a  responsibility while others are shouldering the burdens of  responsibility--and even losing their lives in the process.   Finally, Senator Jacob Javits wrote a book in 1973 entitled ``Who  Makes War'' after Congress passed the War Powers Resolution during the  Vietnam war. He offered a very prescient commentary. I will close here:         Many advocates of presidential prerogative in the field of       war and foreign policy seem to be arguing that the       President's powers as Commander in Chief are what the       President alone defines them to be. The implication that the       Presidency is beyond the range of congressional authority to       check in the exercise of the war powers raises a serious       constitutional danger. If we accept such a view we accept a       situation in which the American people are dependent solely       on the benign intent and good judgment of the incumbent       President. We may not always be fortunate enough to see a       person with such qualities in the White House.    With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
