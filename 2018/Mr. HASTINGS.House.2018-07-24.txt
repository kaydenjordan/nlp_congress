 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to debate this rule, but I would urge my  colleague from Texas to be mindful that this ain't going nowhere, so we  really are, when all is said and done, wasting our time. This is not  likely to be taken up by the Senate in August, and why we are not doing  other things, I simply cannot understand.   The Protect Medical Innovation Act and the Increasing Access to Lower  Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act are worth  considering. The gentleman from Texas certainly is an expert in this  area and is most sincere. It is regrettable that the legislation,  ultimately, that will pass the House of Representatives ain't going  nowhere.   Taken together, these measures do nothing to ameliorate the  Republican attempt to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, do nothing to  curb rising drug costs, and do nothing to curtail skyrocketing premium  hikes. Instead, H.R. 6311 continues the Republican majority's  destructive path of undermining and destabilizing our health insurance  markets.   This package of six bills will likely lead to fewer choices and  competition for moderate- and low-income families who do not have the  disposable income to pay premium costs up front.   In bringing up the second measure, H.R. 184, my friends across the  aisle seem intent on ignoring the pressing issues facing our country,  like passing sensible legislation that will address the country's  ongoing gun violence epidemic, passing legislation that will protect  our election infrastructure from hostile foreign hacking, or passing  legislation that will help reunite the more than 2,500 separated  children with their families. Rather, the Republican majority wants to  waste valuable legislative time in repealing a tax that won't even be  active until 2020.   This is the last week before we go on a 5-week recess and we are  doing nothing. Even worse, these bills are not offset and, taken  together with tomorrow's bills, will add up to $90 billion to our  deficit. They are not paid for. And I challenge my colleague on the  floor handling this rule to tell me where the pay-fors are and, if  there are none, why are they not paid for--$90 billion.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that the epidemic of gun violence  that plagues our communities must be addressed in a comprehensive  manner and without further delay. Unfortunately, our Nation has  witnessed far too many senseless deaths caused each day by firearms,  and that continues to rise.   Under a Republican majority, many commonsense reforms, such as the  assault weapons ban--and somebody please tell me why anyone other than  the military and law enforcement needs an assault weapon; I just, for  the life of me, cannot understand it--were allowed to expire. I might  add, flood insurance is getting ready to expire. We are not taking that  measure up.   Providing nearly unfettered access to a variety of firearms does not  make any sense. Someone said to me, well, there are 103 kinds of  automatic weapons; and I say ban them all because they don't have any  business in the hands of people in the streets at all.   While we need to preserve the rights of responsible gun owners--and I  am one of them; I believe in the Second Amendment--we must focus more  of our attention and efforts on keeping weapons out of the hands of  dangerous individuals instead of attacking and undermining the  healthcare for millions of hardworking Americans.   While the present administration works to further the majority's aim  of dismantling the most popular aspects of the Affordable Care Act,  like keeping children on their parents' health insurance until the age  of 26 and protecting people with preexisting conditions, these bills  continue to balloon Federal spending and deficits.   While we were promised increased revenue from the GOP tax cuts of  2017, with the GOP falling back on tired talking points like tax cuts  paying for themselves, we now have the Congressional Budget Office  projecting over $1 trillion in budget deficits in 2020, even before  legislation like this passes.   Whatever happened to the conservative Republicans? Where did the  fiscal conservative Republicans go, who are blowing up the deficit in  this country? The amount of fiscal irresponsibility demonstrated by my  friends across the aisle is shocking and will be a great detriment to  all Americans in the future.   Moreover, these pieces of legislation do nothing to holistically  solve the most pressing concerns hardworking Americans have with  healthcare: ever-increasing premiums, unstable health markets, and  exploding drug costs. In fact, in the last year and a half, the  majority has gone out of their way to destabilize health markets as  much as they can.   Instead of encouraging Americans to enroll in health insurance, the  Department of Health and Human Services has created an advertising  campaign explicitly undermining the individual insurance markets  created under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have cut the  Department's budget for those grassroots organizations whose sole  purpose is to assist folks in signing up for health insurance. How much  of the budget did they cut? 92 percent.   In addition to this, HHS has threatened States that try to lower  premiums, and the Trump administration has even canceled cost-sharing  reduction payments to insurers, which the CBO projects will leave 1  million more people uninsured, raise premiums by 20 to 25 percent over  the next 2 years, and increase the Federal deficit by $200 billion.   Listen, people, when we started this business of the Affordable Care  Act--as much as my friends on the other side who have the prerogative,  in the majority, to be in disagreement with this measure as well as any  others and to offer this thing that ain't going nowhere here today--the  simple fact of the matter is, some few years back, we had 42 million  Americans who were uninsured. We now have more than 42 million  Americans uninsured, and that is wrong.   I said yesterday in the Rules Committee, all of us, 535--the Senate  and the House--and the six delegates, ought to be locked up up here  until we come up with a sensible solution for the American people with  reference to a crisis.   It was said yesterday by the chair of this committee that the plan  that is going to be offered--that we did offer and then they voted  against--would be the best healthcare plan in the world. Well, it ain't  the best healthcare plan  [[Page H7098]]  in the world. The best healthcare plans in the world are in Denmark,  Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, and a whole bunch of other places other  than America.   And while the Trump administration has pushed junk healthcare plans,  even the organizations that originally lobbied the administration for  access to these plans now say they no longer want to use them.   All in all, as a result of these policies, as I have indicated, 4  million fewer Americans have health insurance than when Donald John  Trump took office, and healthcare costs continue to rise unabated.   I need not remind my colleagues that people in the United States pay  far more for healthcare than in any other industrialized nation on  Earth, and, in most cases, they get far less. We spend over 18 percent  of our gross domestic product on healthcare, compared to most other  countries, which spend less than 10 percent, with much of the disparity  occurring thanks to higher drug prices and administrative overhead.                                time  1245    Despite the money we pour into our healthcare, the United States has  the shortest life expectancy and highest infant mortality of any modern  industrialized nation--let me repeat that--the shortest life  expectancy, and the highest infant mortality of any modern  industrialized nation.   We have far fewer physicians--and we had better do something about  that; not in this measure, not in the Affordable Healthcare Act. We had  better get busy trying to figure out how to provide more physicians,  more nurses, more research for a variety of measures that are oncoming  that our Nation is going to be confronted with.   We have fewer hospital beds and, in perhaps what is the most  depressing statistic of all of U.S. healthcare, the United States is  one of only 13 countries in the world where the rate of maternal  mortality, defined as the death of a mother in the year after she gives  birth, is now worse than it was 25 years ago.   And here we are, continuing to jaw jack about something that ain't  going nowhere, and we have situations in our country that all of us  know something about, all of us care about. There is no Republican in  the House or Democrat in the House that doesn't care about their  constituents and their healthcare. And at the very same time, what we  are winding up doing is arguing with each other and nothing is getting  done, and that is just dead wrong for this country.   Black women, in particular, are three times more likely to die from  health-related issues to their pregnancy. How can we seemingly pay for  more healthcare now than at any point in our Nation's history and, yet,  at the same time, be getting worse care than we were decades ago?   We have a fundamentally broken system. The majority doesn't seem to  have any way of fixing it, and I am not even sure that they want to fix  it. Indeed, they seem to be going out of their way making it somehow  worse.   Now I hear all of the voices out there. I had a constituent call the  other day to tell me that I wasn't as liberal as his people were,  liberal, and that I didn't understand this whole healthcare system.   And I told him: Listen, man, in 1992, when I ran for office, I ran on  the premise of universal healthcare for every American, period. And  when we did the Affordable Healthcare Act, it ultimately got called the  ObamaCare Act.   I have said in the Rules Committee repeatedly, it probably should  have been called the Hastings/ObamaCare Act, or perhaps we would have  done what Dr. Burgess asked us to do and it would be called the Burgess  Healthcare Act.   I don't care what it is called. It needs to be called something that  is going to help every American, and not just a handful, and certainly  not the richest people in this country who don't even need any  healthcare. They have been at the socialized healthcare business for  all of their lives and, therefore, people like Donald John Trump don't  need to worry about this kind of thing.   It is those people that are vulnerable. It is those people on  Medicaid in Florida and other States that didn't expand Medicaid,  900,000 of them in my State, that are left to the mercies of the  system.   And what do they do? All of us know what they do. When they have  healthcare, they go to the hospital, to the emergency room, generally  speaking, they are treated, and then those taxpayers in those  respective jurisdictions wind up paying for it.   So why don't we get our act together and try to do something about it  now?   I have proudly advocated for multiple pieces of legislation that will  improve and strengthen the Medicare system, including H.R. 676, the  Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which will provide all  individuals residing in the United States and the United States  territories, with affordable healthcare, including that which is  medically most necessary, such as primary and preventative care,  dietary and nutritional therapies, prescription drugs, emergency care,  long-term care, mental health services, dental services, and vision  care. Underscore preventative care. And if we did more in that arena,  we wouldn't have as much of a problem as we do today.   Medicare for All will save taxpayers hundreds of dollars a month.  Now, I firmly believe that we must focus priorities in the interest of  the American people to ensure that our citizens have continued access  to healthcare services.   So when we come back here in September, when we finish all of our  fighting in November, and we have somebody that is going to get  elected, 435 of us will return here and be sworn in in January. Let's  all make a commitment that we are going to work together, together, to  get all of the resources, the tremendous minds, the incredible staffs  that work here in this institution together, and try to make sure that  we do the right thing by the American people and pass a measure that  will cause everyone to have affordable care.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule that would change the rules of the House to  prevent any legislation from being considered that would reduce the  guaranteed benefits for individuals enrolled in either Medicare or  Medicaid programs.   I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the  Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote  on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and  defeat  [[Page H7099]]  the previous question so that we may protect these critical programs  for this generation and the next.   Mr. Speaker, I would be prepared now to advise my colleague from  Texas that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close when,  and if, he is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, this place, the people's House, should be  about approaching our congressional responsibilities and daily  activities in a manner that is fair and respectful to all Americans; in  a manner where the appropriate committee of jurisdiction holds hearings  and markups; in a manner where experts in the field are respected and  consulted; in a manner where Members of both political parties have the  ability to offer amendments and debate the contents of bills that come  to the House floor.   Unfortunately, in this historically closed-off, Republican run House,  that is not the case. And let me make it very clear. Even though in the  Ways and Means and the Appropriations Committee, as a matter of  practice, we allow for closed rules, we now have, with these three  rules that are likely to be finished today, we have 95 closed rules.  This is 2018, and not in the history of the people's House has the  process been as closed.   When the Speaker of the House of Representatives began this session,  he indicated that it would be the most open session that we would have.  And yet, it is not the case.   I spoke earlier about immigration, and I saw this morning where the  majority leader has determined, even though having promised his own  conference that he would have a vote on immigration, he ain't gonna do  it.   Now, something is wrong with this process and it needs to be  corrected, and we can correct it going forward. We will make 100, and  then we will be historically referenced as the most closed Congress in  the history of the United States of America.   What we see are my friends across the aisle, bending over backwards  to reward a very specific and elite constituency. Week after week, the  powerful gun lobby is rewarded as Republican leadership refuses to  bring up even the most commonsense gun violence prevention legislation.   The next week, like today, the powerful medical insurance lobby  chalks up a win as this Republican-led Congress votes in favor of  special interests over the interests of hardworking Americans.   Some other people that make out like bandits that we never talk about  are the insurance companies. I could spend a whole hour talking about  how they are benefiting while we are about the business of tying each  other in knots with verbiage rather than with substantive legislation.   Mr. Speaker, while there is no quick fix to any of these measures,  not to gun violence, opioid addiction, the immigration problems, and  ongoing foreign cyber attacks on our election system's infrastructure,  we simply must engage in the complicated and difficult process of  improving our country's current policies.   I, as well as my colleagues on this side of the aisle, stand ready to  work with Members of Congress to bring commonsense legislation to the  floor that will benefit all Americans and not just the rarified few.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and a  ``no'' vote on the previous question. This measure we are debating here  today ain't going nowhere, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove my name  as a cosponsor of H.R. 2069, the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities  Act of 2017.
