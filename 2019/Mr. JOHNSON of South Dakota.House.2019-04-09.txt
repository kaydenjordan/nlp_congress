 Madam Speaker, I am honored to be a part  of this Special Order tonight.   I want to highlight the dire situation in my home State of South  Dakota. Our State is just barely beginning to recover from dramatic  flooding while, simultaneously, we are trying to prepare for the  disaster to get worse as a blizzard this week will dump freezing rain  and more than a foot of snow onto already saturated ground.   Now, I have heard colleagues talk about similar and, in some cases,  even more dramatic damage to their homes, and we have seen, in their  States and in mine, commerce interrupted; we have seen livelihoods  devastated; we have seen cattle killed; and, worse yet, we have seen  human life lost.   Now, within South Dakota, there have been many impacted communities,  although perhaps none more dramatically than Indian Country. When I  have talked to President Bear Runner, Pine Ridge; President Bordeaux,  Rosebud; or Chairman Frazier from Cheyenne River, their texts, their  phone calls, our face-to-face meetings, they are heavy with the  frustration and the exhaustion, the irritation, the concern about what  is going on for their people. Madam Speaker, put more appropriately,  they are concerned for what is going on with our people.   Right before I walked onto the floor here, I came from a meeting with  Chairman Harold Frazier, and he had picture after picture after  picture, Madam Speaker, of the devastation there at Cheyenne River:  cemeteries under water, roads under water, cattle under water, cars  under water.   I know South Dakota is not the only community that is impacted. Many  of us need a helping hand. Many of the people in our States are too  proud to ask for a helping hand, but tonight I would just ask my  colleagues in this body and my colleagues in the Senate to do  everything they can to put politics aside and to pass a disaster relief  bill that can do much-needed work for our country.
