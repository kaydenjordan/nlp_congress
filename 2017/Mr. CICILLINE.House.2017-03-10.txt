 Mr. Speaker, right now Republicans are racing to pass  TrumpCare, legislation that repeals and replaces the Affordable Care  Act.   They are racing to pass it to because they know when the American  people find out what is in this bill, they won't support it.   But let me tell you what TrumpCare does, Mr. Speaker.   It gives huge tax cuts to insurance companies and the top 1 percent.   It allows insurance companies to raise premiums by 25 percent for  older Americans.   It eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, denying millions of  women critical care.   It cuts lifesaving support for the most vulnerable: children,  Americans with disabilities, the frail elderly, and nursing home  residents.   And it slashes funding for Medicaid.   TrumpCare is a great deal for the wealthy. TrumpCare is a great deal  for insurance companies and drug companies. It is a raw deal for  everyone else.   Millions will lose healthcare coverage. And let's be clear, people  are going to die when this happens. Millions more will end up paying  for more lower quality care, and Republicans don't even have a plan to  pay for their proposal.   After 7 years, this is it. This is the best they have got: tax cuts  for the rich and bad health care for everyone else.   Working families deserve better.                            ____________________
