 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    A few months ago, from this desk, I talked about the  results of a recall election in San Francisco. In February, a  multilingual, multiethnic coalition in San Francisco stood up for  common sense and rejected three members of the far-left school board  who had prioritized woke lunacy over the basics of education.   Well, last week, these same fed-up citizens provided a sequel. Even  the deep-blue Bay area decided they had had enough--enough--with their  radical-left district attorney--a prosecutor in name only--who had  become nationally famous for running a soft-on-crime experiment.   As deaths from drug overdoses skyrocketed, his office chose to almost  entirely stop prosecuting drug dealing. Burglaries shot up 50 percent.  Chain stores had to close locations because of rampant shoplifting. One  person who had been arrested five times in 6 months in 2020 was let out  every time--every single time--until he killed two women with a stolen  car. Liberals actually bragged about how they had cut down  incarceration rates, even as disorder swallowed up more and more of the  city.   The citizens were fed up--fed up--with being the far-left's guinea  pigs. They flocked to the ballot box, and they voted for change.   This phenomenon is not only playing out in San Francisco, it is  nationwide--nationwide. For years, the far left has zeroed in on local  prosecutors and district attorneys as juicy opportunities to make  America radically softer on crime.  [[Page S2921]]    According to recent news reports, for example, one far-left  billionaire donated more than $1 million each to the political  campaigns of soft-on-crime prosecutors in Chicago, New York, Los  Angeles, and Philadelphia. According to one group's analysis, the army  of soft-on-crime prosecutors supported by this one donor--this one  donor--and his networks oversees as much as 20 percent of the Nation's  entire population.   Once in office, many of these prosecutors set about abusing their  authority by basically unilaterally decriminalizing various crimes that  neither voters nor legislators have actually decriminalized in reality.  As the attorney general of Virginia put it recently, ``Instead of  trying to change the law . . . these groups are electing prosecutors  who simply ignore it.''   As this liberal campaign has been playing out at the State and local  level, we have seen violent crime surge all across the country. Here  are just a few recent news reports.   From Minnesota: ``Robberies, assaults, and gun crimes are causing  waves of anxiety and fear among suburban residents across the Twin  Cities.''   From Colorado: ``Since the beginning of the pandemic . . . murders  had gone up 47 percent, some types of property crime had nearly  doubled, and [the] seizures of fentanyl and methamphetamine had  quadrupled'' in just the last year.   Atlanta ``saw a 30-year record in homicides last year [in 2021],''  and 2022 has been looking actually even worse. At least as of a few  months ago, both murders and rapes were way ahead of even that 2021  pace.   Residents of Phoenix who try to use public transit to escape soaring  gas prices have found out that ``assaults and drug crime in and around  public transportation have risen over the last five years.''   Philadelphia is reporting an 80-percent increase in assaults aboard  buses.   In my hometown of Louisville, we are struggling as well. ``Over the  past several years, violent crime has sharply risen across the city,  breaking gruesome records including record homicides and assaults.''  And we have seen carjacking ``more than triple in the [last] five  years.'' Last weekend alone--last weekend alone--Louisville saw 3  homicides and 10 nonfatal shootings. Five teenagers and a 9-year-old  were shot during a single altercation at my hometown's Big Four Bridge.  Violent criminals turned a popular attraction for families and tourists  into a literal war zone.   Stable prices, border security, and public safety are three of the  most basic deliverables that any government owes to its citizens-- strike one, strike two, and strike three for Democrats at the Federal,  State, and local level.   That explains one last headline I will mention this morning:  ``Americans are more worried about crime than at any other time this  century.''                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, now on a different matter, the latest news from  Ukraine confirms that our friends need more robust weaponry, and they  need it fast.   ``Outgunned Ukraine Needs More Weapons Fast as Russia Advances,  Officials Say.''   ``Ukraine Pleads for Weapons, Saying Russia Has Much More  Artillery.''   The people of Ukraine have inspired the world with their resilience,  but resisting Russian aggression takes reliable supplies of lethal  force.   As the Biden administration continues to provide shipments and prod  our allies, they must adopt the kind of strong and positive posture  that has eluded them at earlier points in the conflict.   As early as last November, I was urging sanctions for deterrence and  pushing for NDAA provisions to send enhanced lethal aid last November.  Throughout December and January, I urged the President to bolster  NATO's eastern flank with more U.S. forces and get more weapons to  Ukrainian forces before--before--Russia attacked. In February, I called  on President Biden to anticipate Russian manipulation of the energy  markets and back off his own holy war against domestic American  production. But for months, the Biden administration seemed mute,  seemed actually more focused on deterring itself than deterring Putin-- too much hesitation, too much hemming and hawing, too little preventive  action in advance.   The United States cannot make the same mistakes again with prolonged  dithering over whether to provide longer range or more powerful  weapons. That is where we are now. It is time to get Ukraine what it  needs to finish this fight, including artillery and long-range rockets,  and strongly and firmly push our European allies to do the same. The  wealthiest European countries need to move fast to do their part--no  more hesitation, and quit making excuses.   This war has carried terrible human costs for the Ukrainian people.  We cannot bring back the thousands who have been lost, but with strong  assistance, we can help Ukraine limit future losses, reduce the risk of  greater conflict, and create a deterring precedent for other would-be  aggressors, like China.   There is another area where the Ukraine crisis has showcased the need  to take decisive action quickly while there is still time. That is with  respect to our own defense industrial base and our supplies of critical  arms.   Equipping Ukraine has seriously depleted our own stockpiles of  Javelins and Stingers. According to the Secretary of the Army, the U.S.  military has ``taken some risk to our own readiness.'' This sounds  exactly like the sort of situation that prompted the creation of the  Defense Production Act, but thus far, we have heard far more from  Washington Democrats about using the DPA to fast-track green energy  boondoggles than to expand production capacity for critical weapons and  munitions.   Our allies and our partners are interested in buying American  military technology. This should be a win-win: allies spending their  own money to strengthen themselves by buying American and making our  militaries more interoperable in the process. But too often, our  partners are hamstrung by American constraints on the process, like the  heel-dragging bureaucracy that runs our military sales, and lagging  production schedules.   We must adequately stockpile weapons and munitions for our own  military and have sufficient supplies and production capacity to arm  our friends, and we need to do this before it is too late.   Building up our own stores and upgrading our allies' is the best way  we can avoid nightmare scenarios down the road where America could be  forced into a terrible choice between committing U.S. troops to a  conflict or doing nothing. The remedy is to help our allies upgrade  their military capabilities in advance.   Of course, this takes money. All the serious preparations and  military modernization that it will take to compete with Russia and  China require resources. Tomorrow, the Armed Services Committee will  mark up the National Defense Authorization Act. This is a key  opportunity to show that both parties are serious about the real growth  in defense spending that it will take to keep us on the cutting edge.   The Biden administration's defense budget request was woefully  insufficient. The President has proposed a real-dollar cut for defense  spending after President Biden's own inflation.   Our colleagues on the committee must help Congress to deliver an NDAA  that provides for real, robust growth above inflation so that we can  modernize our forces, ensure adequate inventories of critical weapons  and munitions, and keep America safe.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
