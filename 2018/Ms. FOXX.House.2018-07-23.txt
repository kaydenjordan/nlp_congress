 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 184, the Protect  Medical Innovation Act.   Many medical device manufacturers in North Carolina's Fifth District  have reported how the medical device excise tax hinders medical  innovation, costs jobs, decreases research and development, and slows  capital expansion.   A fundamentally flawed policy enacted under ObamaCare, the medical  [[Page H6637]]  device excise tax was intended to spare taxpayers healthcare costs.  Instead, it burdens those taxpayers, and innovators are the backbone of  our economy.   According to the Tax Foundation, the medical device tax cost  approximately 21,800 jobs from 2013 to 2015. Furthermore, the tax is  hidden from consumers at purchase and passed off to them in higher  prices.   Congress has suspended this tax twice before, and as an original  cosponsor of this legislation, I urge my colleagues to vote for its  permanent repeal with the Protect Medical Innovation Act this week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Walters, and I  appreciate her leading this Special Order tonight to bring to the  attention of the American people the fact that they are better off now  than they were 2 years ago. This is an important message for us to  share with the American people. Many of us are doing it individually,  but we appreciate the gentlewoman's leadership on this.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, House Republicans promised to replace our  broken Tax Code and rein in the runaway administrative state that  stifled our economy and made it harder for businesses to create jobs  and grow.   We proposed a better way to grow the economy with solutions for  hardworking Americans who were being chewed up by our system and  struggling to get by. This Congress, we have delivered on our promises,  and I am pleased to say that North Carolinians are better off now.   We passed the most significant tax reform in over 30 years, and  everyday Americans are already reaping the benefits. According to the  Tax Foundation, the average increase in take-home pay for a family of  four in the Fifth District is $1,843. I would like to say that again,  Mr. Speaker: $1,843. Those are hard-earned wages being kept in  paychecks and not sent to Washington to finance inefficient government  bureaucracy.   Speaking of bureaucracy, Mr. Speaker, this Congress has also enacted  historic regulatory relief, with 16 Congressional Review Act  resolutions becoming law. Five of those resolutions came out of the  House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which I chair, and I  was able to get a sixth enacted that I sponsored that came through  another committee.    We have rolled back some of the most burdensome Obama-era regulations  concocted by Washington bureaucrats who thought they knew better than  American farmers and business owners. But Republicans did not agree  with them.   North Carolina's economy is evidence that Republicans' policies are  working for the American people. Just compare the North Carolina  Department of Commerce's figures from June of last year to this year  and you will see that our State now stands 100,000 jobs ahead. There is  still work to be done, but thanks to tax and regulatory relief, North  Carolinians are better off now.   Again, I want to thank Congresswoman Mimi Walters for leading this  Special Order tonight, Mr. Speaker.
