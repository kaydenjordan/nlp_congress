 Madam Speaker, today, during Black History Month, I rise  to celebrate Rita Smith-Wade-El, a leader in my community of Lancaster.  Rita passed away last month, but her impact will be felt in our  community forever.   She was a fierce leader on social justice issues and racial equality  in our community. Her life can best be described as a life of service  and a life of compassion. She served as a lector, eucharistic minister,  and social justice  [[Page H2277]]  committee member. She was always trying to lighten the load for others  and lend a helping hand.   Rita saw those in need and recognized that if she had the power to  give, she would, and even if it wasn't in her power, she would try  anyway.   Rita was a longtime Millersville University professor of psychology  and African American studies and founded the school's African American  studies minor.   I am very happy to celebrate her life today. We will miss her in our  community, and we will miss her contributions to our community.                            ____________________
