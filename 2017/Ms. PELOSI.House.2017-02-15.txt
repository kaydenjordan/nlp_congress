 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her hard work on  this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, every American should be able to trust in the promise  that, after a life of hard work, a secure and dignified retirement will  be there for them. But today, that promise is at risk. Half of all  private sector employees in America, almost 60 million people, do not  have access to any type of employer-sponsored retirement plan.   It is a problem that Republicans should remember when they plan to  raise costs on seniors, when they work to slash Medicaid and they  destroy the sacred guarantee of Medicare.   Yet, once again, Republicans have come to this floor not with the  retirement security of hardworking families in mind, but with a greedy  Wall Street first agenda.   Under the Obama administration, the Department of Labor empowered the  States to create innovative solutions to the retirement savings crisis.  The gentleman is talking about--some of these savings didn't even exist  when we had the majority.   In States across the Nation, the great laboratories of our democracy  went to work just as they should. My State of California decided to  create something called Secure Choice, a State-run retirement plan that  allows employees to be auto-enrolled into an IRA if they work for a  business with five or more employees.   In doing so, California will give almost 7 million workers access to  retirement savings--no substitute for a pension or a 401(k), but a  vital step toward a greater retirement security. Other States have  stepped forward with their own plan, the gentlewoman's State of Oregon  being one of them: Oregon, California, Illinois, Washington State,  Connecticut.   The Republican measure targets workers' savings accounts in those  States and chills efforts to foster retirement savings accounts in some  20 other States. In some cities, including the city of our chair, Mr.  Crowley, New York City is attempting to move in that direction.   So today, instead of supporting States' innovation--this is a states'  rights bill to the party of states' rights--Republicans have decided  Wall Street's profits are more important than workers' retirement  savings.   This Republican resolution is opposed by the AARP, the National  Conference of State Legislatures, the AFL-CIO. In fact, the AARP letter  to Congress states, starts, as a matter of fact:         On behalf of hardworking Americans who struggle to save for       retirement, AARP urges you to vote against a Congressional       Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's       final rule on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States       for Non-Governmental Employees.''    And while Republicans race to do the bidding of their Wall Street  friends, they still have not lifted a finger to create more good-paying  jobs for hardworking Americans.                                time  1515    Let's just make a comparison. On Friday, it will be 4 weeks since  President Trump took office.   Let's go back 8 years to when President Obama took office. On January  20, 2009, President Obama stood on the steps of the Capitol and asked  for swift, bold action now to create good-paying jobs, to establish  education for the 21st century, and the list goes on for swift, bold  action now.   One week and one day later, the House passed the American Recovery  [[Page H1217]]  and Reinvestment Act. One week after that, the Senate passed the bill.  And on February 17, which would be Friday of this week, 4 weeks since  the inauguration of President Obama, President Obama signed into law  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created or saved  around 4 million jobs of the American people, stopping the loss of jobs  that existed in the Bush administration. That is something that is so  remarkable.   So where is the jobs bill from the Republicans? Wasn't this election  about jobs? Where is their jobs bill? Where is the infrastructure bill?   By the way, President Obama also passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay  Act even before the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. He also  signed the SCHIP program, which had bipartisan support in the Congress  and much more.   This do-nothing Congress, except do stuff for your friends who will  exploit the environment, clean air, clean water--you name it-- retirement savings, has done nothing.   As I said, within 4 weeks of the Obama administration, all those  bills had passed.   Today is February 15, and I ask my Republican colleagues: Where is  your jobs bill? Why do you have time for Wall Street's agenda, but no  plans to create jobs for hardworking Americans?   This is the people's House. We must do the people's business. You  must do a better job by the people we serve. When you are ready to do  that, we look forward to working with you in that regard.   I join the AARP in urging a ``no'' vote on this ill-advised CRA.
