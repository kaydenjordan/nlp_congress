 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 149) directing the Clerk of the  House of Representatives to make certain corrections in the enrollment  of H.R. 4174.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 149         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That in the enrollment of the bill H.R. 4174,       the Clerk of the House of Representatives shall make the       following corrections:        (1) Page 2, beginning line 13, strike ``has the meaning       given the term `Executive agency' under section 105'' and       insert ``means an agency referred to under section 901(b) of       title 31''.        (2) Page 19, line 13, insert ``for data that does not       concern monetary policy'' after ``open data plan''.        (3) Page 32, beginning line 6, strike ``career'' and all       that follows through ``title 5)'' and insert ``nonpolitical       appointee employee''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this concurrent resolution would correct the enrollment  of H.R. 4174, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act,  sponsored by Speaker Ryan. This important resolution has bipartisan  support. I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
