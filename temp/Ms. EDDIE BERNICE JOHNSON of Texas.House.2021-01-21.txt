 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 335, a bill to provide Ret. General Lloyd Austin  an exception to a limitation against appointments of persons as United  States Secretary of Defense within seven years of relief from active  duty as a regular commissioned officer of the Armed Forces.   It is incumbent upon Congress to consider a waiver for such persons  who are deemed not far enough removed from active duty to head the  Department of Defense. Previous exemptions through a waiver have only  been granted twice in our nation's history, most recently in 2017.  However, my colleagues and I in the Congressional Black Caucus find it  altogether fitting and proper that Ret. General Lloyd Austin is the  recipient of the third.   Ret. General Austin is an experienced leader, a brilliant strategist,  and a decorated hero. He has seen war from the frontlines as a soldier,  and from afar as a commander. He is not one that seeks the spotlight or  controversy, but one who quietly, but confidently gets the job done-- earning him the nickname of ``invisible general.''   Mr. Speaker, as the first African American to hold the title of  Secretary of Defense, I am confident that Ret. General Austin would  carry out the mission of the Department of Defense with the utmost  sense of professionalism and civility. That is why I am proud to  support his waiver today and look forward to his swift confirmation in  the Senate.
