 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I will yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to speak on the bill included within this  rule, Senate amendment to H.R. 3404, the Respect for Marriage Act.   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, this bill previously came before the  House. Unfortunately, at the time, the legislation was a byproduct of a  very truncated process, having received no committee markup and being  parachuted from the Speaker's office straight to the floor.   In response to the rushed House process, the Senate actually  undertook a more comprehensive amendment process on the floor, giving  Senators the opportunity to amend the legislation, something we did not  have the opportunity to do. I am encouraged that the amended version  from the Senate has tried to address some of the religious liberty  concerns that myself and other Members have highlighted.   Even though I can report that this bill is much improved from its  original form, there are still problems with this legislation and its  possible implications for religious institutions and matters of  conscience.   It is regrettable that certain amendments that would safeguard  religious liberty, such as Senator Lee's and Congressman Roy's  amendments prohibiting the government from removing a nonprofit  organization's tax-exempt status based on religious beliefs, those were  all blocked.   Had those additional amendments received a fair hearing and as a  result been adopted, we could have made significant progress toward  addressing the very serious and legitimate concerns about the  consequences of this legislation and its potential curtailment of a  fundamental American right.   Today's bill, while a better product than before, should have been  better, and it is regrettable that we are at this point and this is the  case.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), a colleague and certainly a well-spoken member of the  House Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, if I could, I would inquire as to whether  or not the gentlewoman has additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Sessions), a former chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, if the  gentlewoman is prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   In closing, I would note that today's rule is, in fact, the product  of a very rushed legislative process. The bill should have been subject  to regular order so that it could be improved to address religious  liberty concerns noted by my fellow Members.   The very fact that we have had this discussion here on the floor to  me indicates that there is some ambiguity. I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy) and Chairman Sessions for coming and raising the  argument.   Section 6 of this bill provides protection of religious liberty, but  only if you are religious enough. If you are a church, you are  protected. If you are an individual or a school, you may not be, and  you may be subject to that private right of action.    What we are voting on today is emblematic of how this one-party  Democratic rule has been enforced in Washington, D.C., over the past 2  years. I am discouraged to see the majority is still focused on passing  partisan messaging bills which will not address the problems they  purportedly claim to want to solve.   This week, we are considering partisan bills instead of focusing our  efforts on things like funding the Federal Government, maybe even the  authorization for the Nation's defense, one of the requirements under  the Constitution that we fulfill.   Unfortunately, tonight, this is a continuation of a discouraging and  regrettable trend that I hope will be revisited by a new Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 217,  nays 204, not voting 10, as follows:                               [Roll No. 512]                                 YEAS--217       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.

The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated against:    Madam Speaker, he so quite correctly outlined some of  the difficulties facing Congress as we get to this end-of-the-year  crunch of legislation that has to pass before the end of the year.   There is no place where this is more pronounced than for our Nation's  doctors. The very people that we asked to get us through the pandemic,  the very people that we have asked to take care of us. And now we  arrive at the end of this Congress, and we say: Thank you for your  service, here is your pay cut. And they go: Wait, what? A paycheck.   The Surgeon General came to the Doctors Caucus earlier this year and  said he is concerned. He goes around and talks to doctors all over the  country, he is concerned about the level of burnout that he is seeing  in the Nation's physicians. He said he has never seen this before.    It really should not be a surprise. You work doctors and nurses day  and night during the pandemic, and then  [[Page H8814]]  you turn around and say, You know what, we don't value what you do. The  evidence for that is right as we barrel into the end of the year, there  are significant cuts to the physician fee schedule, sequesters, paygo,  budget neutrality requirements that in aggregate spell about an 8 to 9  percent reduction in payments for physicians.   For years, I fought to repeal the sustainable growth rate formula.  The sustainable growth rate formula was repealed in 2015. I thought,  hallelujah, we won't spend every December having to worry about how to  make our doctors whole because the formula has gone away.   But now through administrative actions and through budgetary  requirements, doctors are facing these pay cuts. So here we are in  another December trying to scramble together a doc fix so our doctors  can remain in practice.   But what makes this year so different and what makes this year so  devastating to the Nation's doctors is on top of the 8 to 9 percent  cuts in Medicare, they are facing 8 to 9 percent inflation. Nowhere  else in the Federal Government could you say, Hey, we are going to hold  you at level funding and not take into account the fact that the cost  of living adjustment--it would be a pay cut anywhere else.   Well, I will tell you this, it is a pay cut in your doctor's office,  and they are feeling it. The aggregate weight of these pay cuts is  going to be such that we will drive doctors out of practice. I hear  from docs all the time that they are going to have to close up shop.   What does that mean? It means further consolidation within the  healthcare industry. It means further hospital zoning physician  practices, private equity-only physician practices because we just  can't keep up with what the government is doing to us.   Now, there is a chance that something will happen before the end of  this year and stop these cuts before they are administered. But I will  tell you this, in the new Congress--in the next Congress--it is my  intention that we have to be very serious about tackling this problem  in our authorizing committees.   Madam Speaker, I am on the Committee of Energy and Commerce, I expect  that very early in the year we will be intentional about fixing this  problem because we can't find ourselves here in December of another  year where our docs are saying, We are at the end of our ropes, and we  just can't take it anymore.   This is a serious problem; it needs to be fixed. President Biden  would talk about, Hey, Republicans, they are going to cut your Social  Security and Medicare.   Well, Mr. President, you know who is cutting Medicare right now?   You are. It is your agency, and you won't stop it. Next Congress,  Republicans will.
