 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work and  accomplishments of my friend and former Congressman, Brad Ashford, who  passed away April 19, 2022. Brad began his career in politics by  faithfully serving in the Nebraska State legislature for 16 years,  focusing on ways to solve problems in education, labor, and urban  affairs.   After being elected to represent the Second Congressional District of  Nebraska, Brad worked hard to advance multiple bills in support of  veterans. He was a co-sponsor of the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of  2015, which helped veterans find sustainable employment and apply their  skills to work for Customs and Border Patrol. He also co-sponsored the  Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act of 2015, which allowed veterans with  a service-related disability to take an increased amount of time to  seek treatment and heal as needed.   Brad will most be remembered when people drive by the nearly 2-year- old Ambulatory Care Clinic at Omaha's VA Hospital. This facility,  funded through a public-private partnership, was largely the result of  Brad's efforts to craft and pass the CHIP In for Vets Act of 2016.   This innovative legislation was a first of its kind that enables the  use of Federal funds to be matched with privately raised donations.  Brad and I became friends after 2016 and we worked together to see the  project come to fruition. This past September, I was humbled to carry  on his legacy by passing the reauthorization of this important  legislation.   It was Brad's mission to ensure all constituents of the Nebraska  community felt well-represented. Throughout his tenure in Congress,  Brad consistently sought to reach across the aisle and advocate for  bipartisan legislation, highlighting that Representatives are not only  capable of working together, but must do so to advance our Nation, and  we do this regardless of ideology or political party.   He was a problem-solver and a man of action. Even after his time in  Congress, he continued to advocate and educate the public on justice- engaged youth, including our last project together finding pathways to  careers that could reintegrate them as productive members of our  community and reduce recidivism.   I salute and thank Brad for his leadership, mentorship, and  friendship. We went from being political adversaries to great friends.  It is my hope that we all carry on Brad's legacy of civility,  compassion, and cooperation. I personally will miss the optimistic and  hopeful conversations with my friend that we frequently enjoyed.   My heart goes out to his wife, Ann, his children; John, Ellie, and  Tom; his granddaughter, Rosie; and his many loved ones. We are  eternally grateful for all that Brad has done for our Nation.                                time  1030                     Honoring Nebraska Senator Tom Brewer     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Native American Heritage Month, I  rise to recognize the dedication and accomplishments of Senator Tom  Brewer, a veteran with 37 years of service, including six tours to  Afghanistan, two Purple Hearts, and a Bronze Star.   His experiences show resilience and true patriotism as he holds the  title of the first senator of Native American descent to serve in  Nebraska's unicameral. He was first elected in 2016 and represents the  13 counties of District 43 in the western Nebraska Sandhills.   Senator Tom Brewer is a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux and grew up  on the Pine Ridge Reservation before he enlisted in the Nebraska Army  National Guard. He attended college at Doane University in Crete on an  ROTC scholarship and continued to serve us internationally as he fought  on behalf of our freedoms in Afghanistan.   Although gravely wounded in his final tour, Senator Brewer did not  let this injury prevent him from fighting for his country through  public service. After serving nearly four decades, Senator Brewer  retired from the Army and was then elected to the Nebraska unicameral.   His inclusion represents how far we have come as a State, as well as  the ways that we as people can come together in the future to uphold  the proposition that all men are created equal.   Since his time in office, he has worked on legislation that improves  veterans' affairs and agriculture policy to help all Nebraskans.   Senator Brewer continues to advocate for farmers and ranchers,  servicemen and women, and fights to protect our constitutional rights.  He has just returned from 2 months in Ukraine doing humanitarian relief  in the Kharkiv region.  [[Page H7973]]    Though he has faced much adversity, he has managed to overcome it and  use his experiences to create new standards in Nebraska's government.  We thank him for his service and honor him for paving the way for all  Native Americans.                            ____________________
