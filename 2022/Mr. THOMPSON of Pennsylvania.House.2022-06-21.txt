 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the  distinguished career of Mr. Dale Moore as he celebrates his retirement  from the American Farm Bureau Federation. For 40 years, Dale has been  an instrumental leader in agriculture policy.   Dale earned his bachelor's degree in animal science from Fort Hays  State University. Dale then began his professional career as a  legislative assistant to former U.S. Congressman and Senator Pat  Roberts. Dale then transitioned to the House Committee on Agriculture  to serve as legislative director while Mr. Roberts was chairman.   After years of hard work on Capitol Hill, Dale served as executive  director of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Dale then became  the USDA's chief of staff for all four Secretaries under President  George W. Bush.   Dale has spent the last 11 years of his career with the American Farm  Bureau  [[Page H5720]]  Federation, serving as the executive director of public policy before  being appointed executive vice president in 2018.   Dale has maintained an exemplary reputation for decades. He will be  sincerely missed as he enters retirement, and his positive  contributions to agriculture policy will be remembered for many years.   Congratulations, Dale, on your successful career. Best wishes to you  in your next chapter.                            ____________________
