 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the  opportunity to come to the floor at this time.   I come to pay tribute to a person who is not easy to describe. As a  matter of fact, he has been called many things, has been many things,  and will always be many things. As a matter of fact, his name is  Richard Barnett. He held no title and he held no office. As a matter of  fact, he never ran for public office, to my knowledge. But he probably  helped more individuals get elected to judgeships in Cook County than  anybody in the history of the county.   As a matter of fact, he also happened to have been the manager of my  first campaign for public office which was about 40 years ago. After  the campaign was over, he went into the hospital. He had taken ill but  would not go into the hospital until after the election was done. He  finally did go after we had won, and he looked as though he only  weighed about 90 pounds which means that he was just that sick, he was  just that ill. But he bounced back and went back to work at his actual  job which was that of a postal clerk.  [[Page H235]]    He went back and worked until retirement. Then he became very  actively engaged in the election of Harold Washington for mayor of the  city of Chicago. He took a job and worked for the city until he quit  that after Harold had passed away, because he really was not looking  for a job or didn't want a job.   He became significantly important because we have all heard the term  political machine. We don't hear it as much now as we did in the past,  but political machines have been described in many different ways,  sometimes good, sometimes not so good, and sometimes bad.                                time  1545    One definition that people generally accept as being fairly common is  that a political machine is a political group in which an authoritative  leader or small group commands the support of a core of supporters and  businesses, usually campaign workers, who receive rewards for their  efforts. The machine is based on the ability of the boss or group to  get out the vote for their candidate on election day.   The term ``political machine'' dates back to the 20th century in the  United States. In the late 19th century, large cities in the United  States--Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York,  Philadelphia, St. Louis, and others--were accused of forming, building,  and making use of political machines.   Chicago, being one of those, emerged as one of the big cities with a  strong political machine. The machine was known to totally dominate and  control all the machinery of government, especially in the immigrant  and Black communities.   When I came to Chicago in 1961, Chicago was seriously segregated, as  it is today, and seriously politically organized, much more than it is  today. These were what was called the movement years.   This is the period when Dr. Martin Luther King came into Chicago.  This is the period when we experienced the War on Poverty, great  efforts to reduce and work on some of the issues plaguing individuals  who were at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale.   That was when I met Richard Barnett. He was part of a small group of  activists who felt and believed that the machine could be defeated.   Notables like Leon Despres, Richard Barnett, himself, and others  worked in ways to try to undercut the power and influence. People were  meeting a great deal in Chicago, and there were meetings all the time,  almost every day. We were young activists and would almost be looking  for meetings.   People would talk about everything. They talked about race issues.  They would talk about poverty. They would talk about the need for  programs. But very seldom would they talk about electoral politics.   Richard was one of the persons who would, and he kind of checked  people out at the meetings. When there was a campaign going on, he  might call you up.   I never will forget, he called me and asked me if I would be a poll  watcher. I said, what am I going to watch? Am I going to watch the  polls?   He said, well, that is not exactly what it means, because I really  did not know. I mean, I would go to the meetings and all.   He said: No, you are going to go and watch to make sure that the  election is fair.   And I am trying to figure out how in the world can I make sure that  an election is fair by watching the poll.   The next time he called, he says: Would you like to be a LEAP judge?   I said: Leap judge? Does that mean I am going to jump over somebody?   He laughed and said: Well, that is not quite exactly what that means  either. That means ``legal elections in all precincts,'' and we are  working to try to make sure that the elections are fair and that the  votes are accurate.   That was Richard. Richard always had a telephone book and a bunch of  names, and he was most effective with that.   I also say that it was him and some other folk who got me to run for  the city council. I had no intention of running, but I did agree to be  chairman of a committee to help find a candidate. But we couldn't find  anybody; nobody would run. We broke up the committee, and I ran into  the person we were going to run against. He started to do what we call  sell wolf tickets.   He says: You guys have been talking about what you are going to do to  me, and you can't even find a candidate.   I went home that evening and said to my wife: I think I am going to  run for the city council.   She said: Who, you?   I said: Well, yeah, me.   She said: You can't run for no city council. You are not even a  precinct captain.   And I said: Well, I didn't know you had to be one to run.   At any rate, I called Richard, and Richard said: Well, if you decide  you are going to run, I will help you.   That is exactly what he did, and he has been helping me ever since.  He has been helping me every time I run. He has been helping other  people every time they run. Never to my knowledge have I known him to  get 1 cent for working a campaign or working in anybody's campaign.   He became sort of an icon to those of us who believe in what we  called independent politics, meaning independent of bossism,  independent of not being able to make up your own mind and make your  own decisions.   I guess when I went to his funeral on Saturday, the individuals who  were there, they were just down the line, down the line. I think some  of what I experienced with Richard, I am sure that you experienced some  of it also.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted that Mr. Rush came over to join me as  we talk about this community icon from our city. I might also add that  Bobby's district was the first district that an African American won  after African Americans were all put out or left or didn't come back at  the end of the 18th century.   Madam Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rush), the Representative from the First District in Illinois.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, the gentleman just  talked about Representative Garcia, who has just joined us and come in.  I think we have got about 5 minutes left.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia). We call him ``Chuy'' in  Chicago, but everybody knows him that way.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that Members may have 5 days in which to revise and extend  their remarks.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I move that the House  do now adjourn.
