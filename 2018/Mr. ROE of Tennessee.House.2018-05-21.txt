 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5215) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prohibit employees found to  have knowingly misused Department of Veterans Affairs purchase cards  from serving as purchase card holders or approving officials.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5215         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Affairs Purchase       Card Misuse Mitigation Act''.       SEC. 2. MISUSE OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PURCHASE                     CARDS BY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES.         (a) In General.--Chapter 7 of title 38, United States Code,       is amended by adding at the end the following new section:       ``Sec. 727. Misuse of Department purchase cards         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall prohibit any       employee of the Department who the Secretary or the Inspector       General of the Department determines has knowingly misused a       purchase card from serving as a purchase card holder or       approving official. Such a prohibition shall be in addition       to any other applicable penalty.        ``(b) Misuse.--For purposes of this section, the term       `misuse' means--        ``(1) splitting purchases;        ``(2) exceeding applicable purchase card limits or purchase       thresholds;        ``(3) purchasing any unauthorized item;        ``(4) using a purchase card without being an authorized       purchase card holder; or        ``(5) violating ethics standards.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item relating to section 725 the following new item:  ``727. Misuse of Department purchase cards.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the record on H.R. 5215.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5215, the Veterans  Affairs Purchase Card Misuse Mitigation Act.   This legislation is sponsored by my Veterans' Affairs Committee  colleagues Jack Bergman, Kathleen Rice,  Mike Bost, Dr. Neal Dunn, and   Mike Coffman.   H.R. 5215 would implement an additional safeguard in VA's  multibillion-dollar government purchase card program, which has too  often lacked adequate controls and has periodically been abused. The  legislation directs the Secretary to revoke the purchase card from any  employee who is found to have intentionally misused it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5215, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), our Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee chair.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 5215, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5418) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to carry out the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program using multiple  prime vendors, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5418         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Affairs Medical-      Surgical Purchasing Stabilization Act''.       SEC. 2. MEDICAL SURGICAL PRIME VENDOR PROGRAM.         (a) Vendors.--In procuring certain medical, surgical, and       dental supplies or laboratory supplies for medical centers of       the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall carry out the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor       program, or successor program, in a manner that--        (1) requires the Secretary to award contracts to multiple       regional prime vendors instead of a single nationwide prime       vendor; and        (2) prohibits a prime vendor from solely designing the       formulary of such supplies.        (b) Clinically Driven Sourcing.--        (1) Expertise.--In carrying out the formulary of supplies       under the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor program, or successor       program, the Secretary shall ensure that each employee of the       Department of Veterans Affairs who conducts formulary       analyses or makes decisions with respect to including items       on the formulary has medical expertise relevant to the items       for which the employee conducts such analyses or makes such       decisions.        (2) Lists.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter with respect       to any updates, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees       on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Senate a list of each employee described in paragraph (1) and       the relevant medical expertise of the employee, listed by the       categories of items in the formulary described in such       paragraph.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 5418, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5418, as amended, the  Veterans Affairs Medical-Surgical Purchasing Stabilization Act. This  legislation was introduced by General Bergman and is cosponsored by  Representatives Peters, Banks, Dunn, and Kuster.   VA's medical-surgical prime vendor program is an ambitious effort to  save money by establishing a medical-surgical formulary in leveraging  the Department's massive buying power. Unfortunately, the results have  fallen far short of expectations.   I held a hearing on this subject last December and continue to  monitor it closely.   The formulary was originally created with little clinical input, and  it does not contain what clinicians need.                                time  1600    Over the past year, physicians, surgeons, and nurses have been  organized into teams to reevaluate the formulary. At one point, a group  of clinicians was essentially put in a room for a week to concentrate  on the task, but the formulary remains troubled.   Now, VA is restructuring the program to put the prime vendors in  charge of negotiating the supplier contracts, but it remains crucial  that VA get the formulary right. This is a matter of safety as well as  finances.   H.R. 5418, as amended, would put clinicians with appropriate  expertise back in charge of the formulary, which is the first step  toward stabilizing the Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor Program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5418, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the Oversight and Investigation  Subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Speaker, it is hard for me to believe we  are going to pass a piece of legislation that has this much common  sense in it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5418, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4958) to increase, effective as of December 1,  2018, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected  disabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for  the survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4958         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2018, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2018, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2018, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2019.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4958.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4958, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2018.   This bill was introduced by the subcommittee chairman,  Mike Bost of  Illinois, and I appreciate his leadership on this issue.   VA provides compensation to help fulfill our obligation to take care  of the brave men and women who have been injured during their service  to our Nation.   This money can be a lifeline for veterans who have service-connected  disabilities that may affect their earning ability.   These veterans often have families to support, and they should not be  worried about how they are going to pay their bills when prices go up.   This bill will help ensure that the value of veterans' benefits are  not eroded by inflation by giving veterans a cost-of-living increase if  Social Security recipients receive one this year.   The amount of the increase will be determined by the consumer price  index, which establishes the COLA for Social Security beneficiaries.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost), our Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee  chairman and Marine veteran,  Mike Bost, for bringing this up. It is a  great piece of legislation. I encourage all Members to support H.R.  4958, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5044) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  clarify the treatment of certain surviving spouses under the  contracting goals and preferences of the Department of Veterans  Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5044         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Service-Disabled Veterans       Small Business Continuation Act''.       SEC. 2. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT REGARDING TREATMENT OF CERTAIN                     SURVIVING SPOUSES UNDER CONTRACTING GOALS AND                     PREFERENCES OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Effective on the date specified in subsection (e) of       section 1832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2660),       section 8127(k)(3) of title 38, United States Code, as       amended by such section 1832, is further amended by inserting       after the period at the end the following new sentence: ``A       surviving spouse of such a veteran who is not covered by       subparagraph (C)(i) of such section by reason of the       disability rating of the veteran being less than 100 percent       shall be treated as being so covered during the period       beginning on the date of the death of the veteran and ending       on the date that is three years after such death, the date on       which the surviving spouse remarries, or the date on which       the surviving spouse relinquishes an ownership interest in       the small business concern, whichever occurs first.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5044.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5044, Service-Disabled  Veterans Small Business Continuation Act.   Current law authorizes a special set-aside program at the Department  of Veterans Affairs for veteran-owned small businesses and Service  Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses called Vets First Program. This  program has been highly successful in providing VOSBs and SDVOSBs more  opportunities, so much so that VA spent almost 20 percent of all  contracting dollars with these firms in 2017.   While we should all laud the success of the program, there has been  concern that current law did not appropriately address concerns of what  happens to awards and contracts of VOSB and SDVOSB when the veteran  owner dies.   The sudden death of a veteran could bring significant upheaval for a  small business as they lose their VA contracts, which can impact not  only the veteran's family, but employees as well.   H.R. 5044 would clarify and authorize the spouses of veterans who  died with less than a 100-percent disability rating to maintain VOSB  and SDVOSB status for up to 3 years following the veteran's death.   I believe this change to current law is an appropriate way to  continue the success of the Vets First Program without hurting other  veteran firms.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman Chabot, for introducing  this bill, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5044, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). This is his piece of legislation. I appreciate  him being here on the floor today.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  H.R. 5044, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1282) to redesignate certain clinics of the  Department of Veterans Affairs located in Montana.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1282         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REDESIGNATION OF CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS CLINICS IN MONTANA.         (a) David J. Thatcher VA Clinic.--        (1) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans       Affairs located at 2687 Palmer Street in Missoula, Montana,       shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known       and designated as the ``David J. Thatcher VA Clinic''.        (2) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in paragraph (1) shall be considered to be       a reference to the David J. Thatcher VA Clinic.        (b) Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow VA Clinic.--        (1) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans       Affairs located at 1775 Spring Creek Lane in Billings,       Montana, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be       known and designated as the ``Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow VA       Clinic''.        (2) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in paragraph (1) shall be considered to be       a reference to the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow VA Clinic.        (3) Public display of name.--        (A) In general.--Any local public display of the name of       the clinic referred to in paragraph (1) carried out by the       United States or through the use of Federal funds shall       include the English name, Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow, and the       Crow name, Dakaak Baako, of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow.        (B) Local display.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), a       local public display of the name of the clinic referred to in       paragraph (1) includes a display inside the clinic, on the       campus of the clinic, and in the community surrounding the       clinic, such as signs directing individuals to the clinic.        (c) Benjamin Charles Steele VA Clinic.--        (1) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans       Affairs located at 1766 Majestic Lane in Billings, Montana,       shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known       and designated as the ``Benjamin Charles Steele VA Clinic''.        (2) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       clinic referred to in paragraph (1) shall be considered to be       a reference to the Benjamin Charles Steele VA Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  add extraneous material on S. 1282.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1282, to designate certain  clinics  [[Page H4261]]  in the Department of Veterans Affairs located in Montana. This bill is  sponsored by Senator Daines from Montana, and I am grateful to him for  introducing this legislation in honor of three American heroes.   The first is Sergeant David J. Thatcher, who was born in Bridger,  Montana, and joined the U.S. Army in 1940. Following the surprise  attack on Pearl Harbor, Sergeant Thatcher volunteered for a secret  mission, the Doolittle Raid. He was the engineer and tail gunner for  crew number 7, the Ruptured Duck.   The crew successfully carried out the mission and attempted to fly to  China. The aircraft ran out of fuel and was forced to make an emergency  landing on a beach. The violent landing caused serious injury to all  crew members besides Sergeant Thatcher. Thankfully, he was able to drag  his men from the wreckage and lead them to safety after avoiding  several Japanese patrols.   For his bravery in saving the lives of his crew, Thatcher was awarded  the Silver Star. His other decorations included the Distinguished  Flying Cross; Air Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters; and the Chinese  Army, Navy, and Air Corps Medal, Class A, First Grade.   S. 1282, would further honor him by naming the clinic of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, located at 2687 Palmer Street in  Missoula, Montana, the David J. Thatcher Department of Veterans Affairs  Clinic. I can think of no better name after reading that.   The second American hero who would be honored by this bill is Dr.  Joseph Medicine Crow, who was born on the Crow Indian Reservation near  Lodge Grass, Montana. Dr. Medicine Crow went on to get his bachelor's  degree from Linfield College and master's degree in anthropology from  the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1939. He was  the first member of the Crow Tribe to obtain a master's degree.   After the war broke out, Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow joined the Army and  became a scout in the 103rd Infantry Division. While at war, he  completed all four tasks required to become a war chief: touching an  enemy without killing him, taking an enemy's weapon, leading a  successful war party, and stealing an enemy's horse. He is the last  member of the Crow Tribe to become a war chief.   After serving in the Army, Dr. Medicine Crow returned to the Crow  Agency and was appointed Tribal historian and anthropologist. He was  appointed the keeper of memories of his Tribe and published many  historical books. Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow continued to write and  lecture at universities and public institutions until his passing at  the young age of 102.   I am truly honored to rename the VA clinic located 1775 Spring Creek  Lane in Billings, Montana, the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Department of  Veterans Affairs Clinic.   The final hero to be recognized by this bill is Ben Steele. Mr.  Steele was born in Billings, Montana, and graduated from Billings  Senior High School.   In 1941, Mr. Steele enlisted in the Army Air Corps, where he was  assigned to the 7th Material Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group. His  group was assigned to the Philippine Islands, and during the ensuing  Japanese invasion, Mr. Steele fought to defend his base on Bataan.  After his capture, Mr. Steele was forced to endure the horrendous  Bataan Death March and was a Japanese prisoner of war for 3\1/2\ years.   After the war, Mr. Steele was a true renaissance man, consulting for  the Department of Defense, serving as the crafts director of the  Military District of Washington, D.C., chairing the art department of  Eastern Montana College, and giving workshops, demonstrations, and  lectures at museums, schools, and civic centers.   As a survivor of the Bataan Death March, Mr. Steele was devoted to  his Creator, his family, his country, and his art. In his memory, I am  privileged to support this bill to rename the clinic of the Department  of Veterans Affairs at 1766 Majestic Lane in Billings, Montana, the  Benjamin Charles Steele Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic.   This legislation satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria, is  cosponsored by the entire Montana congressional delegation, and is  supported by many VSOs. I am proud to support it as well, and I urge  all of my colleagues to join me.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I close, I can't encourage my  Members enough to vote for this.   My history professor in college was a survivor of the Bataan Death  March. He wrote a book, ``Apocalypse Undone: My Survival of Japanese  Imprisonment During World War II,'' and told me he had never slept  through the night until he wrote that book.   I wonder if these two gentlemen, Mr. Steele and my professor, knew  each other. I hope they did. They both lived to have successful lives,  and this truly was and is the Greatest Generation. There is no question  about what these men did when they returned home.   So once again, I encourage everyone to support this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3663) to designate the medical center of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, as the  Hershel ``Woody'' Williams VA Medical Center.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3663         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HERSHEL ``WOODY'' WILLIAMS VA                     MEDICAL CENTER IN HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA.         (a) Designation.--The medical center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, shall after       the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated       as the ``Hershel `Woody' Williams VA Medical Center''.        (b) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be       considered to be a reference to the Hershel ``Woody''       Williams VA Medical Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3663, to designate the  medical center of the Department of Veterans  [[Page H4262]]  Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, as the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams  VA Medical Center.   This bill is sponsored by my friend and colleague Evan Jenkins, and I  am grateful to him for introducing this legislation in honor of an  American hero.   Hershel ``Woody'' Williams enlisted in the Marine Corps on May 26,  1943, in Charleston, West Virginia. Following his training, Corporal  Williams was deployed to participate in the invasion of Iwo Jima. On  February 23, 1945, a system of enemy pill boxes pinned down his unit.   With a 70-pound flamethrower and covering fire from only four  riflemen, Corporal Williams braved the viscous barrage and charged  forward alone. He fought 4 hours, successfully destroying several enemy  strongholds and saving the lives of countless marines.   Corporal Williams fought the entirety of the 5-week battle for the  island despite suffering a wound for which he was awarded a Purple  Heart. For his actions and his heroism in the face of brutal combat,  President Truman awarded Corporal Williams a Medal of Honor on October  5, 1945.   After 20 years of service, he retired from the Marine Corps Reserve  and worked with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Now he serves on  the Governor's West Virginia Military Advisory Board and runs the  Hershel ``Woody'' Williams Medal of Honor Foundation, a not-for-profit  that erects monuments to honor Gold Star families and provides  scholarships to eligible Gold Star children.   Today, Corporal Williams is the only surviving marine to have  received the Medal of Honor during the Second World War, and I am  privileged to support H.R. 3663 in his honor.   This legislation satisfies all of the committee's naming criteria and  is sponsored by the entire West Virginia congressional delegation, and  is supported by many VSOs.   As an aside, Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of attending an event  in Kingsport, Tennessee, where Corporal Williams was the sponsor for  our memorial that is there in Kingsport, Tennessee.   I want to thank my West Virginia colleagues for bringing this up. I  thank Congressman Evan Jenkins for introducing this bill, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Montana (Mr. Gianforte), who is my good friend.    Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``yes.'' What I say to Woody is: thank you, thank  you, thank you.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4451) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide for a five-year extension to the homeless veterans  reintegration programs and to provide clarification regarding  eligibility for services under such programs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4451         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeless Veterans'       Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF HOMELESS VETERANS REINTEGRATION                     PROGRAMS.         (a) Five-Year Extension of Homeless Veterans Reintegration       Programs.--Section 2021(e)(1)(F) of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2022''.        (b) Five-Year Extension of Homeless Women Veterans and       Homeless Veterans With Children Reintegration Grant       Program.--Section 2021A(f)(1) of such title is amended by       striking ``2018'' and inserting ``2022''.        (c) Clarification of Eligibility for Services Under       Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs.--Section 2021(a) of       such title is amended by striking ``reintegration of homeless       veterans into the labor force.'' and inserting the following:       ``reintegration into the labor force of--        ``(1) homeless veterans (including veterans who were       homeless but found housing during the 60-day period preceding       the date on which the veteran begins to participate in a       program under this section);        ``(2) veterans participating in the Department of Veterans       Affairs supported housing program for which rental assistance       is provided pursuant to section 8(o)(19) of the United States       Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19)) or the Tribal       HUD-VA Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) program;        ``(3) Indians who are veterans and receiving assistance       under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self       Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 et seq.);        ``(4) veterans described in section 2023(e) of this title       or any other veterans who are transitioning from being       incarcerated; and        ``(5) veterans participating in the Department of Veterans       Affairs rapid rehousing and prevention program authorized in       section 2044 of this title.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 4451, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4451, as amended. This  bill would reauthorize the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program,  known as HVRP, and Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless Veterans With  Children Reintegration Grant Program, through fiscal year 2022.   These are grant programs managed by the U.S. Department of Labor's  Veterans Employment and Training Service. Grants are made generally to  nonprofit, community-based organizations to fund efforts to train and  place homeless veterans in jobs.   This has been a highly successful program that puts homeless veterans  back on the path to self-reliance and sustainability and is worthy of  Congress' continued support and funding.   This bill would also clarify that homeless veterans who are eligible  for other federally funded homeless veteran programs are also eligible  to receive training and employment services provided by grantees  through HVRP and HVRP-W.   I believe that expanding eligibility for HVRP and HVRP-W will provide  participants in these programs better access to job training programs  that can help homeless veterans on their path to sustainable employment  and positive outcomes. This expansion would also occur without  impacting current authorization levels for this program.   I want to thank Congressman Wenstrup and Congresswoman Brownley for  introducing this must-pass bill, which has my full support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4451, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), who is my Health Subcommittee chair.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation.   When I came to Congress in 2009, there were over 100,0000 homeless  veterans in the United States. General Shinseki, our Secretary at that  time, set out to eliminate veteran homelessness in the next 6 or 7  years. It was a very ambitious task. Great progress has been made.   I have visited the West L.A. campus and seen what they are doing in  Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. As my good friend, Tim Walz, said,  one homeless veteran is one too many.   For people who may be watching this today, we as a country are  providing HUD-VASH vouchers for veterans who can use these, along with  a case manager. But that is only part of it. Many of these veterans  have many other issues and there are other programs that need to be  available for these men  [[Page H4265]]  and women who find themselves in this situation. This is one of them  where you can access job training so you can get a meaningful job and  take care of yourself. Actually, I think this program and the other one  end up paying for themselves over time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to support this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4334) to provide for certain reporting requirements  relating to medical care for women veterans provided by the Department  of Veterans Affairs and through contracts entered into by the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs with non-Department medical providers, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4334         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Oversight of Women       Veterans' Care Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON VETERAN ACCESS TO COVERED SEX-                    SPECIFIC SERVICES UNDER COMMUNITY CARE                     CONTRACTS.         (a) Annual Report.--The Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the House of Representatives an annual report on       the access of women veterans to covered sex-specific medical       care under contracts with non-Department medical providers       entered into by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the       provision of hospital care or medical services to veterans       eligible for enrollment in the patient enrollment system of       the Department of Veterans Affairs maintained under section       1705 of title 38, United States Code. Such report shall       include data and performance measures for the availability of       covered sex-specific medical care, including--        (1) the average wait time between the veteran's preferred       appointment date and the date on which the appointment is       completed;        (2) driving time required for veterans to attend       appointments; and        (3) reasons why appointments could not be scheduled with       non-Department medical providers.        (b) Sunset.--The requirement to submit a report under this       section shall terminate on the date that is seven years after       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Covered Sex-Specific Medical Care.--In this section,       the term ``covered sex-specific medical care'' means       mammography, maternity care, and gynecological care.       SEC. 3. REPORTING ON VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION                     ENVIRONMENT OF CARE STANDARDS FOR WOMEN                     VETERANS.         (a) Medical Facility Reporting.--Each medical facility of       the Department shall submit to the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs a quarterly report on the compliance and       noncompliance of the facility with the environment of care       standards for women veterans. Each such report shall include       the name of each person associated with such facility who is       responsible for such compliance and the specific role or       responsibility assigned to each such person.        (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs       of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on       the plan of the Secretary to strengthen the environment of       care standards for women veterans at Department of Veterans       Affairs medical facilities. Such report shall include--        (1) a description of the process established to verify that       noncompliance information reported under subsection (a) is       accurate and complete; and        (2) a description of the method by which the Secretary       will--        (A) ensure that all patient care areas of each Department       medical facility are inspected as required; and        (B) expand the list of items that facility staff inspect       for compliance to align with the women's health handbook of       the Veterans Health Administration.        (c) Sunset.--The requirement to submit a report under this       section shall terminate on the date that is seven years after       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Environment of Care Standards for Women Veterans.--In       this section, the term ``environment of care standards for       women veterans'' has the meaning given that term in Veterans       Health Administration Directive 1330.01(1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 4334, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4334, as amended,  Improving Oversight of Women Veterans' Care Act of 2018.   While VA has vastly improved its capacity to care for gender-specific  needs of women veterans, many are still referred to the community when  VA cannot provide the appropriate services.   Mr. Speaker, last week, the House overwhelmingly approved the VA  MISSION Act by a vote of 347-70. The MISSION Act will, among other  things, improve the ability for eligible veterans to seek care from  community providers when VA cannot meet strict access standards.   With more veterans becoming eligible to seek care in the community,  it is incumbent upon us as members of the House VA Committee to provide  oversight over the care delivered within the community as well.   This bill, offered by my friend and fellow committee member from  California (Mr. Correa), would help us do just that. H.R. 4334 would  require VA medical centers to report to the Secretary on the compliance  of contracted community providers with standards of care for women  veterans, as established by VA.   The Secretary would also be required to report to Congress on the  accessibility of gender-specific medical care for women with community  providers, as well as to develop a plan to strengthen standards of care  within the facilities.   Mr. Speaker, as we await Senate passage of the VA MISSION Act, I urge  [[Page H4266]]  my colleagues to support this complementary piece of legislation, H.R.  4334, as amended, Improving Oversight of Women Veterans' Care Act, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Correa's legislation. I, too, was, an  OB/GYN physician who saw VA patients. I would like to think that Mr.  Correa had all these ideas himself, but I have had the opportunity to  find out that he definitely married above himself. His wife is an OB/ GYN, so I think he probably got most of those ideas from her.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I also concur with my colleague: I urge support of H.R. 4334. I just  want to say, right before Memorial Day, it is obviously next week, and  many people will go home to picnics and families. We have just heard  this afternoon on the House floor the sacrifice of many, many of our  veterans and really amazing people that live in our country.   In the past week, the Veterans' Affairs Committee--and I want to  thank members on both sides of the aisle--have put together 15 bills:  one was a major bill, the VA MISSION Act, which will be taken up by the  Senate this week, and 14 bills this afternoon to improve both the care  and services provided to our Nation's heroes.   For me, it is a true privilege to get up every day and come to this  House, to this body, the U.S. House of Representatives, and to advocate  for those men and women that I have so much respect for.   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy Memorial Day to everyone,  and I encourage everyone to vote for this today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
