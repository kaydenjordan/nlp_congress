 Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege to  introduce the House to our guest chaplain, Father Dan Spexarth of  Wichita, Kansas. As an ordained minister for more than 30 years, Father  Spexarth has served six parishes in our community, including St.  Catherine of Siena Catholic Church in Wichita since 2008.   Father Spexarth was born and raised on a wheat farm near Colwich,  Kansas. And after graduating from the seminary, we are fortunate Father  Spexarth returned to our community.   Father Spexarth has been a tireless servant of God, leading an active  parish committed to serving those in need in our community and  throughout the world. As Congress addresses many complex issues facing  our Nation, I am humbled by the opportunity to host Father Spexarth and  thankful that we can join together in prayer for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Father Dan  Spexarth, and thank him for offering today's opening prayer in the U.S.  House of Representatives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer thoughts and  prayers to the families of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Andale,  Kansas. For nearly 125 years, the parish of St. Joseph has been a  pillar of west Sedgwick County and our entire community.   On Sunday morning, several hours before parishioners were to arrive  for 8 a.m. Mass, it is believed a lightning strike caused a fire which  soon engulfed the entire attic and roof. Two firefighters were injured  responding to the fire which was contained after several hours.  Thankfully, the firefighters treated for smoke inhalation and burns  were released from the hospital.   In a demonstration of the spirit in our community, nearby Andale High  School was quick to open its doors and the church was able to celebrate  10 a.m. Mass. I am confident that this resilient community will  continue to join together to help Father Daryl Befort and all the  parishioners in St. Joseph as they begin the long and difficult task of  rebuilding their church.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping St. Joseph and  our first responders in our thoughts and prayers at this time.                            ____________________
