 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the House  Administration Committee for her leadership. I also thank our resident  historian, Congressman Hoyer of Maryland, for constantly reminding us  of the better virtues of our history.    To my dear friend as well, a Congressman who was eloquent on the  floor of his age but also his recognition of the importance of this  legislation, I thank him for the bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge my friends that have supported this  legislation, including Joyce Beatty, Karen Bass, now mayor of Los  Angeles, Barbara Lee,  Jim Clyburn, and my cosponsorship as well,  because we knew what was important and what had to be done.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 5229, that is a downsizing of  the House bill to direct the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library  to remove the bust of Roger Brook Taney in the Old Supreme Court  Chamber of the Capitol and to obtain a bust of Thurgood Marshall for  installation in the Capitol or on the Capitol grounds and to be able to  lift America up.   It is important to lift America up to her better angels in the  understanding of the richness of our history. Those of us who are  African Americans came first in the bottom of the belly of a slave  boat. We have never had that acknowledged. But it was acknowledged in  the Dred Scott decision when it was affirmed with this effort of Roger  Brook Taney to say that we were less than a person, that it was all  right to make those who were slaves not a human being; that our  children were raised under that, and our grandchildren were raised  under that.   I remind people that slaves were so long in slavery that they were  born slaves, lived as slaves, and died as  [[Page H9820]]  slaves, which brings me to the importance of H.R. 40, the Commission to  Study Slavery and Develop Reparation Proposals. We must get our hands  around this issue of slavery and not be afraid of it.                                time  1530    The very fact that the bust will be removed, again, in the words that  were said by my colleague, it will get rid of the horribleness of what  happened, the outrage of what happened.   I believe the placing of Justice Thurgood Marshall's bust will be a  grand step forward, a mighty step forward.   It is absurd. It is horrible. It is without understanding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support it.   As well, if I might, I want to raise S. 2607, the Tom Suozzi bill,  Iran Hostages Congressional Gold Medal Act, and say that it is long  overdue.   I met with the hostages' family members who had lived through this  tyranny and had lived through it for many days, 53 hostages, which  occurred on November 4, 1979. As I recall, they were held for over a  year. There were many attempts to free them.    Mr. Speaker, they remained heroes and patriots, and  I believe this is the minimum that we can do to give to those hurting  families still, those children that I met, those grandchildren that I  met that wondered what happened to their families.   Here we, as a Nation, will recognize that time of their lives when  they never gave in to tyranny and never gave up their belief in the  values of this Nation.   Again, we remind ourselves that democracy is precious, and it is not  free. We must fight for it at every turn. Those who were held hostages  as American citizens fought at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2607, as well as S.  5229. They both represent the best of what America is, and they both  represent telling our story, our history, and honoring it. This is a  great democracy, and we must show it every day.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 7., the ``VAWA  Technical Amendment Act of 2022,'' that would ensure Native Hawaiian  victims and survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sex  trafficking, and other such crimes have access to vital VAWA resources.   When the Violence Against Women Act first became law in 1994, it  represented an historic shift in the federal government's role in  combating violent crimes committed against  [[Page H9823]]  women. Due to the importance of the legislation and its resulting  success, VAWA was reauthorized on an overwhelming bipartisan basis in  2000, 2005, and 2013.   As we negotiated the most recent reauthorization, I was adamant that  Congress acknowledge the cries of the multitude of voiceless native  women. That we should do more to improve coordination and communication  between law enforcement agencies, empower tribal governments with  resources, and improve the way we collect data about missing and  murdered native women.   And although each piece of VAWA is critical to support and protect  victims of violence, I thought it necessary to pay special attention to  the plight of tribal women, who suffer extraordinarily high rates of  victimization.   That is why we must pass the ``VAWA Technical Amendment Act of  2022''--to make sure that Native Hawaiian victims and survivors are  supported and protected.   The VAWA Reauthorization--which made its way to the President's desk  this year--made several improvements to the Services, Training,  Officers, and Prosecutors (STOP) grant program.   The STOP grant program was established to assist state, territorial,  local, and Tribal governments in responding to violent crimes against  women, including the crimes of domestic violence, dating violence,  sexual assault, and stalking, as well as the appropriate treatment of  victims.   The grants have long been used to develop effective strategies to  assist victims and survivors through nonprofit, community  organizations.   Eligibility for the grants was expanded under the reauthorization for  individuals and grantees, and the authorized uses of grants under the  expansion now include supportive services for American Indian victims  of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.   Unfortunately, due to a drafting error, Native Hawaiian organizations  have been unable to access STOP grant funds for the benefit of Native  Hawaiian women, thereby denying an entire community of victims and  survivors restorative, stabilizing care. This is a serious problem with  an uncomplicated solution.   S. 7 would amend relevant statutory provisions to make sure Native  Hawaiian organizations can render aid to their communities using STOP  grant funding.   As has always been true, the Violence Against Women Act  Reauthorization is comprehensive and inclusive legislation that  responds to the many varied and changing needs of diverse victims and  survivors across the country by making meaningful improvements. This  bill exemplifies that sentiment.   I applaud Senator Mazie Hirono for spearheading this bill to ensure  that no victim or survivor is denied access to VAWA's life-saving  resources, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman from the Committee  on the Judiciary, the gentleman from New York, and the manager who is  joining us on these bipartisan bills, which many of them had their  origins in the House. I am delighted that the Senate was able to join  us. These bills come under the Senate name because of the fact that we  are working with the Senate on many of these similar bills in order to  have them become law, because they are important.   I rise now to support S. 2991, the Countering Human Trafficking Act.  I thank the Senator from Michigan who offered this legislation, and it  deals with making the Center for Countering Human Trafficking permanent  and requires other changes to strengthen the center's contribution for  the fight against human trafficking.   Let me be very clear on the floor. Human trafficking is an epidemic.  It is a pandemic. It is a scourge on the fabric of America. Human  trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in the  United States. In 2020, 11,190 instances of potential human trafficking  were reported to the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline,  with at least 70 percent of these instances involving sex trafficking.   The one thing about sex trafficking, it is more profitable than  drugs, because you utilize, unfortunately, the tragic human being who  has been made part of the bounty of your profit and recycle them over  and over again, and they are young girls and boys in many instances.   I will continue to advance and support legislation, like the bill  before us today, as well as programming aimed at preventing human  trafficking, protecting victims and survivors, as an estimated 25  percent of human trafficking victims are reportedly in my home State of  Texas at any given time, many of whom are minors.   In our State of Texas, we have developed strong advocacy groups that  fight against human trafficking and even have done something  innovative, which means that we have called our sports arenas No  Trafficking Zones.   So I rise to support this legislation with over 5,359 trafficking  victims and survivors identified through the hotline in 2019.   I introduced H.R. 7566, the Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones  Act, now known as the No Trafficking Zones Act. I pronounce today on  the floor, this bill must pass. We must have the Senate agree to this  bill so this can be a complement to the bill that we now have on the  floor. We have done hard work. We have worked with the Senate. We want  to make sure we get this bill passed.   I rise also to support the bill previously discussed, the VAWA  Technical Amendment Act of 2022. I thank Senator Hirono for this  courageous legislation to protect Native Hawaiian victims and survivors  of domestic violence, dating violence, sex violence, and others, to  have access to the vital services of VAWA, which I think are extremely  important.   I also rise to support S. 5230, Billy's Law, or the Help Find the  Missing Act. This is important. I have worked with missing and  exploited children. This bipartisan legislation would fix the gaps in  our Nation's databases of missing persons and unidentified remains,  providing much-needed closure to the thousands of families who have  endured the trauma of losing someone they love.   Each year, more than 600,000 Americans are reported missing. While  many are ultimately found, at least 22,000 are currently missing.   I know that for a fact, Mr. Speaker, because I have dealt over the  last month with a family whose loved one was missing, it was very  painful, until tragically this person was found, and they were not  found alive. But the pain of missing the person and not getting any  response, this should be very helpful in at least giving comfort to  families who are desperately in need of finding their loved one.   So as we go forward on this legislation, I hope to continue the work  that we need to do with the Senate to move forward.   My final support is for S. 2899, the Prison Camera Reform Act of  2021. It is bipartisan legislation that would require the Bureau of  Prisons to reevaluate the security camera, land-mobile radio, and  public address systems in use at BOP institutions and submit to  Congress a report. This is very important for civil liberty, civil  rights, and prison employees.    Mr. Speaker, the well-being of these prisoners is  critical, along with protecting the safety, well-being, and civil  rights of incarcerated people and prison employees, including  correctional officers, medical personnel, and other staff.   Let me just simply say, as I close, on the Bureau of Prisons, there  is more work to be done. They have to do work on how they are treating  women. There was a recent hearing that shows that women have been  abused, sexually abused, in prisons, besides addressing other terrible  issues, and that includes both prisoners and employees.   In addition, the Bureau of Prisons has been known to not utilize the  compassionate release. In fact, their percentages are disgraceful. Most  of the prisoners have had to go outside with a lawyer. This is a law.  They should use it.   I hope that as we look at improving the cameras that will provide due  process to these prisoners who are incarcerated, who are doing their  time, they will also have a bureau that is responsible and sensitive to  their responsibilities of incarceration but also fairness and due  process.   I thank my colleague for yielding, and I ask for support for all of  the legislation that I just commented on, particularly the underlying  legislation.  [[Page H9826]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2991, the ``Countering Human  Trafficking Act of 2021,'' which would make the Center for Countering  Human Trafficking permanent and require other changes to strengthen the  Center's contributions to the fight against human trafficking.   Human trafficking is one of the greatest threats to human rights in  the United States. In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential human  trafficking were reported to the United States National Human  Trafficking Hotline with at least 70 percent of those instances  involving sex trafficking.   I will continue to advance and support legislation, like the bill  before us today, as well as programming aimed at preventing human  trafficking and protecting victims and survivors--as an estimated 25  percent of human trafficking victims are reportedly in my home state of  Texas at any given time--many of whom are minors.   At least 5,359 of trafficking victims and survivors identified  through the hotline in 2019 were under the age of 18, and in 2021, the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than  17,200 reports of suspected child sex trafficking.   That is why I introduced the H.R. 7566 Stop Human Trafficking in  School Zones Act, also known as the No Trafficking Zones Act, to ensure  that our nation's schools are a safe haven for students. I hope the  Senate will take up and pass my bill so that we may get it to the  president's desk before this Congress ends.   While traffickers seek out vulnerable minors and adults--no person is  truly safe from the schemes of charismatic traffickers bent on  exploiting and destroying lives.   Sadly, these statistics were only made worse by the COVID-19  pandemic--during which traffickers took advantage of individuals and  communities in crisis--further increasing the number of people at risk  of falling victim to human trafficking.   It is for all of these reasons that we must help maintain the  momentum gained by the Center for Countering Human Trafficking in  recent years.   The Center is responsible for integrating the efforts of 16 different  offices and components of the Department of Homeland Security into a  cohesive strategy that supports law enforcement investigations and  training, shields and supports victims, develops and enhances  prevention strategies, and engages with the public.   S. 2991 is a straightforward, bipartisan bill that would make the  Center permanent while promoting stability and modernization and  encouraging continued collaboration, growth, and innovation.   I thank Senator Gary Peters and John Katko for their leadership on  this bill and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it.    Mr. Speaker, S. 2899, the ``Prison Camera Reform Act  of 2021,'' is bipartisan legislation that would require the Bureau of  Prisons to evaluate the security camera, land-mobile radio, and public  address systems in use at BOP institutions and submit to Congress a  report on any deficiencies and a plan to implement needed improvements.   Security camera systems within prisons are critical for protecting  the safety, wellbeing and civil rights of both incarcerated people and  prison employees, including correctional officers, medical personnel  and other staff.   Documented deficiencies in the federal Bureau of Prisons' security  camera systems, however, limit the effectiveness of that protection.   A 2016, DOJ Office of Inspector General report identified major  deficiencies and needed upgrades within the BOP's security camera  system, including blind spots, inoperable cameras and limited  functionality.   In a 2021 memo, OIG reaffirmed the 2016 report stating that ``the OIG  continues to see the same deficiencies in our investigations that we  observed during our 2016 review. These deficiencies have negatively  impacted the OIG's investigations and ability to secure prosecution of  serious incidents in BOP institutions, including sexual assaults, civil  rights violations, introduction of contraband, dereliction of duty, and  even inmate deaths.''   Although BOP has begun upgrading these systems at some institutions,  serious shortcomings remain.   This bill would require BOP to investigate and address deficiencies  in the camera and radio systems across all institutions.   BOP would also be required to implement all needed improvements  within three years and submit annual progress reports. The significant  oversight mechanisms within this legislation will enable Congress to  hold BOP accountable and ensure all deficiencies are addressed within  the specified time period.   ``Dead spots'' in video surveillance coverage inside FCI Dublin in  California may have even contributed to the lack of accountability for  the sexual abuse committed against incarcerated women in that facility.   Earlier this month, a former unit manager at FCI Dublin testified  that the facility lacked sufficient security camera coverage and that  many cameras are either not monitored or footage is deleted. The former  warden is relying heavily on the lack of video footage in his defense  against the sexual assault case.   This tragic story highlights the need to address camera deficiencies  within BOP facilities as quickly as possible. The lack of adequate  camera systems puts the safety of both incarcerated individuals and  correctional officers and staff at risk.   This bill is a bipartisan common sense measure to require that BOP  investigate and address these critical safety concerns and ensures that  the improvements will be made by including adequate Congressional  oversight.   I want to thank Representatives Keller, McBath, and Trone as well as  Senator Ossoff for introducing this important legislation. I urge all  of my colleagues to support the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 5230, the  ``Help Find the Missing Act,'' also known as ``Billy's Law.''   This bipartisan legislation would fix the gaps in our Nation's  databases of missing persons and unidentified remains, providing much- needed closure to the thousands of families who have endured the trauma  of losing someone they love.   Each year more than 600,000 Americans are reported missing. While  many are ultimately found, at least 22,000 Americans are currently  missing, and the remains of over 14,000 individuals have been recovered  but not identified.   My own State of Texas has been hit particularly hard by the crisis of  missing persons, as we have more than 2,200 open cases--second only to  California--and three Texas cities rank among the top 10 cities with  the highest number of missing persons.   The pain that families experience when one of their loved one goes  missing is unimaginable. It is not merely a loss; it is a loss  accompanied by terror, uncertainty, and endless questions that are  rarely answered. We can, and we must, do more to help find the missing;  to save who we can; and to provide assistance to the families of those  who we cannot find or save.   Billy's Law would help us find more of our missing Americans by  ensuring that the Department of Justice continues to maintain the  National Missing Persons and Unidentified Persons System, or ``NamUs.''   In addition to providing a database of missing persons, NamUs  provides a variety of critical support services to law enforcement,  medical examiners, and families of those who have gone missing.   But not all missing persons and unidentified remains are required to  be reported to NamUs. That is why Billy's Law is so critical.   Rather than having a multitude of unconnected missing person  databases that cannot communicate with each other, Billy's Law would  link NamUs with the FBI's National  [[Page H9831]]  Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database, creating more complete,  comprehensive databases and streamlining the reporting process.   The bill would also require the Attorney General to issue guidelines  and best practices to the agencies that handle cases involving missing  persons or unidentified remains.   Lastly, Billy's Law would expand current law to require that missing  children be reported to NamUs, in addition to NCIC, and it will require  the reporting of information on every unidentified deceased person,  adults and children alike.   My State of Texas passed similar legislation just last year,  requiring law enforcement agencies and medical examiners to use NamUs  to solve missing and unidentified persons cases.   But while I am proud of the steps my State has taken, this is a  national problem that demands a national solution. Billy's Law is that  solution.   As a testament to the value of this bipartisan legislation, it is  supported by numerous law enforcement and forensic specialist  organizations, including the National Association of Police  Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, The American Academy of  Forensic Sciences, and the National Association of Medical Examiners.   I commend Senator Murphy for his years of dedication to Billy's Law  and missing persons across the country, and I thank Representative  Hayes for her work on this issue as well. I urge my colleagues to  support this significant bipartisan legislation.    Madam Speaker, in this season of greetings and well- wishes for holidays for Americans, I do wish them a very special  holiday season in all the ways that we, as Americans, will celebrate  this holiday.   We know that it is a season of giving and good cheer as we finish our  collective work to be able to fund the government, to keep the doors  open, and to help the services of those who need them to continue.   I also think it is important to say that we have crucial legislation  that should be passed. We cannot leave without passing voting rights.  We cannot leave with gifting to the American people oppressive voting  laws to stop them from voting, that purge the voting rolls. We cannot  leave without real human trafficking legislation that protects our  children at schools.   The No Trafficking Zones Act is in the Senate, the other body, and it  has to be passed. It is a pathway of protecting children and families  feeling safe when their children go to schools, that predators will not  be able to actually recruit children for human trafficking right at the  school and even online.   Madam Speaker, I give good greetings, but this legislation has to  pass, voting rights and the No Trafficking Zones Act.                            ____________________
