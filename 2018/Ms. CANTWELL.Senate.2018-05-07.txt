 Mr. President, I come to the floor to pay tribute to  Rev. Dr. Samuel B. McKinney, a civil rights icon from the Pacific  Northwest.   In August of 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., inspired the Nation from  the steps of the Lincoln Memorial here in Washington, DC, boldly  proclaiming: ``Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of  God's children.''   Meanwhile, in the basement of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Seattle,  WA, Dr. Samuel McKinney was already taking up that cause. He stood  before his fellow religious leaders--pastors, rabbis, and priests--and  asked them to join him in the struggle for equality and justice for  all.   For more than 40 years, he never gave up the fight, advocating for  economic and social justice in Seattle, WA, and throughout our Nation.  Refusing to yield to deep-seated prejudice and threats of violence, he  became known as a visionary civil rights leader, a pillar of Seattle  civic life, and a moral consciousness of our community.   Tomorrow, many Washingtonians will come together to celebrate Dr.  McKinney's life--to remember his wisdom, his advocacy, his deep and  unshakeable belief in justice, his steadfast commitment to his  community and his church, his service to our Nation in the U.S. Air  Force, and his devotion as a husband, father, and friend.   He was a third-generation Baptist minister. He took up the struggle  for justice at an early age. He was inspired by the athletic prowess of  Jesse Owens and Joe Louis and by civil rights leaders of our  generation.   No influence was more profound than the sermons of his own father.  The Rev. Dr. Wade McKinney never shrank from an opportunity to use his  pulpit to fight back against racism and segregation, and decades later,  from his own pulpit at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Seattle, Dr. Samuel  McKinney continued his father's efforts. He repeatedly fought back  against injustice in every form, leading civil rights marches in the  sixties, protesting school segregation in the seventies, and  demonstrating against apartheid in the eighties. He led boycotts  against companies that refused to hire Black workers and developed and  promoted workforce training programs for people who were struggling to  find employment. He protested unfair education policies and started an  accredited preschool and kindergarten program that helped establish the  first Black-owned bank in Seattle. He served as an original member of  the Seattle Human Rights Commission, helping to pass our city's first  Fair Housing Act.   Through his leadership, Dr. McKinney also brought to the national  stage the only visit of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Seattle in  1961, featured in this historic photo. Dr. McKinney also participated  in the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march in 1965. In 1980, he was  arrested for speaking against apartheid at the South African consulate  in Seattle. At 86 years old, Dr. McKinney was still fighting back  against injustice, speaking at the prayer vigil in Seattle for Trayvon  Martin.   Dr. McKinney's legacy lives on through his courageous actions, his  visionary leadership, and his quest for justice. But perhaps most of  all, his legacy lives on through the extraordinary community that he  built at Mount Zion Baptist Church.   It was at Mount Zion that he mentored fellow ministers and imparted  inspirational guidance. It was where he baptized newborns, presided  over weddings, helped families bury their loved ones, and maintained  his steadfast commitment to his parishioners.   At Mount Zion, he raised his two daughters--Dr. Lora-Ellen McKinney  and Rhoda McKinney-Jones--along with his wife. They made sacrifices for  the community. She, too, was a savvy businesswoman and a strong  supporter of education and the arts.   Under Dr. McKinney's leadership, Mount Zion flourished and tripled  its membership. His church and its community stand as a true testament  to Dr. McKinney's life and what it meant in Seattle. Today, it shows  the enduring faith that drove him in all that he did. Dr. McKinney made  the fight for justice and equality his lifelong mission.   Another picture shows him with Jesse Jackson, who I believe also came  to Seattle at Dr. McKinney's request. Dr. McKinney fought for justice  in Seattle and helped to impact our Nation. His leadership and  dedication to the community will be sorely missed. As I said, tomorrow,  many Washingtonians will be there to commemorate his life, along with  his daughters and many of his parishioners--people from Mount Zion.   As we honor and remember Dr. McKinney's lifetime of advocacy, I am  reminded of a fitting quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The  ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort  and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and  controversy.''   In good times and through difficult ones, Reverend McKinney stood on  the side of justice, and for that, all of us in the Pacific Northwest  are grateful.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
