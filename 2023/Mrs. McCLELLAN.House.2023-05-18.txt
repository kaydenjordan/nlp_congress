 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are presenting us with  a false choice: default on our debt and cause a recession or pass their  default on America act and slash environmental funding and clean energy  investments made through the Inflation Reduction Act.   The IRA is the most significant legislation in U.S. history to tackle  the climate crisis and strengthen American energy security. Virginians  in my district have already seen tangible benefits from the bill  through environmental restoration funding for our Tribal communities,  climate-resilient infrastructure upgrades, and clean school buses for  our children.   It will continue to deliver for our Commonwealth. There are already  more than 92,000 Virginians employed in clean energy jobs, and the IRA  will create even more opportunity bringing $11.6 billion in funding to  our Commonwealth for large-scale clean power generation storage by  2030.   The IRA represents a new chapter for my constituents who are excited  to  [[Page H2443]]  purchase energy-efficient appliances, make repairs to their homes, and  save money on their utility bills.    However, the draconian default on America act will jeopardize many of  these provisions. We must reject these extreme cuts and cleanly raise  the debt ceiling.                            ____________________
