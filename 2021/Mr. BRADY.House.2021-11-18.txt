 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we meet today to consider the largest spending bill in  American history; a bill that no one has read, no one knows its cost,  it was written in secret, and rushed to the floor to hide it from the  American people.   We meet in the shadow of an awful economic report that shows  America's economy effectively stopped growing last quarter. President  Biden is over 700,000 jobs short of his promises from the last  stimulus, has ignored the damaging labor shortage and the fastest  rising inflation in 40 years.   This is all proof that President Biden is bungling the recovery, and  leaves many Americans questioning his competence.   Given all that, you would think the President and Congressional  Democrats would avoid sabotaging America's economy further. But that is  exactly what this $4 trillion socialist tax and spending binge does.   Build Back Better's crippling tax hikes will kill American jobs,  drive many of them overseas, hammer small businesses as they struggle  to recover, worsen the labor shortage, and drive inflation even higher.   And, yes, President Biden is absolutely breaking his pledge to not  raise taxes on America's lower- and middle-income earners. Two out of  three millionaires will get a tax cut while the middle class gets a tax  hike.   Both the liberal Tax Policy Center and Congress' own scorekeeper, the  Joint Committee on Taxation, confirm this. This bill imposes over $400  billion in taxes on America's small businesses, which couldn't come at  a worse time.   There are $800 billion in tax increases on American businesses who  compete both here and around the world.   This is an economic surrender to China, Russia, Japan, and Europe;  driving American jobs, investment, and manufacturing overseas.   The new corporate minimum tax is really a Made in America tax.   It hits American manufacturing, energy, and technology businesses the  hardest along with American consumers. The international tax increases  make it better to be a foreign company or consumer than an American  one.   Is it any wonder our foreign competitors are happy to embrace a small  global minimum tax; they are getting American jobs and a big bite of  our tax base.   There is a troubling new tax that hurts retirement plans, harming  workers and seniors the most by punishing businesses that invest in  their own stock.   All this while the Federal Government enjoys record-high levels of  tax revenue from corporations, small businesses, and high-income  earners due to the Republican tax cuts in 2017.   This $4 trillion socialist tax and spending binge will drive prices  up even higher on families and make the damaging labor shortage even  worse.   As businesses from Main Street to manufacturing struggle to find  workers, Democrats' changes to the child tax credit no longer require  Americans to earn or to work to qualify for monthly checks.   Experts predict this, along with lavish COVID-era Affordable Care Act  subsidies, could drive up to 2 million more Americans to exit the  workforce.   Under their paid leave plan, taxpayers will pay billions of dollars  to put Washington in charge of your time off while workers struggle  with one-size-fits-all mandates that limit choice for families and  crush small businesses.   This is crazy, too: Democrats are insisting on giving a huge tax  windfall to the wealthy 1 percent of Americans by lifting the  reasonable SALT cap. The cost of this tax give-away? A whopping $222  billion.   The penthouse gets an obscene tax break, but the building janitor  gets nothing. The middle class gets nothing. The 90 percent of  taxpayers who don't itemize their taxes get nothing but higher taxes  themselves.   Where are their priorities? The SALT windfall for the wealthy is 50  times larger than the help a parent gets from the child tax credit.   And it gets worse. Democrats are spitting away $550 billion in green  pork subsidies for the wealthy and the world's biggest corporations.   Democrats are forcing taxpayers to send $12,500 to a wealthy family  buying a luxury electric vehicle worth 80 grand. They quietly snuck in  tax breaks for wealthy trial lawyers, recording artists, electric  bikes, and subsidies for the media. Of course, labor unions get a huge  haul, including forcing the 90 percent of Americans who don't join a  union to subsidize a few who do.   While special interests cash in, families don't. Did you know this  includes a new toddler tax that will force middle-class families to pay  $13,000 more a year for their childcare?   And there are budget gimmicks galore.   ``It costs zero'' will go down in history as one of the biggest  whoppers a President has ever told.   The true deficit is trillions of dollars over the decade.   And one of the budget gimmicks lands on American seniors who won't  have affordable generic drugs in the future to choose from.   Another budget gimmick is supercharging the IRS with 80,000 new  agents. While Democrats will say they have walked away from their bank  surveillance plan, the White House is ``hopeful'' Senators will sneak  it back in.   If you are worried about rising prices shrinking your paychecks more  and more every month, these trillions in new government spending will  only make it worse.   Inflation is killing families, forcing them to effectively pay a  second utility bill, a second cell phone bill, or a second cable bill a  month. Inflation is a tax, and Democrats are raising it in this bill.   So crippling taxes, driving jobs overseas, making the worker shortage  worse, and driving prices higher; this is a terrible bill.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Federation of Independent Business, the Nation's leading small  business advocacy group underscoring how this proposed bill will impose  a small business surtax on already struggling mom-and-pop shops across  America.                                                            NFIB,                                   Washington, DC, November 5, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of NFIB, the nation's       leading small business advocacy organization, I write in       strong opposition of H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act.       This legislation would increase taxes, impose new mandates,       and increase penalties on small business owners, threatening       to disrupt the fragile small business recovery. H.R. 5376       will be considered an NFIB Key Vote for the 117th Congress.        NFIB opposes efforts to raise taxes on small businesses.       The Build Back Better Act broadens existing passive income       taxes and applies them to active income, creating a true       ``Small Business Surtax.'' Specifically, the legislation       substantially expands the 3.8% net investment income tax       (NIIT) on pass-through business income and applies it to all       business income above $400,000 (individual filers) and       $500,000 (joint filers). The threshold is even lower for       family businesses held as trusts, with the surtax applying to       income above $13,000. These thresholds are not indexed for       inflation, so the ``Small Business Surtax'' will impact an       increasing number of businesses and an increasing percentage       of business income every year.        Three-quarters of small employers are organized as pass-      through entities (S Corporations, LLCs, Sole Proprietorships,       and Partnerships). The ``Small Business Surtax'' would       negatively impact more than 750,000 pass-through businesses       and over half of pass-through business income. When combined       with the other surtaxes on certain pass-through businesses,       these tax changes create a 48.8% federal effective tax rate       on pass-through business income before even considering state       and local taxes. NFIB's latest tax survey, small business       owners shared that federal business income taxes were the       most burdensome tax on both a financial and administrative       basis. These taxes will divert resources away from job       creation, compensation increases, and business investment and       further complicate tax compliance. The permanent tax       increases fund temporary spending programs, meaning       additional tax hikes will be necessary if the programs are       extended and offset.        NFIB is also concerned about the impact of a government-run       paid family and medical leave program may have on small       employers. The Build Back Better Act creates a four-week       federal paid family and medical leave program for all workers       without regard to employer size. This program would be a       significant change to small employers (fewer than 50       employees) who are currently not subject to the Family and       Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Congress wrote this exemption into       law because they understood that an employer mandate like       FMLA would be burdensome, and compliance would be difficult.       In a recent NFIB member ballot, 90% of small businesses       believe that small employers should be exempt from paid sick       and family leave mandates. Requiring small business       participation in a federal paid family and medical leave       program would take away the flexibility many small businesses       need to be able to manage their workforce at a time when half       of small business owners are struggling to fill open       positions.        NFIB opposes increased penalty amounts and increased       penalty exposure on small businesses. The Build Back Better       Act increases civil monetary penalties on small businesses       with isolated errors when trying to comply with complicated       federal employment law and increases penalty exposure for       employers by expanding the Affordable Care Act's employer       mandate. Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) violations currently       operate under a strict liability standard, meaning employers       who make an honest misinterpretation of the law or make an       isolated mistake are not given leniency. The legislation also       increases civil monetary penalties for violations under the       Occupational, Safety, and Health Act (OSHA), as well as those       under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). If penalties       are substantially increased, a single error could ruin a       small employer and permanently put them out of business.       Further, the legislation lowers the definition of       ``affordability'' for the ACA's employer mandate, which would       drive up health insurance costs for employers. Small       businesses do not have the operating revenue of larger       businesses and cannot simply absorb these substantial fines       and cost increases. They also do not have legal and human       resources departments to negotiate lower fines with agency       officials or lower premiums with health insurers.        Small businesses are struggling with labor shortages,       rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and increasing       threats from  [[Page H6595]]       COVID-19 variants. Congress should not impose significant tax       increases, inflexible mandates, and massive new civil       monetary penalties on small businesses as they would compound       these problems and damage the fragile small business       recovery. NFIB opposes H.R. 5376 and will consider the       legislation an NFIB Key Vote for the 117th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                  Kevin Kuhlman,                                                     Vice President,                                      Federal Government Relations.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  American Farm Bureau who represents nearly 6 million families and  American farmers asking us to reject passage of this bill due to  inflation and how this hurts America's farmers.                                 American Farm Bureau Federation,                                  Washington, DC, November 16, 2021.      Hon. ___      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Farm Bureau's nearly       6-million member families, I write to urge you to oppose the       Build Back Better Act, a piece of legislation that raises       taxes and spends more taxpayer money at a time our country       can afford to do neither.        Inflation is driving up costs across the economy, and       greatly increased federal spending is a contributing factor.       Federal policy choices have raised energy prices, leading to       higher costs for everything from food to used cars. And yet       this legislation will further exasperate that pain through a       methane tax on oil and gas.        The Consumer Price Index is at a 31-year high, and unlikely       to reach historical norms any time soon, having risen 6.2%       since this time last year. Inflation is a hefty tax on every       American's paycheck.        While certain funding increases or newly created programs       may, by themselves, be commendable, the totality of the       increased federal spending in this bill coupled with the       enormously burdensome tax increases leveled on businesses and       individuals to pay for it will stifle economic growth and       destroy jobs. Ultimately, the result could be the       consolidation or sale of family farms and ranches.        The legislation also seeks to raise revenue by increasing       fines and penalties as much as ten times their current amount       for violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,       Fair Labor Standards Act, and Migrant and Seasonal       Agricultural Worker Protection Act. The missteps of farmers       and ranchers when navigating complex, oftentimes onerous       regulations and laws should not serve as a funding mechanism.       While Farm Bureau does not condone bad actors when it comes       to appropriately managing safety, the seasonal workforce, and       employee pay on the farm, fines associated with OSHA, FLSA,       or MSPA violations should not be determined based on their       ability to serve as a pay-for in a partisan legislative       process. If enacted, these provisions could put well-meaning       farmers and ranchers out of business.        While some elements of the reconciliation package would       benefit agriculture, the massive amount of spending and tax       increases required to pay for the plan outweigh the gains we       would see in rural America. Also, the manner in which they       were crafted is concerning. The agriculture industry and the       committees of jurisdiction have held to a long tradition of       bipartisanship that we have seen erode over this past year.       We hope this does not negatively impact future farm policy       discussions.        In addition, the best policy is that which is discussed in       an open and transparent manner with input from a variety of       stakeholders. Reconciliation has been anything but       transparent with billions of dollars not even discussed by       the committees of jurisdiction. This should concern all       advocates of good and responsible government.        The economy is still recovering from the pandemic, supply       chains are stressed, and inflation is putting pressure on       America's pocketbooks. Now is not the time to put an       additional burden on families struggling to make ends meet.       After watching months of contentious, partisan debate       surrounding the Build Back Better Act, Farm Bureau can only       stand in opposition to the legislation.            Respectfully,                                                      Zippy Duvall,                                                         President.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 381.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   So America, the results are in, and now we know it was all nonsense,  just nonsense. The claim that this costs zero and reduces the national  debt? Nonsense.   This bill, even counting the budget gimmicks, is several hundred  billion dollars short today, and the independent Committee for a  Responsible Federal Budget says over 10 years it is closer to $3  trillion in national debt.   It won't tax the middle class? Nonsense.   The Joint Committee on Taxation and the liberal Tax Policy Center  both confirm that up to one-third of middle-class Americans will see a  tax increase starting next year.   This will make the wealthy pay their fair share? More nonsense.   Two out of three millionaires in America will see a huge tax cut in  this bill.   And this will reduce inflation? Nonsense.   Even the President's own favorite analyst, Moody's, admits that  Americans ought to brace for higher prices for the next decade because  of this bill and the infrastructure bill and the COVID stimulus bill.    But there is more than just nonsense in this bill. There are  dangerous provisions dealing with the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time I will offer a motion to  recommit the bill to the Budget Committee.   I will also ask to include the text of an amendment in the Record  that I would have offered had the rules allowed me to offer  instructions with my motion to recommit.   And my amendment is simple. It stops Democrats from unleashing 80,000  new IRS agents on American taxpayers. And more importantly, it blocks  the House and the Senate from ever imposing a dangerous bank  surveillance scheme targeting America's families, farmers, and small  businesses.   The truth is the IRS doesn't need your private information. It has a  record of targeting Americans based on their political beliefs. In  fact, this year, they discriminated against a nonprofit focused on  biblical teachings and continues to fail to stop massive leaks of  private taxpayer returns to the media.   Our Democratic colleagues claim bank surveillance is not in there.  Yet. The Biden White House is still insisting.   So join with us, accept this motion, and stop it right now, once and  for all.   Mr. Speaker, you know, Americans need to know what is in this bill.  And under this $4 trillion Biden-Pelosi scheme, let's look at a day in  your life.   So you wake up in the morning and pay a ``heat your home tax.'' You  shower and get ready and pay a consumer products tax.   You drop your kids off at childcare and pay a ``toddler tax.''   You drive to work paying higher gas prices. You take a break and pay  a bigger nicotine tax. At work your company pays a Made in America tax,  a ``small business surtax,'' or a tax on your retirement plan.   On the way home, you swing through your pharmacy and pay a ``no  generics'' tax. Stop for groceries and pay the ``Bidenflation'' tax on  everything you need. And then you get your mail on the way home, and  you get a letter from the IRS; you are being audited.   And then you are getting the kids ready for bed, and you realize  Democrats are forcing you to send $12,500 of your taxes to the wealthy  neighbor to subsidize their luxury Beemer electric vehicle.   Plus, they are getting a massive SALT tax windfall for the wealthy  while you get nothing, except 80,000 new IRS agents to make sure ``you  pay your fair share.''   So when your head finally hits the pillow, as you lie awake in bed  too worried to sleep in a community less safe, in housing more  expensive, in a country that lurches from crisis to crisis, ask  yourself this question: Under Joe Biden is my life truly built back  better?   Americans already know the answer, and that is why this President's  polling is at the bottom of the heap and why Americans have lost any  confidence in his competence to heal this economy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the chief minority whip of the Republican  Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), Republican leader of our Conference.
