 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to one of  the many important provisions of today's legislation. In particular, I  rise to discuss Section 1109 of Title XI of Division FF, relating to  aquatic ecosystem protection, which comes from the FUTURE Western Water  Infrastructure and Drought Resiliency title that I authored in H.R. 2  earlier this year.   Today's provision is an improved version of that legislation, and it  is the result of the ongoing bicameral water infrastructure  negotiations between the committees of jurisdiction. I am grateful for  the work done on both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle  to bring this to fruition. This aquatic ecosystem protection provision  is designed to fund broadly-supported fish passage projects in the  western states, and the specific intent is to help projects like the  one in the Eel and Russian River basins in California, where we have a  chance to significantly improve fish passage and habitat on the Eel  River while providing long term certainty and reliability for Russian  River water users.   The Potter Valley Project Ad Hoc Committee has been refining this  effort for several years, and we now have a Two-Basin Partnership that  is taking the next steps. The intent of this new aquatic ecosystem  protection statute is to support the important work of the Two-Basin  Partnership, as well as other community-supported restoration projects  like it around the west.   I am including in the Record letters of support from the Round Valley  Indian Tribes, Humboldt County, Sonoma County Water Agency, Mendocino  County Inland Water and Power Commission, and California Trout-- collectively known as the Two-Basin Partnership--as well as from the  Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, and California Trout--collectively  known as the California Salmon and Steelhead Coalition.   I thank my colleagues for working with me to bring this legislation  to fruition, and thank the staff in both the House and Senate who have  helped in this effort, especially Matthew Muirragui from the House  Natural Resources Committee and John Driscoll, Logan Ferree, and Ben  Miller on my personal staff. I look forward to working with the next  administration to support this win-win outcome for the North Coast and  North Bay.         Dear Chairman Huffman: The Round Valley Indian Tribes,       Humboldt County, Sonoma County Water Agency, Mendocino County       Inland Water and Power Commission, and California Trout,       collectively known as the Two-Basin Partnership, write in       strong support of the aquatic ecosystem restoration provision       included in H.R. 2, which we understand you and your staff       have negotiated for inclusion in the omnibus appropriations       bill.        The Potter Valley Project is a hydroelectric facility that,       in addition to generating a small amount of electricity,       diverts water from the Eel River into the Russian River       basin. The Project's main facilities include two dams on the       Eel River, a diversion tunnel and a hydroelectric plant.       Citing economic concerns, current Project owner Pacific Gas &       Electric announced in January 2019 that it would not seek a       new license from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to       continue operating the facilities. PG&E's decision to not re-      license the Project left an uncertain future for both Eel and       Russian River interests. Instead of leaving it up to the       utility and federal regulators to determine the region's       water future, local leaders decided to work together to       protect the interests of both river basins. The Two-Basin       Partnership is a direct outgrowth of that collaborative       effort, which brought together diverse stakeholders to       develop a compromise solution for the future of this aging       and non-economically viable hydroelectric project.        The Partners have joined together as the applicant for the       Project, with the collective goal of restoring 288 linear       river miles of spawning habitat at the headwaters of the Eel       through the removal of Scott Dam, while ensuring water supply       reliability on the Russian River. Additional components of       the proposed Project Plan include improving a water diversion       infrastructure at Cape Horn Dam and developing infrastructure       to provide water to meet summer irrigation needs for farmers       and ranchers in Potter Valley.        As you know, this legislation would directly support the       Two-Basin Solution's shared objectives, which include:       minimizing or avoiding adverse impacts to water supply       reliability, fisheries, water quality and recreation in the       Russian River and Eel River basins; improving fish passage       and habitat on the Eel River sufficient to support recovery       of naturally reproducing, self-sustaining and harvestable       native anadromous fish populations including migratory access       upstream and downstream at current project dam locations; and       protecting tribal cultural, economic, and other interests in       both the Eel and Russian River basins.        On behalf of the Two-Basin Partners, we strongly support       this inclusion and your continued support of our efforts on       the Eel and Russian Rivers.            Sincerely,      Kathleen Willits,        Councilmember, Round Valley Indian Tribes.      Grant Davis,        General Manager, Sonoma Water.

Curtis Knight,        California Trout.                                   ____                                                                                    December 18, 2020.        Dear Chairman Huffman: The Nature Conservancy, Trout       Unlimited, and California Trout, collectively known as the       California Salmon and Steelhead Coalition, write in strong       support of the aquatic ecosystem restoration provision       included in H.R. 2, which we understand you and your staff       have negotiated for inclusion in the omnibus appropriations       bill.        The Coalition is a strategic partnership founded to       increase streamflows in California's North and Central Coast       watersheds, with the goal of restoring and protecting wild       salmon and steelhead and creating water reliability for       people. We are working toward a California where water use       management harmonizes and meets the needs of people, needs of       fish and ecosystems. It is for these reasons that the       Coalition is working together to support the Potter Valley       Project relicensing effort as a major restoration       opportunity.        The current Potter Valley Project Plan is built around a       unique collaboration among conservationists, county       governments, tribes, farmers and other water interests to       shape a new future for the Project, a set of obsolete       hydroelectric facilities in the upper Eel River and Russian       River Watersheds. This effort, if successful, will implement       one of the largest dam removals in the history of the United       States while strengthening the security of local water       supplies.        The project consists of two dams on the upper Eel River--      Scott and Cape Horn--as well as a system of trans-basin       tunnels that divert approximately 60,000 acre-feet of water       per year from the Eel to the Russian to generate       hydroelectric power. This water ultimately flows to       agricultural and municipal users in the Russian River       Watershed. But, perhaps more importantly, the project blocks       fish from reaching 288 linear stream miles above Scott Dam       that were once the spawning grounds for some of the largest       salmon and steelhead runs in California.        In January 2019, PG&E chose to discontinue its efforts to       renew the project's license, which expires in 2022, from the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This left the       door open for a different entity to license the project.       Seeing this as an opportunity to remove the dams blocking the       headwaters of the Eel River, California Trout joined with a       diverse coalition--Sonoma Water, Mendocino County Inland       Water and Power Commission, and Humboldt County--to notify       FERC that they would explore taking over the re-licensing of       the project. Over the subsequent year, those parties--joined       by the Round Valley Tribe--worked with a team of technical       consultants to develop a proposed plan to take over the       project and implement a ``Two-Basin Solution'' that would       remove Scott Dam, improve fish passage at Cape Horn Dam and       build new infrastructure to deliver secure water supplies to       farmers who currently rely on the project.        In the spring of 2020, the three Coalition groups helped       negotiate an initial plan proposing the removal of Scott Dam       and the implementation of a Two-Basin Solution to modernize       this project to improve water supply reliability for farms       and communities in the Russian and Eel River Basins; the plan       will also help to restore struggling salmon and steelhead       runs by reconnecting the river to its headwaters. In April       the Coalition secured a $1.1 million CDFW grant that will be       used to develop that proposal into a complete re-licensing       plan. We have also made inroads with the communities that       would be most affected by dam removal and lobbied for state       and federal funding that will be needed to further develop       and implement the plan.  [[Page H7313]]         We strongly support the inclusion of aquatic ecosystem       restoration funding in the omnibus that could facilitate the       watershed-level restoration of a key salmon river in       California. Thank you for your leadership and support.            Sincerely,      Curtis Knight,        Executive Director, California Trout.
