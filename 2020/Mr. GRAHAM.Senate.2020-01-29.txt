 I send a question to the desk from myself and Senator  Cruz.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Graham and Senator Cruz pose this question  for the House managers:         In Mr. Schiff's hypothetical, if President Obama had       evidence that Mitt Romney's son was being paid $1 million per       year by a corrupt Russian company--and Mitt Romney had acted       to benefit that company--would Obama have authority to ask       that that potential corruption be investigated?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. First of all, the hypothetical is a bit off  because it presumes in that hypothetical that President Obama was  acting corruptly or there was evidence he was acting corruptly with  respect to his son. But, nonetheless, let's take your hypothetical on  its terms.   Would it have been impeachable if Barack Obama had tried to get  Medvedev to do an investigation of Mitt Romney, whether it was  justified or unjustified? The reality is, for a President to withhold  military aid from an ally--or, in the hypothetical, to withhold it to  benefit an adversary--to target their political opponent is wrong and  corrupt--period, end of story.   If you allow a President to rationalize that conduct, rationalize  jeopardizing the Nation's security to benefit himself because he  believes that his opponent should be investigated by a foreign power,  that is impeachable.   If you have a legitimate reason to think that any U.S. person has  committed an offense, there are legitimate ways to have an  investigation conducted. There are legitimate ways to have the Justice  Department conduct an investigation.   I would suggest to you that for a President to turn to his Justice  Department and say, ``I want you to investigate my political rival,''  taints whatever investigation they do. Presidents should not be in the  business of asking even their own Justice Department to investigate  their rivals.   The Justice Department ought to have some independence from the  political desires of the President, and one of the deeply troubling  circumstances  [[Page S656]]  of the current Presidency is you do have a President of the United  States speaking quite openly, urging his Justice Department to  investigate his perceived enemies.   That should not take place either, but under no circumstances do you  go outside of your own legitimate law enforcement process to ask a  foreign power to investigate your rival, whether you think there is  cause or you don't think there is cause, and you certainly don't invite  that foreign power to try to influence an election to your benefit.   It is remarkable to me that we even have to have this conversation.  Our own FBI Director has made it abundantly clear--and it shouldn't  require an FBI Director to say this--that if we were approached with an  offer of foreign help, we should turn it down. We should, of course,  certainly not solicit a foreign country to intervene in our election.  And whether we think there is grounds or we don't, the idea that we  would hold our own country's security hostage by withholding aid to a  nation at war to either damage our ally or help our adversary because  they will conduct an investigation into our opponent, I can't imagine  any circumstance where that is justified, and I can't imagine any  circumstance where we would want to say the President of the United  States can target his rival, can solicit, elicit foreign help in an  election, can help him cheat and that is OK, because that will  dramatically lower the bar for what we have a right to expect in the  President of the United States; and that is, they are acting in our  interests.    I would say it is wrong for the President of the United States to be  asking for political prosecutions by his own Justice Department. I  would say it is wrong for the President of the United States to ask a  foreign power to engage in an investigation of his political rival,  but, particularly, where, as we have shown here, there is no merit to  that investigation is even more egregious. You know there is no merit  to it because he didn't even want the investigation.   The more accurate parallel, Senator, would be if Barack Obama said: I  don't even need you, Russia, to do the investigation; I just want you  to announce it--because that portrays the fact there was no legitimate  basis, because the President didn't even need the investigation done.  He just wanted it announced. There is no legitimate explanation for  that except he wanted their help in cheating the next election.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Michigan.
