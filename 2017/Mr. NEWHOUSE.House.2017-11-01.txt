 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 595 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 595         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2936) to expedite under the National       Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and improve forest       management activities on National Forest System lands, on       public lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land       Management, and on Tribal lands to return resilience to       overgrown, fire-prone forested lands, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and amendments       specified in this resolution and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided among and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Agriculture and the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural       Resources. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the       amendments in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committees on Agriculture and Natural Resources now printed       in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original       bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule       an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-36. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived.

At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Washington?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, just yesterday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 595, providing for  consideration of an important piece of legislation, H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936 under a structured  rule, with four Democratic amendments made in order and two bipartisan  amendments and one Republican-led amendment made in order.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the  Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, a bill that is critically  important to my district in central Washington State and to rural,  forested districts like it across the United States who continue to  face devastation from catastrophic wildfires as we have seen, just this  last year, a great example of.   This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation is aimed at addressing the  disastrous consequences of wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest  Service and other agencies have to reduce the threats posed by these  wildfires, by insects, by disease infestation, and by dangerous old  forest overgrowth that serves as a literal tinderbox for wildfires.  This legislation will expedite and improve forest management activities  in Federal forests to counteract these threats.   This legislation, spearheaded by my friend and colleague from  Arkansas, Representative Bruce Westerman, who is a trained forester  himself, is comprised of a truly comprehensive effort developed here in  the people's House. It is bipartisan. This bipartisan support  demonstrates that the threat of catastrophic wildfires does not just  impact a red or a blue district, but, rather, it poses a threat to  communities across the United States.  [[Page H8310]]                                     time  1230    H.R. 2936 would provide Federal land management agencies immediate  tools to increase the pace and the scale of forest management projects  to dramatically improve the health and resiliency of our national  forests, ensuring robust protection of the environment. Active  management leads to healthier forests. It is that simple.   This legislation also allows expedited review for collaborative  projects in Federal forests and removes incentives for special interest  groups to file frivolous lawsuits. By requiring litigants opposing  active management projects to propose an alternative management option,  we can instill accountability into a system that is wrought with  litigation.   Additionally, the legislation bolsters locally led forest management  and hazardous fuel reduction projects to improve forest health.   By engaging local stakeholders, we can lessen the severity and the  costs of wildfires, while protecting the communities and the  environment.   Mr. Speaker, another major component of our Nation's wildfire crisis  is the broken system with which we fund firefighting suppression. When  these firefighting costs exceed the existing budget, the U.S. Forest  Service transfers funds from other vital forest management program  accounts in order to pay for wildfire suppression. I and a lot of other  people in this Chamber have been outspoken critics of this dangerous  broken cycle known as fire borrowing. That also is a very bipartisan  position that is taken. H.R. 2936 provides a major step forward in  ending this cycle. By raiding accounts that provide for forest  management programs which help prevent wildfires, we tie one hand  behind our back in an effort to both prevent and suppress these  catastrophic wildfires. This legislation will help to put an end to  this longstanding problem.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents know as well as anyone the immense  threat that wildfires pose to local communities. In just the past 4  years, the fourth district of my State, my district, has seen the two  largest fires in Washington State's history. We have lost hundreds of  homes and businesses and structures. My constituents are still  struggling to recover from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014 and the  Okanogan Complex Fire of 2015. We lost three firefighters that year.  That truly is a high cost.   Active forest management is a matter of saving lives and livelihoods,  of protecting our communities, and ensuring our constituents' health  and safety, which is why I am proud to support this rule and the  underlying legislation that it represents today.   Mr. Speaker, as I have often said, we cannot continue to limp from  one devastating fire season to the next. We must take significant steps  toward reforestation, rehabilitation, and overall forest management.  This legislation will allow us to do just that. We must begin to  prevent, to suppress, to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires,  and the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017 will be a momentous  opportunity to turn around our diseased and overgrown Federal forests.  This legislation is essential and desperately needed to change the  current path of forest management on public lands. It is outdated,  unsustainable, and dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for  consideration of this critical piece of legislation that will help  protect our rural communities and ensure that we are prepared to  respond to devastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued  many areas of our country in the last few years.   Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption, I urge my colleagues to  support both the rule and the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my colleague from Florida, I would  like to share one last note. Just a few weeks ago, the new chief of the  U.S. Forest Service, Tony Tooke, came to Capitol Hill and briefed some  of my colleagues, including me, regarding this year's devastating  wildfire season.   He reported to us that over 8 million acres, just this year, have  burned. We have also lost dozens of lives, thousands of homes. Chief  Tooke left us with the stark fact that while more than 8 million acres  burned this year, another 80 million acres across the United States are  at high risk of catching fire--80 million acres. Mr. Speaker, if that  does not show how dire this problem is, then I certainly can't tell you  what does.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that the admonition of  my friend from Florida, that to bring bipartisan proposals forward,  this absolutely is a bipartisan bill; support from both sides of the  aisle, because, as I said in my opening comments, these kind of fires  know no political boundaries, know no political lines. So I am very  happy to report that we have a strong bipartisan effort right here in  front of us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Maine (Mr.  Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, we do deal with a lot of important issues  on this floor. Today we are talking about something that, in this  country, people are losing property, we are losing our natural  resources, and, certainly, people are losing their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx) to talk further on this important topic.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the prime sponsor of the bill in question  today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, to  demonstrate the importance of this particular piece of legislation to  the whole country.    Mr. Speaker, most all Western States were impacted in  one way or another by catastrophic fires this summer. Particularly hard  hit was the great State of Oregon.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Oregon for his passionate words about the  impact of catastrophic fires in his State.   He is right. The fire from Oregon did jump the Columbia River into  Washington, but that is not the only thing that they shared with us  this summer. My own community, the Yakima Valley, was filled with smoke  for probably 6 weeks this summer, causing all kinds of health issues  for the citizens of central Washington, not just from Oregon, but smoke  also from as far away as Montana and Idaho, and other parts of the  Northwest.   In fact, I was just handed a news article, I would like to note, from  the Methow Valley News, which if you have never been to the Methow  Valley, it is one of the most pristine, beautiful places on the face of  the Earth. They are talking about the quality of air in the Methow  Valley in the community of Twisp.   The air pollution in Twisp, Washington, is considered among the worst  in the State, if you can imagine that, in some of the most beautiful,  clean, pristine areas that you can imagine. The air quality, largely  due to these catastrophic fires year round, has been impacted  negatively. That is something that, thanks to the Methow Valley News,  they are making very clear to all of us that we need to do something to  address this particularly important issue.   I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), my neighbor to the east, the Congressperson  from the Fifth Congressional District of the State of Washington.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership on this very important issue.    I am pleased to see this legislation, the Resilient Federal Forests  Act coming to the floor today. I also want to express appreciation to  Representative Westerman for his leadership through the years on this  issue. In recent years, in my home State, as has been mentioned, in  Washington State, we have seen larger and larger devastating wildfires,  breaking all of the records, and it seems like every year they just get  larger and larger, and more devastating.   They impact people's health. It is not unusual now for air quality  warnings to be in eastern Washington, not just for days, but weeks at  end, where it really does impact people's health. It jeopardizes our  safety--the stories of people who are caught in the midst of these  fires--and it is destroying our environment.   We like to think of our forests as being green and healthy stands of  trees, but, unfortunately, today, when you look at these forests,  millions of acres, millions and millions of acres within the U.S.  Forest Service are actually diseased, dying, bug-infested trees.   I had the opportunity to meet with the chief of the Forest Service  just last week, and he said that he estimated 80 million out of the 198  million acres that the U.S. Forest Service owns needs treatment.   The Forest Service has warned us for years that the forests are in  terrible shape. It is really a result of decades of overregulation and  frivolous lawsuits that have hindered forest management, and we are  paying the price.   I represent the Colville National Forest which is about a million- acre forest. It is really the engine of our economy in the Northwest.  Because what happens in the Colville National Forest determines whether  or not we have Vaagen Brothers Lumber, or 49 Degrees North Ski &  Snowboard Resort, or the biomass facility that Avista runs, converting  wood waste into electricity.   This is all providing jobs, energy, recreational opportunities, yet  mills have been closed, and jobs have been lost. It is unacceptable. It  is time to pass the Resilient Federal Forests Act legislation.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentlewoman from  Washington State for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington has 3\1/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly show this is an example of some  of the fire damage. If you can see that, this is from the Carlton  Complex Fire that happened 3 years ago in my district in central  Washington, taken just yesterday.   The Carlton Complex burned through State, private, and Federal lands.  So you can see that these dead, fire-damaged trees have not been  logged, they have not been removed, and what they do is provide the  kindling for the next catastrophic fire.   So that is what we are talking about here, not disarming local  communities but actually arming them and giving them the ability and  the tools that they need in order to prevent these catastrophic fires.   I would invite the good gentleman from Florida to come with me to  witness firsthand the devastation and the potential devastation that we  have and to really understand the nature of the issue. I would  reciprocate with a visit to his State to see the damage done by the  devastating hurricanes as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the newspaper article from the  Methow Valley News, dated October 27.                [From the Methow Valley News, Oct. 27, 2017]                Smoke Is a Year-Round Problem in the Valley                             (By Ann McCreary)         Autumn in the Methow Valley brings cool, crisp weather,       bright days and colorful foliage. And smoke. Just like every       other season of the year.        The Methow Valley's clean, clear air--one of its key       attractions--is anything but clean and clear for extended       periods of the year. In fact, the Methow Valley has four       seasons of smoke, said Liz Walker, head of the Methow Valley       Clean Air Project.        And it is not insignificant amounts of smoke, Walker said.       Air pollution in Twisp is among the worst in the state, based       on data from the Washington Department of Ecology.        Each season in the Methow Valley brings its own source of       air pollution. In recent years, the all-too-familiar pall of       wildfire smoke has hung over the valley for days or weeks       during summer. As wildfires are put out by cooler, wet       weather of fall, the valley enters another phase of smoke       produced by prescribed burning in national forests, outdoor       burn piles and wood stoves for home heating.        In spring, prescribed burning begins again, as well as more       burn piles. ``Maybe a respite in June and early July, and       then wildfire season will be upon us,'' Walker said.        Although wildfire season can bring health-threatening       amounts of smoke to the valley, like last summer's Diamond       Creek Fire, poor air quality is a real concern in winter as       well, Walker said. ``We're susceptible to inversions and       stagnation in the winter months'' that trap wood stove smoke       on the valley floor, she said.        Smoke is the air pollutant of greatest concern in the       Methow Valley, and is monitored by the Department of Ecology.       It is known as PM2.5, which means particulate matter that is       2.5 microns or smaller. These tiny particles are most       frequently caused by incomplete combustion, and can stay       airborne and can travel long distances, increasing the       likelihood that humans and animals will inhale them.        Data collected by a Department of Ecology air monitor in       Twisp ranked air quality at that site among the eight most-      polluted places in the state in 2016, Walker said. ``By       several of the measures the Department of Ecology uses to       look at PM2.5 pollution reported at air quality monitors       across the state, Twisp ranks among the worst in air       pollution--worse than metro Seattle or Tacoma. This is even       after PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is subtracted out,'' Walker       said.        There was insufficient data from the air pollution monitor       in Winthrop to assess air quality there last year, ``but it       is typically only slightly better than Twisp,'' Walker said.                                 Public cost         ``Our valley cares a lot about this, and we're working       together to improve it. There's a real public health cost to       air pollution. Anyone who has sat around a campfire, or gone       for a strenuous hike on a smoky day has had a firsthand       lesson in the toxicity of smoke,'' Walker said.        Walker's concern about health impacts come from her       training as an environmental health toxicologist. Harmful       effects range from the inability to exercise outdoors, to       respiratory distress and infections, to increased risk of       cancer.        ``For vulnerable populations--babies, children, pregnant       women, elders, and anyone with heart or lung issues--bad air       days can mean serious health repercussions. For everyone,       chronic exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can potentially       trigger or exacerbate conditions such as headaches, asthma,       bronchitis and cardiovascular disease.''        There are economic costs of air pollution in the Methow       Valley as well, she said. ``We're a tourist economy,       dependent on the natural beauty of the valley,'' Walker said.        The Methow Valley Clean Air Project was launched in 2015 by       Raleigh Bowden, a local physician, after she saw people       suffering health effects of poor winter air quality, Walker       said. A key goal of the project is improving air quality       during the home heating season, October through March.        ``Due to our valley's frequent winter inversions, smoke       from woodstoves and outdoor burning pollutes our air to       frequently unhealthy levels,'' Walker said. ``We've focused       on the home heating season because this is when we can make       behavioral changes to improve our air quality. This is a       controllable source of pollution, as contrasted with       pollution from wildfires.''        The Clean Air Project outlines measures residents can take       to reduce pollution from wood stoves, including: Properly       season wood so that it is dry and burns cleaner; clean       chimneys yearly; build small, hot fires and don't damp them       down; comply with burn bans; upgrade to certified stoves or a       wood-burning alternative; weatherize homes.        The organization is also working to reduce outdoor burning       of yard waste and provide alternatives, including       ``vegetation drives'' sponsored by the Clean Air Project,       Walker said.                              Successful drives         Vgetation drives, supported by grants and partnerships,       were held in the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017, and another       drive is scheduled next spring. Past drives have collected       about 20 tons of vegetation, which prevented hundreds or       thousands of hours of smoke, Walker said.        The yard waste was dropped off by residents and hauled to       the county landfill during the first drive, conducted over       two days. During the second drive, conducted over eight days       in partnership with the Town of Twisp, residents delivered       vegetation to a site near the Twisp wastewater treatment       plant, where it was chipped and offered free for landscaping       and mulching.        ``The most unusual community participant brought his load       strapped to the back of his bicycle--now that's commitment to       clean air!'' Walker said.        The Clean Air Project also partnered this year with the       Pine Forest Homeowners Association to provide support for       chipping branches and slash created when underbrush and trees       were thinned and limbed as part of Pine Forest's ongoing       Firewise efforts. The debris would otherwise have been       burned.        Next spring's vegetation drive will be conducted in       partnership with the Okanogan Conservation District, Walker       said. She suggested that residents who have been accumulating       yard waste cover their piles this fall instead of burning       them, and haul them to the vegetation drive in the spring to       be chipped.        Walker acknowledged that it takes extra effort, and a       different mindset, to participate in a vegetation drive       rather than burn yard waste. ``It's hard. Our valley is long.       It requires a truck, loading it up and hauling it in,'' she       said. ``People have been outdoor burning in the valley       forever. It's how you get rid of your stuff when you live out       in the country.''        However, Walker said, many valley residents have been       supportive of the vegetation drives. ``People really       appreciate this as an option. They don't want to impact the       health of families and the community,'' she said.        For people who want to continue the longstanding local       tradition of burning yard waste, the Clean Air Project       suggests ``best practices for burning outdoors in the most       safe and clean way,'' Walker said.        ``Make sure the pile is as bone dry as possible. Make sure       you know what is a good day, with good ventilation, but not       too much wind. We've interacted with Fire District 6 and       smokejumpers. There are lots of folks with tons of knowledge       about how to build a hot, clean pile,'' she said.        The Clean Air Project is overseen by a volunteer advisory       group. The Methow Valley Citizens' Council is fiscal sponsor       for the organization. More information is available on the       Methow Valley Clean Air Project Facebook page.   [[Page H8316]]          Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida for  today's debate.   The issue of proactive management of our Nation's Federal forests is  critically important to the future and economic well-being of our whole  country as well as to the health of our Federal lands and safety of our  rural communities.   Let me say that, if you have never been through a rural community  that has had to face the devastation of a catastrophic fire, you are  welcome to come to the State of Washington and see firsthand exactly  the kind of damage that these fires can do.   This is of the highest priority, and I urge all my colleagues to  support this rule as well as the underlying bill in order to combat  these catastrophic wildfires and reform the way in which we manage our  forests.   This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2936, the Resilient  Federal Forests Act of 2017. This is bipartisan, it is comprehensive,  and it aims at addressing the disastrous consequences of catastrophic  wildfires by utilizing the tools the Forest Service and other agencies  have to reduce the threats posed by these fires, by insects, by disease  infestation, and by dangerous old forest overgrowth.   As I said, my district in central Washington and millions of acres  across our great country continue to face this threat. We must take  steps to prevent and address these fires, which this bill will do by  reforming the way we prepare for, respond to, and fund wildfire  response and mitigation efforts. These threats will only continue to  worsen not only for my constituents, but for people all around the  country.   We are recognizing sustained drought conditions. Mismanagement and  failure to conduct maintenance of our forests on Federal lands will  continue to plague this issue. The underlying legislation is essential  and desperately needed to change the outdated, unsustainable, and  untimely dangerous system of Federal forest management on these lands.   Mr. Speaker, this is a straightforward rule allowing for  consideration of a critical piece of legislation that will help protect  our rural communities and ensure we are prepared to respond to these  devastating, catastrophic fires.   I appreciate the discussion we have had today. I believe that this is  a critical measure, and I urge my colleagues to support House  Resolution 595 and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 595 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time to consider H. Res. 599 in the House, if called up by  the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or his designee; that the  resolution be considered as read; that the previous question be  considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to adoption  without intervening motion or demand for division of the question  except for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  Representative Royce of California and Representative Khanna of  California or their respective designees; and that notwithstanding any  previous order of the House, the provisions of section 7 of the War  Powers Resolution, 50 U.S.C. 1546, shall not apply to H. Con. Res. 81.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Washington?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
