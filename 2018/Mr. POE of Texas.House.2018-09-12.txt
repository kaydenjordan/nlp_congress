 Mr. Speaker, there is a battle brewing back home in  Texas. According to news reports, it seems that some in our education  system have taken issue with one of the most treasured and significant  historical letters in Texas history, Lieutenant Colonel William Barrett  Travis and his passionate plea in his letter ``to all the people of  Texas and all Americans in the world.''   To add insult to injury, they have also called into question the  heroic nature of Travis and the 187 volunteers who sacrificed their  lives at the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836.   A committee evaluating the State's history curriculum standards has  proposed that we eliminate the study of Travis' historical ``Victory or  Death'' letter. They have also recommended that we remove the word  ``heroic'' from the curriculum because it is a value-charged word, a  hero and the heroes of the Alamo.   Well, to quote Travis, I have a value-charged word or two to say  about that: ``Victory or death,'' Mr. Speaker. These are the most  iconic words in Texas history. That is our battle cry and has been our  battle cry since 1836. It is who we are.   Texas' defiant, independent nature was born from those words of that  letter written from behind the walls of a besieged Alamo mission in  Bexar, Texas. The words on that paper are as much a part of who we are  as the blood that runs through our veins.   We shall ``never surrender or retreat,'' to quote Travis. We cannot  allow political correctness to rewrite any history or, in this case,  edit history.   Maybe they didn't take Texas history from Mrs. Wilson, like I did.  However, it seems now that this committee is walking back that original  suggestion.   Whatever the case, the Travis letter is every bit the core and soul  of freedom as the words of Jefferson in the Declaration of  Independence. He says: ``I have answered that demand with a cannon  shot, and the flag still waves proudly over the north wall. I shall  never surrender or retreat.''   Mr. Speaker, history is the greatest teacher we have. Book burners  who want to erase from textbooks ``the establishment of the Republic of  Texas brought civil, political, and religious freedom to Texas'' are  just trying to ignore history.   Those elites who want to rip the Travis letter from our Texas history  books dishonor the sacrifice of 187 freedom fighters at the Alamo, of  all races, from most of the States and several foreign countries,  including Mexico. These individuals gave their last full measure of  devotion to liberty.   Webster's dictionary may not define ``hero'' with the names of those  who died March 6, 1836, at the Alamo, but it should.   Travis isn't just my favorite hero. He has intertwined himself  throughout my life. He is the inspiration of why I am a lawyer. He was  a lawyer.   My first grandson is named Barrett Houston. And inscribed along the  bottom of my stationery are the words, ``I shall never surrender or  retreat.''   Travis' letter hung on my wall of the courtroom in Texas and still  hangs in my office today in D.C.   Because of men like William Barrett Travis and the Alamo defenders,  we are called the great State of Texas. Travis' legacy embodies the  passion and loyalty that makes Texans stand out in the world. To  consider anything to the contrary is a disgrace.   We must preserve one of our greatest treasures in Texas history so  that future generations can learn the meaning of ``what is due to his  own honor and that of his country.'' God and Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Travis letter.                                        Commandancy of The Alamo                                             Bejar, Feby. 24th. 1836        To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World--Fellow       Citizens & compatriots--        I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under       Santa Anna--I have sustained a continual Bombardment &       cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man--The enemy has       demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison       are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken--I have       answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still       waves proudly from the walls--I shall never surrender or       retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of       patriotism & everything dear to the American  [[Page H8110]]       character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch--The enemy       is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to       three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is       neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as       possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due       to his own honor & that of his country--        Victory or Death.                                            William Barrett Travis.                                                    Lt. Col. comdt.        P.S. The Lord is on our side--When the enemy appeared in       sight we had not three bushels of corn--We have since found       in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20       or 30 head of Beeves.        Travis.     And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, more than a century ago, one of the  most horrific genocides in history took place as the world was fixated  on the Great War raging in Europe.   The Ottoman Empire and its successor state, the modern Republic of  Turkey, have always denied the atrocities they committed against the  Armenian people.   For too long, our own government has played along with Turkey. We  have allowed politics to blind us from the mass murder of 1\1/2\  million innocent Armenians by the Ottoman Turks. We must officially  recognize this horrific crime to prevent similar events from occurring  again. This also means pressuring the Turks to acknowledge their past  sins.   Turkey, under dictator Erdogan, has proven to be an oppressor of his  own people. Today, we see him adopt similar brutality against the Kurds  that was applied to the Armenians more than a century ago.   This behavior is unacceptable by a NATO member and a supposed  American ally.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
