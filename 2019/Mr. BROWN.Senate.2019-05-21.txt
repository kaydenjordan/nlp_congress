 Madam President, this month I join Senator Grassley of  Iowa and a bipartisan group of my colleagues to recognize May as  National Foster Care Month.   It is an opportunity to acknowledge the millions of foster parents  and children in foster care around the country. More importantly, it is  a call to action. We simply leave too many children behind.   Poverty should never be the reason children are separated from their  parents. There is no dignity in removing children from their mothers or  fathers because they don't have adequate housing or affordable  childcare or jobs that allow them to take time off when their children  get sick.   Right now, child welfare agencies are overwhelmed by the number of  children who enter the system, and the addiction crisis just makes it  worse. In Ohio, parents' substance abuse is listed as one of the causes  for one-third of all children who enter the system. Children who are  already in the system stay there longer, especially teenagers. We have  to do better than that.   Last year, we passed and the President signed the bipartisan Family  First Prevention Services Act, which is an important first step. It has  the potential to change our child welfare system over time. Yet the  changes the Family First Prevention Services Act requires ultimately  have to be made at the State level. We have to make sure that States  have the support they need and that they actually do what the law  requires.   That is why, this month, I introduced the Family First Transition and  Support Act--to help all States transition to the family first era. It  would provide funding for States to recruit and retain quality foster  parents who meet the needs of children. Our bill would expand funding  for kinship support services, which would help family members who raise  children pay for essential needs and services, like childcare,  transportation, and other things.   This is especially important with the rise in having other family  members raise the children because of the addiction crisis. In Ohio,  Arizona, and all over this country, we have seen a big increase in  there being grandparents who raise grandchildren, in large part,  because the children's parents have had addiction issues or have  actually died of overdoses.   The grandparents with the grandchildren face unique challenges and  don't often qualify for the same support as foster parents. It means  that they are going back to work. It may mean that a 68-year-old  grandmother who lives on a pension and thought she was retired has to  go back to work in order to raise this child to make enough money or  has to take money out of her retirement savings.   Relatives' care is vital to keeping kids safe at home and in their  communities. Our bill would provide real funding to get these  grandparents and other family members more support. There is no formula  here, but most of the time, it is better if grandparents can raise  these children rather than send them to foster parents, who are  strangers. The grandparents, obviously, know and love the children. It  doesn't mean foster parents can't, of course, but so often the  grandparents are financially challenged.   I get letters all the time from Ohioans who tell their stories and  ask us to support these family members.   A man from Richland County, where I grew up, wrote to me saying:         I ask that family members be given the same financial aid       as foster parents. Most of the family members are       grandparents or great-grandparents on fixed income with       little or no money.    Another woman from the county just south, Knox County, south of  Mansfield wrote:         I am a grandmother raising my grandson. He is 15 years old,       a great kid, and has been living with me almost all his life.       I lost my beautiful daughter to an overdose.        She was raised in a good home, but was affected by this       disease for the past 9 years. We loved her and miss her every       day.    This letter goes on:         Grandparents that lovingly accept their grandchildren,       under sometimes awful [conditions]--    Just think of that. She is raising a grandson when her daughter died  of an overdose.         Grandparents that lovingly accept their grandchildren,       under sometimes awful circumstances, often don't know what to       do.        Thank you so much for getting this program and money to       support it on board. Grandparents do so much, without much       help.    Last year we were able to break through the partisanship and get the  Family First Act signed into law. This bill is the commonsense next  step.   This Foster Care Month, I hope that my colleagues will live up to  their talking points about supporting children and families. We hear  every day here how much we support children and families. Well, do  something about it. Work with us to pass this bill.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
