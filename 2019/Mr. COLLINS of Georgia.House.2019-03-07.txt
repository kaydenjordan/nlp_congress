 Madam Chair, I just wanted to come down. I  was listening to this debate. Some of it is good-hearted because,  frankly, you just don't want to get so frustrated with a bill that was  so rushed with 600-and-some pages that was not gone through.   I pointed out on the floor yesterday, Madam Chair, that there is a  part of this bill that actually does--go back and read it. The  chairwoman of this great committee, whom I have a lot of respect for  would not have done this, I believe, if she was allowed to have done  this, but it actually criminalizes keeping a 4-year-old from voting.   Now, this amendment is fine, but it goes to this issue: Ten  committees had jurisdiction. One of the biggest was the Judiciary  Committee on which I am the ranking member. We had a hearing, but no  markup--don't want to get close to that; Oversight, hearing, no markup.  This is what happens when you rush bills to the floor.   This is what happens when your agenda is bigger than the process.  This is what happens when you don't care what is on the floor, you just  want a talking point.   If we are going to continue this for 2 years, fine. The American  people will see through this. But I think my ranking member from  committee is correct. You cannot continue to do this and people not  figure out we are not sure what is going on anymore.    This is a frustrating point with this because some of this could have  been caught. We probably still wouldn't have agreed on much of this.  Some of this bill is actually good, Supreme Court ethics and some other  things in here we could have worked on.   But when you come to the floor like this and you don't mark it up and  you do it like this, this is what you get: the hope of a lot of  amendments to clarify, the hope of a lot of amendments to change.   Just do the work of committee. That is what I don't understand.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the chair here, and  I do want to follow up on that.   I think the price of democracy has actually been paid by the blood,  sweat, death, and lives of those who have fought for this country for  over 200-something years.   That is the price of democracy. Those of us who have seen it in Iraq  and other places, while serving there, understand that.   It is not found in a 600-page bill being rushed to the floor, not  going through markup. Let's at least be very honest about that.   I appreciate the gentleman wanting to involve others in that. I  appreciate wanting to make sure that we have young people's  involvement. But we are also, frankly, as Members of this body, given a  great opportunity.   There is not a high school, elementary school, or middle school in  this country that would turn us away. We can go anytime we are in our  district workweeks and encourage those teachers who are trying every  day to teach them reading, writing, and civic responsibility. That is  what our jobs give us the ultimate privilege of doing.   I appreciate the chairwoman of the committee saying that we are going  to have vigorous outreach. She just said: Well, $25 million spread over  the life of this bill is not that much.   It is either a lot of outreach or it is a little bit of money or  really, frankly, it is neither. It is just a feel-good to make sure  that we are getting people involved, which we should be doing.   I don't think I want to join in an attack on teachers, who are trying  their best to instill civics, by saying we are not doing it well  enough, and we are going to give a little bit of money spread out very  thinly across the country to do something that our teachers strive  every day in classrooms to do.   I respect the work of those teachers who are doing that, and I think  Members of Congress ought to be able to go in and do what we do, take  our office and go to the very ones who we are encouraging to show them  that we are human, that we do understand, that we listen, and we answer  all their questions, no matter how small or how large those questions  are.   It is one of the greatest joys that I have, going to these schools  each and every time I can and listening to them and saying: You can do  this.   I was once an intern here, and I share that story. When they come to  my office, they can see that.   That is what it takes.   I appreciate the gentleman's intent. I have never questioned his  intent. I want to see this happen as well. But it also happens many  times in this body. We believe money and a little bit of conversation  has it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I don't know where to begin. I really don't. As Members of Congress  duly elected by a constituency to serve in this body, who come here  with the hope and the thought that we exchange ideas and come to this  body to actually participate, for the second time in 8 weeks, I am here  with my friend from New York debating a resolution that all of us  should have learned in kindergarten: Be nice; don't hate.   This resolution doesn't need to be seven pages. It is just wordy. I  agree with it. We don't need to hate, no matter where it comes from.  But what  [[Page H2549]]  bothers me the most, Mr. Speaker, is what I am finding right here.   Just the other day on this floor, we celebrated the institution of  this body with the dean of the House. We spoke of Mr. Dingell. We spoke  of   Don Young. We spoke about the institution of this House. What is  becoming more and more concerning for me about this process and what  breaks my heart as much as any anti-Semitic thought, any anti-Muslim  thought, any anti-anybody thought, is that we have broken down in this  House.   Last week, we brought to the floor a bill that was supposed to be  about firearms, which my friends across the aisle mistakenly didn't  understand the penalty associated with the bill.   Yesterday, I was just on the floor of this House talking about a bill  that really, because they rushed it through committee, came to the  floor of this House in which, if you keep a 4-year-old from voting, you  are a criminal. This is what happens when we rush.   This week, the entire week almost, has been taken up by sentiments of  a Member that were anti-Semitic, repeating, as Rahm Emanuel said, some  of the ugliest stereotypes that we have had.   But it goes back, again, to my concern here. At 3:20 this afternoon,  I was handed, or at least it was printed, one of the resolutions. I  have three more of this resolution that has taken all week. How long  does it take to figure out ``just don't hate''? How many times, how  many, you know, pages does it take to cite evil is evil?   My heart breaks, Mr. Speaker. My heart breaks for this institution  when we say that we see something that is anti-Semitic, but we say,  well, they may not have known it was. It is anti-Semitic. It is anti- Muslim. It is whatever you want to call it. It is just wrong. My heart  breaks.   Then I find out that we changed it now lately as to add other groups  in here who undoubtedly saw they weren't a part of the group, so we  added in new groups to the list. I guess since we are at it, why didn't  we add Mormons? Why didn't we add Jehovah's Witnesses? They have been  attacked. Mormons have many times been accused of dual allegiance. Ask  a former Presidential candidate.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the Chair and I could engage in a colloquy. He is  a good gentleman from North Carolina. Explain this to me, why it took a  whole week to figure out to say, ``Hate is hate.'' We don't need seven  pages.   We need people to understand that words have consequences; that being  a Member of Congress matters; that being a Member of Congress says that  when you say something, we can debate civilly.   My friends from New York and Maryland, we disagree on most anything.  We could probably disagree about how many clouds are in the sky, about  policy, but it is not a disagreement that hate is hate.                                time  1615    And we shouldn't overlook it and try and lump it with everything else  and give moral equivalency. But here we are again. Here we are again.   Mr. Speaker, I hope we are not here in another 4 weeks, because the  first 8 weeks we have been here twice. Please let us get back to being  the people that this country needs us to be.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I don't think the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler) would question my belief that what happened in  Charlottesville or anywhere else was bad. I don't think he really meant  that, Mr. Speaker, because I do believe it is bad. And I think what is  bad is having to write this thing, seven pages, and having to figure  this out.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to what I was talking about when we  first started this, and being saddened to be here, and also how we are  continually rushing stuff to the floor. I know it is an oversight, but  it goes back to my very first statement here, and, again, I can remind  everyone here, if we wanted to write a simple resolution here, hate is  hate. It is not good. Don't say it. Think about what you are doing. You  could have done this in half of a paragraph.   Not to belittle any of this, this is all wrong, but on page 7, number  7, we have a resolution that says, ``condemns death threats received by  Jewish and Muslim Members of Congress.''   I am a Member who has had someone put in jail for threatening to kill  me and my daughter. Why don't we condemn that? We forgot it. We forgot  it. Like we had other groups in this bill, that we have written three  times, that we had to add because we forgot them. As I mentioned  earlier, why didn't we add Mormons? Why didn't we add Jehovah's  Witnesses?   It is not that the issue here is the hate and what happened and where  it went back to. Our speakers on both sides have gone to the very issue  of why we are here. I go back to the issue of what I talked about  earlier, that I am saddened for the state of our House that we are so  concerned about trying to make talking points and finishing it, that we  rush stuff to this floor. This is not what we do or who we are.   Hate is hate. It is bad. It is wrong. Quit saying it, but don't keep  rushing stuff to the floor when you don't even really understand what  you put in the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from  New York's statement just then. It is frankly a shame that he had to  come say that in this context, but I appreciate what he said because he  is right on. He is correct.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I do again want to go back to  something.   I appreciate the words that have been said here. Again, I cannot  emphasize this enough. It took seven pages to describe what simply can  be said is: Don't hate; watch what you say; you are a Member of  Congress; we deserve better; the House deserves better. When we  understand this, then we can begin to understand.   Also, I want to go back to something that I will hit again. It goes  back to this is again something put together because we couldn't come  to agreement on the very nature of what started this, which was anti- Semitic comments. And having to have some of our Jewish legislators  come down here and condemn that is sad, wanting to have to vote for  something that, at the very heart, tore them apart. You can hear it in  their voices, but yet they have to vote for this.   We also put it together getting it at 3:20 this afternoon. We left  out the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We left out  Wiccans. We left out Jehovah's Witnesses. We left out disabled people  who are often discriminated against and have hateful things said about  them.   We also, in the thing, found out that the only ones we are going to  condemn getting death threats are Jewish Members and Muslim Members. We  are not condemning anything else. This is just another attempt to rush  to do something, to fix something.   I said last week, and I will say it again: What makes you feel good  doesn't always heal you. This is another example of a rush project.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), who is the minority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as we come to the conclusion of our second time doing  this, I will echo the sentiments of our leader who just spoke, and I  will echo the sentiments of most everyone who has spoken here that this  is wrong.   One time, we should learn; two times, we are getting nothing out of  this anymore because, undoubtedly, we are getting no input because we  are just putting everything we can imaginable that we could think of in  a short amount of time unless somebody brought it up into a resolution  and saying: This is hate. We don't need to do this.   We don't need a manual to tell us who we can't hate.   How is it so hard?   Why do we blow process?   Why do we disrespect this institution by bringing together things  that are thrown together at the last minute that leave out death  threats to any other Member besides two groups of Members, that leave  out others who have been hated upon?                                time  1700    It breaks my heart. After just a day or so ago speaking of the  institutional spirit and hearing the dean of this House talking about  working together, it breaks my heart that we are 8, 9 weeks into the  session and this is our largest accomplishment, telling the world:  Don't hate.   That is our largest accomplishment?   Mr. Speaker, my fear is, with this today, I don't want to be here  again. But with the way this was handled, I fear we may be.   We are better than this. This should not be where we are at.   Why do we keep coming back? Because many times, Members forget the  awesome responsibility that they have been given as Members of  Congress.   Our mouths and our tongues can be our greatest enemy. Let us remember  that as we seek guidance each day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
