 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. There is  no question that I want to see legislative solutions here, and I am  actually glad to stand with my colleague from Arizona to talk about how  we get a solution on this issue.   As we have seen from Congress, especially over the last 20 years, the  challenge has been, if Congress does a temporary patch once, it will do  it 20 times again. My concern is for the 7,500 DACA kids who are in my  State of Oklahoma. They are looking for an actual solution. They want a  sense of permanence. Their status has been in limbo since 2012. The  question is, Can we actually resolve this for them?   I have put forward a presentation--Senator Flake has been passionate  about this as well--for those individuals to actually end up toward  naturalization, not to have a temporary patch of just being in limbo  status again. It would be to work them through a process to get them in  a line in which they actually end up in naturalization at the end of  it. At the same time, there would be border security and some other  things that we think would be connected to it. I would like to see us  work through this process to actually get to a resolution. A couple of  Federal courts have pushed back on the administration and have bought  Congress a little more time to be able to resolve this issue. I would  like for us to use the better wisdom of that to actually get to a  solution during this time period.   The goal is: How do we get this resolved?   I am pleased to say the President has moved a long way on this issue.  The President has laid out naturalization for 1.8 million people, has  dealt with border security, and has engaged in a conversation to  actually get it resolved. We had a completely failed effort a couple of  weeks ago with four different proposals coming up, with all four of  them getting bipartisan support, but with all four of them failing. I  would love to see us get on any one of them and start amending it.   The Senator from Arizona and I have already had conversations about  changes that I would like to see even in some of the bills that I  supported, but the way to resolve that is get on one of them. Let's  actually start amending one, and at the end of it, let's let this body  work its will. The frustration I have had with this body in these 3  short years that I have been here is, most of the time, we fail to even  debate an issue. When it requires 60 votes to even open debate on  something, we just, simply, start the process, never get 60, never  debate it, never resolve it. Then this body just moves on to another  topic.   I commend my colleague from Arizona for reminding this body again  that we have an unanswered issue still sitting out there that needs to  be resolved. I agree with him completely on that one. Let's get on it.  Let's resolve it long term, and let's provide a sense of permanency to  this solution, not another temporary patch that will end up being the  same temporary patch we will do 3 years from now, 3 years after that,  and 3 years after that.   May I remind our body that we are on our fourth continuing resolution  just this year. We need to resolve this and take the moment to be able  to do that.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2579    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his  request so that the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2579. I further  ask that the pending amendments be withdrawn with the exception of the  Grassley amendment No. 1959. Finally, I ask that the Grassley amendment  be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    I do object.
