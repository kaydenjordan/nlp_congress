 Mr. Speaker, several hundred private aircraft have left  Dubai after a couple of weeks of wining and dining in the hot climate  there in order to tell us how we should live our lives. They want to  tell us how we should cut back or eliminate meat in our diets and how  we should change our agriculture in this country to just be less of it.  I guess they want to put us all on a forced diet, according to their  view of the world.   What does that really mean for us here? Less agriculture and fewer  products grown in this country and in the European countries that want  to play along with the Paris accords and such.   One interesting little fact that gets in the way of all that is that  the U.S. and Europe have already reduced their CO2 emissions  down 10 to 15 percent in the last 2 years. This is without the Paris  accord even having come fully into effect yet.   It is other countries, like Asia, where numbers are dramatically  increasing on CO2.   That assumes that CO2 is actually a problem.  CO2, carbon dioxide, is only represented by 0.04 percent of  our atmosphere. That is 4/100ths of 1 percent is what CO2  makes up.   I talk to people on the street or at gatherings and events where I am  speaking. How much of the air do you think is actually CO2?  They have been hyped so much since grade school. They have kids scared  to death. They say that CO2 is somewhere between 20 and 50  percent. No. It is 0.04 percent.   It is not a poisonous gas. I have had the argument of, well, it is  like having fentanyl in your cereal or something like that. No, it is a  necessary gas for plant life. We are all breathing it in right now. We  are exhaling it right now. There are plants somewhere gladly absorbing  it.   If we go below 0.02 percent, plant life starts dying off. We would be  in a pretty bad way. Yet, the hype over CO2 continues as  they have the COP28 in Dubai. They sit there hatching plans to control  our lives, especially in the Western countries.   The plans for China and places like that continue to ramp up with  more coal power plants and much more use of oil and gas. Oil and gas  have been villainized by California, the EPA, and so many, including an  idea over there that the Arab countries have produced so much  petroleum, so they were supposed to have that conversation at COP28.  They kind of put that off as getting rid of oil and gas.   If we were even to contemplate that, you couldn't do it for at least  four or five decades because we are so engrained with using that  product to do anything--planting crops or transporting anything. If you  got it, a truck  [[Page H6825]]  brought it. It is probably a diesel-powered truck.   You see so many failed efforts to electrify vehicles, cars, trucks,  et cetera. There are a few out there getting around, yes, but not on a  dependable basis to keep our supply chain going.   What we keep learning is that you have elites over at conferences  like this saying that we need to cut back on meat, cut out agriculture.  They want us to cut 30 percent of our agriculture. There is already a  food shortage in much of the world, and even in some of our urban areas  in this country, what we call food deserts.   What is their reality with that? There is no reality to this. This is  a way to control our lives, our choices, as they want to phase out meat  and agricultural products grown in this country.   Do you want to depend on it coming from somewhere else? That works  really great. Wait until they have a food embargo like the fuel  embargoes we had in the 1970s. The rest of the world does not look out  for the needs of the United States like we do ourselves.   It is about time we put aside this nonsense of getting to some kind  of zero output of carbon by 2035 or 2050 or whatever round number they  dream up as a goal. Like my home State of California, they do it all  the time.   At the same time that they are saying less carbon, they are also  taking away the means to produce carbon-free electricity, such as  tearing out the dams on the Klamath River and other dams up in Oregon  and Washington that make clean hydroelectric power, low-cost power.   Why do we need to have our electricity cost so much because of some  people's wild dream, and controlling dream, on eliminating  CO2, which is really not a problem? It is not a poisonous  gas. It is not negative. Carbon is a building block of all of what we  have and what we do.   That isn't talked about a lot. Instead, we hear this side of the room  half the time--it is all about carbon. Every conversation, every  committee has to filter something through climate change. Climate  change is a constant in our lives and on our planet. That reality  doesn't get talked about, it is just hype, hype, hype.   Czar Kerry comes back with more and more ideas on how to control us  and take away the basic sustenance that makes this country strong with  its energy and self-provision of food that keep us strong.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it should be obvious and common sense, but  border security is national security. President Biden's open border  policies have incentivized this historic surge in illegal immigration  at our southern and northern borders.   Since taking office, over 6.4 million illegal crossings have happened  at our southern border; 1.7 million known got-aways have evaded U.S.  Border Patrol and are now in our country.   Every State is now a border State. Every town is now a border town.  They are living in New York. Democrats are proposing that our national  parks be used not for people to enjoy but to house illegal immigrants,  which will only further encourage this crisis.   Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned Biden's border crisis,  but we must stop incentivizing further waves of illegal immigrants by  providing them with free housing.   House Republicans will continue to fight to secure our border and  eliminate the financial burden illegal immigrants are putting on  American taxpayers and our institutions, our towns, our States. That is  why we passed H.R. 2 to secure the border, which is the strongest  border security package in American history.                            ____________________
