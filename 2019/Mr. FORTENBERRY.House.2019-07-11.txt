 Mr. Chair, I want to thank Congressman Thornberry  for the time as well as his leadership, as well as the chair of the  Armed Services Committee, because this is very important.   Recently, I was looking at the photos of the young men and women who  hang on the wall of my office. They died in Iraq--some of them I knew;  some of the families I knew, some I didn't know; some I still stay in  touch with.   At this point, we have lost so much, we have given so much, it is  hard to understand why further engagement is necessary. And yet, of the  many injustices that remain, one, particularly, stands out.   The dark twisted idealogy of ISIS decimated the religious minority  communities, primarily of northern Iraq, almost 4 million persons. ISIS  attempted to exterminate, to kill off Yazidis, Christians, and other  minority populations.   Now, since then, the Iraqi Army, with our support and with the  support of an international coalition, has fought hard and fought ISIS  off. They are gone but not yet exterminated.   We have shifted substantial economic aid, but there is one more thing  we should do: provide security in northern Iraq through the integration  of the religious minorities into the Iraqi Government security forces,  as well as the Kurdish forces.   I thank both the chair and the ranking member for their support.
