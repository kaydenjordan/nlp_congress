 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize J. Gene  Faile for his outstanding career and his impending retirement after 30  years of dedication to healthcare administration.   A veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Faile began his career at Yokota Air  Base in Japan. Afterwards, he earned degrees in finance and business,  and became a sought-after hospital administrator and advisory board  member around the country.   For 10 years, Faile has served as the President of Wake Forest  Baptist Health-Wilkes Medical Center in my district, championing  excellent patient care and strengthening the hospital's finances.  During his tenure, Wilkes County has been blessed by his generosity and  leadership, including with the March for Babies, Wilkes Community  College, Wilkes Chamber of Commerce, and The Health Foundation, Inc.   Although he will be missed in the Fifth District, I wish him and his  wife, Peggy, a wonderful retirement with his family in Raleigh.                            ____________________
