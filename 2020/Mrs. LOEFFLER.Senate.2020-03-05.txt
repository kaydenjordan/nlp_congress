 Mr. President, I was sworn in 2 months ago and left  behind a nearly three-decade business career to serve the people of  Georgia in our Nation's Capital. It is truly my honor to support and  defend the Constitution.   I arrived as impeachment began, one of the most divided and partisan  times in the history of Congress. Now, with impeachment behind us and  the President's having been acquitted, ongoing partisanship is  undermining the American people's access to facts during a public  health emergency.  [[Page S1588]]    What I have seen in the last few weeks has been alarming. Day after  day, I witness exactly why the American people are fed up with  Washington--the partisan rhetoric, the media's sensationalism, the  negative political news--all while America is facing a public health  emergency.   The government at all levels must carry out the responsibility to  keep Americans safe. Federal agencies and the Vice President and our  President are working relentlessly to do just that. We need to be  united in our efforts to protect the health and safety of all  Americans. This is not a time to score political points through  baseless commentary. It is a time for facts.   I hope my colleagues, the media, and political leaders across America  will continue to put Americans first and put politics aside while we  prepare to combat this outbreak.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
