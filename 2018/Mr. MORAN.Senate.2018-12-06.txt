 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  scheduled for 1:45 occur now.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to congratulate  Herb Holzapfel on his retirement as chairman of the Farmers' Rice  Cooperative.   The Farmers' Rice Cooperative has a long and distinguished history  and an equally long history of influential leaders. Herb stands out as  one of those leaders--as one of the very best.   It may seem a little bit odd for a Kansan to be congratulating a  Californian, but in this job as a U.S. Senator and in my earlier days  as a Congressman, as a Member of the House of Representatives, you have  the opportunity to meet lots of wonderful, interesting people. As a  person who is so interested in agriculture, I had the opportunity of  meeting Herb back in my days in the House of Representatives. He is one  of those special people who is a joy to know, and he is someone who has  such a strong passion for agriculture, and so we easily connected.   His love of agriculture, his engagement in the industry, and his work  in the industry have improved the lives of farmers and consumers for  more than 40 years, including 33 specifically with the Farmers' Rice  Cooperative.   Herb is a passionate public servant. His love for public service  dates back to his early moments as a boy when he remembers meeting  Ronald Reagan. That was an inspiration to Herb. As he was attending the  National Scout Jamboree here in the Nation's Capital, which marked the  beginning of a life of serving others, he had the opportunity to become  acquainted with Ronald Reagan.   Herb grew up with a sense of duty. He was drafted and served in the  Vietnam conflict just 1 year after he married Ginger, his wife. Herb  joined the National Guard in the same year and began farming rice. He  was offered a spot in the 1975 warrant officer helicopter training  school, but he had to turn it down in order to get his rice harvested.   Herb has always been on the lookout for opportunities to serve other  people and has never shied away from hard work. His father would always  tell him that in order to make something better, a person has to be  involved. Herb took that message to heart and committed himself to  doing things in the right way--to being fully involved.   Herb joined the Farmers' Rice Cooperative in 1985 and became a board  member that same year. In 1998 he was elected chairman of the board and  has served in that position since then. For 20 years, Herb has fought  for the rice producers and has led and represented them in such a fine  fashion. Herb has always focused on finding solutions that will make  sure that the next generation of farmers and ranchers is better off  than the last.   To accomplish that, he has worked with many Members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle. As chairman of the co-op, Herb has spent a  significant amount of time in Washington, DC, doing just that-- representing agricultural producers in the Halls of Congress. He is one  of the most genuine people I have ever met. If you meet Herb, you will  remember Herb. He goes out of his way to build genuine relationships  with Members of Congress, and he knows the importance of our staffs. He  has become a trusted adviser and a source of wisdom and good advice to  many people in Washington, DC. In so many ways, that includes me. There  has been no better ambassador for agriculture, especially for rice,  than Herb. It is not uncommon for Herb to take an incoming call from DC  while he is on his tractor back at the ranch.   Herb's legacy at the Farmers' Rice Cooperative is one of his great  achievements. He has assisted in the reforming of the cooperative over  the past 30 years and has impacted every facet of the company, from  dealing with the leadership of the co-op down to the nuts and bolts of  the rice mill. He is one who has shown me how rice is grown, which is  necessary, because no Kansas farmer knows how to grow rice. His goal  has been to leave the company and the industry better than he found it.   I will tell you, Herb, you have achieved that goal in spades.   As I said earlier, Herb never shies away from hard work. This means  he will not be slowing down but only changing directions. He will  continue to work on the Farm Credit Council's board of directors, which  he has been a part of since 2012. Herb's impact on the world of  agriculture will continue to be felt for years to come through his work  at the Farmers' Rice Cooperative and at the Farm Credit Council.   I thank Herb for his years of advocacy on behalf of agriculture,  rice, and all of the things that agriculture is comprised of, including  wheat and cattle and corn in Kansas. He made the case for all of us-- for our farmers and our ranchers. I appreciate that very much. I  appreciate his standing side by side and our being a team in order to  see that good things happen in rural America. I wish him the very best  in his new phase of life, and I thank him for his service and his  friendship.                            tribute to bill snyder    Mr. President, last Sunday, Kansas State University Head Football  Coach Bill Snyder announced his retirement, marking the end of his 56- year career coaching football and 27-year tenure in Manhattan, KS.   Coach Snyder made his debut with the K-State football program in  1989. He took the helm of a program that was known as Futility U and  America's most hapless team.   When he arrived, the Wildcats hadn't won a single game in the  previous two seasons and had the most losses of any Division One  football team.   During the now-famous press conference at the early stages of his  tenure at K-State, Coach Snyder remarked that, ``I think the  opportunity for the greatest turnaround in college football exists here  today, and it's not one to be taken lightly.''   Kansans know well today that Coach Snyder lived up to those words.   Coach Snyder boasts a great deal of accolades in his storied career:  215 career wins, 19 bowl game appearances, and two Big 12  championships--which seems especially remarkable, given the state of  the program when he took over as head coach.   Deeply engrained in Coach Snyder's legacy is the work he has done off  the field developing young men, contributing to the community, giving  back, and inspiring so many.   Coach Snyder's ``16 Goals for Success'' have served as guidelines for  his players on and off the field.   Snyder said that if his players followed these goals--goals such as  ``Never Give Up,'' ``Don't Accept Losing,'' and ``Eliminate  Mistakes''--then success would come. His ``16 goals'' represent his own  legendary paradigm--that our work is never over and the journey to  success is never really finished.  [[Page S7344]]    His impact at the university and in Manhattan have reached far beyond  the field, where he has helped to increase student enrollment, boost  the local economy, and fund major renovation projects across K-State's  campus that have allowed for groundbreaking work at the university.   Coach Snyder's involvement, support, and close work with the Johnson  Cancer Center at K-State has helped to advance the groundbreaking,  scientific research being done there that will one day save lives.   His work in the community to mentor young men and women, develop  community leaders, and inspire philanthropy has changed lives across  our State. His focus on ``family'' has created and contributed to a  remarkable culture in Manhattan.   Coach Snyder has had to overcome numerous challenges during his  tenure as a coach, but he has faced those with the same grit and mental  toughness that he has instilled in his players.   Even while battling cancer, coach still hit the road to travel Kansas  on Catbacker tours; he didn't let anyone or anything get in the way of  him meeting with the program's most loyal fans, a large number of them  rural Kansans.   Coach's love for traveling the State and meeting with rural Kansans  is something we both share, but I think often times Kansans might be  more excited to talk about football than politics.   Coach Snyder repeatedly says he came to Kansas State University  because of the people, stayed because of the people, and returned  because of the people.   To get to Manhattan, KS, you take Bill Snyder Family Highway. To go  to a K-State football game, you go to Bill Snyder Family Stadium. On  your way into the stadium, you walk by a larger-than-life statue of  Coach Bill Snyder. His legacy is permanently sealed in the K-State and  Manhattan community.   History will remember Coach Snyder as an incredibly successful  football coach and developer of young men, someone with an  extraordinary work ethic and a high level of integrity.   I appreciate the impact Coach Bill Snyder has had at Kansas State  University. His legacy will be forever enshrined there. Robba and I  wish all the best for Coach, Sharon, and the entire Snyder family in  this new chapter of their lives.   I yield the floor.
