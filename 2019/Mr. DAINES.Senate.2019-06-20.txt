 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Dylan Wichman, of Billings, for his impact on the  Yellowstone community and surrounding areas.   Dylan, only a rising senior at Billings Central High School, earned  second place at the State Science Fair and took first at Montana State  University-Billings' regional fair for his wildfire predictive and  preventative algorithm, FASTCAT. Dylan also participated in the  International Science Fair in Phoenix, AZ alongside 1,800 other  students from 80 countries. Dylan earned third place in his category.   Inspired by the tragic Paradise Fire in 2018, Dylan put in countless  hours to develop FASTCAT. FASTCAT is an algorithm used to predict the  size of wildfires before they even occur, to ensure Montanans will be  safer and more prepared during fire season. Dylan's artificial  intelligence algorithm utilizes a neutral network model, ensuring the  algorithms ability to problem solve as more data is input and analyzed.  His innovative creation is an impressive improvement in Montana's  existing fire safety and prevention programs. Dylan hopes to see his  system implemented State and nationwide and globally in the future.  Dylan will continue to work on his program alongside a professor at  University of Montana next year.  [[Page S4166]]    I congratulate Dylan on his outstanding achievements and willingness  to give back to his community. I look forward to seeing his success in  his future endeavors.                            ____________________
