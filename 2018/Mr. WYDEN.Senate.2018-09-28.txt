 Mr. President, I am submitting two letters into the  Congressional Record in order to clarify the application of the  Congressional Review Act, CRA, to the recent rule Rev. Proc. 2018-38,  issued by the Treasury Department and the IRS, to dramatically weaken  the disclosure rules for large contributions to certain tax-exempt  organizations, including many that engage in political activity, what I  and others call the dark money rule. In doing so, I also want to take  the opportunity to comment on the rule itself and on the inappropriate  and irresponsible approach that the administration is taking to the  application of the CRA to the dark money rule.   By way of background, in 1971, as part of a general effort to improve  the ability of the IRS to assure that tax-exempt organizations are  complying with the tax and election laws, the Treasury Department  promulgated a legislative regulation requiring certain tax-exempt  organizations to disclose to the IRS, as part of their annual filing,  the identity of those who contribute $5,000 or more to the  organization. This information is not made available to the public,  except in certain cases, but it is can be used by the IRS, State tax  administrators, and other Federal agencies.   In recent years, this disclosure requirement has become  controversial. Some, particularly conservative groups, have called for  the rule to be repealed in an attempt to keep donor information out of  the hands of State tax administrators and law enforcement. Others have  urged that the disclosure rules be strengthened. I am one of them.  Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, more and more dark money  has flooded into secretive tax-exempt organizations and into election  campaigns in the form of such things as anonymous ``issue ads.'' I have  urged that the contributor information be made available to the public  and, further, that the IRS improve its application of the rules  designed to prevent tax-exempt organizations from engaging in excessive  political campaign activity under false pretenses of ``social  welfare.'' For example, I have been particularly concerned about  reports that a group that is tax exempt under Tax Code section  501(c)(4) that is associated with the National Rifle Association, which  has engaged in extensive political activity, may have received large  contributions from foreign sources.   In the midst of all of this controversy, on July 16, without any  public notice and comment or any consultation with me as ranking  Democratic member of the Finance Committee, the Treasury Department and  the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2018-38, which invokes a narrow provision  that allows the Treasury Secretary to waive particular reporting  requirements in appropriate situations, to effectively repeal the  entire 1971 regulation requiring the disclosure of large contributions.  Perhaps coincidentally and certainly ironically, this was done late in  the evening of the day in which the Justice Department arrested an  alleged Russian agent, Maria Butina, for attempting to influence  American political discourse through a ``gun rights organization,''  later revealed to be the National Rifle Association, a 501(c)(4) dark  money political organization.   This was an outrage. It was terrible policy and a terrible process.  As I said at the time, the political brazenness of this action shocks  the conscience. At a time when the U.S. intelligence community is  warning that foreign actors are actively working to interfere in  American elections, the Trump administration has decided to tie the  hands of the only Federal agency with visibility into financial flows  of foreign funds into dark money political organizations.   When the administration proposed the dark money rule, it submitted  the rule to Congress for review under the CRA, which allows Congress to  disapprove rules after they have been issued. The administration's  submission to Congress explicitly states it was a ``Submission of  Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act.'' Senator Tester and  I were determined to invoke this process in order to overturn the dark  money rule.   There was, however, a procedural problem. The CRA includes a  ``clock,'' limiting the period for challenging a new rule, and, under  the terms of the CRA, that clock begins on the later of the date the  rule is submitted to Congress, and the date it is published in the  Federal Register, ``if so published.'' In this case, apparently for the  first time, we were dealing with a rule that had been submitted to  Congress for review under the CRA but not published in the Federal  Register because this is the sort of material that the IRS publishes in  the Internal Revenue Bulletin IRB, rather than in the Federal Register.  This created a technical question about how to apply the CRA time clock  to the IRS rule. To be clear, the question was not whether the CRA  applied to the dark money rule, but rather, when the clock for  congressional review began.   After consulting with the Parliamentarian, who advised that the CRA  process would be clarified if the IRS would confirm, in writing, that  the rule would not be published in the Federal Register, I sent Acting  IRS Commissioner David Kautter a brief letter asking him to do so. This  seemed to me to be a very straightforward request. The IRS's own  internal procedure manual makes clear that matters that are issued as  ``revenue procedures'' are published in the IRB rather than the Federal  Register. Further, an IRS official had informally confirmed by email  that would be the case here. On top of that, the dark money rule was in  fact published in the IRB on July 30.   I ask unanimous consent that my August 21, 2018, letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               United States Senate,                                            Committee on Finance,                                    Washington, DC, August 21, 2018.      Hon. David Kautter,      Acting Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury           for Tax Policy, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC.        Dear Acting Commissioner Kautter: As you know, on July 26,       the Treasury Department and IRS submitted to the Senate,  [[Page S6381]]       under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), Rev. Proc. 2018-38,       which modifies the information to be reported to the IRS by       certain organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) of       the Internal Revenue Code.        Under the CRA, the period for potential Congressional       review begins on the later of the date of submission to       Congress or publication in the Federal Register, ``if so       published.'' My understanding is that revenue procedures are       not published in the Federal Register but instead are       published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.        In light of this, it would facilitate the Congressional       review process if the IRS would confirm in writing that the       IRS will not submit Rev. Proc. 2018-39 for publication in the       Federal Register. I would appreciate it if you would do so.        Please call me or have a member of your staff contact       Tiffany Smith or Mike Evans of the Finance Committee       Democratic staff if you have any questions.        Thank you for your assistance with this.            Sincerely,                                                      Ron Wyden,                                                     Ranking Member,                                              Committee on Finance.     Mr. President, my letter went unanswered for almost 5  weeks. Eventually, the Parliamentarian indicated to both Democratic and  Republican staff that she was prepared to allow Senator Tester and me  to move forward with a disapproval resolution under the CRA without an  IRS response to my letter, so that we would not lose our right to  challenge the rule on a timely basis. Based on this, on Monday,  September 24, Senator Tester and I submitted our disapproval  resolution, S.J. Res. 64. That same day, I finally received a reply  from Acting Commissioner Kautter. In it, he confirmed, at long last,  the elementary proposition that the dark money rule would not be  published in the Federal Register. In addition, he went on to discuss  an issue I had not raised in my original letter. He stated that,  despite the fact that the administration had formally submitted the  rule to the House and Senate for review under the CRA, understanding  now that Senator Tester and I intended to challenge the rule under the  CRA, the Treasury Department intended to reverse its previous decision  and argue that Rev. Proc. 2018-38 was somehow not subject to  congressional review.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         Department of the Treasury,                                        Internal Revenue Service,                                 Washington, DC, September 24, 2018.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your inquiry regarding       whether the IRS will submit Revenue Procedure 2018-38 for       publication in the Federal Register.        Revenue procedures are not published in the Federal       Register; rather, they are published in the Internal Revenue       Bulletin (IRB). Revenue Procedure 2018-38 was published in       IRB 2018-34 and will not be published in the Federal       Register.        Not all revenue procedures, including many transmitted to       Congress using the form prescribed by the Office of       Management and Budget (OMB), meet the definition of a rule       under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). We define a revenue       procedure as ``an official statement of a procedure by the       Service that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or       other members of the public under the Internal Revenue Code,       related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations, or       information that, although not necessarily affecting the       rights and duties of the public, should be a matter of public       knowledge.'' Chief Counsel Directives Manual (CCDM) section       32.2.2.3.2 (emphasis added). Procedural rules that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of the public       are not subject to the CRA. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C).        We generally submit revenue procedures to Congress and to       the Government Accountability Office (GAO) out of an       abundance of caution and in the interest of keeping Congress       fully informed. This longstanding practice serves two goals.       First, it allows Congress to consider whether a revenue       procedure is subject to the CRA by requesting advice from       GAO. Second, if a revenue procedure meets the definition of a       rule under the CRA, the consequences of failing to submit it       when required are significant. Because rules are effective       only after submission to Congress, a revenue procedure that       is later deemed to be a rule would not be effective if it had       not been submitted following the CRA. Consequently, our       submission of a revenue procedure using the standard CRA form       prescribed by OMB does not necessarily indicate that we have       determined the revenue procedure is subject to the CRA.        We do not believe Revenue Procedure 2018-38 is a ``rule''       within the meaning of the CRA, and we are consulting with GAO       on this matter. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C). In this       revenue procedure, we exercised our discretion under existing       regulations to limit our receipt of personally identifiable       donor information that is not necessary for efficient tax       administration. The revenue procedure did not alter the       substantive standards or criteria that apply to tax exempt       organizations, nor did it alter the requirement that       organizations maintain donor information and submit the       information to the IRS upon request. The revenue procedure       imposed no new substantive burdens and in no way limited       public access to return information that was previously open       to public inspection. For these reasons, we believe Revenue       Procedure 2018-38 is exempt from the CRA.        I hope this information is helpful. If you have questions,       please contact me, or a member of your staff may contact       Leonard Oursler, Director, Legislative Affairs.            Sincerely,                                                  David J. Kautter,                                               Acting Commissioner.     Mr. President, acting Commissioner Kautter's response is  deeply troubling, for several reasons.   First, why did it take so long? Every bureaucracy has its problems,  but almost 5 weeks, on a time-sensitive matter, the answer to which  should be clear in 5 minutes? As I said on the Senate floor last week:  ``It looks to me like the administration has a policy on their hands  that they know is corrupt--that they know is undemocratic. And so  they're playing hide the ball. Because the more the public hears about  this dark money rule, the less they like it.''   Further, the argument Acting Commissioner Kautter makes in the letter  is utter nonsense. In the first place, he mischaracterizes the CRA, in  a way that would render the entire law unworkable. For over 20 years,  here is how the CRA has worked: If the administration submits something  to Congress under the CRA, that is that; it is subject to congressional  review under the terms of the CRA. In the Senate, that means the clock  starts, and the period for the consideration of a disapproval  resolution begins. If, on the other hand, the administration does not  submit a matter under the CRA, but a Senator or Representative believes  that the matter nevertheless should be subject to the CRA, that Senator  or Congressman can ask the Government Accountability Office to review  whether the CRA applies. This has happened about 20 times since 1996.  Congress has never required the GAO to opine on the applicability of  the CRA to a rule formally submitted by an agency to the Congress for  review under the CRA. In Acting Commissioner Kautter's letter, he  fabricates out of whole cloth a new requirement for congressional  review, which runs counter to precedent established over the past two  decades.   Acting Commissioner Kautter takes the position that the  administration's submission of the rule under the CRA is not  dispositive. It is, instead, just a starting point, to, as he writes,  ``allow[ ] Congress to consider whether a revenue procedure is subject  to the CRA by requesting advice from GAO.'' This is unprecedented  because all previous requests to GAO related to matters that had not  been submitted under the CRA. It is inconsistent with the plain text of  the CRA and with longstanding practice, in which we only resort to a  GAO opinion for matters that have not already been submitted under the  CRA. It also is completely unworkable because it would require GAO to  review every rule submitted under the CRA, to confirm that it is indeed  subject to the CRA. Said another way, it would require the Senate to  look behind all 4,271 rules submitted by agencies to the Senate in this  Congress under the CRA to determine if the CRA, in fact, applied. We  cannot have ``do-overs'' here.   Second, Acting Commissioner Kautter's position is inconsistent with  administration practice. In submitting the dark money rule to the  Senate, the administration was not simply trying to be courteous and  transparent, making sure the Senate was aware of the latest  developments at the IRS. It was, instead, complying with the CRA, based  on a determination that the rule was subject to the CRA.   This is reflected in the process established in the Internal Revenue  Manual, IRM. One section of the IRM relates to ``Congressional Review  of Rules.'' After describing the CRA general rule and three exceptions,  the IRM says, ``Revenue rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and  announcements that are rules under the [CRA] must be submitted for  congressional review before they can become effective. Whether a  revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement is  considered a  [[Page S6382]]  rule subject to reporting is determined on a case-by-case basis.  Ministerial revenue rulings and revenue procedures; notices and  announcements relating to error corrections, personnel matters, or  proposed rules; and press releases generally will not be considered  rules under [the CRA].''   Thus, the IRS's own process requires the agency to determine, on a  case-by-case basis, whether a document issued by the IRS constitutes a  rule for purpose of the CRA. The IRS in fact exercises judgment about  whether to submit a revenue procedure as a rule under the CRA: As of  September 10, the IRS had issued 45 revenue procedures in 2018, only 27  of which were submitted to the Senate. Specifically, in this case, on  July 26, over the signature of the Chief of the IRS Publications and  Regulations Branch, the IRS and the Treasury Department submitted, to  Vice President Pence, as President of the Senate, a copy of Rev. Proc.  2018-38, entitled a Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional  Review Act. The submission was docketed in the Senate as EC-6097, and  it was referred to the Finance Committee.   Finally, even if the administration had not submitted the dark money  rule under the CRA, there is no question the rule is subject to the  CRA. The CRA applies to rules as defined under the Administrative  Procedure Act, which states in relevant part that a rule is ``the whole  or part of an agency statement of general . . . applicability and  future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or  policy,'' with three exceptions: rules of particular applicability;  rules relating to agency management or personnel; and rules of agency  organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect  the rights or obligations of nonagency parties.   The dark money rule is clearly a statement of general applicability  and future effect. The only real question, then, is whether it is  subject to one of the exceptions, particularly the exception for  ``rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that [do] not  substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.''   Here, it is clear that the rule has a substantial effect on nonagency  parties. Under the provisions of IRC section 6103, State tax  administrators may obtain from IRS tax-exempt donor information for  State tax administration purposes. As a result of Rev. Proc. 2018-38,  State tax administrators will no longer have the right to obtain donor  information from the IRS, undermining States' ability to enforce tax- exempt rules on organizations operating within their borders. Further,  as the Treasury Department clearly stated in a July 16 press release,  Rev. Proc. 2018-38 will reduce the burden of disclosure and filing  obligations of tax-exempt organizations because they no longer will be  required to disclose the identifies of large donors. This is a big  deal. It will significantly inhibit IRS enforcement efforts, and it  will make it easier for dark money to continue to flood in. Indeed,  that is why so many groups have been urging that the disclosure  requirement be repealed.   As a final note, the IRS may argue that repeal of the disclosure rule  is insignificant because the IRS doesn't systematically cross-check  this data against other sources of tax information. This is a large  part of the problem of IRS failing to enforce existing laws relating to  political activity of tax-exempt organizations. To my mind, the IRS  should be using this information in order to maintain the integrity of  our tax-exempt rules and election laws. If, for example, an  organization named Russian Oligarchs, LLC made large contributions to a  tax-exempt organization, it seems to me that this is something the IRS  should want to know. At a time when foreign actors are actively  attempting to interfere in American elections, law enforcement, the  IRS, and State tax administrators need to have visibility into the  financial flows of political nonprofits. The argument that we should no  longer collect this information because the IRS is failing to use the  information to enforce the law gets things precisely backward.   I urge my colleagues to support Senator Tester and me as we work to  overturn this outrageous dark money rule.                            ____________________
