 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the work of the  Head Start providers and programs across the United States as the  National Head Start Association gathers in Phoenix, AZ, for its 50th  annual conference.   Since 1965, more than 37 million Americans have relied on Head Start  to provide high-quality early childhood education programming to  families in need. Head Start programs operate in all 50 States through  a variety of models, serving families from before birth to age 5 in  Early Head Start and Head Start. But it is not just children who reap  the benefits of a Head Start program. Parents and families are an  integral part of Head Start, whether by  [[Page S1622]]  volunteering in a classroom, participating in educational programming,  or even embarking on a career in early childhood education through Head  Start, which is happening in Arizona.   Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to meet with an Arizona Head  Start parent in my office, along with staff and administrators from our  State. Being a new grandfather made it even more meaningful to me to  hear the appreciation in the voice of the parent as she described the  economic and educational opportunities Head Start was creating for her  family. It also made it harder to hear that challenges in finding and  retaining teachers and staff mean that classrooms are closing and  hundreds of thousands of children are stuck on waiting lists.   That is why I am committed to growing Senate support for Head Start.  I am proud that the most recent appropriations bill included nearly $12  billion for Head Start, representing a $960 million increase from the  prior year. With this funding, Head Start staff can get paid closer to  what they deserve, and more families can gain access to the early  childhood education that we know makes a long-term difference. But  there is certainly more to do, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues to help more children and families succeed.   To the Head Start providers, staff, and families throughout this  country: We are with you. Thank you for the work you do every day.                            ____________________
