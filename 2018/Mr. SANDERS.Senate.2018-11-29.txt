 Mr. President, Philip H. Hoff, who passed away on  April 26, 2018, was one of the great Governors of the State of Vermont  and someone I respected enormously. On May 12, 2018, at a memorial  service in Burlington, VT, a close friend and colleague of Governor  Hoff's, Rich Cassidy, delivered a very moving eulogy which I enclose.   The material follows:                     A Tribute to Philip Henderson Hoff         Theodore Roosevelt said:        ``It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points       out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds       could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man       who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust       and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who       comes short again and again, because there is no effort       without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive       to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great       devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the       best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and       who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring       greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and       timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.''        Philip Henderson Hoff did not shy away from the arena. He       confronted the issues of the day, and often, the issues of       the future.        He played high school football and tasted victory, scoring       the winning touchdown in the longstanding rivalry between his       hometown, Turners Falls, and arch-enemy Greenfield. He went       to Williams College, but left early to do his bit in World       War II. He signed up for training as a pilot, but after he       damaged his third trainer, the Navy persuaded him that it was       not to be. So, he volunteered for the submarine service.        He met Joan while he was training in Connecticut. On one       date, he took a red kerosene lantern from a construction site       and gave it to her as a gift.        Phil saw combat in the Pacific Theater aboard the USS Sea       Dog, a submarine, where he earned two battle stars.        After the war, Phil returned to Williams College. Joan       heard that he was back and had asked about her, so she boxed       up the red lantern and sent it to him with a note: ``Phil,       it's your turn to polish it for a while.'' The lantern       rekindled their romance and led on to almost 70 years of       marriage.        Phil finished at Williams and went to Cornell University       Law School.        In 1951, Phil accepted an invitation from another Cornell       graduate, J. Boone Wilson, to come to Burlington, and join       the respected law firm then known as Black and Wilson.        Phil developed a successful law practice with Boone. He was       good with a jury and had the largest jury verdict in a       personal injury case of the 1950s.        Phil and Joan settled in a lovely home on South Prospect       Street, where they raised their 4 daughters, Susan, Dagny,       Andrea, and Gretchen.        Phil is often given credit for making the Democratic Party       dominant in Vermont, and for ushering Vermont into the       American mainstream. He deserves a great deal of credit on       both counts, but even he would not claim it all. Politics and       government are team sports, and Phil would be the first to       acknowledge that what was accomplished was not his alone, not       by any means.        But to see how broad and deep his legacy is, it is       important to put it in context. Vermont in those days was a       sleepy state. Most Governors acted as caretakers. The real       political power in the state rested with the towns. Vermont       had more dairy cows than people.        And the Democratic Party was sleepier still. A Democrat had       only held the Governorship only once in history. For many       years a handful of Democratic cronies traded the nominations       for statewide offices, not in hopes of getting elected, but       to have a stake in distribution of political patronage from       Washington.        How sleepy was it? In the 1946 election, Vermont's       Democratic National Committeeman was asked who the party's       candidate for Governor was. Unable to remember, he replied       ``Oh, some fellow from up north.'' ``But we don't concede his       defeat.''        Change was in the wind. In 1950's two of Phil's friends,       Bob Larrow and Bernard Leddy, ran between them, three serious       campaigns for Governor. Leddy came within 719 votes of       victory. In 1959, the Party hired its first full time       executive director, Sam Miller, who is with us here today. We       were poised for victory.        Phil ran for Burlington Board of Alderman in the winter of       1960. He lost, but politics was in his blood. That fall he       was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives.        In the House, Phil helped bring together a group of young,       well-educated and energetic legislators, Democrats and       Republicans, who wanted to see government take a more active       role in the development of the state. Its members included       many who would play important roles in the days ahead.       Together, among other things, they set out to end the poll       tax. At the time they failed. But they started a political       revolution that has not ended yet.        In 1962, Phil and Joan ran an energetic and charismatic       campaign against the incumbent Governor. The Hoffs were       everywhere, even at my mother's door in Rutland. With the       help of about 5,000 votes on two independent party lines,       Hoff prevailed. Phil told the crowd in Winooski that night:       ``100 years of bondage broken.''        Winning is one thing; governing is another. Phil found that       state government could neither forecast expenses nor revenue.       Within weeks, he appointed a series of task forces made up of       legislators, officials and citizens, who reviewed the state's       problems and inventoried its needs.        By the beginning of the 1964 legislative session, Hoff came       forward with a substantial legislative program.        The accomplishments of his six years as Governor changed       the face of Vermont: Hoff opened state government's first       planning office, ended the Overseer of the Poor system of       administering welfare benefits, and founded the Vermont       District Court, and the Judicial Nominating Commission. He       established the Governor's Commission on Women, the Vermont       Council on the Arts, and the Vermont Student Assistance       Corporation. He promoted regionalization in the delivery of       government services, establishing regional airport and       library systems. He presided over the reapportionment of the       Vermont legislature to comply with the principle of one man,       one vote.        And as important as those accomplishments were, the issues       he took on dominated the political agenda for the rest of       century and on to today.        Phil took on the cause of racial justice in Vermont. As       freshman legislator he proposed prohibiting race       discrimination in employment. The bill failed, but after his       election as Governor, his bill was adopted and included a       prohibition against discrimination based on sex. He       established the Vermont Human Rights Commission with       jurisdiction to prohibit discrimination in housing and public       accommodations.        And then, in the aftermath of the assassination of Martin       Luther King, Jr.--with more than 100 American cities still       smoking from riots that followed--Phil worked with New York       City Mayor John Lindsay to form the New York/Vermont Summer       Youth Project, bringing hundreds of African-American and       Hispanic high school students from New York City together       with Vermont high school students to build understanding by       working together on educational and recreational programs.        When an African-American minister's home in Irasburg was       raked with shotgun fire--night rider style--some tried to       blame the victim. Phil insisted on a fair investigation even       in the face of stern opposition.        Phil fought to import and sell public hydroelectric power       from Quebec. His plans were frustrated by the big power       companies, who claimed that electricity from Vermont Yankee       would be ``too cheap to meter.''        He sought to equalize the burden of the cost of public       education and to bring efficiency to it through       regionalization.        Phil had been befriended by President Lyndon Baines       Johnson. In 1967, Johnson sent him to Vietnam to get a       firsthand look at the ``light at the end of the tunnel.'' But       Phil knew an oncoming train when he saw one and was the first       Democratic governor in the nation to split with Johnson over       the Vietnam War.        Phil endorsed the antiwar candidacy of Bobby Kennedy and       became an important spokesperson for him. After Kennedy's       assassination, Phil laid aside his grief, and supported the       campaign of Gene McCarthy. At the convention, Hubert Humphrey       seriously considered offering Phil the vice-presidential spot       on his ticket before settling on Phil's friend, Ed Muskie.        In 1970, Hoff challenged incumbent Senator Winston L.       Prouty for a seat in the United States Senate. The war, gun       control, and racial justice were dominant themes of the       campaign. Although Phil mounted a vigorous effort, Prouty was       reelected.        In the 1970s, Phil practiced law and in 1972 and 1973,       served as chair of the Vermont Democratic Party. But most       importantly, he took on his own personal demon, alcohol. He       won the that battle but lived ever after with  [[Page S7238]]       an understanding and sympathy for the victims of addiction.        In 1982, Hoff returned to elective politics, winning a seat       in the Vermont Senate and serving three terms. In the Senate,       he was instrumental in revitalizing the Vermont Human Rights       Commission and promoting prevention of social and health       problems. Hoff remained steadfastly committed to the cause of       racial justice, serving for many years on the Vermont       Advisory Commission to the United States Civil Rights       Commission.        Phil's efforts in the world of politics overshadow his       contributions to the practice of law. But they are not to be       forgotten. In the early 1980s, he chaired a blue-ribbon       commission that reorganized the Vermont Bar Examination and       established the first mandatory continuing education       requirement for Vermont lawyers. For many years he chaired       the Vermont Judicial Nominating Commission. As a trustee at       Vermont Law School from 1983 to 1999, and as its President       from 1990 to 1995, he helped lead the school's continuous       growth in clinical and experiential education, in building a       strong faculty, and in adding a new library and classroom       buildings.        Phil inspired and supported scores of young people to       become involved in the political process. And he supported       the political campaigns of virtually every successful       Democrat candidate since 1962. Most notably, in May 1966, he       called a young lawyer in his law firm and told him to meet       him at the Chittenden Courthouse the next day. The young       lawyer was Patrick J. Leahy, and Phil swore him in as       Chittenden County States Attorney. The senator still claims       it's the best job he's ever had!        Phil was the first mainstream politician to endorse Bernie       Sanders during his historic independent run for congress in       1990.        With his friend and former state police driver,       Representative Michael Vinton, Phil was an early supporter of       the adoption of civil unions and same-sex marriage.        I think Phil's attitude towards public life was summed up       by his answer to a question that his grandson, Nathaniel,       asked him:        ``Why is it that people won't stand up for the things they       really believe in anymore?''        Phil told Nathaniel. ``There's been a tendency for people       who are in office to simply be involved with re-election as       opposed to what they really should do. If you're only       interested in holding the office, what's the sake of holding       the office? It seems to me you ought to stand for what you       believe. You may lose, but in the overall thrust of history,       you will make a difference.''        Phil Hoff made a difference. He tasted victory and defeat.       If you're looking for his legacy you don't have to look far.       The state we live in today reflects the courage with which he       grappled with the issues.        The death of Philip Henderson Hoff came as no surprise to       those of us who loved him He had certainly lived a long and       full life. Still, we grieve. I am reminded of Robert Kennedy       speaking on the night of the death of Martin Luther King Jr.       Kennedy quoted his favorite poet, Aeschylus. He said:        ``He who learns must suffer. And even in our sleep pain,       which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart,       until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom       through the awful grace of God.        I finish, as Bobby Kennedy finished later that evening, and       in the spirit of the life of Philip Hoff:        ``Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so       many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle       the life of this world.''
