 Mr. Speaker, improving background checks is common  sense. Background checks simply make it harder for guns to end up in  the hands of the wrong people--criminals.   Mr. Speaker, 75,000 guns have ended up in the hands of the wrong  people. The Enhanced Background Checks Act gives the FBI more time to  complete background checks. In doing so, it closes the loophole.   The Framers didn't think about carrying an AK-47 or a semiautomatic  weapon. That is not what they thought about.   Mr. Speaker, these guns are dangerous. They leave a pool of blood on  corners in cities across the United States of America, and having  access to them too soon is a deadly decision. We must pass this  legislation to ensure that communities are safe all over America.   Let me just end by saying that we have a new item, the ghost gun  loopholes. Ghost guns are made to evade law enforcement. There are  ghost guns. We should stop them now, dead in their tracks.
