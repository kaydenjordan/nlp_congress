 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the  Contra Costa Canal Transfer Act, a bill that will assure the health and  safety of the residents of Contra Costa County while also providing for  the efficient delivery of water from the Bay Delta to the customers of  the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD). Senator Harris is joining me in  cosponsoring the bill, and I understand that Representatives Mark  DeSaulnier, Jerry McNerney, and Mike Thompson are introducing a House  companion measure today as well.   I will be brief in explaining the reasons I support the bill, which I  introduced with Senator Harris. The bill would transfer title to the  Contra Costa Canal from the United States to Contra Costa Water  District (``District''). The District has fully paid off  [[Page S144]]  the capital debt for constructing the canal, so it is financially  reasonable to transfer the 48-mile long canal to it. There is no known  opposition to the bill, and several good reasons to support it.   The District would like to convert the existing open earthen canal to  a closed pipe at an estimated cost to the district ratepayers of $650  million. The District understandably wants to take title to the  facilities to have collateral for issuing bonds to cover the expense of  the conversion.   There are a number of good reasons to convert the existing canal to a  pipe:   First, 82 people have drowned in the earthen canal despite protective  fencing in the 70 years since the Canal began operation. This is about  a death per year on average, which would be completely prevented if the  canal were converted into a pipe. Tragically, there was another  drowning in the canal just last year.   A second reason is water conservation. Drought is always an issue in  California, and water is becoming more and more expensive. About 6% of  the canal's water is lost through evaporation and seepage. A pipeline  would eliminate these losses.   A third reason is avoiding flood risk from the earthen canal. When  the canal was built 70 years ago, much of the surrounding land was  farming country, but more recently homes have been built around it.  These homes are at risk from the types of floods that earthen canals  periodically experience.   Finally, the 70-year old canal is nearing the end of its lifespan and  needs a major facility upgrade or replacement. Replacement with a  pipeline is the best option, for all the reasons set forth above.   Besides the advantages of the bill, there is no known opposition to  it. The District has reached an MOU with East Bay Regional Parks  District to continue the existing recreational uses of the adjoining  parks it manages. In addition, the District has received letters of  concurrence from the City Managers of Walnut Creek and Antioch  regarding the smaller parks managed by the cities along the route of  the existing canal. Like East Bay Regional Parks, these cities agree  the bill would preserve the existing recreational uses of the adjoining  lands.   The bill would not just transfer title to Contra Costa Canal, but  would also authorize the transfer of the Rock Slough intake and fish  screen, one of Contra Costa's diversion points from the Delta. This  transfer will not affect the applicability of the various biological  opinions that apply to the facility. As I understand it, because the  bill will not affect the environmental management of the canal, and  because the District has paid off its capital debt, the environmental  groups NRDC and the Defenders of Wildlife will not oppose the bill.   In summary, this bill has no known opposition and good reasons to  support. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Thank  you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Rounds):   S. 100.
