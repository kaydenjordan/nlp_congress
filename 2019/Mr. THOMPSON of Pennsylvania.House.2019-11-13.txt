 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Apprenticeship Week. This year is the fifth anniversary for  the celebration that aims to connect job seekers with businesses and  educators in our communities to highlight the wealth of apprenticeship  opportunities that are available.   For too long, it has been implied that the only respectable or  worthwhile option available to achieve a successful career is spending  4 or more years on a campus to earn a college degree. Yet, the more  than 7 million unfilled jobs in America today suggest workers don't  have the necessary skills to fill these jobs.   We need to defy this misconception, invest in skills-based education,  and fix our Nation's growing skills gap by providing students and job  seekers with the skills and hands-on experience they need to improve  their own lives.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus,  I am proud to push for accessible career and technical education  alongside my good friend and colleague, Congressman  Jim Langevin.   Career and technical education, or CTE, goes hand in hand with  apprenticeships. Equipping learners of all ages with real-world  experience in fields like STEM, nursing, information technology, cyber  technology, agriculture, and more can bring us one step closer to  closing our Nation's skills gap. In the past several years, we have  [[Page H8791]]  seen a rapid expansion in skills-based education like on-the-job  learning, earn-while-you-learn programs, and apprenticeships.   Workforce development programs are successful only if they are  adaptable to the changing needs of employers. The notice of proposed  rulemaking by the Department of Labor issued this past June recognizes  this through the proposed establishment of industry-recognized  apprenticeships programs, or IRAPS. IRAPS cut through the bureaucratic  red tape to put businesses and employees at the center of the  conversation.   The proposed flexibility in the notice of proposed rulemaking will  allow businesses the ability to quickly meet labor market needs. These  changes will help foster continued innovation that recognizes the  dignity of all work and provides another tool for apprentices to move  into meaningful work in the rapidly evolving 21st century economy.   We can ensure IRAPS create as many career opportunities as possible  by encouraging employer innovation and allowing students and families  the freedom to choose the path that is best for them. That is the power  of work. That is the power of CTE. And that is the power of  apprenticeships, putting employers and students in the driver's seat of  their own professional futures.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.   In a 1987 speech in West Berlin, President Ronald Reagan famously  declared: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''   For nearly 30 years, East and West Berlin were separated, both  physically and ideologically.   On November 9, 1989, freedom prevailed. East Germany's communist  government and the Berlin Wall, one of the starkest symbols of the Cold  War, would fall.   That evening, on a West German television channel, reporter Hanns  Friedrichs proclaimed:         This 9th of November is a historic day. East Germany has       announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to       everyone.    While East and West Germany would not officially unify until the  following year, East and West Berliners rushed to the Brandenburg Gate  to celebrate this historic moment that would lead to the end of the  Cold War.   Let today serve as a reminder that freedom is always worth fighting  for.                            ____________________
