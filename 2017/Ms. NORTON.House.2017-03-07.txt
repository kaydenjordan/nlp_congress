 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for  yielding. I certainly thank him for being a cosponsor of my bill.   I should start, however, by thanking Chairman Shuster, and Ranking  Member DeFazio, who have moved this bill so quickly.   The bill is called the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of  2017. This is a real motherhood bill. Mr. DeFazio, Mr. Johnson, and  Barbara Comstock have all joined me as cosponsors.   H.R. 1174 requires locations that are either federally owned or  leased to provide designated private and hygenic lactation space for  nursing mothers. As I will indicate, no new space in buildings or  expenditures is contemplated.   Last Congress, I offered this bill as an amendment to the Public  Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016, and I was pleased to have it  pass the House.   Space for lactating women is already required for Federal employees.  We are really not talking about a new kind of benefit. Certainly, there  is no new money. The reason that this is not new is because Federal  employees already have lactating space under the Affordable Care Act.   So I have to ask my good friends on the other side: As you try to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, do you propose to erase this motherhood  provision as well? Will you preserve it?                                time  1745    My bill extends the lactating space requirement to include not just  employees, but visitors and guests of Federal facilities across the  Nation. H.R. 1174 also does not require additional Federal funds or  space to be mandated at all. Since Federal employees already have this  space, I look forward to visitors to Federal buildings also making use  of this space. In our country, new mothers often come to visit Federal  buildings, not only those who work in Federal buildings.   The reason this is such an important bill is that the benefits of  breast milk are so well documented: antibodies and hormones that boost  babies' immune systems, lower risks of asthma, diabetes, respiratory  infections, and other diseases among breastfed babies.   There are benefits also for nursing mothers. Research has shown that  there are lower risks of diabetes and even cancer as a result of  breastfeeding. Speaking of motherhood, the Republican healthcare plan  would even make maternity care significantly more expensive.   Now, this, of course, is a bill that is very easy to support, but  when we think of its links to other important legislation, I ask that  there be sincere consideration given to whether or not at this moment  in time my good friends across the aisle want their legacy to be: We  actually repealed your health care.   I don't think they are going to be able to do it.   My Republican friends have no experience with structural reform. If  you look at all the structural reform in our country, beginning with  the New Deal, none of it was done by Republicans. Whether you are  talking about the administrative agencies that are so important to all  that we do in this country, Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and  Secondary Education Act, whatever you have in mind, these are  structural reforms that Republicans  [[Page H1551]]  have, if anything, opposed, as they opposed Social Security, for  example.   So here what they are trying to do is to unravel, take away health  care, and then put something in its place. They have no experience  doing anything like it. Anybody who has looked closely at it has to  doubt, as I do, that they can do it.   Look what they will be doing. In my own district, the District of  Columbia, we have cut in half the rate of uninsured.   Are Republicans going to give me a guarantee that that cut will  remain if they replace the bill with the markup that is going on as we  speak?   Ninety-six percent of District of Columbia residents have health  coverage today. That is comparable to other advanced countries in the  world. As we know, most countries in the world already afford this kind  of coverage. That makes the District, according to whoever is doing the  counting, number one, number two, or number three in the Nation in  health care provided to our residents. I am very proud of that. I am  going to fight like mad to keep it.   Mr. Speaker, many of us had healthcare townhalls over the recess. We  saw what happened at the townhalls on affordable care that my good  friends on the other side also had. They met a revolution from their  own constituents. We didn't have that problem in our townhalls. Some of  the stories that residents brought forward are truly heartbreaking, so  I want to leave you with one.   A woman who came to testify at my healthcare townhall, her name is  Markita. Markita's grandmother was a D.C. Public Schools cafeteria  worker for most of her career. She retired early. She retired before  she had Social Security or Medicare. She was suffering from diabetes  and a stroke, but she was so prideful that she never let anyone know  that she had to slice her pills in half just to get by. Now she is  under the protection of the Affordable Care Act. Markita's grandmother  is healthier and can afford her medication. She is no longer splitting  her pills in half.    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to correct the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Sanford), who opined that this bill was not scored  correctly.   We are talking about space already designated for Federal employees.  The intent of the bill, and I am the author of the bill, which could  never have gotten through committee if it involved the expenditure of  funds. Yes, sometimes these lactation rooms will be dedicated to  lactation, but that doesn't mean they are exclusively designated to  lactation.   And the whole notion that some Federal buildings don't have such  space means they are in violation of the Affordable Care Act, which  requires that they have such space, even if it is not space that is  exclusively used for the few women who are lactating or nursing.
