 Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  Senators Blumenthal, Hirono, Welch, and myself be allowed to engage in  a colloquy on the Senate floor.    Mr. President, the subject of our colloquy is going  to be the enormous, secret gifts that have recently been disclosed  going into the pockets of certain Supreme Court Justices.   The first thing that is remarkable about these gifts is how  magnificent they are--luxury trips on private jets, luxury trips on  superyachts, paying for a Justice's mother's home, paying for private  school tuition of dependents, $500,000 donations to organizations that  the spouse worked for, $25,000 fees into a spouse's consulting firm,  jet and fishing trips across the country. So it is all pretty rich  stuff.   In Rhode Island, if you want to take a gift from somebody--let's say  you are a municipal employee, and they want to take you to lunch across  the street from city hall. It is 25 bucks. That is your limit, and you  have to disclose it. You get to do that three times, and then you are  all done. Then you can't even take the $25 lunch if you disclose it. So  in Rhode Island, people are really upset about these multi-hundred- thousand-dollar gifts.   It gets worse. It is not just the size of the gifts. It is the  network. It is the web. The billionaires who are involved in giving  these gifts overlap with an array of front groups that are involved  with the billionaires and with the gifts, and there is a common  ``fixer'' who ties many of these threads together. The trips very often  involve the fixer and the Justices and the billionaires, and the whole  mess is interwoven. The donations go through the front groups to the  Justice from the fixer over and over. This thing is a web, and we are  working hard in the Judiciary Committee to try to untangle it.   On Thursday, we will be taking up the question of subpoenas to the  billionaires and the front group corporations that have participated in  these different gifts to find out what really went on. How bad, really,  was it? What we know already is bad enough, but there is more to  discover.   With that, let me yield to my colleague Senator Blumenthal, and then  I will wrap up after Senator Hirono and Senator Welch have had their  chance to speak as well.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my three  colleagues for joining me on the floor today. A word that came up  repeatedly was ``reverence,'' and I want to start with that word  because I think we all do share a reverence for the institution of   [[Page S5396]]  the Supreme Court. And that is what makes it so bitter, to see how  badly the Supreme Court is failing us now and to see the paths that  billionaire influence has led it down.    It has to correct, and if it is not going to correct itself, then  Congress is going to have to correct it.   As Senator Blumenthal said, the problem here is that there is no  ethics process for the Supreme Court. There is a perfectly good code of  ethics for all of the Justices and for all of the Federal judges, but  there is no way to enforce it for the Supreme Court.   If you have a complaint about a Supreme Court Justice, there is  nowhere to file it. There is not even an inbox, and if there were an  inbox and complaints came through, there is nobody on the other side of  the inbox to screen out the nutty ones from the legitimate ones. And  once you have a pile of legitimate ones, there is no staff attorney to  do the basic research into what are the facts here. At the end of the  day, when you have the facts determined and the judge or Justices have  their say, then you have the factual predicate to compare with the  ethics standard and a neutral decider to decide whether or not it  comports. That is the basic structure of U.S. due process, and the  Supreme Court will not allow that for itself. That is the problem that  we have.   So none of the questions that deserve to be answered about all of  these secret gifts and about all of this billionaire influence--none of  them--have even been asked over at the Supreme Court, let alone  answered. So we have an absolute obligation to go forward with answers.   And we have tried. We have asked very nicely. We have sent lists of  questions. We have gone forward with the people who would know about  all of this.   And we have received two answers. One was that this is  unconstitutional, and so we are not going to participate with you at  all. You get nothing. You don't get a single answer.   That, as Senator Blumenthal said, we believe to be a complete sham  and a complete charade because the disclosure rules--right? We are  talking about disclosure of gifts to Justices. They went undisclosed.   So the question is, Should they have been disclosed? And there is a  rule about disclosure that just happens to be a law passed by Congress.  And there is a related law passed by Congress that relates to recusal,  and recusal relates to gifts because, if you take big enough gifts from  someone, you then have to recuse yourself as a judge from their cases.  And the recusal rule is also passed by Congress.   So you have a disclosure law passed by Congress, and you have a  recusal law passed by Congress, and you have what Senator Blumenthal  described--the Judicial Conference, which is the administrative body  that oversees the administrative side of the judicial branch, and that  body was also created by Congress.   So the argument that is being made to us is that Congress has no  authority to oversee how an Agency that Congress created is  implementing laws Congress passed. That argument is, on its face,  preposterous, and that, in turn, suggests that there is a lot to look  at when we get a chance to look under the hood of all this mischief.   And they really don't want us to see it, and they are going to  manufacture completely preposterous arguments just to try to throw us  off the trail.   Another recipient of our questions said: OK, it is unconstitutional,  but I will offer you a few things. You know, in good faith, I will  offer you a few things, but you can only go back 5 years.   Well, we happen to know, with respect to this billionaire, that they  were giving gifts to Justices way more than 5 years ago. So they are  not even allowing us to ask into the known gift-giving conduct between  the billionaire and the Justice, which, by the way, was undisclosed at  the time.   So the 5-year rule is just nonsensical, just picked out of the air-- picked, actually, out of a criminal statute, as if that had a bearing  on a congressional investigation.   Then they said: We will only give you documents that you already  have. For everything else, we will just give our lawyers narratives  about what took place.   Well, anybody who has ever tried a case knows perfectly well that if  you rely on the other side's lawyer's narrative, you are getting no  place.   Discovery means you see the documents. You do your real homework like  lawyers do. So for one lawyer to suggest to another: No, we are not  going to show you the documents; we have them, but we are not going to  show them to you; we are just going to give you a narrative of them-- there isn't a lawyer in this country who would accept that as a  condition in discovery in a case.   The third one is that, once we have answered your first round of  questions and given you our phony-baloney narrative for the 5 years  that is all we will let you inquire about, no more questions. You waive  your right to ask us any more questions forever.   Again, there is not a lawyer in the country who would accept that as  a condition of a discovery order. You get to ask the second question.  ``One and done'' is not a thing when you are doing an investigation.   So all of these theoretical accommodations that were offered were  just completely fake. We cannot proceed that way--not with any kind of  professionalism and not with any kind of ability to get to the truth,  which is, at the end of the day, what we really need to do here.   I will conclude by going back to where I started. The reason that we  need to follow this process of getting subpoenas so we get answers to  our questions is because of two failures: one, the failure of the  Supreme Court to even ask these questions itself. If there were a  viable process going forward, using the basic due process investigation  standards that everybody in government has to face for ethics, except  these nine Justices, we wouldn't need to do this. But the Supreme Court  won't allow questions to be asked about itself. So we can't go to them  for a proper investigation. They refuse to do it.    When we asked the participants in this gift scheme what they were up  to, they told us, as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I  think, rather artfully summarized, to go pound sand. Well, when  Congress has a legitimate inquiry into how an Agency that it created is  implementing statutes that it passed, ``go pound sand'' is not a  legitimate answer. So the next step is to move to authorize these  subpoenas, and we are going to do that.   This business of the Court not answering obvious questions is really  a problem. The question of whether Justice Thomas should have recused  himself from the January 6 cases depends on a single fact: what he knew  about his wife's involvement in insurrection activities. If he knew  absolutely nothing at all, OK. Then it is probably OK for him to recuse  himself--maybe a little bit of appearance of impropriety. But if he  actually knew of her involvement in those matters, then he absolutely  should have recused himself.   The question ``Justice Thomas, what did you know, and when did you  know it?'' has never been asked and never been answered. That is not a  tenable way for a Court that purports to represent due process and  enforce due process to conduct itself with respect to a conflict of  interest.   It is the same thing with these gifts. There is no Federal judge in  the country who is receiving multihundred-thousand-dollar vacation  gifts, who is getting huge half-million-dollar checks sent in to a  spouse's small private company out of which she takes money. This  behavior of free private jet travel--at beck and call, it seems--nobody  else does that. It is not OK. But looking at it to find out what  actually took place and why and when is a basic responsibility of the  Judiciary. In any other court, these claims, these charges, these  circumstances would be properly investigated. We would know the facts,  and we are entitled to know the facts.   The last is that, in the context of our investigation, one of these  lawyers made up what I consider to be a sham argument that we can't ask  any questions because it is unconstitutional. I have addressed that. It  is a congressionally established entity applying congressionally  established laws. Yes, we do get to inquire about that kind of job.  Because, perhaps, that argument is so weak, so sham, that lawyer  actually recruited a Supreme Court Justice to  [[Page S5397]]  go into the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal and offer an  extrajudicial opinion--not an opinion of the Court, just his own  personal opinion--that we had no business investigating.   That violates a ton of stuff. That violates the rule that they are  not supposed to offer opinions on matters that might come before the  Court. That violates the rule that you shouldn't be engaging as a  Justice in an ongoing dispute, sort of like a de facto expert witness  for a party in an ongoing dispute. In this case, the dispute is over  access to information.   The lawyer's client in that is one of the people involved in this  scheme, Leonard Leo. Leonard Leo has a personal relationship also with  Justice Alito. He is described as his friend. None of that is  disclosed. He just offers his opinion on behalf of the lawyer for his  friend.   At the end of the day, the inquiry looks at free gifts, undisclosed,  received by Justice Alito. At the end of the day, the lawyer for  Leonard Leo was able to recruit a member of the Supreme Court, Justice  Alito, to offer a private--I should say a public opinion but a  nonofficial opinion, a personal opinion, in the Wall Street Journal  editorial page to prop up the argument that says we can't look into  gifts that Leonard Leo, the client, organized for Justice Alito, the  recipient. That is a tangled mess of ethics violations, and nobody can  look at that. Nobody will look at that. That can't be.   So, with the Court looking at none of this scandalous behavior, it is  entirely incumbent upon the Congress to do its job and get to the  bottom of what went on. That is what, under the leadership and guidance  of our Judiciary chairman, Dick Durbin, we will do.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf  of Senator Hirono, that Sitara Kedilaya be granted floor privileges  until November 30, 2023.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf  of Senator Durbin, that the following law clerks of the Senate  Judiciary Committee be granted floor privileges until November 16,  2023: Evan Zepeda, Durva Trivedi, Christopher Daffin, Timothy Laderach,  and James Starke.    Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Wednesday, November 8; that following  [[Page S5405]]  the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate  proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Reyes  nomination postcloture; further, that all time on the nomination be  considered expired at 11:30 a.m. and that if cloture has been invoked  on the Burrows nomination, all time be considered expired at 2:20 p.m.  and that if cloture has been invoked on the McMillion nomination, the  vote on confirmation be at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Republican leader; further, that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following the cloture vote on the McMillion  nomination, the Senate resume legislative session and proceed to the  consideration of Calendar No. 238, S.J. Res. 38; that at 5:30 p.m., the  joint resolution be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on  the passage of the joint resolution; further, that upon disposition of  the joint resolution, the Senate resume executive session and vote on  the motion to invoke cloture on the Almadani nomination and that if  cloture is invoked, the vote on confirmation be at 11:30 a.m. on  Thursday, November 9; finally, that if any nominations are confirmed  during Wednesday's session, the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:55 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, November 8, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
