 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Bishop Irinej, from the  Serbian Orthodox Church, for offering today's prayer.   We are at the 100-year anniversary of when President Woodrow Wilson  raised the Serbian flag in a show of support for the Serbian people.  That symbolic act of solidarity is remembered today, and I think it is  really important.   Since 2006, my home State of Ohio has worked closely with the Serbian  Armed Forces through the Ohio National Guard State Partnership Program.  Soldiers from the Ohio National Guard and the Serbian Defense Forces  have worked together on deployments and training. We have also worked  together to construct schools, carry out humanitarian missions, and  provide healthcare.   On this anniversary of the U.S.-Serbia cooperation, I look forward to  another 100 years of friendship with Serbia, and Ohio stands ready to  lead the way.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois  for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6311, and more  specifically, I rise to support bipartisan language to make flexible  spending accounts flexible.   While 44 percent of Americans have access to flexible spending  accounts, flexible spending accounts have not been flexible. There are  two problems:   Under ObamaCare, flexible spending account contributions were capped  at $2,650. And while the average American spends more than $5,700 in  out-of-pocket healthcare costs, it is just not enough.   The second problem is flexible spending account rules make people use  it or lose it at the end of the year, and they can't roll over their  money. They have to spend it on things they don't need or they have to  lose that money.   Our bipartisan solution solves those problems by doing two things:   First, it increases the limit on FSA accounts by a multiple of three  to $7,950. And I did the math for the ranking member. That total would  be, over 3 years, if you wanted to save $50 a week, you could  accumulate $7,950. Obviously, that would be if you weren't using it, so  it would probably take longer than that to accumulate that kind of  money. But, again, that is well over the average of $5,700 of out-of- pocket expenses that the average American has.   And, by the way, while flexible spending accounts are accessible to  people, one of the reasons people like them is they make out-of-pocket  expenses more affordable for individuals because those contributions  are pretax dollars.   The second thing our bipartisan language does is it allows the  balance to be rolled over at the end of the year up to that $7,950  limit. The rollover provision keeps people from losing their money or  making healthcare expenses that are wasteful at the end of the year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the flexible spending  account language and the underlying bill.
