 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the so-called Fair Tax  Act.   Right now, Oregonians don't pay a single cent in sales tax. Ask  anyone and they will tell you: It is a good thing. We rejected such  proposals multiple times. It protects working folks who are  disproportionately impacted by the undue burden of spending additional  dollars on basic necessities.   I am not here to raise taxes on Oregonians. That is not why my  constituents sent me here. I am here to help working folks get ahead,  which is why I am so troubled by this congressional proposal to mandate  a 30 percent sales tax.   This is far from fair. It is not even close. The top 1 percent may  not sweat a 30 percent sales tax, but for working families, that could  be the difference between putting food on the table or having to go  without.   I stand today to redirect our attention to the pressing needs of  Oregonians: the need to lower costs and fight inflation, not to raise  taxes. That is what I am focused on, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.                            ____________________
