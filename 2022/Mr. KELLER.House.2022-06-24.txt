 Madam Speaker, after nearly 25 years of service as  President of the Pennsylvania College of Technology, Dr. Davie Jane  Gilmour is retiring.   During her accomplished tenure, Dr. Gilmour has guided Penn College  through challenges, growth, and innovation, ultimately shaping the  institution into a national leader in applied technology education.   Penn College has stepped up in a big way to develop Pennsylvania's  workforce and close the skills gap, largely due to Dr. Gilmour's vision  and commitment to giving students the tools to excel in high demand  fields.   Dr. Gilmour and I share that vision, and I have enjoyed working with  Penn College in Congress to develop policies that bring job creators  and the workforce closer together, expand opportunities for career and  technical education, promote economic development, and spur job  creation.   I thank Dr. Gilmour for her service, vision, and tireless commitment  to Penn College's important mission. I wish Dr. Gilmour all the best in  her future endeavors.                            ____________________
