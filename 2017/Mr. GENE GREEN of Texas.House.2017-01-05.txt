 Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act works,  but the majority of Republicans want to make America sick again.  Republicans have voted more than 60 times to roll back the historic  progress that has been made to expand health care to 20 million-plus  Americans and to improve coverage for those who already have it. At  every turn, they have undermined the law at the expense of American  families and now are setting the path for full repeal.   2.6 million Texans stand to lose healthcare coverage, including  20,000 in our district. Fifty thousand of my constituents would gain  coverage if Texas would have expanded Medicaid along with more than 1  million Texans. Texas stands to lose $62 billion in Federal funding for  Medicaid, CHIP, and financial assistance for marketplace coverage if  the new President and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Making America sick again is not the solution. Let's don't have a  repeal until we have a replacement.                            ____________________
