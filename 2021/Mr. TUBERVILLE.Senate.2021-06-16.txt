 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, I want to discuss an issue that  many folks may not be familiar with, but they should be. After today,  they will be. When I first heard about this, I couldn't believe it was  true, but I have learned up here that just when you think you have seen  or heard the worst, the swamp will always surprise you.   One of the many important roles of the Department of Justice is to  represent the United States in civil and criminal trials. Sometimes the  DOJ decides that a pretrial monetary settlement for a lawsuit is the  best route to take. The DOJ directs the money from the settlement to  the victims or to the Treasury. That is the way our system is supposed  to work.   But during the Obama administration, the DOJ took a different course.  Rather than direct settlement money to victims, the DOJ pushed the  defendants to give money instead to third-party organizations favored  by the Department. This was a slush fund for groups chosen by the DOJ.  What is more, the DOJ would count the dollar amount of any donation as  double toward the settlement. Money paid to the victims or the Treasury  would only count dollar for dollar. So it was a huge incentive for  these defendants to pay a third party, and these third parties often  had nothing to do with the lawsuit.   When companies like JPMorgan, Bank of America, or Citigroup had to  pay settlements based on mortgage lending practices, the DOJ  intentionally directed millions of dollars to liberal activist groups.  You don't have to take my word for it; here is an email from the Office  of the Associate Attorney General in 2013 talking about the DOJ  settlement with JPMorgan:         Can you explain to Tony the best way to allocate some money       toward an organization of our choosing?    Those are the key words there: ``of our choosing.''   Let me continue to quote: We have been discussing having the  agreement provide that JPM agreed to pay $9 billion but that, if, by  the time we sign the settlement agreement, JPM has given $60 million to  X, they will have to pay only 8 billion.   I think that is OK. We understand that we would not have control over  what X organization does with the money.   The ``Tony'' referred to there is Tony West, an Associate Attorney  General, who was at that time No. 3 in the Department of Justice.   Two days later, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  wrote to the Office of the Associate Attorney General to lobby on  behalf of a group called VOICE. The Leadership Conference on Civil and  Human Rights includes the biggest activist arms of the political left,  including the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Big Labor's AFL-CIO, and the  teachers unions.   On No. 3 here, but when the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights contacted the DOJ, it was because VOICE wanted funds from the  JPMorgan settlement. Not surprisingly, VOICE ended up receiving $1  million from JPMorgan.   They had a listening ear in the Obama administration. This is what he  wrote to Tony about the settlement with Citigroup. Chart 4.   They were concerned with the possibility of Citi picking a group  like, ``The Pacific Legal Foundation does conservative property rights  free legal services.'' The DOJ was clear: Conservative groups couldn't  have the access to the same funds that liberal groups could. It was  obvious.   Here was the result, chart No. 5.   From Bank of America alone, the National Council of La Raza, now  known as UnidosUS, received $1.5 million. The National Urban League  received $1.2 million. VOICE got another million dollars, on top of the  first million.   This won't shock you, but both La Raza and the Urban League were big  supporters of President Obama's agenda. They are also both members of  the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights today. La Raza  consistently lobbied Congress to pass President Obama's misguided  immigration reform bill. Urban League was a routine cheerleader of the  Obama administration's Big Government approach to public housing. They  were rewarded for their advocacy with millions of dollars from the DOJ.   In total across the Federal Government, the money directed to third  parties added up to a total of $668 million, according to the  nonpartisan Regulatory Transparency Project.   On chart No. 6, out of the $668 million, at the end of the day, they  could only locate $9.5 million, which is 1.4 percent of the total money  given. We don't even know exactly where or how the rest of the money  was spent.   Folks, I have one word for you on this. This is called corruption.  This is the swamp. The fact that this practice ever existed should make  Americans' blood boil. Political appointees at one of the most powerful  Departments in the country used their position of power to extract  money from companies, and then they gave that money to their like- minded friends. That is what is wrong with Washington, DC.   We have grown used to hearing about this type of behavior from  dictatorships around the world, like Russia or Venezuela. We should  not, we cannot accept this type of behavior here in the United States  of America.   Well, President Trump didn't. His administration, very early in his  tenure, put a stop to this practice. They were right to do so. It  should never have happened in the first place. But now, with a new  President in office and with so many high-profile Obama administration  retreads throughout the administration and in the White House, this  corrupt practice could and probably will return. Congress cannot allow  this to happen. I don't care if it is a Republican or a Democrat or an  Independent in the White House; the power of the purse lies with us,  the folks in this building. It is called the 117th U.S. Congress-- elected officials, not bureaucrats.   We need a permanent fix. If the Federal Government is diverting  settlement funds away from victims into politically connected groups,  they are undermining Congress's role. There is a way to stop this.  Earlier today, I introduced the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act. This  bill would ensure that all settlement funds would go first to the  victims and then to the Treasury--no third party. No administration  should be allowed to force donations to politically connected groups at  the direct expense of victims.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense  solution. Let's ensure our Federal Government works on behalf of all of  its citizens, not just the ones with connections to people in power.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Ms. Duckworth, and Ms.          Murkowski):   S. 2086. A bill to improve the identification and support of children  and families who experience trauma; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Will  Taylor, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of Congress.
