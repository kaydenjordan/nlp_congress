 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th  anniversary of the Roselle Active Seniors group. It began in 1983 when  a group of Roselle residents took trips to local places of interest.  The connections and conversations between the residents soon sparked  talk of a formal group.   Today, the Roselle Active Seniors group provides fun activities,  trips, and outreach opportunities for local seniors, and it is an  important part of our community. Group members provide Easter baskets  for children with disabilities, baby supplies for single mothers, toy  drives and winter clothes for children in need, and food baskets for  families during Thanksgiving.   I attended a recent gathering of the group, and I was extremely  impressed with the members and their organization. It is an incredible  group that I am proud to have in my district.
