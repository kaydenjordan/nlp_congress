 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck Protection  Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.   There is no doubt that our small businesses in west Tennessee and  across the Nation have felt the brunt of the economic effects of the  coronavirus.   The Paycheck Protection Program has saved small businesses in west  Tennessee and also allowed them to keep their employees on the payroll.   Now, I am disappointed that the Democrats didn't allow a vote on this  funding before today, but I am appreciative of the vote.   I look forward to voting for this funding today that will give  American small businesses the resources to maintain their livelihoods  and weather the storm.
