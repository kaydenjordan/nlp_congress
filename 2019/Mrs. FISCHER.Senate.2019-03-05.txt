 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the 116th Congress, I am once again  chairing the Senate Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Strategic  Forces, which oversees our nuclear forces.   Over the coming months, I will be coming to the floor to discuss  specific components of our nuclear deterrent and their contributions to  the defense of this Nation.   Today, I rise to speak about the critical role strategic bombers play  in our nuclear triad. The triad is known for its flexibility and  resilience, and bombers contribute to this flexibility in important  ways. They are highly visible, and they can be forward deployed. They  can be used to signal resolve to our adversaries and commitment to our  allies.   This benefit is not theoretical. Bombers have been used in exactly  this way many times, particularly on the Korean Peninsula. Bombers are  also recallable and, when armed with standoff weapons, they can offer  the President a variety of tailored response options in a crisis.   As the oldest leg of our nuclear triad, bombers have a long and  distinguished history. In some ways, the story of the strategic bomber  begins in the great State of Nebraska.   In the early 1940s, Bellevue, NE, was home to the Martin Bomber  Plant, which was located on the land that is now Offutt Air Force Base.  The Martin plant, with the help of thousands of Nebraska workers, built  and modified the Enola Gay and Bockscar. These two B-29 bombers went on  to deliver the Little Boy and Fat Man nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, ending World War II and ushering in the nuclear age. The  horrific destruction of these attacks established the deterrent power  that has prevented conflict on a global scale ever since.   As ballistic missile technology evolved, the bomber continued to be  the mainstay of our nuclear deterrent forces through the early 1970s.  Although bombers carried the heavy load for many decades, today we no  longer rely on them in the same way. Nuclear-armed bombers have not  been on 24-hour ready alert status since the end of the Cold War in  1991, and the responsiveness that alert-status bombers provided now  resides primarily with our ICBM forces.   The strength provided by the other legs of the triad have allowed us  to take our nuclear capable bombers off alert and use them for  conventional missions. When we send B-52 bombers to Afghanistan to  complete a conventional mission, we exercise the triad's flexibility.  When U.S. B-2 bombers struck targets in Libya, we utilized the triad's  flexibility. These examples clearly demonstrate that the flexibility of  the triad is not an abstract concept. It is something our forces use  every single day.   Our current nuclear bomber force consists of 46 B-52 and 20 B-2  aircraft. While we rely on this highly capable but aging fleet, we also  look ahead to the future of the bomber force, and that is the B-21.   As the B-21 development progresses, it is important to remember the  lessons learned from the last time we developed a nuclear bomber, the  B-2. As the Cold War ended, nuclear tensions cooled and the need for an  expensive nuclear-capable stealth bomber seemed to diminish. Even  though the B-2 had already been developed and significant resources  spent on research and development, Congress decided to reduce the final  order from 132 aircraft to 20. In so doing, the per-unit cost of the  airframe rose to $2 billion. The Air Force has said it plans to buy at  least 100 B-21s, but many in this Chamber believe more are likely  required to meet the conventional mission the Nation expects our Air  Force to perform.   The nuclear triad is the bedrock of our national security, and the  airborne leg continues to contribute to the strength and resilience of  our nuclear forces. It is our responsibility to ensure that this  capability is modernized, particularly as the global security  environment transitions to one of long-term strategic competition.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess under the previous order.    Madam President, today I would like to recognize Julie  Brooker, my central Nebraska director of constituent services who  retired at the end of February.   Julie Brooker's service in the U.S. Senate began in 1997 and has  spanned three U.S. Senators from Nebraska: former Senator Chuck Hagel,  former Senator Mike Johanns, and myself.   Before her longtime work as a Senate staffer, Julie was a committed  and hardworking volunteer on a number of political campaigns.   She was well known as someone willing to haul yard signs all over  Nebraska's huge third district.   You see, a commitment to helping and serving others ran in Julie's  family.   Julie's dad, Gordon, served faithfully as a local volunteer  firefighter, and her mom, Doralene, served on both the Buffalo County  Board of Supervisors and the Nebraska Public Power District Board.   Their example instilled in her lessons in treating people with  kindness, listening to others' concerns, and lending a helping hand.   If you were planning a run for office in Nebraska, Julie Brooker was  someone you needed to go see.   When I decided to run for U.S. Senate, Julie was one of the first  people I visited with, and she was so very generous with her time and  her advice.   During her Senate career, Julie sacrificed many days, nights, and  weekends to serve the people of Nebraska well.   She was renowned for driving whichever U.S. Senator she was serving  at the time all over the third district.   In every county, Julie had many friends. Her genuine interest in  others and friendly, approachable demeanor were always on display.   Over the years Julie worked in my office, I was always completely  confident that she was representing me well and that my constituents in  Kearney and throughout the central region of the State were in the very  best of hands.   Whether it was through her tenacity in helping resolve casework, her  willingness to meet with any Nebraskan who crossed her path, or her  ability to provide tough news in compassionate ways, Julie has always  had a servant's heart.   Serving Nebraskans wasn't a job for Julie, it was a calling. She  loves Nebraska, and she loves Nebraskans.   I want to thank Julie's husband, Jim, for loaning Julie to the people  of central Nebraska for so many years.   I am also so very grateful to Julie's kids and grandkids for  sacrificing time with her so that she could put the time and energy she  had into this service to the people of Nebraska.  [[Page S1657]]    The city of Kearney, the State of Nebraska, and the U.S. Senate are  better because of Julie's wonderful work throughout the years.   She is a dedicated, committed person who focused on making life  better for Nebraskans.   She is truly one of a kind.   I congratulate Julie on her remarkable career in public service. I  thank her for her many years of service to our State and to our people,  and I wish her a retirement full of joy and fulfillment.                            ____________________
