 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Saturday, November 11, is the  anniversary of the end of World War I. Today we know it as Veterans  Day.   On Veterans Day, we honor everyone who has worn the uniform of the  United States of America. Alabama is proud that the Veterans Day  tradition started in Birmingham, AL, in the aftermath of World War II.  A local veteran named Raymond Weeks recognized the need for a day  honoring all of our veterans.   In 1947, Raymond Weeks petitioned the Army Chief of Staff, a general  named Dwight D. Eisenhower, for a national Veterans Day. Seven years  later, General Eisenhower was President and signed it into law.   Alabama is proud of Raymond Weeks. We are proud to be home to nearly  400,000 veterans. And every Veterans Day, I am proud to come to this  floor to tell my colleagues about a few of our veterans in Alabama.   The first I will mention today is Ron Skoneki from Montgomery, AL. He  is the son of a Polish immigrant. He enlisted in the Air Force about as  soon as he could right after graduating from high school. He served in  Thailand during the Vietnam war. He helped repair and maintain aircraft  for a strong defense. After 33 years of service, Lieutenant Colonel  Skoneki retired. But he wanted to continue to serve, so he joined  Alabama's wing of the Civil Air Patrol in Montgomery. He then served  another 16 years helping to support the U.S. Air Force in a civilian  capacity. Now at 87 years old, he is just as proud of his time wearing  this uniform as he has ever been. And he should be.   I would also like to tell the Senate about CSM Joe Godwin of Mobile,  AL. He wanted to join the military ever since he was 14 years old. By  the time he was 17, he couldn't wait anymore; he got his dad's  permission to join the Army.    He went on to serve in three wars: World War II, the Korean war, and  the Vietnam war. He helped guard and transport Nazi prisoners during  the Nuremburg trials.   Today, Joe is 94 years old. When people tell him he is a hero, he  says that the real heroes are the ones who didn't make it back. He is a  humble man. I think they are all heroes, anyone who served, and we  ought to thank them today, tomorrow, and every day.   Finally, I would like to talk a little about SGT David Henry of  Warrior, AL. Sergeant Henry has served as a firefighter and a  paramedic. These experiences gave him skills that he used as a medic in  the Iraq war.   His first deployment came when his son was only 6 months old.  Sergeant Henry deployed again to the Middle East when his son was 3. He  had to sacrifice to be an ocean away from his family during those  crucial times of his son's growing up. He had to explain to a 3-year- old why Dad was going to be gone and he didn't know when he was coming  back.   A lot of families know what that is like. Our heroes in uniform often  serve as a family, and so, on Veterans Day, we thank their families,  too, for their service. They are also making a huge sacrifice for our  country.   Today, Sergeant Henry is back in sweet home Alabama. We are deeply  grateful for his service to Alabama and to America.   Colonel Skoneki, Sergeant Major Godwin, and Sergeant Henry are just  three examples of the 400,000 heroes who call Alabama their home.   The writer G.K. Chesterton once said:         The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in       front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.    You can see that in the lives of these veterans in Alabama. Our  veterans fought because they believe in this United States of America.  They believed America was worth fighting for and even, many, dying for.  They laid down their lives for the people of this country, for millions  of people they don't even know.   Everything we have in this country depends on a military that is very  strong. Our economy, our security, and our way of life depends on our  military.   President Ronald Reagan summed it up best when he said:         Veterans know better than anyone else the price of freedom,       for they've suffered the scars of war. We can offer them no       better tribute than to protect what they have won for us.    This Veterans Day and this Veterans Day weekend, I hope we will  remember the price of freedom and those who have paid that ultimate  price.   To all of our veterans, thank you for your service. Thank you for  your sacrifice to ensure America remains a  [[Page S5441]]  country of freedom and opportunity for all of the many generations to  come.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there  is no institution in the world I honor more than the U.S. military. I  am thankful to every veteran all year long, not just on Veterans Day.   The Republican Party has been a pro-life party for half a century. We  ought to be proud that we stand for life. We stand for the most  vulnerable in our society, the unborn.  [[Page S5450]]    Let me explain, again, why I am doing this and how we got here and  where we go from here. Nine months ago, the Pentagon announced that  they would start using taxpayer dollars to facilitate abortion. The  Pentagon is now paying for travel and extra time--time off--for  servicemembers and their dependents to get abortions.   Let me remind everybody, Congress never voted for this. We also never  appropriated money for this. There is no law that allows this  administration to do this. In fact, there is a law that says they can't  do this. It is 10 U.S.C. section 1093. It says the only time the  Pentagon can spend taxpayer dollars on abortion is in cases of rape,  incest, and a threat to the life of the mom.    So this is a policy that is illegal and immoral. This is about life,  and it is also about the rule of law. It is about our Constitution. It  is about whether we make laws at the Pentagon or whether we follow the  Constitution.   This is also about the integrity of our military. The only thing in  this world I honor more than our military is the Constitution itself,  one that we all swore to serve.   I also feel really strong about the obligation to do something about  this when the Constitution is attacked. I cannot simply sit idly by  when the Biden administration injects politics in our military and  spends taxpayer money on abortion.   The only power that a Senator in the minority has is to put a  nomination on hold--the only power. I am not the first person to do  this. Holds on nominations happen all the time. Holds on military  nominations happen and have happened many times before. Typically, they  don't last long because the Senator gets what he wants and negotiates,  and then doesn't get what he wants. That is not what happened this  time. Abortion is so important to the Democrats that they have not  negotiated with me--zero.   This has been a long 9 months for us all. Every day this continues is  a day that my Democratic colleagues think abortion is more important  than these nominations.   I support many of these nominees. I agree that they are very, very  important jobs. But we could have been voting on these nominees the  entire time. I am not blocking all of these at once. Vote on them one  at a time.   I have been talking about that. The Senate has had more than 90 days  off this year. Each nomination could take as little as 2 hours. We  confirmed three just last week. The nominees at the very top ought to  be voted on anyway. They are very, very important positions. These jobs  are too important not to receive the advice and consent of this body,  the U.S. Senate.   I respectfully disagree with my colleagues about the effect my hold  has on the readiness of our military supposedly--not being able to be  ready because of people not in positions. But not one of these jobs is  unfilled as we speak. Biden officials have been saying this for months,  and nobody has explained to me what reasoning they come up with.   So the fact is, no jobs are going unfilled. Every job is being done.  In fact, GEN Mark Milley, who just retired from the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, said recently that our readiness is the best it has been in  years. Time and time again, generals and servicemembers have assured me  that they are ready. I believe them.   I am going to keep my holds in place. If Senators want to vote on  these nominees one at a time, I am all for it. I will keep my holds in  place until the Pentagon allows me the opportunity to negotiate this  change of law. This is about our Constitution, and it is about the  right to life. They are some of the most important things in this world  and very important to me.   For that, Mr. President, I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.    I object.
