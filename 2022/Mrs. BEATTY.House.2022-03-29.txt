 Madam Speaker, today marks the first annual Ohio  Tuskegee Airmen Day celebration at the National Veterans Memorial and  Museum in my district.   In March 1946, Tuskegee Airmen began to arrive at Lockbourne Army  Airfield, today known as Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base in  Columbus. The airmen were under the leadership of Colonel Benjamin O.  Davis, the first Black officer to command an Air Force base in the  continental United States.   Their achievements during the war paved the way for full integration  of the U.S. military, as pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. These  brave, distinguished Black men received Purple Hearts, Silver Stars,  and Bronze Stars.   They were fighting for our country and for us during a time they were  denied access to the right to vote, housing in certain neighborhoods,  and separate but not equal educational opportunities.   Please join me in recognizing these heroic Black men.                            ____________________
