 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss an important  lifeline to so many North Carolina families, the child tax credit.   In North Carolina alone, millions of families have benefited from the  child tax credit. The first monthly payment lifted 3 million children  out of poverty and significantly reduced childhood hunger. No family  should have to worry about whether they can afford their next meal.   The child tax credit also helps pay for childcare, helps pay for  school supplies, helps when the car breaks down, and helps families  living paycheck to paycheck.   Recently, I heard from a mother in North Carolina who told me that  the child tax credit takes away a layer of stress that is inherent in  trying to return to the workforce and financially plan for a new  setting.   In just a few weeks, these monthly payments are set to expire unless  Build Back Better is passed. We cannot fail the next generation. We  must pass this transformative legislation in the Senate and have the  President sign it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the  Protecting Our Democracy Act, which ensures that our government remains  of, by, and for the people.   I also rise in support of my amendment, which would establish a task  force within the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute, in  collaboration with State and local governments, threats to election  officials.   Poll workers in my home State of North Carolina and their families  have been subjected to harassment, violent threats, and intimidation,  all exacerbated by baseless conspiracies like stop the steal.   We suffered critical shortages of poll workers during the 2020  elections, and over one-quarter of counties in North Carolina had  understaffed polling sites. Threats to election officials are threats  to our democracy and must be stopped.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support poll workers, the  democratic process, my amendment, and the bill.
