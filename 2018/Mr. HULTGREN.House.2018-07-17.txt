 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Hensarling  and Ranking Member Waters for their hard work in crafting this  bipartisan package of bills.   If enacted, this much-needed legislation will deliver American small  businesses and entrepreneurs improved access to capital, which we all  know is the foundation for driving job creation and economic growth.   I am pleased that two of my bills, which are very important to a  number of stakeholders in Illinois, were included in this package. The  Options Markets Stability Act will help maintain options for investors  and support their ability to manage risk in volatile markets.   The Expanding Investment in Small Businesses Act requires the SEC to  study and provide a recommendation to Congress regarding the current  limit on percentage of voting shares a diversified company may hold in  a single issuer, which is currently discouraging funds from investing  in small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this job-creating  legislation.
