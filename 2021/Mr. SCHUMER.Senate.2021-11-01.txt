 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, President Biden unveiled a  framework for his Build Back Better plan that will make historic  investments to help millions of working- and middle-class families  achieve the American dream in the 21st century while taking new and  bold steps to tackle the climate crisis.   Over the weekend, I continued diligent, assiduous negotiations with  my Senate colleagues, the Speaker, and the White House as Congress  prepares to take action on the President's proposals. We are still  talking and working through important details and making good progress,  and I want to thank all my colleagues for their diligence, their  expertise, and their commitment to getting something done.   As I have always said, nobody is going to get everything they want in  the deal, but we will have some things that everyone wants. Even as  legislative text continues to get finalized, the framework itself  already contains very, very good and important things that will make a  tremendous difference in the lives of the American people. It will help  the middle class stay in the middle class. It will help those  struggling to get to the middle class get there a little more easily.  It will really help Americans in ways that Washington has not helped  Americans in quite a few years.   One way it will help is childcare. Tens of millions of American  families struggle with the unaffordable cost of taking care of their  children. For some families, childcare can cost over $10,000 a year,  forcing parents to make the painful choice between going to work and  looking after their kids. The consequences for our economy, with its  shortage of workers, for parents, and for our kids are severe and long- lasting.   The framework, with its historic investments in childcare and  universal pre-K, would finally--finally--provide working- and middle- class families with the urgently needed help they need so parents,  particularly women, can enter the workplace, earn a living, and not  worry about whether their kids are being well taken care of.   The President's framework also makes long-overdue progress in the  fight against climate change. It contains the largest investment to  address the climate crisis in American history.   American families from one coast to the other are in desperate need  of relief from the consequences of climate change. Wildfires in the  West make it harder for people to breathe, especially those with  conditions like asthma. Flooding in the Midwest destroys crops and  homes and local economies and poisons fragile ecosystems and even the  safety of drinking water. Extreme storms in the winter make it harder  for those without proper heating to stay safe, as we saw tragically in  Texas. Of course, the hurricanes and tropical storms on the east coast  have caused regular flooding, the likes of which we haven't seen in a  long time occurring as recently in the Mid-Atlantic as this weekend.   We have an opportunity--a real opportunity--to take unprecedented  action to protect Americans against these threats. While there will be  so much more to do, this is a bold step in the right direction. As the  President spoke before the world today in Glasgow, his framework is  proof the United States is ready to once again lead by example against  the greatest existential crisis of our time.   There is so much more to like in this framework. As I have said  repeatedly, when this bill is passed, it will be fully paid for and  reduce--reduce--inflationary pressures--something that has  [[Page S7524]]  been affirmed by many, many economists. It will be fully paid for and,  at the same time, will reduce some of the bottlenecks and high costs  that people have. It will lower people's costs in many ways.  Particularly, we are making regular progress to lower prescription drug  prices as we work to refine the agreement.    The framework will also make healthcare more affordable, cut taxes  for working and middle-class Americans, and most importantly, provide  long-sought ladders for families to climb up to the middle class and  give them the stability needed to stay in the middle class once they  get there.   It will lower costs for people in many different ways--one of our  main goals. This will be just what the American people need, and it  will not be--will not be--inflationary.   So the announcement last week from the President brought us one step  closer toward our goal of delivering help to the American people at  every stage of their lives. We are going to keep working this week to  get this legislation over the finish line. Democrats are committed to  rewarding the trust that the American people have placed in us.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on judges and nominations, last  week, the Senate confirmed seven--seven--more judges to serve lifetime  appointments on the Federal bench.   Just about all of them were people of color; all but two were women.  Among them were more Federal defenders, civil rights lawyers, election  experts. They will bring sorely needed diversity to the judiciary--not  just personal diversity or demographic diversity, as important as that  is, but professional diversity as well, adding to the breadth and width  and depth of knowledge possessed by the courts.   It is no longer a bench that we are appointing that is simply  prosecutors or partners in large law firms, but many, many others from  walks of life with different and needed perspectives on the Federal  bench.   Today, we are going to pick up right where we left off. Later this  afternoon, we will vote to confirm Beth Robinson, of Vermont, to serve  on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Toby Heytens  to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.   A former clerk to the late Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Heytens is a veteran  of the Justice Department and is the current Solicitor General of the  Commonwealth of Virginia. He is regarded by both sides of the aisle as  a superbly skilled lawyer and an impartial thinker.   In Justice Robinson, who has spent 10 distinguished years on the  Vermont State Supreme Court, the Senate is presented with another  experienced, dedicated, and historic nominee. She would be the very  first openly gay woman to serve not just in the Second Circuit, but in  any Federal circuit court in the country--another barrier torn down in  the halls of justice. We are proud of tearing down those barriers and  making the bench more inclusive and more like America. I look forward  to her confirmation today.   In the weeks and months to come, Senate Democrats will continue  pressing ahead to bring balance back to our Federal courts with  diverse, mainstream, qualified, and impartial jurists.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act and cloture, the fight to protect our democracy from  voter suppression and election subversion continues in the U.S. Senate.  Later this evening, I will file cloture on the motion to proceed to the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, setting up a vote to take  place on Wednesday.   This bill, which my friends, Senators Leahy and Durbin, worked  assiduously to put together, will restore the key protections of the  Voting Rights Act--the crowning achievement of the civil rights era-- that were wrongly gutted in one of the worst decisions the Supreme  Court has made in a long time--in 2013, the Shelby decision--done by a  conservative majority on the Court.   Specifically, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would  update the preclearance protections that prohibited States with records  of voter suppression from making changes to election law without  Federal approval.   Recent history makes absolutely clear that we need these protections  on the books. Thanks to the Shelby decision, we now live in an era of  increased voter suppression in the United States. After that decision,  States like Texas and North Carolina, sadly, sprang into action to make  it harder for minority, younger, and lower income people to vote. Many  more States followed years later, and we are suffering the consequences  of that decision to this day.   Few of the Justices had thought, I believe, that we didn't need these  preclearances because there is no more voter discrimination. Lord, were  they wrong. We must reverse their awful Shelby decision.   If there is anything that merits debate here in the Senate, it is  protecting the precious right of Americans to participate in our  elections. Since its original passage, the Voting Rights Act has been  updated five times--five times--with support from both Democrats and  Republicans. We should, likewise, proceed this time around on this  time-honored measure.   I want to make clear: If the Senate votes to proceed on to the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I am prepared to offer a full- fledged debate befitting this great Chamber. Republicans will be given  the chance to raise their objections, to offer amendments, and to make  changes to the bill. I know that both parties have serious  disagreements on this important issue, so we want to hear from the  other side what they propose. But for that to happen, we need to start  debate first; we need to vote to allow the Senate to work through its  process; we need 60 votes simply to say we will debate this issue. We  will get a chance to see what happens this week.   Time is really getting short for the Senate to take action on voting  rights before Americans go to the polls in the 2022 elections. It is  essential that we restore preclearance protections before the start of  next year, when States are set to consider another round of restrictive  voting rights laws when their legislative sessions start in the spring.   Indeed, the dangerous and draconian Republican laws we have seen in  2021 are only the beginning if this body doesn't take action, and they  are a very serious threat to our democracy--one of the greatest threats  to democracy that has come around in a long time.   So I hope both parties will proceed on legislation that has long  enjoyed bipartisan support in this Chamber. Our democracy demands we  act.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, in 1 minute, I will be filing cloture  on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, but I am going to give a short,  brief remark before I do that.   Now, tonight, I am filing cloture on a motion to proceed on the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. That means that the Senate is  going to take a first vote on whether or not we even debate this voting  rights bill--even debate it--on Wednesday.   Our democracy relies on the guarantee of free and fair elections.  Across the country, we are witnessing a coordinated assault on the  integrity of our electoral process. We must advance critical reforms to  protect the freedom to vote, fulfilling the life and the legacy of our  late colleague John Lewis.   If there is any issue that deserves debate in this Chamber, it is  protecting voting rights. I know that both parties have differences on  this important issue, but Republicans shouldn't be afraid to debate the  bill.   If the Senate votes to open debate to this bill, I am prepared to  offer an open and honest and full-fledged process here on the Senate  floor, where Republican amendments will be made in order and allowed  and debated.   If Republican Senators have different ideas on how to achieve a  stronger democracy, they owe it to the American people to come forward  and debate their ideas. Simply standing silent with their arms crossed,  refusing to allow the Senate to function, is unacceptable.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 143,  S. 4.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, November 1,  be waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Tuesday, November 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Davidson nomination; further, that notwithstanding  rule XXII, at 11 a.m., the Senate vote on cloture on the Davidson,  Harris, and Coleman nominations in the order listed; and that following  the cloture vote on the Coleman nomination, the Senate recess until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; further, that at  2:20 p.m., the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  Prieto and Nayak nominations, in the order listed; that at 5:15 p.m.,  the Senate vote on confirmation of the Davidson nomination if cloture  has been invoked; and that upon disposition of the Davidson nomination,  the Senate resume consideration of the Harris nomination.   Finally, if any nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's session,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For information of Senators, there will be three  rollcall votes at 11 a.m., two rollcall votes at 2:20 p.m., and one  rollcall vote at 5:15 p.m.   If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that  it stand adjourned under the previous order following the remarks of  Senator Cruz.
