 Madam Speaker, last month, I toured Penn State University  Park campus located in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.   During that time, I had the opportunity to speak with students,  staff, and faculty about ongoing projects and why they are proud to be  part of an internationally sought-after education program.   Penn State University was founded as a land grant university, meaning  its mission is to serve the public, especially the people of  Pennsylvania.   After my tour of the campus and seeing their impressive research  facilities, I can say with confidence that Penn State remains focused  on that original mission. Whether it is helping the agriculture  community with ag extensions or working on important defense-related  research for the Federal Government, Penn State is an important State  and national resource.   I look forward to continuing to work with Penn State in carrying out  its public mission and remaining a premier national institution.                            ____________________
