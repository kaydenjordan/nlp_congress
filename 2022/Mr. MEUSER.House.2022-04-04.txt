 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Lieutenant William Lebo of the Lebanon City, Pennsylvania, Police  Department. Lieutenant Lebo was shot and killed in the line of duty  last week.   Lieutenant Lebo was a dedicated, 40-year veteran of the Lebanon City  Police Department and planned to retire on May 1 of this year.   Lieutenant Lebo and two other officers, Ryan Adams and Derek  Underkoffler, were responding to a domestic disturbance last Thursday  when the offender immediately opened fire on them. All three officers  were shot, and tragically, Lieutenant Lebo was fatally wounded.   Lieutenant Lebo has been remembered by his colleagues and those he  served as a calm, kind, and ethical police officer who was deeply  devoted to protecting the Lebanon community.   This tragedy serves as a devastating reminder that every day law  enforcement officers put on their uniforms and go to work, as my father  did, to protect and serve, always knowing full well that they may not  return home.   Today and always, we owe our continued support to our police officers  and their families in Pennsylvania and across America.   We all send our deepest condolences to Lieutenant Lebo's wife, Lora;  his daughter, Corrine; and his entire family, as well as the Lebanon  City Police  [[Page H4147]]  Department, the Lebanon DA's office, and the entire Lebanon community.                            ____________________
