 Mr. Speaker, please accept this personal explanation as  I was unavoidably detained due to my presence as the White House for  the historic signing of the Abraham Accords between the United States,  Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. Had I been present, I  would have voted: ``nay'' on rollcall No. 185 and ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 186.                             personal explanation
