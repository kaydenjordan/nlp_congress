 Madam Speaker, today President Trump delivered on  [[Page H6634]]  his promise to the American people. He said he would discontinue the  DACA immigration program, which allows hundreds of thousands of illegal  immigrants to stay in the country and receive work permits.   By ending the unconstitutional DACA program, he has overturned the  last of President Obama's amnesty agenda and returned to the rule of  law. President Obama, a former constitutional law professor, said many  times that DACA was unconstitutional.   Congress and the administration should strengthen our laws against  illegal immigration and ensure that our immigration policies put  unemployed Americans first. The U.S. labor participation rate is at a  40-year low.   President Trump is right to discontinue the DACA program and let  Congress address immigration policies, including securing the border.                            ____________________
