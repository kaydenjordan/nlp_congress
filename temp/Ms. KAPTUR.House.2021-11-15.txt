 Madam Speaker, as cochair of the Congressional Ukraine  and Polish Caucus and member of the Belarus Caucus, I rise with deep  concern about Russia's expansionary combativeness in Europe.   Russia is amassing tens of thousands more troops and equipment near  Ukraine's border, which it has already invaded and killed over 13,000  individuals, threatening global security. Now Belarus, with the support  of Russia, is working to undermine the European Union by spearheading a  migration crisis at the border with Poland, patrolled by--guess what?-- Russian troops.   The free world must strongly condemn Belarus' cruel weaponization of  immigration and the loss of life it is causing. As well, we must work  to protect our Polish allies and the lives of desperate migrants at the  border. If that is not enough, Europe is facing an energy crisis forced  upon it by the Kremlin. Russia is seeking to weaponize energy to weaken  the Transatlantic resolve.   To combat this, I am working with my colleagues to deliver $300  million in investments to support the Three Seas Initiative to help  Europe diversify its energy sources and restore energy independence.  America must stand in strong solidarity with our European allies who  love liberty.                            ____________________
