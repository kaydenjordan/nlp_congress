 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I  rise to pay tribute and honor the activities of the great First Lady,  the first that I ever had the opportunity to know, and that is First  Lady Rosalynn Carter, who was funeralized earlier today.   As a young activist, as we organized and tried to organize community  health centers and community mental health centers, along with us was  First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who was often at the meetings. Sometimes,  she wouldn't say anything. She would take notes.   Not only did we have a friend in the White House in President Carter,  but we also had a great friend and advocate in the person of First Lady  Rosalynn Carter.   May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
