 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2543, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   This week, Democrats have a bill on the floor to ``address inflation  and help bring costs down for Americans.''   Just last week, President Biden stated that inflation is his ``top  domestic priority.'' So, let's talk about inflation if we are going to  talk about the Federal Reserve. Let's look at the numbers. Let's look  at the stats.   The President announced that his focus is going to be on the economy  this month. To kick it off, his Treasury Secretary, Secretary Yellen,  finally admitted that she was wrong when she called inflation  transitory last year.   To the Biden administration and congressional Democrats, I would like  to say to you: Welcome to the party. You are a year late. The American  people have been feeling this pain of inflation, and I am glad you are  coming to the realization that we have to do something about it.  Republicans welcome the conversation.   Inflation has surged to a 40-year high. Stats across the board are  terrible. Everyday goods and services are more unaffordable today,  especially for low-and middle-income Americans and those on fixed  incomes. Skyrocketing consumer prices are outpacing wage gains. U.S.  households will spend an extra $5,200 this year compared to last year  for the same basket of goods and services they normally buy.   The national average for the price of gasoline has reached a  staggering $5 a gallon. If that weren't bad enough, our economy is now  shrinking. The U.S. GDP came in at a negative 1.4 percent in the first  quarter of this year. That is problematic. That is bad.   Democrats want to blame everything from Putin to so-called corporate  profiteering for the inflation crisis. They are still looking for who  did it. Well, guess what, folks. The call is coming from within the  house. They are the ones that put this on the American people.   This is all the result of Democrats' bad economic policies, and this  crisis is of their own making. The American people know it. They see  it. They feel it. They experience it.   In a recent poll released by The Wall Street Journal, 83 percent of  respondents rated current economic conditions as poor or not good. This  is the result of Democrat economic policies. Since they control the  fullness of the Federal Government, they have put their economic  policies into place, and we are living with the bad consequences. All  across the board, inflation is way up.  [[Page H5569]]    In another poll released by RealClearPolitics, 60 percent of the  American people disapprove specifically of President Biden's handling  of the economy.   What is the Democrats' strategy? It is to distract struggling  families with this bill that we have on the floor today, a bill that  might sound good but does nothing to bring down consumer prices or help  struggling families.   Let's talk about the contents of the bill. Republicans support  improving diversity in financial services, but H.R. 2543, this bill,  misses the mark. Committee Democrats had the opportunity to work with  Republicans on a bipartisan legislative package to achieve that goal.  In fact, five of the bills that make up this package received some  Republican support, either in markup, in committee, or on the floor in  previous Congresses. But instead of working with Republicans, committee  Democrats injected this package with another eight partisan poison  pills.   First, this bill blatantly politicizes the Federal Reserve. In fact,  it tasks the Fed with a third mandate, and that third mandate is to  close socioeconomic disparities instead of focusing on what we have  asked the Fed to focus on, which is price stability and maximum  employment possible. So much for the President saying he is not going  to politicize the Fed or he is going to respect the Fed's independence.  This bill goes completely counter to that.   This bill will make credit more expensive and less accessible to  those who need it the most.   This bill will also pile regulatory costs on small businesses,  forcing them to divert resources from business operations to report on  diversity and inclusion metrics outlined in this bill. Currently,  businesses can self-assess the makeup of their workforce. This bill  would impose a one-size-fits-all mandate on all job creators,  regardless of size, geographic location, or business model.   This bill is a boon for litigious trial lawyers, and it is a boon for  them because it expands ECOA, and it opens businesses up to new  lawsuits. This creates uncertainty in the credit markets, ultimately  increasing the cost of credit and making it more difficult to assess  credit risks for financial institutions and businesses.   Finally, while Americans are reeling from higher prices, this bill  will make it more expensive for families to purchase a home. This bill  will impose additional costs on creditors and servicers, which will  inevitably be passed on to those applying for loans.   The bottom line, this is just another attempt by House Democrats to  divert voters' attention from the big issues of the day, and that is  their dismal economic record that they have foisted upon the American  people.   If House Democrats are serious about addressing inflation, as the  Biden administration has claimed and as the President has specifically  said he is focused on this month, if they were serious, they would  abandon a partisan messaging bill like the one we have on the House  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my colleague and friend and the ranking member of  the National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy  Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Davidson), the ranking member of the Fintech Task Force on the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose), my friend and colleague, and a leader on the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), a leader on the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), a longtime member and leader on the  Agriculture Committee and the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a great leader on the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans say inflation is the most  important issue facing the country, that is according to ABC News/Ipsos  poll. We can't get 80 percent of the American people to agree on  anything in our political discussion, but they agree that this economy  and this inflation are problematic.   We have been given our marching orders. Congress must act to address  skyrocketing prices and provide relief to struggling families. That is  what the American people are telling us we should be focused on.   Instead, here we are debating a messaging bill that stands no chance  of becoming law.   I have already run through a long list of bad things in this bill. I  did that in my opening, so I would rather spend the rest of my time  discussing what western North Carolinians are most worried about, what  my constituents are most worried about.   In the core part of my district known as the Catawba Valley, the cost  of housing alone has increased more than 15 percent since last year.  Where I live in the Lake Norman region, local food banks are struggling  to keep up with the surging cost of food and increased demand stemming  from those costs.   One food bank operator said: ``We are out of staples.''   That is a frightening thing.   They also added: We are tired of high grocery bills. We are tired of  gas prices  [[Page H5574]]  going up. One of my constituents from Winston-Salem said that on a  local Fox affiliate.   North Carolinians are fed up. The American people are fed up. They  don't like what they see economically, and they deserve real answers  and real solutions to address that core problem--the core issue of  inflation.   So let me be clear. There is no mystery of why we have runaway  inflation. It is Democrats' reckless spending that is the driver of  this. They have managed the fiscal house for a year and a half, and  they have managed to drive our economy into the ditch.   So we have got to get it out of the ditch. We have got to get it back  on the road. We have to be in the right direction with a growing  economy, not a shrinking economy, and with wages increasing more than  the cost of the goods that people need to live.   So instead of addressing this crisis of their own making, Democrats  would rather distract Americans with a bill that does nothing to bring  down costs. This is yet another attempt to distract the American people  from that basic challenge and that basic fact of high inflation.   But to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: you aren't  fooling anyone. The American people are on to who caused inflation, who  started inflation, and who is driving up the cost of energy bills, both  at home and in their car. They understand why, and there are real  consequences for not addressing the needs of the American people.   Thankfully, I have faith in the American people to get this right. I  hope our elected officials will follow suit. We, on the Republican side  of the aisle, are hearing this loud and clear, and that is why we are  trying to return to fiscal stability and fiscal sanity and return to  sound money. That is our focus.   Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn't address the core problems the American  people are telling us we should address, and that is why we should  reject this bill that does nothing to answer the call the American  people have made.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment en bloc. We know that Democrats'  reckless spending and bad economic policies are hurting the American  people.   Let's look at the inflation numbers. You have fuel oil, gasoline,  used cars, groceries, and public transit all dramatically up.   Inflation is the big issue. Inflation is at a 40-year high of 8.6  percent--a 40-year high. Food is up 10 percent, gas 50 percent, shelter  5.5 percent from just last year. This is a result of Democrat policies.   The American people will pay $5,200 more this year than last year for  the same goods and services. This is a direct result of bad economic  policies.   Instead of working with Republicans to address these crises,  Democrats are jamming through a partisan messaging bill that stands no  chance of becoming law. This is bad policy. It is bad politics, bad  process, the whole thing. The en bloc is more of the same.   Now, I will say that there are a few of the amendments that  Republicans could support. I will give you an example.   Ms. Garcia offered an amendment that focused on onerous HUD  regulations or unfair funding formulas. Committee Republicans and House  Republicans agree that HUD should not get in the way of local public  housing authorities' ability to provide assistance to the homeless.   A recent Government Accountability Office study examines--well, there  is a request in the bill that we have a study to examine and report on  the impediments that HUD is putting in place so that we can actually  better serve the very people that we intend for the Housing and Urban  Development Department to serve and for public housing authorities to  serve.   But rather than work with committee Republicans on this issue,  Democrats poisoned the well with partisan amendments to score political  wins with their progressive base.   For example, in this en bloc, Democrats want to further politicize  the Federal Reserve by adding a third mandate to address socioeconomic  issues. This will divert the Fed's attention from its dual mandate of  maximum sustainable employment and price stability. It will also  threaten the stability of the monetary policy authorities we have given  the Fed and add uncertainty and risk to the Fed's responsibilities.   The Federal Reserve is independent for a reason. It ensures that it  is accountable to the American people and long-term economic growth,  not to political whims or serving one party here in Washington. Even  President Biden acknowledged the importance of the Fed's independence  in his so-called plan for fighting inflation.   Additionally, this en bloc continues Democrats' government-knows-best  approach. For example, it directs HUD and Treasury to create another  interagency task force to focus on the state of housing in this  country. Housing doesn't need another task force. It needs results.   To be clear, HUD's mission is to ``create strong, sustainable,  inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all.''   After 50 years, and nearly $2 trillion in spending, this amendment  says that HUD is not getting the job done. An additional interagency  task force isn't going to fix that.   Congress needs to reform how HUD operates so that it can assist the  families and individuals it is tasked with serving.   In conclusion, this en bloc is more of the same. It will politicize  the Fed, expand the CFPB's authority, and make credit harder to access  and more expensive, ultimately harming the very consumers Democrats are  claiming to help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc, and I urge  my colleagues to oppose the bill. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let's focus on the main thing. The main thing to the  American people right now is what they see when they fill up their tank  at the pumps and buy gas. It is what they see when they go to the  grocery store. It is what they see in their daily lives.   What they are seeing in their daily lives is inflation at a 40-year  high. Here are fantastic examples that are horrible, horrible things to  see, but they are important that we see because this is what the  American people are facing.   Inflation is at a 40-year high. Food prices are up 10 percent, gas 50  percent, and shelter 5.5 percent from just last year. The American  people will pay $5,200 more this year than they did last year for the  same goods and services.   This is a direct result of Democrats' fiscal plans. It is a direct  result of the Democrats' economic strategy, and we are suffering the  consequences from it.   This bill, and the amendments that pass on the floor today, will do  nothing to help struggling American families. Nothing.   Instead, they will politicize the Fed, expand the CFPB's authority,  and make credit more expensive and harder to get. This is bad news. It  is bad policy. It is a bad process.   We should reject it. We should make sure this bill does not become  law.  [[Page H5583]]    I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Republican en  bloc, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The amendments in this en bloc are where we should have started this  debate. These amendments would improve the bill and provide real  solutions for the American people who are suffering under the weight of  misguided Democrat economic policies.   In whole, this amendment package would make the bill bipartisan and  give us a real chance to pass the Senate and become law. These  amendments would preserve the sections of the bill that Republicans  supported during committee consideration, such as promoting new and  diverse depository institutions, improving corporate governance through  diversity, ensuring diversity in community banking, expanding  opportunity for minority depository institutions, and improving the  CDFI Bond Guarantee Program.   These are the bipartisan pieces of the bill. These five bills are the  result of bipartisan discussions and compromise. They show that  Congress is capable of working together and putting the American people  first rather than really a far-left agenda that the rest of the bill is  pushing.   These bills collectively would help to identify and implement  solutions to support small banks and credit unions in the communities  they serve.   Furthermore, this amendment en bloc would strike section 1071 of the  Dodd-Frank Act which requires the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau--which is an unaccountable agency, by the way--to issue a rule  to force banks and credit unions to collect and report demographic data  on small business loan applications.   We have seen what the CFPB can do under Director Chopra's scorched- earth policies. This proposed rule will make small business lending  more costly and difficult for financial institutions of all shapes and  sizes. It will also choke off the very access to credit those small  businesses need right now.   So instead of limiting small business credit options and saddling  them with unnecessary regulations, as the underlying bill does, we  should focus on fostering growth and help small businesses succeed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I would just reiterate the amendments in this en bloc are  how we should have started this debate and how we should have started  this bill.   These amendments would improve the bill and provide real solutions  for American people who are suffering under the weight of misguided  Democrat policies.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Gonzalez's attempt to help  community banks. I would say that this amendment really doesn't do  anything substantive to the bill. It doesn't help community banks  compete and survive in the current regulatory environment.   In fact, if we were really serious about helping community banks, we  would be looking at the Dodd-Frank Act and the additional regulatory  burdens in place on these financial institutions, but we are not. This  bill doesn't do that. We would be looking at the regulatory burdens  that Dodd-Frank keeps on institutions that keeps them from lending to  their consumers, the compliance cost burdens that make accessing credit  more difficult, especially for hard-to-reach communities.   Last year, Democrats got rid of the true lender doctrine, which  focused on providing legal certainty to banks and fintech partnerships.  The true lender doctrine would have actually helped provide clarity and  lower the cost and access to credit. It is these partnerships between  fintechs and community banks that harness and scale technology and  provide consumers with the financial products that they want and need,  particularly in underserved communities.   If we are really serious about reaching underserved communities--and  I think we should be--we should restore the true lender doctrine and  rightsize overly burdensome regulations on community banks.   Those are the important points I would like to make in light of this  amendment. I welcome a discussion about those issues. I think we have a  lot of mutual concerns about the challenges the American people are  facing, but I think it is important that we get to the big issues that  are central in this economy, given the economic circumstances we are  currently in as a result of Democrat policies, and we should be working  to fix those big issues.   While I am not opposed to the amendment--I think it is fine; I am not  going to oppose it--I think it is important that we highlight the big  and essential things we should be about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just reiterate that this amendment really doesn't do anything  substantive. If we are serious about helping community banks,  rightsizing burdensome regulations would be the way to go, and  reinstating the true lender doctrine would be a strong first step.  There are bigger things that we should be doing to help these  institutions.   While I am not opposed to the amendment, I think we should be doing  the big, substantive items that are important for us to have a  competitive economic situation for working Americans. We should be  about these bigger items and focus on them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is a solution in search of a  problem and provides a pathway for frivolous lawsuits in Federal court.  Cash continues to be an important form of payment in many communities  across America. However, businesses that have a substantial number of  customers who wish to transact in cash already accept cash.   The amendment's requirements will impact small business owners in  particular, who will be required to accept cash payment whether or not  it makes economic or business sense.   Additionally, this amendment would give preferential treatment to  ancillary service providers that may be facing a downturn in demand for  services due to an increasing electronic payment usage desire among  consumers.   Let's look at the bill. Let me try to explain it. The bill would  prohibit retail businesses from refusing cash payments below $2,000. It  would prohibit the retail business from charging a higher price to any  customer who pays by cash than is customarily going to be charged for  using other forms of payment. It provides a private right of action-- that means that they can sue--in Federal court for consumers who are  aggrieved.   The amendment provides exceptions to these prohibitions, including if  the business provides a mechanism to convert cash to prepaid cards.   This is really the desire to force basically ATMs into retail  establishments. That is the construct of the bill. So imagine you are a  small business, and now under Federal law, you are required to take a  $2,000 cash payment. That seems onerous. Imagine you are a small  businessperson who is now going to be faced potentially with lawsuits  in Federal court for a failure to provide an ATM machine in your  establishment. This seems quite onerous.   We can get into the question of the soundness of a fully digitized  world. There is a serious debate to be had here, and there is an  economic inclusion debate that is necessary for us to have. In a world  of digital payments, not everyone is digital, so we have to make sure  that we get to those key issues.   But this bill is rather convoluted, and it provides a number of  requirements for businesses that are not in keeping with trying to get  at the question of cash acceptance. I think we should have some serious  discussions about cash acceptance, especially for our communities  across America that are not online and don't have credit cards or  prepaid cards in their pocket.   I think there are things we can still work on in this space.  Unfortunately, this bill is too convoluted with too many mechanisms  that would provide too many opportunities for new lawsuits, so I oppose  it. I think it is important that we oppose this amendment, as I did in  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5586]]         Mr. Speaker, has the gentleman's time fully expired?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from New Jersey. I agree with  Mr. Payne on his choice of attire. I think the fact that two of us, who  are very well dressed--appropriately dressed, I would say--are having a  debate and are on different sides of this issue is very unbecoming of  the bowtie community. We stand together more closely than this.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleague--the fact that he has an  undertaking in this arena to talk about the question of cash  acceptance, I think, is important.   There are a number of questions that I have raised about this bill  that I think are important. The private right of action in Federal  court is problematic for us on this side of the aisle. The requirement  to have a machine on site--on page 2 of the bill, it says the retail  facility, or whatever the facility is, that is accepting payment, they  have to provide customers with the means on the premises to convert  cash into a card that is either a general-use prepaid card, a gift  card, or an access device for electronic funds transfer. So it is a  very specific requirement to have on premises.   Imagine the same scenario of this nice lady that lives in his  district, Mr. Payne's district, who goes downstairs to purchase  whatever, whether it is from a grocery store or whatever. Now, imagine  they had an ATM that was two doors down. Under the construct of this  bill, that wouldn't be sufficient.   There are important things to get at here. I oppose the amendment,  but I welcome the debate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
