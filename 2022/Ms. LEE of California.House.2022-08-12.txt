 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. I thank the chairman for yielding his  time and also for his leadership.   This historic bill puts people over politics by lowering the cost of  living for necessities like healthcare, creating good-paying jobs, and  ensuring that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share of  taxes.   Now, we know that lower-income communities and communities of color  face the brunt of pollution and climate change. This bill makes the  single largest investment in combating climate change and works to  reduce carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030. We still have a lot  ahead, though, and much more work to do, like fighting for investments  that have deep impacts on communities of color, such as housing, the  child tax credit, investments in our care economy, universal childcare,  and insulin caps beyond Medicare which disproportionately impacts  people of color. But make no mistake, this bill will make an impact on  families and our planet.   It is a shame and disgrace that Republicans won't vote for this bill.  But this bill helps Republican constituents also.   So I am so proud today to vote for this bill for our Republican  constituents.
