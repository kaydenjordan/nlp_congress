 Mr. President, recently I came to the Senate floor to  speak about the airborne leg of the nuclear triad. Today I rise to  discuss the value of another leg of the triad--our intercontinental  ballistic missiles, or ICBMs.   Following the brief deployment of the Atlas and Titan ICBM weapon  systems in the early 1960s, the United States deployed the first  Minuteman ICBMs in support of the strategic deterrence mission. Over  half a century later, today the United States deploys 400 Minuteman III  ICBMs, each carrying a single warhead. While the Minuteman III system  was deployed in the 1970s, much of its technology dates to the previous  decade. The system was originally designed for a 10-year service life  but has sustained an exceptionally high availability rate and is  expected to remain in service through the 2030s, thanks to a series of  life-extension programs. But we cannot extend the current system beyond  2030, and that is why we are now developing its replacement--the ground  based strategic deterrent. Doing so will require resources in a budget- constrained environment and, perhaps for that reason, we are hearing  renewed calls to abandon the triad and cut our ICBM force. However,  this step would be foolish and dangerous to the United States and to  our allied security for several reasons.   First, ICBMs are highly reliable and always ready. That is why they  are regarded as the most responsive leg of the triad. Unlike bombers  and submarines, which may require time to arm or maneuver, the ICBM  force provides the President the ability to promptly respond if  deterrence fails. This virtue is often mischaracterized as a source of  risk.   The system's rapid response is described as a ``hair trigger'' by  critics who often paint chilling pictures of 400 ICBMs automatically  flying to their  [[Page S2417]]  targets and causing Armageddon, either by accident or as a result of  cyber interference.   I want to be clear that there is no ``hair trigger'' about our ICBMs.  We have many safeguards put in place to ensure the system operates only  as intended. For example, our ICBMs are actually targeted on the open- ocean spaces as a means of ensuring that, even if all of our safeguards  failed and a missile somehow managed to launch by accident, it would  land in the ocean and not accidentally start a nuclear war. The critics  conveniently fail to mention this.   Former STRATCOM commander General Robert Kehler recently testified  before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he said: ``It isn't the  same thing at all as thinking about a Wild West hair trigger . . . .  It's not the way it works.''   The high readiness of the ICBM force also provides an important hedge  against uncertainty. Since we no longer maintain bombers on nuclear  alert, the ICBMs and the submarines reinforce each other so that a  technical failure in one leg of the triad does not render our day-to- day deterrent inoperative.   Those who advocate for doing away with the ICBM force must account  for the fact that, under their proposals, in such moments there would  not have been an additional leg of the triad to ensure our Nation isn't  left without a nuclear deterrent. As our nuclear forces continue to  age, reliability challenges will only grow.   Critics often describe the ICBM force as being vulnerable, even going  so far as to call our missiles sitting ducks. It is true that silos are  not hidden, they aren't mobile, and they can be targeted. But, again,  this is a misunderstanding of what actually is the strength of the ICBM  force.   In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General  Hyten stated that the ICBM force ``creates the most significant  targeting problem for an adversary, because there are 400 separate  targets across the United States. All would have to be independently  targeted by an adversary. That targeting problem is hugely problematic  and creates a significant advantage for us.''   Simply put, destroying 400 hardened and geographically dispersed  silos is an extremely difficult proposition. Only Russia possesses the  capability to destroy our ICBM force. No other nation on Earth can do  so, and it would greatly diminish Russia's arsenal in the process. That  is not a vulnerability. As General Hyten clearly states, it is a  significant advantage for our Nation.   For these reasons and many others, Republican and Democratic  administrations alike have maintained ICBMs as part of our nuclear  forces for decades. The role of ICBMs has been reconsidered and  reviewed many times, and their value has been repeatedly reaffirmed in  a bipartisan manner. For example, last November the report by the  bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission stated that the triad  presents insurmountable targeting challenges for adversaries, imposes  disproportionate costs on adversary defenses, and hedges against  unforeseen geopolitical or technological changes.   Mr. President, I will close by saying that our ICBM forces make key  contributions to our overall nuclear forces and, as Members on both  sides of the aisle agree, they are an essential ingredient to the  bedrock of our national security--our nuclear deterrent.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 4 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
