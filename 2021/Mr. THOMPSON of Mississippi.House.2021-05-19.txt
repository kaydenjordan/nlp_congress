 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.  Res. 409, which allows for the debate on H.R. 3233, the National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States  Capitol Complex Act. After months of negotiations, last week I was  pleased to introduce this measure with the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Katko).   Back in 2007, I was proud to be the lead sponsor of legislation to  implement the unfulfilled recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I can  say with certainty, at that time, I could never have imagined that I  would be standing here today, almost 15 years later, advocating for the  establishment of a 9/11-style commission to investigate a violent  domestic attack on the United States Capitol.   On January 6, the world watched Americans storm the Capitol and  engage in violence to try to intimidate and prevent Congress from  carrying out its constitutional duty to certify a Presidential  election, a solemn process central to the peaceful transfer of power in  our democracy.   Like the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the events of January 6 have cast a  long shadow on our country. Like the 9/11 terrorist attacks, it has  raised fundamental questions about information-sharing, coordination,  preparedness, and response at all levels of government.   When the defenses around the citadel of our democracy fail as  profoundly as they did on January 6, then attention must be paid. At  least one Capitol Police Officer died because of the cause of the  violence that day. Others died too, and injuries were extensive also-- not the least of which is the body blow of Americans' confidence that  the reforms undertaken after 9/11 would deliver better information- sharing and coordination to keep us secure.   H.R. 3233 authorizes the establishment of a 10-member commission that  mirrors the 9/11 Commission, the gold standard for bipartisan  commissions. The January 6 Commission would be required to investigate  and report on all the facts and causes of the attack including relevant  influencing factors that may have contributed to the attack.   Given how politically charged the events of January 6 have become, we  need to come together in a patriotic, bipartisan way and approve this  independent body, just as we did when we approved the creation of the  9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission acted not out of partisanship, but  out of patriotism. We need that same sense of duty today. Apathy is not  a security strategy, and neither are ignorance or willful disregard.   After such a shocking attack, nothing short of a full accounting of  what took place will put us on the path to improving our homeland  security.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 409, I call up the bill (H.R. 3233) to establish the  National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United  States Capitol Complex, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3233, the National Commission  to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol  Complex Act.   On January 6, the world watched Americans storm the Capitol and  engage in violence to try and intimidate and prevent Congress from  carrying out its constitutional duty to certify a Presidential  election, a solemn process central to the peaceful transfer of power in  our democracy.   Many of us sitting here today were rushed out of this very Chamber by  Capitol Police to safety as violent attackers roamed the halls, hunting  for our colleagues and the Vice President.   I was in the gallery that day watching the debate when this temple of  our democracy was desecrated and debased.   At least one Capitol Police officer died because of the violence that  day. Others died, too.   And there were extensive injuries associated with the attacks, not  the least of which was the body blow to Americans' confidence that the  reforms undertaken after the 9/11 terrorist attacks would make us more  secure.   Like the 9/11 attacks, the events of January 6 have cast a long  shadow on our country. And like the 9/11 attacks, the January 6 attack  raises fundamental questions about information sharing, coordination,  preparedness, and response at all levels of government.   We need a bipartisan commission made up of experts to come together  to give us an unvarnished view of what happened that day, examine why  our systems failed, and develop bipartisan recommendations for reform  to address any identified gaps.  [[Page H2577]]    I am proud to be here with my partner on the Homeland Security  Committee, the gentleman from New York,   John Katko, to debate a bill  that establishes a 10-member commission that mirrors the 9/11  Commission, the gold standard for bipartisan commissions.   The January 6 commission would be required to investigate and report  on the facts and causes of the attack, including relevant contributing  factors.   A commission of this nature, in some form, has been talked about by  Members of Congress, national security experts, and others for some  time now. Over the past 4 months, discussion drafts have been  circulated, pros and cons have been weighed, and obstacles have been  overcome to get us to this day.   Given how politically charged the events of January 6 have become, we  need to come together in a patriotic, bipartisan way and approve this  independent body just as we created the 9/11 Commission.   The 9/11 Commission acted, not out of partisanship, but out of  patriotism. We need that same sense of duty today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the  ranking member, this won't be the last time that we put together  legislation for the good of this country, I assure you of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres), the vice chair of the Homeland Security Committee.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the former Secretary of  State from Rhode Island, who is now a member of the Committee on  Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California, (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), a member of the Committee on Homeland  Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice).   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on  the United States Capitol Complex Act.   This cannot be said enough. January 6 was an act of domestic  terrorism. An armed mob of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol  intending to murder the Speaker, the Vice President, and Members of  Congress.   We cannot let our friends on the other side of the aisle whitewash  the events of that day. We cannot let them gaslight the American people  by calling January 6 an ordinary tourist visit.   The 9/11-style commission we are proposing in this bill will issue a  full report on the facts and provide recommendations to prevent future  attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member  Katko for negotiating this bill in good faith.   I thank my friend, Ranking Member Katko, for actually recognizing the  events of January 6 and working to find a bipartisan path forward,  despite the opposition in his own party. That is a true act of courage  and being a true American.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  listing of national security, military, and elected officials, former  Members of Congress, U.S. Attorneys, diplomats, all who have specific  expertise in this matter before the body today.    Letter From Former Senior National Security, Military, and Elected    Officials Calling On Congress To Create A Bipartisan 1/6 Commission         Dear Members of Congress: We are former senior national       security, military, and elected officials who have       represented or served Democrats, Republicans, or       administrations of both parties. We write to encourage this       Congress to establish an independent and bipartisan national       commission to investigate the January 6th assault of the U.S.       Capitol Complex and its direct causes, and to make       recommendations to prevent future assaults and strengthen the       resilience of our democratic institutions.        We also write to you with great urgency in light of what we       collectively see as an exigent and growing threat. The events       of January 6th exposed severe vulnerabilities in the nation's       preparedness for preventing and responding to domestic       terrorist attacks. The immediate security failings that       permitted a lethal breach of the Capitol Complex by armed       extremists raise serious questions and demand immediate       solutions.        But January 6th was also the result of complex national       security threats. These include coordinated disinformation       campaigns, nontransparent financing of extremist networks,       potential foreign influences, and white supremacist violent       extremism, which the Department of Homeland Security       identified in an October 2020 report as among ``the most       persistent and lethal threat[s] in the Homeland.'' As FBI       Director Christopher Wray testified to you recently,       ``January 6th was not an isolated event. The problem of       domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country       for a long time now and it's not going away anytime soon.''       Understanding how these forces culminated in an attack on the       infrastructure of our democracy is critical to preventing       future attacks.        In the wake of September 11th, the administration and       Congress jointly acknowledged that the attack's causes were       complex and that an independent and well-equipped national       commission was an essential tool to aid the federal       government. Congressional inquiries, law enforcement       activities, and a national commission not only worked in       parallel, but critically complemented each other's necessary       work. An independent commission should not supplant the       ongoing work by the legislative and executive branches, but       it can uniquely support them by providing comprehensive and       expert recommendations for Congress to act upon.        Commissions--properly empowered, resourced, and led--can       establish a full picture of events and an analysis of their       causes, from which nonpartisan recommendations can       authoritatively flow. With dedicated time, resources, and       expert staffing, they can also exclusively focus on the       matter at hand over an appropriate time horizon. Given the       gravity of January 6th as a national security matter--the       violent disruption to the transition of power and the       continuing threat of future attacks--a national commission       examining the lead up to the January 6th assault, and the       attendant security lapses, is not only appropriate, but a       critical component of the national response.        A failure to deploy the full suite of tools available to       fully understand January 6th and address its causes will       leave the Capitol, and the nation, vulnerable to future       attacks. In bipartisan fashion, we have successfully       marshaled these tools before, and we implore you to do so       once again.            Sincerely,        (Note: All titles are former positions or military ranks       held prior to retirement.)

[From Issue One]   Joint Statement from Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton,             Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission         ``We very strongly urge House Members to support H.R. 3233,       the bipartisan National Commission to Investigate the January       6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex. That bill       would create a 9/11 style commission to investigate the       January 6th assault on the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day       in American history, one of the darkest.        ``As Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission,       unity of purpose was key to the effectiveness of the group.       We put country above party, without bias, the events before,       during and after the attack. We sought to understand our       vulnerabilities in order to prevent future attacks or future       acts of terrorism.        Today, democracy faces a new threat. The January 6 attack       on the U.S. Capitol was one of the darkest days in the       history of our country. Americans deserve an objective and an       accurate account of what happened. As we did in the wake of       September 11, it's time to set aside partisan politics and       come together as Americans in common pursuit of truth and       justice.''     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  letter from Protect Democracy, Ian Bassin, Executive Director.                                              Protect Democracy,                                       Washington, DC, May 19, 2021.     Protect Democracy Urges Representatives to Support H.R. 3233, the   National Commission To Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United                         States Capitol Complex Act         Dear Representative: On January 6th the very foundations of       our democracy--and our Congress and Capitol that lie at its       heart--came under attack. More than 130 days later, Members       of Congress, their staff, and their constituents are still       struggling to come together to understand what happened and       how to prevent it from ever happening again.        We strongly urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 3233, the       National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on       the United States Capitol Complex Act, which would establish       an independent national commission to comprehensively       investigate the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol       Complex.        This bipartisan bill is a measured and thoughtful response       to the attack. It will bring together a bipartisan group of       experts to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding       the January 6th attack. The Commission is structured to       ensure it is a bipartisan endeavor: all reports must be       agreed to by a majority of Commission members and the       Commission may only issue subpoenas upon an agreement between       the Chair and the Vice Chair or a vote by a majority of       Commission members.        The Commission will build on the work that has begun in       various congressional committees to gather information and       hold hearings on the attack. It will not intefere with those       ongoing efforts nor will it delay immediate security fixes to       the Capitol Complex.        By creating this Commission, Congress can assure the       American people, and all who work in the Capitol Complex,       that these events and the circumstances leading up to them       are thoroughly investigated outside of the pressured and       partisan environment of Congress itself.        We are grateful to Chairman Bennie Thompson and Ranking       Member John Katko for their leadership in advancing this       critical legislation, and we urge continued bipartisan       support for the bill. Today marks an important milestone       toward seeking a shared understanding, protecting our       cherished freedoms, and restoring faith in government.            Sincerely,                                                        Ian Bassin,                             Executive Director, Protect Democracy.     Mr. Speaker, we have had a number of my  colleagues come before us encouraging this body to support this  commission and this legislation. They have spoken valiantly in support  of it. They have put their hearts and souls into making sure that it is  correct and proper.   I am happy, again, to share with my colleague from New York. I  appreciate working with him, and I appreciate the ability to work out  our differences. I think it should be part of the role model for future  legislation in this body.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the  Democratic Party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  [[Page H2588]]    Mr. Speaker, I am not going to argue with the previous speaker. I  just say: Read the bill. And if you read the bill, you will understand  it is a bipartisan bill.   It is not a partisan bill; it is absolutely bipartisan. The staff  will be picked just like the staff was picked for the 9/11 Commission.  It is just like the earlier bill the ranking member talked about, the  Rodney Davis bill.   We looked, Mr. Speaker, at this issue because the world saw what  happened on January 6, and it is clear that we put together a  bipartisan bill for the good of the country. It is in that spirit that  we are here today.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   At the outset, let me salute Mr. Katko for his agreeing to work in a  bipartisan manner so that we can get this bill to the floor and adopted  today.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today at a unique moment in American  history. Trust in our government's ability to share information and  coordinate at all levels to keep our democracy secure was severely  shaken by the January 6 attack.   We need a bipartisan commission with experts who put country ahead of  party to come together, just as the commission did, to lay out the  facts and proposed solutions to make us more secure.   When the chairman of the 9/11 Commission issued their final report,  they concluded a message to the public. It asked that each of us  remember how we felt on that day of the attack. It asked that we recall  the grief and sorrow.   This moment is no less historic, no less important, no less  momentous, and it requires the same common action, both as Congress and  as a country.   I, too, salute the brave men and women of the Capitol Police who put  their lives on the line on January 6 protecting this citadel of  democracy, and it is in their spirit that I ask that you vote in  support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
