POLICY JUSTIFICATION     Australia--Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles-Extended Range                                 (AARGM-ER)         The Government of Australia has requested to buy up to       sixty-three (63) Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles-      Extended Range (AARGM-ERs); and up to twenty (20) AARGM-ER       Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs). Also included are AGM-      88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-Extended Range       Dummy Air Training Missiles (AARGM-ER DATMs), containers,       component parts and support equipment; Repair of Repairables;       software (Classified and Unclassified); publications       (Classified and Unclassified); training (Classified and       Unclassified); transportation; U.S. Government and Contractor       engineering support; and other related elements of logistical       and program support. The estimated total cost is $506       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats by suppressing and destroying       land or sea-based radar emitters associated with enemy air       defenses. This capability denies the adversary the use of its       air defense systems, thereby improving the survivability of       Australia's tactical aircraft. Australia will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime U.S. contractor will be the Javelin Joint Venture       between Lockheed Martin in Orlando, FL and Raytheon Missiles       and Defense in Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.       Government personnel and U.S. Contractor representatives to       visit Australia on a temporary basis in conjunction with       program technical oversight and support requirements,       including program and technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-18       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile-      Extended Range (AARGM-ER) weapon system is an air-to-ground       missile intended for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)       and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions. The       AARGM-ER provides suppression or destruction of enemy RADAR       and denies the enemy the use of air defense systems, thereby       improving the survivability of our tactical aircraft. The       AGM-88G AARGM-ER Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) is used       by pilots when training for SEAD/DEAD missions.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

(iii) Description: On February 5, 2018, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       17-77 of the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the       Arms Export Control Act, of sixty-eight (68) Evolved       SEASPARROW Missiles (ESSM) and one (1) ESSM inert operational       missile. Also included were seventeen (17) MK25 quad pack       canisters, eight (8) MK783 shipping containers, spare and       repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and       technical documentation, training, U.S. Government/Contractor       engineering, technical and logistics support services and       technical assistance, and other related elements of       logistical support. The estimated total cost was $112.7       million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $92.6       million of this total.        This transmittal notifies the inclusion of the following       MDE items: eighty-four (84) RIM-162J Evolved SEASPARROW       Missiles (ESSM), Block 2; to replace the previously notified       sixty-eight (68) ESSMs. Also included are MK25 quad pack       canisters and MK852 shipping containers. The addition of       these items will result in a net increase in MDE value of       $81.4 million, resulting in a revised MDE value of $174       million. The non-MDE estimated value will increase from $20.1       million to $28.9 million. The total estimated case value will       increase by $90.2 million to $202.9 million.        (iv) Significance: The inclusion of this MDE represents an       increase in capability over the Block 1 ESSMs previously       notified. Finland intends to use the missiles on its new       Squadron 2020 class Corvette ships. The missiles will provide       enhanced capabilities in effective defense of critical sea       lanes and improve Finland's capability to meet current and       future enemy anti-ship weapon threats. Finland previously       requested ESSM Block 1s, but cancelled the procurement to       await the Block 2s.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       improving the security of a trusted partner which is an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Europe. It is vital to the U.S. national interest to       assist Finland in developing and maintaining a strong and       ready self-defense capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The RIM-162J ESSM Block 2       is an upgrade to the Block 1, which is a kinematic upgrade to       the RIM-7P SEASPARROW Missile that leverages U.S. guidance       technology. ESSM Block 1 is a medium-range, semi-active       homing missile that makes flight corrections via radar and       midcourse data uplinks. The guidance system is semi-active on       continuous wave or interrupted continuous wave illumination.       The missile provides reliable ship self-defense capability       against agile, high-speed, low-altitude anti-ship cruise       missiles (ASCMs) and low velocity air threats (LVATs) such as       helicopters and high-speed, maneuverable surface threats. The       ESSM Block 2 utilizes the same propulsion section and       increases the diameter of the guidance section to 10-inches.       The new guidance section utilizes a dual seeker head that       employs semi-active and active guidance.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.
