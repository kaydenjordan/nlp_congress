 Mr. President, I never cease to be amazed how the  politics here inside the beltway remind me of two ships passing in the  night, where we can all be looking at exactly the same thing and  describe it in such remarkably different ways.   I have been amazed at the Democratic leader's negative comments about  the President's speech last night, and I listened to comments of my  friend the Democrat whip. They found virtually nothing to like about  what the President had to say last night.   So I was a little bit surprised to see a CBS News poll that indicates  that 70 percent of the viewers approved of what they heard in President  Trump's speech last night at the State of the Union, and 72 percent  said they approved of President Trump's ideas on immigration, one of  the most contentious and divisive issues that faces our country.   One conclusion might be that it is because our Democratic colleagues  are simply unwilling to do anything to  [[Page S884]]  work with President Trump and are determined to do everything they can  in order to defeat him or that anything that he happens to be for they  are reflexively against. That seemed to be what gave us the 35-day  shutdown, where Nancy Pelosi said that building a physical barrier  along the southwestern border was immoral, even though Democrats and  Republicans had routinely voted for fencing, extending the hundreds of  miles there in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and 2008. Barack Obama,  Hillary Clinton and Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, all voted  for that. Now Nancy Pelosi woke up one morning and decided it was  immoral to build any physical barrier at all along the southwestern  border.   I agree with those who say the real immorality here is to see the  scourge of human trafficking, sex slavery, women and children being  held against their will by the traffickers who transfer people up and  across the southwestern border. What is really immoral is to stand by  and do nothing and watch 70,000 Americans die of drug overdoses last  year alone, with a significant amount of that due to opioid addiction,  including the 90 percent of the heroin that comes into the United  States from Mexico. To me, that is the immorality, not some fence or  wall or pedestrian bridge or whatever the physical barrier may be.   I agree with those who were polled in the CBS News poll who believe  that what we heard last night from the President was a strong message  in his second State of the Union address. Since President Trump took  office 2 years ago, the American people have seen real results and a  shot of adrenalin has been given to our economy, allowing millions of  Americans to get back to work.   Yes, our economy is booming. We have gotten our optimism and  confidence back again. Wages are on the rise. People are getting to  keep more of what they earn, and middle-class Americans are seeing  their paychecks expand.   We have heard the remarkable statistics that people who have  disabilities are now reentering the workforce because there is such  demand for workers that even people who previously weren't able to find  work are now able to get that work.   Yes, in addition to the low unemployment rate, we are seeing minority  unemployment and African-American and Hispanic unemployment lower than  it has ever been in recorded history. You would think that would be  something that people would want to applaud on a bipartisan basis.   But time and again, we saw our friends across the aisle last night  sitting on their hands with a grim and sort of discontented look on  their face. That is another reason why I think so many people believe  that Washington, DC, and what happens here and the politics that take  place here are completely removed and disconnected from their  experience across the breadth of this country.   We have done some pretty significant things in the last year  together, on a bipartisan basis. We combatted the opioid crisis. We  improved our criminal justice system just this last December by huge,  overwhelming margins. We repealed taxes on low- and middle-class  Americans, known as the ObamaCare individual mandate, punishing people  simply because they could not afford the high premiums and deductibles  of the so-called Affordable Care Act, and we restored much needed  funding to our military in a still very dangerous world and provided an  overdue pay raise for our troops.   But President Trump wasn't there just to tout his accomplishments. He  was there to assure the American people that we are not going to rest  on our laurels. There is still work to be done, and we are eager to get  moving. The President offered up some constructive ideas about what  that might be: rebuilding America's infrastructure, making healthcare  and prescription drugs more affordable, and, finally, eliminating the  scourge of HIV over the next decade.   I remember being at the dedication of the George Bush Library at SMU  a few years ago, when they had all the living Presidents speaking at  that dedication. President Jimmy Carter, surprisingly--to me, anyway-- applauded President George W. Bush for saving millions of lives in  Africa as a result of the PEPFAR program, providing new, incredible  drugs to help reduce and eliminate the scourge of HIV in Africa. The  President now wants to do that in the United States, and I applaud him  for it.   To address these and other countless challenges before us, the  President stressed the need for unity. As much as we would like to,  nobody gets everything they want in Congress. In a country where  democracy prevails, we know that means that we are going to have to  negotiate and compromise, but there are 80-percent solutions that when  we see them, we ought to grab them. Just turning on the news or social  media, it is easy to think there is more that divides us than unites us  as a country, but the President reminded us that citizens of goodwill  share the same goal, and that is to build a stronger and better  America.   As the President said last night:         There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we       have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our       party. Victory is winning for our country.    I hope all of us will answer the President's call to work together to  respond to the better angels of our nature and to build on the  successes of the last 2 years for the benefit of all the American  people.                           Nomination of Neomi Rao    Mr. President, yesterday, we had the Judiciary Committee hold a  hearing to consider an important nomination, and that is of Neomi Rao  to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, what some have called the  ``second highest court in the land.'' This is the seat, of course, that  has been vacated by the elevation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Ms. Rao is currently the Administrator of the Office of Information  and Regulatory Affairs, an obscure but important Agency--probably the  most powerful Agency nobody has ever heard of here in Washington, DC.  She was confirmed to that position on a bipartisan basis in 2017, and  since taking the helm at OIRA, Agencies have reduced regulatory costs  by more than $23 billion, which has been another spur to the American  economy.   Ms. Rao is currently an associate professor at the Antonin Scalia Law  School at George Mason University and a leading scholar in the field of  administrative law.   Through her career, Ms. Rao has served in all three branches of the  Federal Government. She clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the  Supreme Court and Judge Harvie Wilkinson on the Fourth Circuit. She  served as an Associate Counsel and Special Assistant to President  George W. Bush, and she has also worked here in the Senate as a counsel  for the then-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, our friend, Orrin  Hatch.   Suffice it to say that she has a vast understanding of the workings  of the Federal Government, as well as the rulemaking process. In a  court that frequently hears challenges to Federal regulations, her  unique experience and knowledge of administrative law will be an  incredibly valuable asset.   Unsurprisingly, I am not the only one who holds that view. Two dozen  former Supreme Court clerks who worked alongside Ms. Rao sent a letter  to the Judiciary Committee touting her qualifications. They noted:         Many of us have worked in government, at both federal and       state levels, some for Democrats and some for Republicans.    They went on to say:         While our professional and personal paths have thus       diverged, one of the things we have shared is admiration for       Neomi. We are confident she will serve our country well on       the D.C. Circuit.    We have seen similar letters from her classmates at both Yale and the  University of Chicago Law School, as well as from her former students.   Adding to the list of her glowing recommendations, Ms. Rao has  received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar  Association. My colleagues, Senator Schumer from New York and Senator  Leahy from Vermont, once referred to this rating as ``the gold standard  by which judicial candidates are judged.''   But despite her outstanding qualifications, Ms. Rao has faced some  unconvincing attacks by opponents of this administration. I am  convinced that some of our colleagues would oppose any judicial nominee  by this  [[Page S885]]  President just because they were nominated by President Trump.   On Monday, the day before her hearing, I was surprised to see a  headline from POLITICO. The story was entitled: ``Dems hope to draw  blood from potential Trump SCOTUS pick.'' What they were referring to,  I assume, is that Ms. Rao, as qualified as she is and nominated for the  court of appeals, once confirmed, she could possibly in the future be a  candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court. So the goal is to rough her up  now, tarnish her reputation the best you can, in preparation for that  potentiality in the future.   This is not entirely surprising, but it is regrettable. Before we  even had a chance to hear from the nominee and discuss her  qualifications for a circuit court seat, some on the other side are  sharpening their claws, and the special interests are unfairly trying  to undermine her nomination. This war being waged against Ms. Rao is  not because she is unqualified for the job, but it is because some fear  her commitment to the rule of law and speculate, as I said, that  someday she might be a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.   A Wall Street Journal editor last week warned that Ms. Rao might get  ``Kavanaughed.'' That is a new verb. It used to be called to get  ``Borked,'' after Robert Bork. But of course, they said she could get  ``Kavanaughed'' because of her writings in college newspapers more than  two decades ago. So the term ``Borked'' has now been supplanted by the  term ``Kavanaughed'' as a description of the scorched earth tactics of  the radical left.   A young conservative at the time, her biweekly column for the Yale  Herald was called ``Against the Current,'' and it challenged the  politically correct, although poorly reasoned, views of some of her  classmates at the liberal Ivy League school. I guess, when you consider  what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, at least we moved on from high school  yearbooks now to things that somebody has written in college. I don't  know whether that represents progress or not.   Ms. Rao has said repeatedly, however, that she no longer holds the  same views she held more than 20 years ago. That is called growing up  and maturing. In any event, she said she wouldn't substitute her  personal views for the laws of Congress or the precedents of the  Supreme Court. Of course, the flimsy suggestion is that these articles  are enough to deny her a seat on the Federal bench. The left's attempt  to block this qualified nominee by any means necessary reminds me of a  comment made by Judge Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing.   He noted that many members of the committee are taking our job of  ``advice and consent'' to mean ``search and destroy.'' We have before  us a highly qualified nominee with an almost unparalleled understanding  of administrative law. She has received positive remarks from the  American Bar Association, the so-called gold standard for nominees. She  enjoys high praise from former colleagues and students who represent  both liberal and conservative viewpoints.   I hope our colleagues can look objectively at these endorsements and  all she has accomplished during her career rather than follow the  radical voices down some rabbit trail. I believe Ms. Rao is  exceptionally qualified for a seat on the DC Circuit Court, and I thank  her for answering the call to serve despite the divisive political  times in which we live.                                    S. 47    Mr. President, on a final matter, I am pleased that the Senate will  begin consideration of the Natural Resources Management Act. This  package contains more than 100 individual land bills that enjoy broad  bipartisan support, with nearly 90 Senators cosponsoring various  components. I believe the bill will create positive changes at the  State, Federal, and local levels by improving public lands management  and allowing for greater public use of America's beautiful landscapes.   I have worked with my colleague Senator Cruz and members of the Texas  delegation in the House to ensure that two bills we introduced last  Congress were included.   First, the Lake Fannin Recreation Area Conveyance Act would reduce  the Federal estate in Texas and restore local control of more than 200  acres in Fannin County. The residents of Fannin County know better than  the Federal Government how to care for the land, and this will allow  them to utilize this land for public recreation purposes.   Also included is the Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act, which  will protect private property along the Red River, which separates  Texas from Oklahoma. This will deliver certainty for Texas families who  live and own land along the Red River that the Federal Government has  no rightful claim to their property.   I am glad we will have the opportunity to vote on this package, which  will make responsible changes to Federal land management and benefit  Texans.   Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.
