 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to simply tell my team  thank you for the work that they have  [[Page H4417]]  been putting in in the last several weeks.   The individuals that work in our Washington, D.C. and our Ogden,  Utah, district offices are truly the unsung heroes in our world.   I often get the credit by having my name on a bill or my name on an  interview, but the work that they have been doing to help our American  citizens in Afghanistan and our partners is unprecedented.   All summer we have been dealing with State Department backlogs to get  their passports so they can go to Costa Rica or something like that,  and they have been doing a very good job. It all turned very real as we  have been working around the clock and taking an enormous amount of  stress and anguish to do our part.   I hope that the First District of Utah knows that our team is working  to do everything we can to help out those families who are directly  affected by this.   Our thoughts and prayers are going to a better outcome as we come out  of this.                            ____________________
