 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   This morning, women across America drove to jobs where they will be  paid lower salaries for equal work. Today, Black women make 63 cents  and Hispanic women make 55 cents for every dollar earned by a White  man. Over a lifetime, that gap grows to $400,000, enough to pay off the  mortgage and put two kids through college.   The Paycheck Fairness Act will not fix the systemic racism and sexism  that are embedded in our Nation's treatment of women, but it will take  us a step closer to making equal pay a reality.   I am proud to be voting, once again, to pass the Paycheck Fairness  Act. I am calling on all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me and pass this long-overdue bill into law.                            ____________________
