 Mr. President, today I have the privilege of  recognizing the distinguished service of Commander Charles ``Chuck''  Johnson, a highly respected Korean and Vietnam war veteran. Having  enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 16 before completing his high school  education, Chuck served his country honorably for 21 years on the front  lines of combat in both Korea and Vietnam.   Chuck's commitment to serve did not waver after returning home, and  he has spent much of his civilian life advocating and caring for  Nevada's veterans, fighting to ensure that their service is never  forgotten. Commander of the Southern Nevada chapter of the Korean War  Veterans Association, Chuck played a critical role in establishing a  Korean War Memorial at the Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City,  NV, which stands as a testament to the more than 9,000 Korean war  veterans buried there. Chuck persisted for over 24 years to see this  project come to fruition, and as a community, we are beyond grateful  for his dedication to this worthy cause.   Known as a leader and community servant throughout southern Nevada,  Chuck was most recently recognized as News 3 Las Vegas's Veteran of the  Month. Throughout the month of March, we saluted Chuck for his tireless  work to make our community, State, and country a better, safer, and  more just place. I am grateful for Commander Johnson's sacrifice and  patriotism and look forward to observing his continued work on behalf  of veterans in Nevada and beyond.                            ____________________
