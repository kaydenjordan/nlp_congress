 Madam President, I would like to recognize and thank  Justin Kronenberg, my 2022 Department of Defense legislative fellow,  for all of his hard work and dedication to my office. He is an active  duty master sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps with almost two decades  of service. The wealth of knowledge and professionalism he brought have  been incredibly valuable.   Throughout the year, Justin's expertise supported me in my role as a  member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and particularly as the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower. He is a skilled  communicator, which has been instrumental in distilling and explaining  many of the complex policy matters before the committee. North Dakota  had the privilege of hosting Justin for a week as he toured our  military facilities, seeing firsthand the great work being done in  Grand Forks, Minot, and Fargo. North Dakota and my office are better  off thanks to Justin's service.   I would also like to thank Justin's family for the shared sacrifice  and service they give this Nation. I wish Justin all the best at his  next assignment and in all his future endeavors. Semper Fi.                            ____________________
