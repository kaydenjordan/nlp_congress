 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  partisan impeachment process.   Make no mistake, this process did not begin with the whistleblower  report. In fact, impeachment efforts began shortly after the President  was elected. The theatrics and political posturing that have ensued are  not part of an effort that this body is actually pursuing to preserve  checks and balances, rather, this process echoes the calls by some who  refuse to accept the 2016 election results.   Neither of the articles receiving a vote justify the removal of the  President from office. The first article suggests that the President  pressured a foreign government to be able to assist in an upcoming  election. Ukraine received its aid without a prearranged agreement,  proving this article to be an unsubstantiated allegation.   The second article is premised that obstruction occurred when the  White House ignored subpoenas issued by the House. Our Federal courts  are the ultimate arbiters of these decisions. In fact, previous  administrations, Republican and Democrat both, have dealt with these  issues and claimed executive privilege.   Madam Speaker, the articles that are before this House are  unsubstantiated. I intend to vote ``no'' on these articles, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
