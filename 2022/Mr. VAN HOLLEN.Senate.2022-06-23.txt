 Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of a  dedicated public servant and a champion for education: Mr. Reginald  ``Reggie'' M. Felton from my State of Maryland. Our community lost  Reggie only a few days ago, at the age of 75. Today, I would like to  take a moment to celebrate his extraordinary life and pay tribute to  his lasting legacy of good works.   The story of Reggie's life can be defined by one word: service. He  served our Nation in the military as a member of the U.S. Coast Guard  and, later, as a Senior Executive within the Department of the Navy. He  served his town and county as president of a local citizens  association, as chair of the Silver Spring Center Citizens Advisory  Board, and as chairman of the Freedom Fund Dinner organized by the  Montgomery County Branch of the NAACP.   But most of all, Reggie served our students. With the trust of his  community behind him, Reggie won a seat on the Montgomery County Board  of Education in 1994. He would serve on the board for another 20 years,  winning reelection in 1998 and 2002 and rising to become the first  African-American president of the Montgomery County Board of Education,  a position he held for three terms.   Reggie's commitment to the mission and spirit of the school board led  to real results during his tenure. The Montgomery County School Board  earned national recognition for excellence while Reggie served on the  board, and it is no wonder why. Under his leadership, the Montgomery  County Public Schools, which make up the largest school district in my  State, saw major improvements in the quality of education and in the  process for selecting and onboarding superintendents. Reggie also  focused his efforts on establishing higher standards in curriculum, and  those higher standards continue to inform a tradition of excellence at  Montgomery County Public Schools that lives on to this day. In short:  Reggie's time as president of the Montgomery County School Board helped  make Montgomery County schools some of the best in the Nation.   Throughout his extraordinary life, Reggie Felton nurtured his talent  for leadership, stepped up to serve his community and his country, and  did all that he could to improve the lives of  [[Page S3158]]  his fellow citizens. He was beloved by all--respected across our  communities for his kindness, his good humor, his brilliance, and his  grace.   On a personal note, Reggie was a good friend whom I admired greatly.  I will always remember his warm and generous spirit, his wonderful  smile, and his determination to serve others. I know I speak for  Marylanders everywhere when I say our State is eternally grateful for  his service and sacrifice.   Today, Reggie's legacy lives on in every young student who benefits  from his good deeds--whether they know it or not--and his story will  continue to inspire us all. Thank you, Reggie. We love you.                            ____________________
