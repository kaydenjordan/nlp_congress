 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  in the Record extraneous material on H.R. 3043.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3043, the  Hydropower  [[Page H8615]]  Policy Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation, introduced by my  friend and colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy  McMorris Rodgers, is an important step toward modernizing our energy  infrastructure, creating jobs, and, yes, strengthening our economy. I  want to thank her for her commitment to this issue.   The committee went through regular order with the bill. We held two  hearings on background issues, one legislative hearing, and both  subcommittee and full committee markups, where the bill was agreed to  by a voice vote. Following the markups, bipartisan committee staff held  more meetings to hear from over a dozen Tribal governments to gather  additional views.   I think that the resulting bill strikes a careful balance. Changes  were made to increase State and Tribal consultation requirements, and a  very strong savings clause was added to protect States' authorities  under the Clean Water Act.   Hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy  strategy for this country. Hydropower is clean; it is renewable and  affordable base load power. It is good for consumers' electricity  bills, and it is also good for jobs, which is why labor is strongly  supportive of this legislation.   There is a tremendous opportunity to expand hydropower production on  existing nonpowered dams. Less than 3 percent of the dams in the U.S.,  approximately 2,200 dams, produce electricity. There are also  opportunities to improve the process for the projects that are due for  relicensing. By 2030, over 400 existing projects, with almost 19,000  megawatts of capacity, will begin the relicensing process, and these  projects, in fact, may be at risk.   Fixing the licensing process would also improve safety. Upgrading the  performance of existing dams and utilizing existing nonpowered dams,  canals, and conduits would enable investments, which would address  aging dams and, yes, improve overall safety.   The duration, complexity, and uncertainty of the hydropower licensing  process creates significant challenges that prevent investments that  would create jobs and benefit consumers. The licensing process for a  new hydropower development project can last over a decade and costs  tens of millions of dollars--significantly longer than the time that it  takes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant of the same size.   This legislation, H.R. 3043, would level the playing field by  modernizing the permitting process without compromising environmental  protections. The bill improves administrative efficiency,  accountability, and transparency. It requires balanced, timely  decisionmaking and reduces duplicative oversight from the multiple  Federal agencies that review hydropower applications.   This bill brings certainty and timeliness to the licensing process by  enhancing consultation with Federal, State, and local agencies and  Indian Tribes, and it requires FERC to establish a process for setting  the schedule for review. H.R. 3043 streamlines and improves procedures  to identify scheduling issues, propose licensing conditions, and  resolve disputes.   This bill also contains provisions to expedite the approval process  for an amendment to a license for a qualifying hydro project upgrade.  Without the hydropower licensing improvements in this bill--without  them--we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower  infrastructure which would benefit consumers with affordable  electricity and expand the use of clean, renewable energy.   Again, I thank my colleagues for their work, and the great staff, on  this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                  Washington, DC, October 31, 2017.      Hon.

Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 3043, Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. As       you note, this bill contains provisions within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform, and appreciate your agreement to forgo consideration       of the bill so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor.

Further, I will support the appointment of conferees from the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.        Finally, a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter       will be included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington State (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the author  of this legislation.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all of the work  that has gone into this legislation, and I rise in support and urge  support of the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.   Hydropower serves as the Nation's largest source of clean, renewable,  reliable, and affordable energy. In my home State of Washington, it is  roughly 70 percent of our electricity that comes from hydropower. It is  one of the reasons that we enjoy some of the lowest electricity rates  in the country.   Only 3 percent of the dams produce electricity, and there is room for  tremendous potential to increase production of this renewable energy  resource. In fact, we could double hydropower production and create an  estimated 700,000 new jobs without building a single new dam, simply by  updating the technology in our existing infrastructure and streamlining  the relicensing process. But we must reduce the regulatory burden to  allow this process to move forward.   This legislation seeks to streamline the relicensing process in an  inclusive and environmentally friendly way. On average, it only takes  18 months to authorize or relicense a new natural gas facility--18  months--but it can take up to 10 years or longer to license a new  hydropower project or relicense an existing facility--10 years.   Right now, it can be extremely costly and an uncertain process to  relicense an existing dam or license a new dam. Investors are pursuing  other base load sources of energy because of the current regulatory  process. I want to encourage these investments so that we can support  and expand renewable, carbon-free hydropower.   As I understand it, hydropower is well-supported by my colleagues,  but many think we are tipping the scales in favor of this source.   First, I would like to define industry. We are hearing a lot about  industry on the other side.    In eastern Washington, many of these dams are owned by small PUDs who  pass on all of the costs to the ratepayers. These costs are delivered  to the people of eastern Washington and throughout the United States.  These are not major corporations.   I have also heard that we are lowering environmental standards during  the licensing process for Tribes and States. At the request of the  Western Governors' Association, we added language to clarify that  nothing in this bill--nothing in this bill--will touch the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act,  the Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act,  or the National Historic Preservation Act.   I have also heard that we did not allow Tribes and States to testify  on this bill. I struggle with these comments. This bill has gone  through regular order. We have held multiple hearings. We had a member  from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe on one of the panels. It passed out  of committee with a voice vote because concerns were raised from the  Tribes, and we committed to sitting down and working with the Tribes to  attempt to reach some language. I am proud of our efforts in that  regard, and I am greatly disappointed that, at the end of the day, the  Tribes did not come to an agreement on the legislation.                                time  1400    Although we weren't able to reach that resolution, we do protect the  integrity of this legislation.   Licenses are complex, but there is no excuse for a process to take 10  years. It is time to update the approval process and make hydropower  production easier and less costly without sacrificing environmental  review. That is exactly what the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of  2017 will do.   Specifically, my legislation designates FERC as the lead agency for  the purpose of coordinating all applications of Federal authorizations,  and establishes coordinated procedures for the licensing of hydropower  projects.   By designating FERC as the lead when coordinating with agencies,  States, and Tribes, there will be added transparency and collaboration.  This added certainty in the relicensing process will diminish the  burden on resource agencies, help avoid unnecessary delays, and  ultimately lower costs to my constituents.   My legislation also incentivizes capital-intensive projects like  updating turbines or improving fish ladders. Right now, these upgrades  are only included in the lifespan of a dam's license during the  relicensing window.   Included in the legislation is an early action provision requiring  FERC to include all protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures  during the relicensing process. In addition, the legislation allows the  timely and efficient completion of licensing procedures by minimizing  the duplication of studies and establishing a program to compile a  comprehensive collection of studies and data on a regional or basin- wide scale. At the same time, industry has the option to help pay for  studies and staff resources to speed up the process.   As a co-chair of the Northwest Energy Caucus, I recognize and I am  excited about the tremendous potential hydropower brings not just to my  district in eastern Washington, but to the country. By utilizing  currently untapped resources and unleashing American ingenuity,  hydropower production will lower energy costs and help create jobs.   This bill is not about changing outcomes or environmental law. This  bill is about speeding up the process and saving time and money.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support clean American  energy and to support the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Griffith), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chair, can I inquire as to how much time is remaining  on both sides?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), who is the chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), who is a member of the Natural Resources and  Armed Services Committees, to speak in support of the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Denham).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  don't intend to use all the time that is remaining. I just want to make  a couple of points to my colleagues as we close debate on the general  debate on this bill.   This isn't a new bill. A lot of us in this body on both sides support  an all-of-the-above strategy. It includes safe nuclear. It includes  clean coal. It supports energy efficiencies, renewables, wind, solar,  and hydro.   This bill, H.R. 3043, is not a new bill. In fact, the provisions,  almost to a tee, in both the House and the Senate version last year in  a bill that ultimately didn't get conferenced to President Obama, we  didn't really have any disagreements on the hydro section. We came to  an agreement and the House passed the bill as it relates to the hydro  bill. And the Senate bill passed, as I recall it, 92-8, pretty  overwhelming, pretty bipartisan. In essence, the same provisions that  we have here.   I got to say that, throughout the process, we listened to the concern  raised by some of the stakeholders, including States and Tribes. We  made a number of significant changes to the version of the bill as  compared to the version again last year that added more strength, more  hurdles to go through.   The biggest change, frankly, that we made was taking the hammer away  from FERC to compel agencies to stick to a deadline. Consequently, no  permits are going to be granted by default because of a missed  deadline. But we also inserted new State and Tribal consultation  requirements with a very strong savings clause that clarifies that  nothing shall affect the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws.  That wasn't in the bill last year. That is new this year.   So I think that we have accommodated the concerns, particularly when  many of the Members that are here in this Congress that were there last  Congress actually voted for the provisions we had, certainly in  committee as well as on the Senate floor.   Again, I just want to read into the Record page 17, line 23: ``No  Effect on Other Laws. Nothing in this section shall be construed to  affect any requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the  Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act of 1973,  section 14 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (commonly known as the Rivers  and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899), and those provisions of  subtitle III of title 54, United States Code, commonly known as the  National Historic Preservation Act, with respect to an application for  a license under this part.''   This bill is stronger than the one that most of us supported last  year, particularly as it pertains to hydroelectric licensing by FERC.   So I commend the action of Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, who, again, carried  the water on this in this Congress. I would like to think that we will  have a positive vote with Republicans and Democrats supporting the  bill. We are prepared to now discuss and debate the amendments.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I just want to say that this is a very good  amendment. It is bipartisan. It is critical that--I know our Great  Lakes Caucus, on a bipartisan basis, in both bodies, the House and  Senate, have taken strong actions against the Asian carp.   This is a good amendment. We are certainly prepared to accept it, and  I commend you for taking the time on the floor.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And,  yes, I do have, now, extended family in Texas.   Mr. Chairman, this is another tool in the toolbox for FERC. We want  to make sure that areas are protected that have survived, somehow,  these terrible hurricanes.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to  support this good amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from West Virginia for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that allows for a study of the  potential to expand non-Federal hydropower projects in Federal dams. It  is a good amendment. I support it, and I urge my colleagues to support  it on a bipartisan basis.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I do  so with some hesitancy against my good friend, but I would say that  this amendment would strike and replace the base tax with language that  would add additional layers of red tape and bureaucracy already to the  permitting process.   The bill itself, H.R. 3043, contains essential permitting and  licensing reforms to ensure that renewable hydropower remains an  important part of our all-of-the-above approach to energy, something  that many of us on both sides of the aisle support.   We know that the permitting process has been broken. We have heard  from FERC over the years and project developers who have been stuck for  more than a decade because of bureaucratic delays.   We also know that we need to improve coordination. There are lots of  moving parts with multiple permits required and sometimes dozens of  agencies that are involved, but this bill, H.R. 3043, brings  transparency and predictability to the process by empowering the State  and Federal agencies to actually sit at the table with FERC to identify  issues of concern and resolve them before they result in unnecessary  delay.   The bill, H.R. 3043, as we have said a number of times over the last  hour, ensures that States and Tribes are an integral part of that  process. The word ``consult'' appears no less than a dozen times in the  30 pages.   Without these important changes to the law, States and Tribes may  continue to be left out of the important decisions relating to  hydropower licensing.   Again, I remind my colleagues that this is a new provision that we  added. This wasn't in the bill last year as we debated this title and  approved it in committee and saw it move again on the Senate floor with  a vote that, as I recall, was 92-8.   The bill, H.R. 3043, strikes a careful balance, which is why it has  broad support from the American Council on Renewable Energy, the  American Public Power Association, the Business Council for Sustainable  Energy, Edison Electric Institute, International Brotherhood of  Boilermakers, International  [[Page H8641]]  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Federation of  Professional and Technical Engineers, Large Public Power Council,  Laborers' International Union of North America, National Electrical  Contractors Association, the National Hydropower Association, the  National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the North American  Building Trades Council, and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and  Joiners of America.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment, we view over here on this side as a  poison pill. It would kill jobs and discourage the development of  clean, affordable, and reliable hydropower.   Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment and vote ``yes'' on the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  DeSantis) having assumed the chair, Mr. Estes of Kansas, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  3043) to modernize hydropower policy, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
