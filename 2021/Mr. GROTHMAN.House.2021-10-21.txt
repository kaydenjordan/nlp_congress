 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The topic for tonight, and rightfully so--when we look at the $3.5  trillion bill with so many things that will permanently change  America--is some of the most radical immigration provisions we have  ever seen. Predictions by the Democrats, themselves, will be that they  will affect 9 to 12 million more people in this country who are not  here legally and will ultimately lead to a huge change in America.   This has nothing to do with legal immigration. Every year in this  country about 800,000 people are sworn in as citizens. They are  appropriately vetted, they have jobs, they are not committing crimes,  and they are added to our citizenry.   I am talking about the people who are coming across the border  claiming they want asylum.   I was down at the border last week to have a look at some of these  people who apparently people feel will make good citizens.   One of the first things you notice, at least in the Yuma sector in  Arizona, is you look at the path of people coming here, the path is  littered with identification that is being thrown away by people who  want to get in this country.   Now, why would people throw away identification? Normally you keep  your identification because you have nothing to fear. If you are  throwing the identification on the ground, it means you are creating a  new identity when you come here. These are the type of people that  under this bill are eventually going to work their way to become  American citizens.   And it is not surprising. The Democratic Party in many other ways has  made it clear the type of people we want to get are not the type of  people normally sworn in.   Look at all the sanctuary cities or sanctuary counties around the  country. And by having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary county to me it  is an invitation to say you are going to go on public assistance.    We are sending in children without their parents. People normally  would like to have an intact family, but what we are doing in this bill  is we are going to encourage more parents to send their underage  children to the United States not knowing what will happen to them.   Under this bill as the word gets out that the United States does not  care about enforcing laws and more people come here, it will inevitably  mean more illegal drugs in the country under this bill. And we are now  in a position in which over 90,000 Americans are already dying every  year primarily of COVID but also from other drugs that pass through the  border.   The only thing in this bill that you would expect to have--given the  $3.5 trillion number, you would expect to have maybe more money spent  that is immigration related--is more border patrol agents. But as in  their regular budget, that is not something that they feel we need more  of.   So, again, I beg the American people. I know it is easy to get lost  among the $3.5 trillion in spending, but I beg the American people to  rise up against this bill because of the massive green light for  illegal immigration that is going to come if it passes.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I would like to spend some time addressing  the Chair and America on the American Rescue Plan or, actually, on the  Build Back Better Act, which is kind of a follow-up on the American  Rescue Plan.   We know the result of that original big-spending, government-printing  act was a big increase in inflation in the United States, apparent to  one and all. This is a follow-up bill to that, which will further  require the Federal Reserve to print more money, driving up the cost of  gas, of food, of housing everywhere we look.   But I am not going to address just the cost of this bill tonight. I  am going to address the way I believe it will permanently change  America and the vision the Democratic Party apparently has for America  in the future.   In this bill, we are adding 87,000 IRS agents. For quite a while,  when I would give talks about this bill, I would talk about 8,700  because when my staff told me it was 87,000, I felt I had to correct  them. Nobody would want to add 87,000 IRS agents. But I stand  corrected. I was wrong.   In this bill, we are adding 87,000 IRS agents, enough to fill up a  massive American football stadium. Being from Wisconsin, I think of  Camp Randall Stadium, where the University of Wisconsin plays. I think  of Lambeau Field, where the Packers play. Somebody wants to hire that  many IRS agents.   It is not in the bill, but it is in conjunction with a proposal I  think the Biden administration has, to monitor every $600 transfer of  funds. What type of country would have this many IRS agents and want to  know if you spend $600 on who knows what--giving to the politically  incorrect church; giving to a politically incorrect nonprofit; giving  money to a fringe, eccentric sibling; whatever.   It sounds like something more you would think of in East Germany when  East Germany was around rather than the United States. But that is  apparently the vision of the party that put together the Build Back  Better Act.   As was just mentioned in this bill, we are adding money for more low- income apartments. Now, that sounds good. President Biden also recently  increased the food stamp allowance.   There is an author of mine that I suggest Americans read by the name  of Theodore Dalrymple, an English author who was a doctor dealing both  with English prisons and English slums.   He talked about the empty lives that people who live what I will  refer to as the welfare lifestyle that England had. He attributed that  empty life to the fact that in England--and maybe they backed off this  by now, but at least England 15 years ago, no matter how irresponsible  you were, you always got a free apartment; you always got free food;  and you always got free medical care. In other words, there was no  responsibility when you got up in the morning to really accomplish  anything because you would always be able to exist.   We are close to that right now, but I am afraid the majority party  wants to go all the way there when I look at this proposal. I hope the  majority party stops and thinks in addition to the cost, more  importantly, psychologically what will it do to the people of America  if, when you graduate from high school or don't graduate from high  school, if you want to, particularly if you have a child, you can live  a lifestyle in which you can be completely irresponsible. You will  always be able to eat and always be able to have a nice air- conditioned, heated apartment, which will probably have more square  feet per person than the average housing in Europe, much less around  the world.   This will, again, change America for the worse. Psychologically, it  will give people nothing to live for. By the way, since it is usually  targeted at people with children, it also will create a sad situation  we have already created in this country in which men will have less  responsibility for taking care of their children.   When you have no other responsibilities in life, it can lead to,  first, an empty, depressed life; and, secondly, it can lead to--what?-- idle hands are the Devil's workshop.   There are other things in this bill that will also change America. We  are aiming for universal 3- or 4-year-old kindergarten, I guess you  would call it. As a sidelight, this bill says that the people in these  daycares, which is kind of what they are, need a college degree. That  is a little bit of snobbery that we should put an end to, the idea that  if I have a college degree, I am always better off than somebody who  doesn't have a college degree.   If you are applying for a job, we treat the hardworking, intelligent,  commonsense person without a college degree as being, for some reason,  less worthy of a higher paycheck than the lack of commonsense person  who may not have a strong work ethic who does get a college degree.  That is just a sidelight. A bad provision there.   But another provision about this that is bad is you are taking the  care of the 3- and 4-year-olds out of the parents and giving it  exclusively to the government. Now, a given number of parents may  prefer it, but I think throughout most of this country, the raising of  the children has been primarily the responsibility of the family.   I know the Marxist element in the other party does not want parents  and, in particular, fathers too involved in their children's  upbringing. But I feel this will again permanently change America.   I should point out, if you look at the studies, American schools  sometimes have bad test scores. But our test scores are pretty good in  the fourth grade. In other words, our problem in this country isn't  that the children are doing poorly when the parents take care of them.  Those test scores for children in American schools are falling in  middle school and high school. So the problem is later on. It is not  with the 3- and 4-year-olds when the parents have responsibility.    I should also point out that we are, in this bill, increasing Pell  grants. Now, there are two problems there. Pell grants are grants going  toward what we will refer to as low-income people, but they don't go to  middle-class people.   I am already getting complaints in my district from Pell grants in  the past as couples, married couples who thought they were being  responsible in raising their children, they find out their children  might be going $30,000 or  [[Page H5788]]  $40,000 in debt to get a college degree. But if the parents hadn't been  working or hadn't been working as hard, those parents' children are  eligible for free college.   I know I am sure it always feels good to give more away, but put  yourself in the place of the middle-class American family that is  working to raise their child, a married couple, and you see somebody  else next door not working very hard, and as a bonus, their children  get free college, where the responsible middle-class kid winds up  $30,000 or $40,000 in debt. Another example here of complete unfairness  and perverse incentives.   When I go back home, one of the major concerns of businesses is they  can't find anybody to work. Now, I would hope everybody sometimes tours  their businesses and is familiar with that. Obviously, hiring 87,000  new IRS agents is going to take 87,000 people away from the private  sector.   But another interesting proposal in this bill is we have a new  expanded civilian conservation corps. In other words, we are taking  more people away from the factories, the construction sites, the retail  outlets that they so desperately need to hire them for the government,  make them dependent on the government, but above all make sure they are  not available for the private sector. Another big mistake.   I mentioned the Pell grants and the fact that in a way they are a  little bit of an insult to the middle-class kids who have to go further  and further in debt. But another interesting provision about these Pell  grants and another way that they clearly want to change America in this  bill is you are eligible for the Pell grants if you are here illegally.  This is not a mistake. I am not making this up.   I am on both the Education and Labor Committee and the Budget  Committee, where we tried to take this provision out, and the Democrats  on those committees proudly defended the provision. They really believe  that if you come here, you are entitled to free college, whereas if you  are a member of a middle-class American working family, your children  should go $30,000 to $50,000 in debt to get a college degree. I mean,  it is almost beyond belief, but that is another one of the features of  this bill and one of the reasons why I really hope it fails.   Another feature of this bill, be it natural gas or methane, is  increasing taxes, driving up the cost of energy in the United States.  The environmentalists in this country may be interested to know that  already the high cost of energy in the United States, and even more  Europe, is causing more and more foundries, and I assume other  factories as well, to go up in India, which is a much, much, much  bigger pollution problem than the United States.   So when you drive up the cost of energy, which is so very important  for American factories in general and our foundries in particular, what  this bill would do is ship more American manufacturing jobs abroad and  increase the overall pollution in the United States as we have energy  production go from the new, clean power plants in America to the much  dirtier power plants in India, China, and from around the world.   Other things in this bill that are a little bit irritating: After  much effort, the Republicans, when they were in charge, required Social  Security numbers for the child tax credits. Why did we require Social  Security numbers? To make sure people are not filling out tax returns  and getting tax refunds they aren't entitled to. I don't know why  anybody would not want Social Security numbers so we can check to see  if somebody says they have five children, they really have five  children and get the money back.   For whatever motivation--I can't even imagine what the motivation  would be--in this bill the wonderful Democratic Party is saying, no,  you don't need Social Security numbers to get refunds for your child  tax credit, which will not just increase a form of welfare. This will  increase a form of welfare cheating. Why you would do this, again I  can't imagine.                                time  1915    One other provision in this bill, not a fiscal provision, the  Democrat Party is trying to allow, I would say, 8 to 11 million people  currently here illegally to become legal.   First of all, you are rewarding people who broke the law to come into  this country. And secondly, when you make 8 to 11 million people legal  who were previously illegal it is like putting a sign on the United  States, which the drug cartels who are involved in all this illegal  immigration, will show around the world: Come to the United States. We  are not enforcing our immigration laws.   Perhaps the majority party is not aware that already the drug gangs  in both Central America and Brazil are taking out TV ads inviting  people to come into the United States.   Why do they do that? Because if you're in Central America, they may  charge you 5 to $7,000 to come here. In Brazil they may charge you  $10,000 to come here. And because there is money to be made for the  drug gangs, they advertise, encouraging people to come here.   Now, when we do something like, in essence, legalize people who are  already here illegally, don't you think the drug gangs are going to  educate the people in Central America as to what we are doing? Of  course they are.   So not only are you inviting people or creating people who are  illegal or who were previously illegal, but, worse, you are giving a  green light to anybody hanging out in other countries, now is the time  to come to America.   By the way, when I am down on the border, another thing I hear is the  cooperation from the Mexican Government has been less and less over the  6 or 8 months as we try to control our border, not only to keep illegal  people out but to keep the drugs out, as well.   Our Border Patrol notices a little less cooperation from the  Mexicans, and I can see why. They believe they are getting less  cooperation because if the United States itself doesn't care about its  own border, why should Mexican law enforcement risk their lives  protecting the border and protecting the integrity of the border if the  United States itself doesn't care?   So here we have another provision which advertises the United States  doesn't care about their immigration laws. I am sure the Mexican Border  Patrol, the Mexican military is aware of it, and what will they think  of it? Why should I risk my butt preventing people from coming here if  the United States itself doesn't care?   So, again, I encourage America to wake up. We are permanently  changing the type of country that this is if this bill passes as is.   So I encourage Americans to contact their legislators. Please don't  pass this bill.   Now, I will make two more brief comments for the press corps, if they  are even paying attention to this.   Like all Congressmen, I frequently get contacted on issues and asked  whether I can look into it. Of course, agencies don't like to respond  to requests from individual Congressmen, particularly Congressmen in  the minority, but I think the press corps, which is so incredibly  powerful, more powerful than they imagine, can get answers from  bureaucratic agencies the way perhaps Congressmen cannot. And I am  going to mention two requests here.   I had requests from people of both parties, both Republicans and  Democrats, as to what is in the videos when we had the attacks on this  building on January 6. For whatever reason, those videos have not been  made public. People would like to know what was going on. I would hope  the press corps would apply a little bit of pressure to the appropriate  authorities and make those videos public. Because from what I can tell,  in my district both the on-the-ball Republicans and the on-the-ball  Democrats wish we could see those videos. And I think if the press  applied a little bit of pressure, we would see those videos.   The other thing I am hearing from my constituents back home is they  wonder about the apparent use of ivermectin in India. If you look at  the popular Worldometer website, they will show a dramatic drop in  fatalities in India over the last few months, just a shocking drop.   People claim it is from ivermectin. I don't know if it is true or  not. But the American news media ought to wake up and cover the story  and find out if it is.  [[Page H5789]]    If it is not from ivermectin, the American public should know it  because then they have been sold a bill of goods.   If it is from ivermectin, the American public should know that  because maybe we have a way to greatly reduce the number of fatalities.   So those are two requests that I have of our sometimes slumbering  press corps.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
