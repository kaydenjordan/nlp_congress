 Mr. Speaker, I join Members of the Maryland delegation in  praising a great man, Paul Sarbanes.   The people of Maryland and all Americans have lost a leader and a  public servant of dignity and principle, Senator Paul Sarbanes.  [[Page H7114]]    His 40 years of tireless service as a member of the Maryland House of  Delegates, the House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate  strengthened our Nation and made a difference in the lives of countless  Americans.   In Congress, Paul Sarbanes was respected by his colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for his humility, tenacity, and brilliant intellect.   It was a source of great pride for me that his congressional career  began in the same House seat which was held by my father years before.   All Marylanders can take pride in Paul Sarbanes' leadership as a  defender of our American democracy on the Judiciary Committee and his  tireless work to bring integrity, transparency, and oversight to  Washington as chair of the Banking Committee.   May it be a comfort to Senator Sarbanes' children, Michael, Janet,  and our colleague, Congressman   John Sarbanes, and the entire Sarbanes  family that Senator Sarbanes, Paul, is with his beautiful wife,  Christine. They are together in Heaven.   May it be of comfort that so many mourn their loss and are praying  for them at this sad time.                            ____________________
