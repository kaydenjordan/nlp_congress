 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor my friend John Lewis.  A giant of the civil rights movement in life, John Lewis' legacy now  transcends his death. Nearly two hundred years after our Founders  dedicated our nation to the proposition that all men are created equal,  John Lewis worked to secure that precious truth. He did so with a warm  heart and a smile on his face. He brought that same spirit to Congress,  where we served on the Ways and Means Committee together and his  presence was always uplifting.   Facing racial segregation and violence, Congressman Lewis held an  unwavering conviction in the ability of nonviolence to deliver equality  to all Americans.   His tireless and bold efforts were met with determined resistance and  brutality. He suffered vicious beatings and unwarranted arrests.  Through all strife and opposition, he stood bloody but unbowed.   John Lewis helped move our nation, and he will be dearly missed in  this House.                            ____________________
