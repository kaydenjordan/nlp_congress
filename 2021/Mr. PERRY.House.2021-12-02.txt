 Madam Speaker, in the name of science, congressional  Democrats are continuing their unconstitutional, unlawful march to  force Americans to get the jab.   Think about it. Democrats are already on the path to ruin Christmas,  destroying the supply chain. They are just going to keep going, right?  Destroying industry after industry.   For a party who praised America's healthcare workers when there  wasn't a jab available, who were out there on the front lines, now if  they don't get it, it is okay to fire them, and not a word.   Finally, mandates for defense contractors and intelligence workers  who have to make a choice between defending their country and putting  their own life in peril, and no discussion about natural immunity, none  whatsoever. You could have had COVID already. Not good enough. You have  got to get the jab or lose your job.   Vote against this.
