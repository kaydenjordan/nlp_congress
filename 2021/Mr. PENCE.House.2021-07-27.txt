 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4502.   Inflation, inflation, and inflation, this is the biggest thing I hear  about back in Indiana's Sixth District. Hoosiers in Indiana worry about  the consequences the Democrats' tax and spend agenda is having on their  pocketbooks.   After this week, Speaker Pelosi is recessing the House until  September, having done next to nothing to address the real issues the  American people are facing: food, energy, transportation. Hardworking  folks are already unnecessarily paying more. This Biden-flation crisis  is hitting home. Consumer prices are at a 13-year high. In just 6  months, Democratic leadership is compounding this crisis with a  completely wasteful, bloated bus.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these hyperpartisan  appropriations packages for the good of the American people.
