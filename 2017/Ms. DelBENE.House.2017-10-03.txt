 Madam Speaker, today I rise for Stephanie from my  district. This is her story.   Stephanie and her husband were building their family. They had one  beautiful daughter when she got pregnant for the second time, a planned  and wanted pregnancy.   But at 19 weeks, Stephanie got heartbreaking news. Her fetus had a  devastating fatal birth detect. Based on her age, medical history, and  test results, she was strongly advised to terminate the pregnancy.   Stephanie ultimately decided not to carry the pregnancy to term. She  told me, through tears, that her daughter needed her mother, and it  wasn't worth the risk. It is a profoundly difficult situation for any  family, but it was their decision.   H.R. 36 punishes women like Stephanie. It takes personal medical  decisions out of families' hands and lets politicians decide. It also  places a cruel burden on survivors of sexual assault and child abuse.  It is unacceptable.   On behalf of Stephanie, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' We must  stop the bans.
