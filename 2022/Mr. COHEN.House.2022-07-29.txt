 Mr. Speaker, this has been an interesting debate.   The cumulative debate from the Republican side has been Members who  have been wanting to show their intimate knowledge of weapons. It is  almost a fetishism with weapons, something that only Freud would  properly understand and be able to explain to the American people.   They have talked about hands being dangerous and knives being  dangerous,  [[Page H7525]]  but hands and knives and other weapons that they discussed don't kill  people in volume and number like AR-15s do.   The CIA did a study and said that even shots to extremities all made  fatal impacts on people. The AR-15 is an outgrowth of a military weapon  that was designed for military use. The AR-15 is a weapon that destroys  people's bodies and kills them quickly. It should not be allowed in a  civilized, safe society, particularly for children and for people in  the general public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
