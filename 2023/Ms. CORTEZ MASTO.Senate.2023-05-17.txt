 Mr. President, I come here today to talk about  Police Week, but before I do--I had the opportunity to listen to my  colleague from Nevada push an important point here, and it is not lost  on me and the general public watching this, thinking how crazy this  argument is, at the end of the day. I just heard my good colleague  Senator Tuberville basically say he is not opposed--he actually would  vote for the individual Senator Rosen just said she was asking him to  support, their promotion. He said he would do it.   The only thing that is holding him up is that, instead of what we  have traditionally done in this body through unanimous consent for  promotions for the men and women in our military, which is a procedure  we do all the time, he is forcing it to go to a floor vote. It makes no  sense. It makes no sense to me. It makes no sense to the American  public who are watching this and clearly is an abuse of the use of the  powers we have as Senators in this body.   So I just have to point that out because this is what we are dealing  with, unfortunately, at times when the American public just wants us to  work together to move forward. The men and women in the military  seeking promotions--that is what this is about, and we should be  supporting them because they are the ones standing guard, protecting us  and our national security.   So I just have to point that out, that the craziness sometimes in  this body I see is just nonsensical.
