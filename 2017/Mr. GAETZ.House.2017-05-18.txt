 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the men and women  of law enforcement whose selfless service to a noble cause fills me  with humble gratitude.   Being a law enforcement officer requires more than training. It  requires sacrifice, devotion, integrity, and honor. Most importantly,  it requires an unshakeable faith in the value and importance in the  rule of law.   What keeps our civil society from a descent into lawlessness and  chaos? What separates civilization from savagery?   It is a thin blue line--these men and women of law enforcement, who  give their blood, sweat, tears, and sometimes their lives in order to  protect and serve communities; who make the country a safer place, one  street, one neighborhood, and one community at a time.   As a society, our laws enshrine freedom, our security, and our  liberty. They uphold America's promise of innate fairness. But for  their service and devotion to our great Nation, our law enforcement  officers are often criticized and scorned by some they serve. Yet,  through it all, they continue to serve and protect.   Too often these brave men and women are targets of violence, which is  why I support the Thin Blue Line Act. An attack on law enforcement is  an attack on the freedom of the United States of America, and it cannot  be tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, some have spoken out in opposition to the death penalty  in this discussion, and they would say only God can judge. And while  that is true, certainly the United States Government can do a better  job setting up the meeting.   So today I rise in support of heroes, and I hope my colleagues will  do the same.
