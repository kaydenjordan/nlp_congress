 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of my dear friends  and colleagues, Representative Dorothy Louise McIntosh Slaughter.   Congresswoman Slaughter passed away last month at the age of 88 after  more than 31 years of service in the House of Representatives  representing the people of Rochester, New York. Born a coal miner's  daughter from Kentucky, Louise quickly became a true native daughter of  upstate New York, exemplifying its values and representing her fellow  constituents with the zeal and tenacity that was unrivaled in her  storied tenure.   Becoming the first woman to chair the House Rules Committee,  Congresswoman Slaughter was a pioneer in her advocacy for issues  ranging from congressional transparency to health protections for those  with preexisting conditions.   I had the distinct honor, pleasure, and privilege to work with  Representative Slaughter on a whole host of issues that affect our  neighboring communities in upstate New York and the Nation at large.  Whether it was tackling the opioid epidemic, or ensuring our citizens  had access to clean drinking water, I am proud, but humbled, to say  Louise and I worked side by side.   For Louise, the interest of her constituents and fellow Americans  rose above all else as she embodied the true meaning of bipartisanship,  readily reaching across the aisle to people like me, in spite of party  or public pressure, to achieve the common good.   Rest peacefully, Louise. I will miss your lovely demeanor and your  wonderful smile.
