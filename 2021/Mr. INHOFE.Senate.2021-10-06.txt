 Mr. President, over the past--first of all, let me just  agree with the Senator from Nebraska. She is exactly on target here.  This is a problem that we are in a--I have said several times, I cannot  remember a time that we have not been--that we have been in a greater  threat than we are today.   Over the past 2 weeks, just to kind of let you know where we are now,  the Armed Services Committee held two classified sessions and two open  hearings on Afghanistan. That is the committee that actually had these  in their schedule. These are really eye-openers, and I think we have a  lot of time to uncover what happened and where we go from here.   First, we heard from General Milley, the commander on the ground in  Afghanistan through July. He went up to the July period of time. Then  we heard from the Pentagon's top policy official, Colin Kahl. In open  testimony, we heard from Secretary of Defense Austin, the President's  top military adviser; General Milley; and General McKenzie, who is in  charge of the combatant command that oversees the Middle East. We also  heard from two outside experts with decades of experience following  Afghanistan and the region. Here is what we learned. Now, I am going to  list these things. There are actually seven things we learned, and it  is very significant.   No. 1, we learned that top military leaders advised President Biden  to keep at least 2,500 troops. Now, the President came out and said  that wasn't true. Yet every military person who offered testimony has  said, yes, that is exactly true. They all recommended to President  Biden to keep at least 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. If not, then, you  know the results that are coming from that. You know what we are living  with today.   This advice goes counter to what President Biden told the American  people back in August. He said his generals did not advise him to leave  troops there. Now we know that is not true, and we know that he said  that and he misled the American people. This is a very significant  point.   The second thing: As I said, we learned that al-Qaida was never gone  from Afghanistan. As Biden says, they were there all along, and they  were a big part of the Taliban's victory. Now they are focused on  external operations. Al-Qaida and ISIS could be able to strike  America's soil as soon as a year from now; that is, striking us on our  soil here in America. Even worse, the withdrawal from Afghanistan was a  shot of adrenaline in the arm of the radical Islamic terrorists  everywhere. They now have a victory to point to.   The third thing: We learned that by completely withdrawing from  Afghanistan, we nearly zeroed out our capabilities to strike those same  terrorist organizations. We understand this. Not many people would  disagree with this. General McKenzie said he was not confident that the  United States would be able to prevent al-Qaida or ISIS from using  Afghanistan as a launching pad for terrorist activity, and here is  why--and this is important. The administration isn't talking about  this. Afghanistan poses a unique set of challenges. It is landlocked.  We don't have any bases nearby. This was driven home by our Senator--a  few minutes ago--from Nebraska. Our generals confirmed that it is  extremely difficult and costly to get the intelligence and conduct the  types of operations the President said he would do. This came from all  of the military leaders.   Let's not forget--we still have not killed the terrorists directly  responsible for the attack that killed 13 U.S. servicemembers. Just  imagine--they are still out there.   President Biden decided to put the Taliban in charge, hoping they  changed. The first thing they did was broadcast a video on Afghan  national TV saying the United States deserved the 9/11 attack. It turns  out that the Taliban is the old Taliban. They haven't really changed a  bit. What this means is that Afghanistan is now the safest place in the  world for radical Islamic terrorism. We are at greater risk, and we are  less safe.   The fourth thing out of seven: We learned--and I quote General  McKenzie directly--``The war on terror is not over, and the war in  Afghanistan is not over either.'' But President Biden told the American  people and told the whole world that the war is over. We know better  than that. Evidently, the terrorists didn't get the memo. As General  Milley put it, ``Al-Qaida is still at war with us, and never has not  been.''   No. 5: We learned without a shadow of a doubt that our allies and  partners and our adversaries, too, are questioning our credibility and  resolve. In fact, General Milley said that our credibility has been  ``damaged.'' At last week's hearing, our experts confirmed that  President Biden's botched withdrawal has caused our allies to question  our ability to stick to our strategies and policies.  [[Page S6935]]    No. 6: We learned that our military leaders would not call President  Biden's evacuation operation an ``extraordinary success'' like he did.  General Milley called it a ``strategic failure.''   Now, I want to be clear. This wasn't a failure on the part of our  troops. Our troops served admirably. They rescued 120,000 people. They  did what they were told to do. Their Commander in Chief led them  astray.   As Dr. Vali Nasr said just the other day--he told our committee last  Thursday that the end game in Afghanistan was not our ``finest  moment.'' That is an understatement, and that is someone trying to  figure out some way to justify what went on.   The last thing, No. 7: We learned that President Biden simply ignored  the conditions-based approach.   Now, one thing I will say about the previous approach. People are  confused sometimes about what our previous President said. He had a  conditions-based approach, and the hallmark of it or the center of that  conditions-based approach was that we would leave troops there to  protect our Americans. We don't even know right now how many Americans  are there.   So we learned that President Biden simply ignored the conditions- based approach. President Biden could have easily said: The Taliban has  not met our conditions. We are going to stay in Afghanistan and ensure  that no terrorists are able to hit us.   That is what his military advisers recommended that he say, and he  didn't do that. In fact, President Biden ignored the conditions on the  ground and instead decided to accept a significant amount of strategic  risk. That means the United States is less safe today, and our  credibility for the future is shot through, and that is what his  decision means.   We lost credibility because we left Americans and our Afghan allies  behind. No one will believe what America says after this, and I am not  sure why they should. I can't think of a time in history that this has  happened. This is simply just something that is brand new.   One thing we didn't get clear answers on despite the repeated  bipartisan requests is exactly how many Americans and Afghan partners  did we leave behind and what is going to happen to them. DOD pointed to  the State Department and vice versa. That is just unacceptable.   We don't know how many people we left behind. You know, we heard the  Secretary actually made a statement approximating at one time between  3- and 4- and 500, and the next approximation was closer to 10,000. So  we don't really know that. It is bad enough that we leave them behind,  but we don't even know how many people we left.   This is why I am going to continue calling for more hearings until we  get--we have to get the answers. This isn't going to go away.   Why does all this matter? America is less safe than we were before  because of President Biden's decisions. Six years ago, former Secretary  of Defense Robert Gates said:         I think [President Biden] has been wrong on . . . every       major foreign policy and national security issue over the       past four decades.    America is now more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. We all  understand that, and the whole world understands that. We have no plan  to meet that threat.   We also have to think about what this means for our biggest  challenge, and that is, of course, our challengers of China, Russia,  North Korea, Iran. They are all celebrating now. China is engaged in a  historic nuclear buildup--one that we have never seen anything like  before. Russia just conducted its largest military exercise in four  decades. They are watching this debacle and thinking how weak America  looks. Now, if President Biden can't get counterterrorism right, how  can his administration put together a strategy to confront China and  Russia?   Unfortunately, this strategic failure of our Afghanistan exit is  encouraging our adversaries to test us--the exact opposite of  deterrence. That is what I am worried about now. I am more worried  about it after last week. That is why I am going to keep fighting for  more open hearings so the American people and our adversaries and our  enemies and our friends will understand what it is all about. And this  will be the real America, not what they experienced recently.   That is why I continue to push for adequate defense funding, to make  sure that we prioritize nuclear modernization, and to pass this year's  NDAA as soon as we can get it to the floor.   By the way, this is the one bill that I have every expectation we  will get. The NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, is one that  we have passed for 61 consecutive years. I have every expectation that  we will do it now. I don't like the idea that the Democrats are putting  this off as if there is no threat out there. I don't think that is  going to happen.   That is why we have to keep getting to the bottom of this. We have  taken some big hits--big hits--out there, and we have got to recover.  OK.   With that, I yield the floor.
