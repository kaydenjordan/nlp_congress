 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3996) to amend title 28, United States Code, to permit other  courts to transfer certain cases to United States Tax Court.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3996         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Access to the       Courts for Taxpayers Act''.       SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF CERTAIN CASES.         Section 1631 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by       inserting ``(or, for cases within the jurisdiction of the       United States Tax Court, to that court)'' after ``any other       such court''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3996, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, American taxpayers fighting the Internal Revenue Service  deserve their day in court. Not every taxpayer who thinks the IRS is  wrong is right, but not every time the IRS brings a case are they  right.   The Tax Court is a unique creation of Congress. It is, in fact, an  article 1 court specifically created and dedicated to tax issues.   The Tax Court has the expertise necessary to hear complex or, in some  cases, simple tax cases. Any situation in which a taxpayer is unable to  contest an IRS action, therefore, would be simply unacceptable.                                time  1515    Unfortunately, the problem today is that, due to an oversight in the  Federal law, you can find yourself in a situation, by filing in good  faith, not to be able to use a Tax Court. Unlike the IRS, not all  taxpayers know about the requirement to file tax disputes in the Tax  Court. Some taxpayers, in good faith, file in their local district  court, which is wrong, and by the time it is discovered, their  opportunity to file in Tax Court has expired.   Today, when a Federal Tax Court judge recognizes the improper venue,  under current law he is prevented from simply transferring the case to  Tax Court, where it rightfully belongs. By the time this happens, the  taxpayer usually has lost their day in court since they only have a  short time in which to ask for the Tax Court.   Because of this oversight in the Federal law, I, along with the  ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee, introduced the  Protecting Access to the Courts for Taxpayers Act. The legislation,  quite simply, fixes this error that impacts dozens and dozens of  Americans repeatedly every year. It is supported by advocates in the  Judicial Conference and the Tax Courts.   It just makes sense, Mr. Speaker, that, in fact, getting your day in  court should not be nullified by an actual petition to a court  erroneously not recognized in time. In any other case in which you file  in Federal court, if the court determines it is not an appropriate  venue, the case is transferred. This is a lone exception.   I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for his support in this  legislation and for his help in making sure it was drafted accurately.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am with my friend, and would like to  associate all of my further comments with his. So, again, I urge  support for this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 506) to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide an  additional tool to prevent certain frauds against veterans, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 506         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Crimes Against       Veterans Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL TOOL TO PREVENT CERTAIN FRAUDS AGAINST                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``Sec. 1352. Fraud regarding veterans' benefits         ``(a) Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute,       any scheme or artifice to defraud an  [[Page H1571]]       individual of veterans' benefits, or in connection with       obtaining veteran's benefits for that individual, shall be       fined under this title, imprisoned not more than five years,       or both.        ``(b) In this section--        ``(1) the term `veteran' has the meaning given that term in       section 101 of title 38; and        ``(2) the term `veterans' benefits' means any benefit       provided by Federal law for a veteran or a dependent or       survivor of a veteran.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following new item:  ``1352. Fraud regarding veterans' benefits.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 506, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act of 2017  closes a small but significant loophole in Federal law and, in so  doing, gives Federal prosecutors an additional mechanism to protect  veterans from criminals who seek to defraud them.   In recent years, we have heard distressing and infuriating stories  about particularly elderly veterans being swindled out of their  veterans' benefits. Some of these veterans, including those in low- income housing, have been deceived by fraudsters who, in fact, have  preyed on their age and infirmity.   Helping veterans in this case certainly should be a priority in this  Congress.   This is particularly insidious in that, in some cases, the criminal  will claim to get a veteran's benefits approved in record time, will  charge outrageous fees to file, and, ultimately, will provide the  veteran with little or no assistance. They will just pocket the money  that rightfully belongs to the elderly veteran.   Mr. Speaker, this change in the law is critical. I want to thank Mr.  Tom Rooney, the author of the bill. I want to urge that we consider it  quickly, close this loophole, and provide prosecutors with the kind of  ability to protect our aging veterans in a way that is currently not  available.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Thomas J. Rooney), who is the author of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's veterans have sacrificed. They have given  us so much. They have protected us.   In his second inaugural address, President Lincoln reminded us of our  solemn duty ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for  his widow, and his orphan.''   By doing this today, we keep that promise of so long ago: the promise  to give back, as appropriate, and to protect that by giving back to the  widows, the orphans, and the veterans themselves, because our values  don't just say we write a check. We also protect to make sure that  check gets to the true beneficiary. This enforcement will do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to, on a bipartisan basis, which  this bill has been from day one, support it and to move it to the  Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3249) to authorize the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3249         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Project Safe Neighborhoods       Grant Program Authorization Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         For the purposes of this Act--        (1) the term ``criminal street gangs'' has the meaning       given such term in section 521 of title 18, United States       Code;        (2) the term ``gang crime'' means a felony or misdemeanor       crime, under State or Federal law, committed by one or more       persons who are a member of, or directly affiliated with, a       criminal street gang;        (3) the term ``transnational organized crime group'' has       the meaning given such term in section 36(k)(6) of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C.       2708(k)(6));        (4) the term ``transnational organized crime'' has the       meaning given such term in section 36(k)(5) of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C.       2708(k)(5)); and        (5) the term ``firearms offenses'' means an offense under       section 922 or 924 of title 18, United States Code.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.         The Attorney General of the United States is authorized to       establish and carry out a program, to be known as the       ``Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program'' or, in       this Act, as the ``Program'', within the Office of Justice       Programs at the Department of Justice.       SEC. 4. PURPOSE.         The purpose of the Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant       Program is to foster and improve existing partnerships       between Federal, State, and local agencies, including the       United States Attorney in each Federal judicial district, to       create safer neighborhoods through sustained reductions in       violent crimes by--        (1) developing and executing strategic plans to assist law       enforcement agencies in combating gang crimes, including the       enforcement of gun laws and drug interdiction; and        (2) developing intervention and prevention initiatives,       including juvenile justice projects and activities which may       include street-level outreach, conflict mediation, and the       changing of community norms, in order to reduce violence.       SEC. 5. RULES AND REGULATIONS.         (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall, not later than       60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, make rules       to create, carry out, and administer the Program in       accordance with this section.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS; CONSOLIDATION OF                     PROGRAMS.         (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated for the Program under this Act $50,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2021.        (b) Consolidation of Programs.--For each of fiscal years       2019 through 2023, no funds are authorized to be separately       appropriated to the Department of Justice Office of Justice       Programs for--        (1) competitive and evidence-based programs to reduce gun       crime and gang violence;        (2) an Edward Byrne Memorial criminal justice innovation       program;        (3) community-based violence prevention initiatives; or        (4) gang and youth violence education, prevention and       intervention, and related activities.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3249, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas is quite right. This bill's  pay-for comes through consolidation of similar programs, and I think it  is important to briefly go over that.   Working with the Attorney General's Office, the author, Mrs.  Comstock, went to great lengths to find programs that are essentially  doing much the same thing in which, by consolidating, you pick up  efficiencies. I particularly note that item two in the bill, the pay- for, the Edward Byrne Memorial criminal justice innovation program, is  but a small part of the overall so-called Byrne program.   Many of the things the gentlewoman from Texas cited are good and are  not being consolidated but, rather, a small amount. This targeted  approach with our limited funds allows those funds to go further; and  particularly as we look at community outreach, these funds, by being  consolidated, are part of a community outreach and will be used in  similar ways to the programs that they are taking from, but taking from  it, in this case, in a consolidated way.  [[Page H1576]]    So I want to thank a former staff member of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, the committee that deals with efficiency  in government, for looking through the details of these appropriated  funds and finding a way to bring them together to give both flexibility  and efficiency that I believe this will adhere to. It is the reason  that this is a bipartisan bill.   The reason that it is so widely accepted is that it has been narrowly  targeted. And although I share with the gentlewoman from Texas, my  friend from Houston, that in a perfect world we would be plussing-up  funds, if we are not able to do that at this time, I would support and  work with the gentlewoman any time to try to do something similar for  some of the areas of her concern.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
