 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3663, which  would name the VA medical center in Huntington, West Virginia, after a  true American hero and my personal friend, Hershel ``Woody'' Williams.   Woody is recognized as the last living Medal of Honor recipient from  the notoriously horrific Battle of Iwo Jima; but in West Virginia,  Woody is known far more for his work on behalf of veterans.   Upon his retirement from the Marines, Woody served 33 years as a  counselor with the Department of Veterans Affairs. He served as the  commandant of the veterans nursing home in Barboursville, West  Virginia, for years, providing care to aging veterans. Then, in 2012,  he helped start a Medal of Honor foundation dedicated to honoring Gold  Star families and their fallen loved ones.   The foundation has erected monuments in 36 States, like Tennessee,  and offers scholarships to children in Gold Star families. Woody  frequently travels to Washington to participate in special ceremonies  at Arlington National  [[Page H4263]]  Cemetery in honor of our fallen heroes. Earlier this year, as my  colleague had mentioned, he received national recognition for his  service to our country when he was asked to perform the coin toss for  the Super Bowl.   It is often said that the character of a person isn't measured by  their actions while in the limelight, but rather by the work they do  when they are not being in the light, when no one is looking. Woody's  life is a manifestation of working behind the scenes. He has been  unwavering in his support for our veterans, and Congress has an  opportunity to offer him our heartfelt thanks and gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R.  3663, and I thank my colleague, Evan Jenkins, for this introduction of  the bill and his support for Woody Williams.
