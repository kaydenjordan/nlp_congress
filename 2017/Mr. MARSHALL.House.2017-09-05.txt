 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss education: the  building block to a successful future.   As a father and, now, a grandfather for the second time, I know our  education system is of the utmost importance. Education is truly one of  the pillars of my life.   I am a strong advocate for limiting the scope of the Federal  Government in education decisions. Our school boards and teachers  understand what works best for these individual students, and providing  them control to make their own decisions ensures the best results for  our students.   I am encouraged to see the House retain and increase many of the  Federal funding levels for education, including funding for career and  technical education State grants. I am very pleased to see Congress  increase funding for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act, by $200 million.   I urge my colleagues to also talk to their local teachers,  administrators, and students to see what works and what doesn't.   Educating the next generation is one of the most sacred  responsibilities, and I thank those like I met with who dedicate their  lives to that cause.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kansas' favorite  son, a hero and mentor of mine, and the former occupant of the  congressional office I now hold, Robert J. Dole. Senator Bob Dole never  forgot where he is from, Russell, Kansas. Perhaps that is what made him  so effective and so beloved by his constituents.   Now at 94 years young, Senator Dole continues to work every day for  the causes he supports. He continues as a shining example of  international leadership, whether it is in the causes he still  champions or the work he did in Congress to help feed millions of  people around the world. All this work, he does with humility and wit  that endeared him to the Nation and that has been engrained in him as a  Kansan.    Many weekends, he can still be seen greeting our Nation's veterans at  the World War II Memorial, which he helped build, and he works today on  promoting the national memorial to President Eisenhower, his hero and  another great Kansan.   I cannot think of one living American more deserving of Congress'  highest civilian award, which is why I am thrilled that tonight, this  very night, the House will join the Senate in passing the Bob Dole  Congressional Gold Medal Act.   I encourage the President to quickly sign this. I look forward to  this vote as much as any I have taken. I am honored to call him friend.  I am honored to participate in this vote.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.
