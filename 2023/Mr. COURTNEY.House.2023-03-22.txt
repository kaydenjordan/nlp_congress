 Mr. Speaker, I rise to enthusiastically support H.R.  1093, a bill that will identify key parts of our Nation's system of  export controls that should be amended and expedited to achieve the  goals of the new Australia-U.K.-U.S. trilateral security agreement  which, as the bill states, will ``contribute to peace and stability in  the Indo-Pacific region.''   Mr. Speaker, I salute and thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member  Meeks, and the members and staff of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  for moving swiftly in the wake of last week's extraordinary joint  appearance of President Biden, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony  Albanese, and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, publicly revealing our  three nations' commitment to a specific, executable pathway to bolster  much-needed deterrence in support of an international rules-based  order, which today is increasingly under stress.    Mr. Speaker, I had the honor to join these leaders on March 13 at  Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego for this historic announcement. As  was noted repeatedly, it marked the first time since 1958 that the U.S.  and the U.K. pledged to share critical technologies with another  country.   In addition to sharing nuclear propulsion technology to recapitalize  Australia's submarine fleet, the three governments also committed to  sharing other security capabilities, including quantum computing,  artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and hypersonics.   Pooling these advanced capabilities will enhance our three nations'  capability to protect maritime freedom of navigation and aviation,  which have been the pillars of peaceful coexistence in the commons of  the seas and the skies since the end of World War II.   To achieve the goals of the AUKUS plan, it will require all three  countries to use laser-like focus to remove any barriers that might  occur from our system of export controls that are not aligned with this  new enhanced alliance.   Admiral Harry Harris, former commander of Indo-Pacific Command and  former Ambassador to South Korea, said it best at a recent House Armed  Services Committee hearing on the contested environment in the Indo- Pacific: ``I can't emphasize enough how important it is to get through  this export control issue with Australia. We could have every good  intention in the world, but it will falter if we become bound up by our  own regulation and our own regulatory policy.''    Mr. Speaker, this bill heeds that call by directing the  State Department to inventory any and all administrative and statutory  barriers to AUKUS implementation and report that back to Congress  within 60 days. This is exactly what Congress needs to do.   Mr. Speaker, I will end by foot stomping the extraordinary bipartisan  support that AUKUS enjoys in all three governments and was on full  display last week in San Diego. Both the majority and opposition  parties in the U.K. and Australia are rock solid in support of this  agreement, and tonight's bill is a strong signal of bipartisan support  in the U.S. Congress.   Indeed, in the last Congress, we overwhelmingly passed the first-ever  congressional action related to AUKUS by authorizing Australian  submariners to begin joint training at the moored training ship  facility in Charleston, South Carolina, and those sailors are here  today. Building on that effort, it is of utmost importance that we  continue our efforts in Congress and identify opportunities to smoothly  implement AUKUS.    Mr. Speaker, as the Australian Prime Minister very well  described a week ago last Monday:         A new chapter in the relationship between Australia, the       United States, and the United Kingdom is about to begin; a       friendship built on our shared values, our commitment to       democracy, and our common vision for a peaceful and       prosperous future.    Mr. Speaker, that is a vision worth pursuing, and that is why I urge  all of my colleagues to support this bill.
