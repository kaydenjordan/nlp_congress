 Mr. Speaker, today, once again, we are going to debate  what we need to do to stop these senseless attacks on our schools.   Our schools are a place of memories. Think about it. We can all,  every one of us, recite stories of when we were in elementary school.  We all know stories about friends or things that happened in junior  high school and in high school. Our life's memories are filled back in  those schooldays, those memories.   The children today, the kids today, have different memories of  school. No child in America should go to school afraid, and no parent  in America should worry about their children, if they are going to come  home safely, when they send them to school.   As I stand here right now, outside these doors there are armed guards  with machine guns, guard dogs, metal detectors to keep us safe. But  today, once again, children will go to school across America and sit  like sitting ducks in a classroom.   When a crazed madman attacked my colleagues and friends at baseball  practice, our response was instant. It was immediate. Democrats and  Republicans, we all agreed we need more security for Congress, we need  more money to secure our offices, to secure our staff to make sure they  are safe. We even found money to provide security for us at home.  People move pretty fast here when it is about themselves and their  families.   Why do we think that our lives are more important than the lives of  any parent's child in America?   Why do we think we are more important that we can find security for  ourselves so quickly?   We should take every metal detector in this building and send it to  some school tomorrow until we find the money to secure our schools like  we did for ourselves.   I read an article where root canals and colonoscopies have a higher  approval rating than Congress. Maybe the American people will think  differently if we put our kids before Congress.                            ____________________
