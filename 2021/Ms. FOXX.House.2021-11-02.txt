 Mr. Speaker, this Thanksgiving will be the most expensive  on record, and Americans have the Biden administration to thank.   Put yourself in the shoes of hardworking families across America.  Every morning they wake up and leave for work. The moment their feet  touch the ground outside, inflation is already reaching for their  wallets. They turn on their cars and head to the gas station where  inflation is ready and waiting for them. At the grocery store,  inflation is lurking within the aisles.   It is a sobering reality for so many working families, and people are  rightfully angry. I share their anger.   Mr. Speaker, consider what these working families are thinking as  Thanksgiving approaches. Will they be able to afford President Biden's  turkey tax on Thanksgiving dinner? Will they even be able to get  themselves to the grocery store in time before the shelves are empty?  Will they even be able to get to the grocery store at all because of  rising gas prices?   Consider this: Thanksgiving dinner this year is estimated to cost 4  to 5 percent more for American families, and that is assuming they will  be able to put food on the table.   Just this morning I did an interview with a local radio station in  the Fifth District. The host remarked to me that under the Biden  administration we are going to have to get used to empty shelves and  rising prices. I take great issue with where the direction of this  country is headed under this administration.   Americans have been told to ``lower their expectations'' and to get  used to doing with less. No, we won't. This is America, and we do not  settle for less. We are better than meeting meager expectations,  lowering the bar, and expecting less. That is just not who we are as a  country, and it certainly is not who we are as a people.   Let's not forget that this administration touted an alleged savings  of 16 cents for family barbecues over the Independence Day weekend  earlier this year. Nobody took that claim seriously then, and it  certainly does not hold up now.   From President Biden's turkey tax to rising gas prices, empty store  shelves to rising costs of heating homes during the winter, everyone is  feeling the squeeze of inflation. This is not a high-class problem by  any stretch of the imagination.   Since President Biden took office, we have watched every month as  inflation has ravaged the country. What is this administration  thinking? Is it so blind to the fact that families and hardworking  Americans are struggling to make ends meet?   Mr. Speaker, the holiday season is on the horizon and Americans are  more concerned than ever. With Thanksgiving dinner and everyday  commodities becoming out of reach now, Christmas dinner will cost  Americans an arm and a leg. This is downright shameful.                            ____________________
