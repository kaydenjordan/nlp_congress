 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2694,  the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   As a mom and a policymaker, I know how important it is to protect the  economic security of pregnant workers and working families; yet 41  years after the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Federal  law falls short of guaranteeing that all pregnant workers have  reasonable workplace accommodations to protect their health and the  health of their baby.   Reasonable accommodations can range from providing seating, water,  and light duty to excusing pregnant workers from tasks that involve  dangerous substances. But when pregnant workers do not have access to  the accommodations they need, they are at risk of losing their job,  being denied a promotion, or not being hired in the first place.   Unfortunately, pregnant workers suffer workplace discrimination at  alarming rates. According to a survey from the National Partnership for  Women and Families, more than 60 percent of the women have experienced  pregnancy discrimination on the job. Women of color are overrepresented  in low-wage, physically demanding jobs and are, therefore,  disproportionately harmed by a lack of access to reasonable  accommodation.   Last year, I chaired an Education and Labor Committee hearing on  pregnancy discrimination. We heard very  [[Page H4515]]  compelling testimony demonstrating that far too many pregnant workers  are denied access to reasonable workplace accommodations despite the  existing Federal law providing for equal treatment on the job.   Now my home State of Oregon is helping to lead the way by passing  bipartisan legislation that requires reasonable accommodations for  pregnant workers. The new law has protected pregnant women and also  provided certainty to the business community. But we need to make sure  that all pregnant workers, regardless of where they live, can access  the protections they need to stay safe and healthy in the workplace.   The bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is our opportunity to  address pregnancy discrimination and protect the health, well-being,  and economic security of pregnant and parenting workers and their  families. By clarifying the right of pregnant workers to fair treatment  in the workplace, we will finally guarantee that pregnant workers get  the accommodations they need without facing fear of discrimination or  retaliation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott and Chairman Nadler for their  leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Women's Law Center in support of this legislation.                                                September 11, 2020.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National Women's       Law Center, we urge you to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness       Act (H.R. 2694) and vote no on any motion to recommit. The       National Women's Law Center (``the Center'') has worked for       over 45 years to advance and protect women's equality and       opportunity--and since its founding has fought for the rights       of pregnant women in the workplace. For the last eight years,       the Center has been a leader in advocating for the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act, and for pregnancy accommodation       protections in states across the country. The Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act would clarify the law for employers and       employees alike, requiring employers to make reasonable       accommodations for limitations arising out of pregnancy,       childbirth, and related medical conditions, just as they       already do for disabilities. Providing accommodations ensures       that women can work safely while pregnant instead of being       pushed out of work at a time when their families need their       income the most.        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant workers were       all too often denied medically needed accommodations--      including simple accommodations like a stool to sit on during       a long shift or a bottle of water at a workstation. As the       United States enters the sixth month of COVID-19 lockdown,       the need for clarity regarding employers' obligations to       provide accommodations for pregnant workers has only       increased. Across the country, as new information emerges       about the risks COVID-19 poses during pregnancy, pregnant       workers are urgently seeking, and far too often being denied,       accommodations like proper personal protective equipment,       telework, moving to a less crowded work area or changing       start times so as not to risk riding public transit during       peak hours. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act uses an       already-familiar framework modeled on the Americans with       Disabilities Act (ADA) to ensure that when such a request is       made, employers and employees can engage in an interactive       process to determine whether the employee's pregnancy related       limitations can be reasonably accommodated without an undue       hardship to the employer. This will help ensure that       employees are not forced to choose between a paycheck and a       healthy pregnancy.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will close gaps and       clarify ambiguities in the law that have left too many       pregnant workers unprotected for too long. The Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA), passed in 1978, guarantees the       right not to be treated adversely at work because of       pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, and the       right to be treated at least as well as other employees ``not       so affected but similar in their ability or inability to       work.'' Unfortunately, many courts interpreted the PDA       narrowly and allowed employers to refuse to accommodate       workers with medical needs arising out of pregnancy, even       when they routinely accommodated other physical limitations.       In Young v. UPS, the Supreme Court held that when an employer       accommodates workers who are similar to pregnant workers in       their ability to work, it cannot refuse to accommodate       pregnant workers who need it simply because it ``is more       expensive or less convenient'' to accommodate pregnant women       too. The Young decision was an important victory for pregnant       workers, but the standard it set out still left many       important questions unanswered and created uncertainty for       employers and employees about when exactly the PDA requires       pregnancy accommodations. In addition, the Americans with       Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to make reasonable       accommodations for employees with disabilities. However,       courts have consistently held that pregnancy is not a       disability. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would fill the       holes left in these protections with a common-ground and       commonsense approach that ensures pregnant workers are       accommodated when the accommodations they need are reasonable       and do not pose an undue hardship to employers.        Accommodating pregnant workers is not only good for working       women and families, it is good for business. Moreover, today,       women make up about half the workforce. More women are       continuing to work while they are pregnant, through later       stages of pregnancy. For example, two-thirds of women who had       their first child between 2006 and 2008 worked during       pregnancy, and 88 percent of these first-time mothers worked       into their last trimester. When employers accommodate       pregnant workers, businesses reap the benefits of avoiding       the costs of turnover and keeping experienced employees on       the job. And since pregnancy is temporary, pregnancy       accommodations are, by definition, short-term; many of these       accommodations are low and no cost.        The time is now to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.       Thirty states and the District of Columbia have enacted       provisions explicitly granting pregnant employees the right       to accommodations at work, from Massachusetts, New York, and       California, to South Carolina, Utah, Nebraska, West Virginia       and Tennessee. Millions of pregnant workers have benefited       from these protections, but a pregnant employee's ability to       work safely should not depend on where she lives.        We strongly urge you to support pregnant workers by voting       for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and rejecting any       motion to recommit. If you have any questions, please contact       me.            Sincerely,      Emily J. Martin,        Vice President for Education & Workplace Justice, National       Women's Law Center.
