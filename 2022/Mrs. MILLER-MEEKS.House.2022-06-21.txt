 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of an incredible student athlete from Iowa's Second  District.   Iowa City High School's Ben Kueter is a local legend in eastern Iowa.  He is a four-sport star for the Little Hawks, dominating in football,  wrestling, baseball, and track.   I have recognized Ben on the floor of the House twice already, as he  is a dominant wrestler, a three-time State champion, and currently  holds a 72-0 record going into his senior year.   Recently, Ben not only earned a spot on the Team USA U20 national  wrestling team and will now represent the United States at the world  championships in Bulgaria this summer.   Ben is an outstanding outfielder for Iowa City's baseball team and  ran the second leg of the distance medley relay team that took second  place at the 2021 Drake Relays. A standout football player, Ben plays  both tight end and linebacker. Last fall, Ben committed to both  football and wrestling programs at the University of Iowa.   I look forward to watching Ben help the Little Hawks win State  championships next year and helping our beloved Hawkeyes when he heads  down College Street next year.   Good luck, Ben. Go Little Hawks and Go Hawkeyes.                        Recognizing Lisa Hoerschelmann     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the feats  of Lisa Hoerschelmann.   Lisa has been an employee of First Gateway Credit Union for over 10  years and has always gone above and beyond in customer service and  ensuring that customers receive the best service and advice for their  accounts.   Lisa's commitment to customer service paid off when an elderly woman  was influenced by a scammer to withdraw a large sum of money from her  retirement fund. Thankfully, Lisa caught the scam and prevented the  scam from occurring.   Because of Lisa's commitment to looking out for her customers, she  was awarded the Consumer Protection Hero Award from the Iowa State  Government.   I can think of no one more deserving of this award than Lisa. Her  attentiveness and quick thinking protected a member of her credit  union. I am thankful that there are hardworking and thoughtful people  like Lisa looking out for the citizens of our community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7777, the Industrial  Control Systems Cybersecurity Training Act.   In policy discussions following recent cyber incidents, like  SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline, one constant area of concern to  Congress and our cyber defenders, like the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, has been improving the Nation's  workforce pipeline for cybersecurity and other STEM-related fields.   As the interconnectivity of our daily lives continues to grow, the  estimated worldwide cost of cybercrime has risen to $6 trillion  annually. Despite this alarming and growing threat, some estimates say  that the cybersecurity workforce is currently short about 1 to 3  million qualified professionals.   A recent Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, study  of IT decisionmakers across eight countries found that 82 percent of  employers report a shortage of cybersecurity skills, and 71 percent  believe this talent gap causes direct and measurable damage to their  organization.                                time  1415    Federal agencies have been working to bridge the gap in skills  required to prepare a future cyber workforce.   CISA is collaborating closely with organizations like the National  Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to identify cyber  knowledge deficits on a sector-by-sector basis. One example is the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework, which serves  as a useful precursor for directing Federal resources into education  and research priorities.   H.R. 7777 would require that CISA provide resources for the purpose  of training cyber operators that are fluent across multiple segments of  the cyber domain, not only information technology but also operational  technology, like manufacturing systems and industrial control systems,  which are commonplace within critical infrastructure sectors and are  increasingly exposed to cyber risk.   We must continue to do all we can to improve our Nation's cyber  posture and focus on policy that can help make our government and  private sector critical infrastructure operations more resilient and  prepared for future events.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 7777, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7174, the National  Computer Forensics Institute Reauthorization Act.   Our Nation is facing an increase in cyber threats stemming from  multiple angles. These range from critical infrastructure  vulnerabilities to child exploitation online.   Previous cyberattacks have highlighted the need for preventive  measures and law enforcement support at every level, including Federal,  State, local, Tribal, and territorial.   Many recent attacks and exploited vulnerabilities have severely  impacted the American people and economy. Adding to this, with the  ongoing war in Ukraine, the intelligence community is warning of a  heightened cyber threat from Russia.   The National Computer Forensics Institute in Hoover, Alabama, is  operated by the United States Secret Service. NCFI provides essential  education and training to State, local, Tribal, and territorial law  enforcement, prosecutors, and judges on how to mitigate, detect, and  respond to cyber threats.   Since opening in 2008, NCFI has continuously worked to equip its  students with the necessary tools and knowledge needed to prevent  cybercrime.   Now, more than ever, as we are facing cyberattacks from malicious  actors like Russia, China, and Iran, in addition to other criminal  behavior online like child pornography, bolstering cyber training and  tools for our law enforcement partners is imperative.   Congress officially authorized the NCFI for 5 years in 2017. This  bill reauthorizes NCFI for 10 years and updates its mission, function,  and curriculum.   In addition, the bill requires an annual report on NCFI's impact and  activities, a requirements analysis for its potential expansion, and a  process to receive feedback from participating jurisdictions.   Cybersecurity has never been more important to homeland security, and  it is pivotal that we train our State and local law enforcement to  address this threat and other online nefarious activities head-on.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting H.R. 7174, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5274, the Prevent  Exposure to Narcotics and Toxics Act, introduced by my friend and  colleague,   David Joyce.   This bill addresses the important issue of protecting our frontline  Customs and Border Protection personnel from the dangerous and illicit  drugs they encounter every day.   This is especially important as the situation at our southern border  continues to worsen by the day under this administration. In fiscal  year 2021, Customs and Border Protection officers and agents seized  more than 914,000 pounds of illicit narcotics, and so far this fiscal  year, CBP is on track to seize a similar amount of illegal drugs.                                time  1430    Unfortunately, in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security's Office  of the Inspector General issued a report that found CBP personnel were  not adequately protected and were at greater risk of secondary exposure  while handling illicit drugs such as fentanyl and methamphetamine.   CBP frontline personnel often work in challenging and dangerous  environments as they risk exposure to these illicit drugs via  inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and contact with needles.   H.R. 5274 will require the CBP Commissioner to issue containment  devices, which are critical tools that provide protection against  secondary exposure to fentanyl and other chemicals to help protect our  frontline officers and agents.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all Members to support this bill  to protect our dedicated frontline law enforcement at the border, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Madam Speaker, certainly, H.R. 5274 is a small  step that we can take in managing the crisis at our southern border, in  addition to emphasizing border security. I thank Representative Joyce  for his very astute observation that our law enforcement is at risk and  for his bill to help protect those who protect and serve us.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge Members to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
