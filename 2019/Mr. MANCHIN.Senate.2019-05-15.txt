 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to call for immediate  action on the American Miners Act.   We have an obligation to the miners across America who served our  Nation by providing us with the energy throughout our greatest  advancements. They deserve to know that their pensions, which they  rightfully worked for, will be funded fully, and they deserve to have  accessible healthcare, which was guaranteed to them as well.   As the Senate fails to act, we continue to put our retired miners'  healthcare and pension benefits in jeopardy yet again.   I have been working with everyone and from every angle in order to  prevent our miners from losing their healthcare and retirement  benefits, but, once again, they are facing a deadline that puts their  whole livelihood at risk.   This has been a long fight, and it is far from over. Everyone who has  joined me on this journey understands that  [[Page S2867]]  fighting for working people is what we were sent here to do.   These retired miners are walking the halls and fighting for what is  rightfully theirs. I am doing this for them and their families. I  promised them that this body would not abandon them, and I refuse to  let them down.   The 1974 Pension Plan will be insolvent by 2022 if we do not act now.  Miners who receive their healthcare through companies who went bankrupt  in 2018 are at risk of losing coverage in the coming months if we fail  to act soon. Unlike many other public and private pension plans, the  1974 Pension Plan was well managed and 94 percent funded prior to the  crash of 2008. However, the 2008 financial crisis hit at a time when  this plan had its highest payment obligations due to retirements.   If the plan becomes insolvent, these beneficiaries face benefit cuts,  and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will assume billions of  dollars in liabilities.   To address this, we have to shore up the 1974 Pension Plan, which is  heading for insolvency due to the coal company bankruptcies and the  2008 financial crisis; ensure that the miners who are at risk due to  2018 coal company bankruptcies will not lose their healthcare; and  extend the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund tax at $1.10 per ton of  underground-mined coal and 55 cents per ton of surface-mined coal for  10 years.   West Virginia has more retired union miners than any other State.  More than 27,000 retirees live in West Virginia alone.   I have two letters that I would like to read into the Record that  explain what we are dealing with in all parts of our State.   This is Roy from West Virginia, and he says:         I am a 63 year old, 3rd generation coal miner. I started in       the mine 3 days prior to graduating from high school.       Unfortunately, I had to find other employment in 1999 after       27 years of mining because my mine shut down. Although the       job that I was hired at paid a lot less (75% less), I felt       that we would survive because of the promise of lifetime       healthcare.        When I went into mining, I felt that if I put in my time, I       would be taken care of in my older years. Now that I am       approaching that stage of my life and am faced with the fact       of healthcare concerns of people my age group, I am fearful       of losing the security that my pension and health benefits       will provide to me and my wife of 43 years.        Fourteen years ago, my wife was diagnosed with severe       rheumatoid arthritis. The cost of her medications alone would       total more than my pension income, making retirement an       impossibility. The idea of her not being able to receive the       proper treatment for her condition is not an option. If       necessary, I will continue to work to provide the medical       care that she needs and deserves.        Senator Manchin, for the concerns that have been mentioned       in this letter, I deeply appreciate the support that you have       lent to the passage of the Miner's Protection Act and hope       that your fellow legislators will consider the same.    This is Lisa from Fraziers Bottom, WV:         My husband was employed by a UMWA represented mine for the       34 years he worked in the mining industry. He worked a 6 day       workweek. He turned down some very promising job offers       because we were always led to believe that after 20 years of       UMWA service, we would have family insurance for life. A       large part of the reason he stayed loyal to the mining       industry was because of the retirement pension and family       health insurance we would have upon his retirement.        He was injured on the job in 2013 and was unable to return       to work. We had the comfort of knowing that he would be able       to receive his pension and that the two of us would have no       worries about health insurance.        In April 2015, I was diagnosed with breast cancer that       spread to my lymph nodes. I had chemotherapy from May 2015 to       November 2015, followed by radiation that lasted until       February 2016. I was hospitalized three times during       treatment, had to undergo a lot of diagnostic testing, and a       blood transfusion. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my       treatment due to this rigorous and intense treatment damaging       my heart. I have to follow up with regular treatment by a       cardiologist and now have frequent testing to make sure the       cancer hasn't come back.        Another side effect I have from having had chemotherapy is       chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy that effects both my       hands and feet. My medications cost several hundred dollars a       month. I am 53 years old and unable to work due to all the       side effects from my having cancer. My medical bills and       medications have cost many thousands of dollars and I don't       have to worry about anything other than getting well, thanks       to the UMWA insurance we have.        Since my husband can no longer work and I too am unable to       work, our income has taken a downward turn. The security of       having this insurance means the world to us. We [are] neither       asking nor expecting nothing other than what we were       promised. Please, please pass this Senate Bill, not only for       the two of us, but for the many other UMWA retirees and       spouses that are also in the same situation.    We have countless letters that come in on a weekly basis, and it is  basically stories. The thing I would want to make sure that all my  colleagues know and all of America knows is that the miners provided  the energy that built the industrial might that we have--an industrial  revolution. They built the factories. They mined the coal and made the  steel to build the factories, and they built the guns and ships that  defended this country. They have given everything they have had, and  this was a promise by the U.S. Government in 1946.   Because of the bankruptcy laws that erupted and basically evolved  over the 1980s, they were left with nothing, and that is what they  have. They didn't take home in the paycheck extra money. They didn't  take home anything else except the promise and guarantee that they  would have their healthcare and the benefits of a pension.    The average pension for a miner retired is less than $600, and most  of those are for widows. This is something that we promised. This is  something we worked for, we are fighting for, and I am not going to  give up until this promise is fulfilled.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Prioritizing  Our Workers Act, which will make changes to the current bankruptcy  code, requiring companies going through bankruptcy proceedings to pay  unpaid vested benefits, like workers' pensions, before they pay out  other claims against them.   I firmly believe that no one should be denied their pension because  their employer goes bankrupt. Hard-working men and women across the  country go to work every day for years, paying into these pension plans  each paycheck with the expectation that one day they can retire and  provide for their families.   Companies offering pension plans made promises to their workers and  need to live up to those promises, no matter what else happens to that  company financially.   In West Virginia, we are far too familiar with coal and steel  companies leaving their workers out to dry in this way. This is  absolutely unacceptable. That is why I am introducing this bill, and I  look forward to my fellow Senators joining me to support and protect  pensions across this country.                                  ______                                         By Mr. UDALL (for himself and Mr. Wyden):   S. 1488. A bill to improve the integrity and safety of interstate  horseracing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.
