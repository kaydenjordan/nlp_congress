 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1754, the  Horseracing Integrity Act, and the really amazing, relentless work that  my colleagues, Paul Tonko and Mr. Barr, have exerted all session this  year, last year, the year before, to make this a reality.   Madam Speaker, compromise is often hard to find. And the number of  stakeholders that have been involved has made it even more complicated  but, finally, successful. This legislation is the result of that  compromise. The amendment includes such important improvements in  establishing safety, not only for the equine athletes, our horses, but  also for the jockeys.   Madam Speaker, you have heard a lot from both of the chief sponsors  on this legislation, but I want to say that this bill will help achieve  our overarching goal to protect the health and welfare of our  racehorses and jockeys while strengthening the integrity of the sport  itself, which is so important.  [[Page H4983]]    Madam Speaker, I want to emphasize something that Mr. Tonko was  talking about, because let's not forget why we are here. Racehorses in  the United States are injured at a much higher rate than the rest of  the horse-racing world, resulting in nearly 500 horses dying every  year.   One of the keys to stopping injuries and deaths is establishing  strong drug policies, training, and racing protocols and racetrack  standards. Standards like pre-race detection and appropriate treatment  for injuries. The stress and pressure generated by an 1,100-pound  animal sprinting down the track at, sometimes a rate of up to 40 miles  an hour, can cause minor injuries to become fatal breaks.   Madam Speaker, as a former horse owner myself, and my horse came from  a track not among the names that Mr. Barr listed--actually, he was  probably thrown off the track, he wasn't very good--and came to the  barn that I would go to. And I had the pleasure of having some years of  the rest of his life for him to be my horse--BJ Sullivan.   He would take me down the paths in the forest preserve and he also  helped me learn how to jump over fences, not too high, but pretty well.  And I think sometimes, until this piece of legislation, maybe he was  kind of lucky not to be one of the winners, and not to be one of the  ones who would be drugged and not protected. And as the stand-in  jockey, I was pretty safe on the back of BJ Sullivan, who was very  honest when it came to jumping over fences.   Madam Speaker, I am very, very proud today. Rather than treating the  underlying conditions, some racehorses are given pain medications to  ease their pain, and the pain medications mask the relatively minor  injuries that could actually become much more serious.   This legislation, as you heard in detail, I think is the kind of  legislation that is really going to enhance the industry and enhance  the safety of riders, of jockeys, as well as our horses.   Madam Speaker, I am so proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I  thank our lead sponsors.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding to  me. I rise in strong support of H.R. 8134, the Consumer Product Safety  Inspection Enhancement Act, a bill that I introduced with my friend and  colleague, Jeff Duncan.   E-commerce spending is surging right now during the COVID-19 pandemic  as Americans turn to online shopping for household essentials, personal  protective equipment, back-to-school supplies, and more.   However, e-commerce shipments entering the United States from  overseas face little scrutiny and often contain fake or dangerous  products. It is time that we empower the Consumer Product Safety  Commission to collect the data it needs to identify and block e- commerce shipments that can harm consumers and that don't offer the  protection and safety that they need.                                time  1330    This legislation would give the CPSC the data that it needs to  protect Americans from the flood of unsafe products that are coming in.   This legislation is a critical first step to restoring confidence in  e-commerce sites, but this bill is not a silver bullet. Much more needs  to happen.   Earlier this month, CNN reported that products sold on Amazon had  burst into flames, causing significant bodily harm and property damage  as well.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record that article.   [[Page H4985]]                               [From CNN, Sept. 10, 2020]     Dozens of Amazon's Own Products Have Been Reported as Dangerous-- Melting, Exploding or Even Bursting into Flames. Many are still on the                                   market                    (By Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken)         (CNN) When firefighters arrived at Austin Parra's home on       January 12, 2017, they could see smoke and the charred       remnants of an office chair outside.        Parra, then 20, had been transported to the hospital. His       mother explained to firefighters that her son's chair caught       on fire while he was sleeping, and he was burned as he       carried the flaming chair outside.        Anthony Dignoti, the Wethersfield, Connecticut, fire       marshal in charge of investigating the incident, could see       that the door and door frame were damaged by the fire as       well. He noticed bowls strewn about, which he wrote in his       official report had been filled with water in an attempt to       extinguish the fire.        The fire at Austin Parra's home originated with an       AmazonBasics USB cord, Fire Marshal Anthony Dignoti       determined. (Courtesy Wethersfield Fire Marshal's Office)        But most interesting to Dignoti was a white USB cord, Part       of the cord was hanging off the chair and still intact, but       the other side was stuck to the seat and had melted into a       bare wire, he said in his report and an interview with CNN.        Dignoti ultimately concluded that the fire originated with       the cord Parra was using to charge his cellphone. His report       stated the cord experienced a short circuit, and while it was       unclear why this happened, ``the heat produced by the cord       ignited the upholstery for the office chair.''        The cord had been branded with the name of the world's       largest online retailer: Amazon. It was sold by one of       Amazon's popular private label lines, AmazonBasics, which       offers budget-friendly products including consumer       electronics, household appliances, home goods and office       accessories.        Launched in 2009, AmazonBasics has grown to offer more than       5,000 products, according to the retailer. Its mission:       identifying everyday items that Amazon can create at a       similar or higher quality and lower price point when compared       to existing name brands--a strategy also employed by       companies such as Costco and Target.                                 Key findings         Using keywords including ``fire,'' ``dangerous'' and       ``burn,'' reporters identified more than 1,500 reviews about       AmazonBasics electronics and appliances posted by US       customers on Amazon.com from 2016 through early 2020 that       described safety-related issues.        More than 10 percent of the reviews identified by CNN       reported that products had caught fire--in some cases       describing how flames shot out of the devices.        Nearly 200 included reports of damage to homes or       belongings, including charred walls and fried cellphones.        A growing number of AmazonBasics products, which the       company promotes heavily on its site, have become bestsellers       since the line's inception, and many have ratings above four       stars, according to Marketplace Pulse research. In recent       months, the online retailer's sales have been soaring as       millions of Americans have been staying at home--and in many       cases working remotely--during the ongoing pandemic.        But consumers have raised serious safety concerns about       AmazonBasics items in complaints to government regulators and       in reviews posted on Amazon's own website. Since 2016, at       least 1,500 reviews, covering more than 70 items, have       described products exploding, catching on fire, smoking,       melting, causing electrical malfunctions or otherwise posing       risks, according to an analysis of AmazonBasics electronics       and appliances listed on its website.        The reviews identified represent a small fraction of the       overall purchases of the products, and fires caused by       consumer electronics are not unique to Amazon branded items.       User error can also be a factor, as can faulty or aging       wiring within a home or a defective device being used in       conjunction with the product.        But when well-made and used properly by consumers,       electronics like those sold under the AmazonBasics name       should rarely pose dangers, said electrical engineers       interviewed by CNN.        Dozens of AmazonBasics product are flagged as dangerous,       but many are still being sold. Within the more than 1,500       reviews, many consumers explicitly called out items as       potentially dangerous--using terms such as ``hazard'' or       ``fire'' or saying the product should be recalled. Around 30       items with three or more reviews like this remain for sale on       Amazon.com today. At least 11 other products that fit this       criteria were no longer for sale at the time of publication.       Some became unavailable after CNN began its reporting, and at       least four product pages were removed from the retailer's       site entirely--leaving behind dead URLs known by employees as       ``dog pages.'' Amazon confirmed that at least eight of these       products had been under investigation, but said the company       determined they all met its safety standards.        Customers have written in their reviews and said in       interviews that they trusted that AmazonBasics purchases       would be safe and well made since they were branded with       Amazon's name and frequently touted as ``Amazon's Choice.''       But even as complaints have mounted, the company has provided       little or no information to consumers or the public about how       it is handling allegations that some of its merchandise is       unsafe.        This review was written about an AmazonBasics car charger       that has multiple consumer safety complaints.        Amazon shoppers have recounted frightening malfunctions and       close calls in vivid detail: A surge protector turned into a       ``blowtorch,'' one father recalled--saying that flames shot       out of the device, which was near his baby's nursery. Phone       chargers were said to have burned peoples' hands and legs,       and exploding batteries allegedly sprayed chemicals in       someone's face. A USB cord burst into flames in a parked car       while a toddler was inside, according to one parent. A       charger in another car was reported as starting an electrical       fire on the freeway, allegedly burning the driver and a       jacket. Paper shredders turned on by themselves, according to       multiple consumers, and one reportedly blew up in a       ``fireball,'' burning someone's arm and singeing the hair       off. And a microwave suddenly caught on fire when an 8-year-      old went to heat up her macaroni and cheese cup as she had       done ``a zillion times,'' a mother claimed, saying she had to       take the appliance outside and spray it with a hose. Each of       these purchases were ``verified,'' meaning Amazon confirmed       that the customer who wrote the review actually purchased the       product on the site and didn't receive a ``deep discount,''       according to its website. Several were accompanied by photos       of the burned items.        More than 150 reviews about the AmazonBasics microwave       describe safety concerns including flames and smoke.        While the best way to determine why something malfunctioned       is to physically test it and take it apart, many customers       said they immediately threw out the defective devices or sent       them back to Amazon at the company's request.        CNN obtained two damaged AmazonBasics products from       customers: a microwave that a customer said caught fire and a       USB cord a user said overheated and melted. These were tested       by researchers at the failure analysis lab at the University       of Maryland's Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering       (CALCE) at CNN's request.        The USB cord was too burned for researchers to determine       what had gone wrong. The microwave testing found that the       design of the panel covering the heating device inside the       microwave could result in the machine catching on fire, and       determined that the way the panel was secured could allow       debris such as food or grease to collect behind it and       possibly ignite. As soon as the researchers turned it on, the       microwave began sparking and smoking, causing it to react as       if its user put foil or other metal inside. The testing was       cut short when the lab was closed due to Covid-19.        ``There's a risk in using this machine for sure, and it's a       safety risk because this clearly heated up to the extent a       fire could occur,'' said engineering professor Michael Pecht,       who is the founder of CALCE and has previously assisted in       government safety investigations. ``This is more than a       reliability problem, this is a potential safety problem.''        Amazon did not comment on whether any improvements had been       made to the microwave, but said it is confident the microwave       is safe to use and that it continues to ``meet or exceed''       all of the applicable certification requirements.        The retailer said ``safety is a top priority'' at the       company and that it takes a number of steps to ensure all       AmazonBasics products are safe and high quality, such as       selecting experienced manufacturers, monitoring customer       feedback and testing items to ensure they pass safety and       compliance standards both before and after they are       available. It also said AmazonBasics offers thousands of       products which combined have more than 1 million reviews, and       that concerns are thoroughly investigated and that the       company acts accordingly.        ``Not safe,'' one verified purchaser wrote in a review       about an AmazonBasics microwave, including a home video that       shows the device sparking and making loud popping noises.        ``The outcome of the investigation varies on a case by case       basis and may include removing the product from the store,       adjusting the design of the product, notifying customers to       stop using the product, or other appropriate action,'' a       company spokesperson said in a statement. ``We want customers       to shop with confidence and if ever a customer has a concern,       they can contact customer service and we will investigate.''        Amazon said there are a number of reasons an item may no       longer be available, but that customers will be notified if a       critical safety issue is identified. When asked how       frequently the company has done this, Amazon said it had       notified customers about an AmazonBasics product less than       five times. It did not specify whether it did this for any of       the items reviewed by CNN.                              `It's a red flag'         Amazon has already been under intense scrutiny for allowing       third party sellers with allegedly dangerous offerings to do       business on the site, and multiple court rulings have found       that the retailer can be held liable for defective items sold       in its third party marketplace. CNN's analysis focused on       products sold with Amazon's own name on them--a growing part       of the retailer's business.        The reviews come from people living all over the United       States and span five years, but they often call attention to       the very  [[Page H4986]]       same problems: The same panel within a microwave catching       fire, USB cords melting or burning despite no visible wear       and tear or overuse, and paint on outdoor patio heaters       lighting on fire. Consumers alleged items malfunctioned the       first time they plugged them in. Others said electronics were       not in use when they began malfunctioning.        In general, one or two reports of problems could be more       easily chalked up to user error or other external factors,       multiple electrical engineers said. But as the number of       reports about the same kinds of failures increases about the       same item, so does the likelihood that there is a defect in       the design or manufacturing.        Researchers at the CALCE lab compare a new AmazonBasics       microwave to one that had visible burn damage.        ``That would certainly lead to more suspicion that the       product is at fault,'' said Mark Horenstein, a professor at       Boston University's College of Engineering. ``It's a red       flag.'' Amazon said customer reviews are only one indication       of a potential issue, saying it looks at a number of other       factors such as sales history, returns and customer service       contacts when assessing potential problems. ``Using customer       reviews alone to conclude a product is unsafe or imply       there's a widespread issue is misleading,'' the company said       in a statement. Former Amazon employees said that even a few       reviews mentioning words like ``fire'' and ``hazard'' should       automatically prompt the retailer to take action. Amazon said       reviews are monitored and can trigger safety investigations,       but it declined to provide details about the specific       threshold needed for this to happen. The company said       products may be temporarily removed during such inquiries and       that in order to keep selling something, it must be       confirmed to be safe. It also said that if an       investigation uncovers a ``potential, non-isolated safety       issue,'' it takes appropriate measures to notify the       government and ``safely recall the product.'' This       AmazonBasics surge protector remains for sale despite       reviews about dangers and a report to the CPSC that it       ``made a loud popping noise, sparked, and the case was       opened by the force of the damage.'' Amazon said the       product is safe and that most reports involved customers       who plugged in multiple large electronics. Some reviews       identified by CNN said nothing was plugged into the       device, however.        Businesses are required by law to immediately report       ``potentially hazardous'' items to the federal Consumer       Product Safety Commission (CPSC) so the agency can determine       whether an official recall is necessary. Companies can also       initiate voluntary recalls in cooperation with the CPSC.       Concerns similar to those detailed in Amazon reviews have       been relayed to the CPSC in at least 10 reports that       specifically mention an AmazonBasics product. The complaints       cover at least eight different items and date back to 2012.        In the United States, Amazon publicly recalled two       AmazonBasics items in 2018 and 2019, after the company       received 53 reports in the US about power banks overheating       and 25 about versions of a space heater overheating, burning       or sparking. It said it proactively notified the CPSC of the       results of the company's own investigation and its intent to       recall the items. Beyond these two official recalls, the       company has never publicly acknowledged that AmazonBasics       products have any safety issues.        The CPSC said it was prohibited by law from discussing any       item that had not been recalled and that in general, the       agency determines if a recall is necessary based on a number       of factors, including ``the nature of the defect, the level       of hazard associated with the issue, and the pattern of       similar problems (seen).''        Customers reported being shocked or burned in at least 100       reviews on Amazon's website. Parra from the Connecticut       apartment fire said in a lawsuit that he suffered second-      degree burns and injuries to his throat from smoke       inhalation. Dignoti's report shows Parra spent around a day       in the hospital. Parra sued Amazon in 2019, and the case       settled. He and his attorney did not respond to interview       requests.        CNN used the information provided by the fire department to       determine that the type of cord Parra purchased had been       removed from Amazon's website. While it is unclear when the       cord was pulled, a version of the page captured by the       Wayback Machine, an internet archive, shows the product had       an average rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars. It shows the cord       was still available for purchase until at least June 2017,       and that there were warnings from other customers at least a       year before Parra's January 2017 fire.        The link for the phone cord used by Parra now leads to       nothing but a dead URL known internally at Amazon as a dog       page.        ``End of the cable melted and started smoking. Glad we       caught it before a fire,'' one verified purchaser wrote in       June 2016.        ``DO NOT BUY! FIRE HAZARD!'' another customer with a       verified purchase of the cord wrote in May 2016, attaching 10       photos of the melted and warped cord--saying it ruined an       expensive iPhone and that he considered himself lucky that a       fire hadn't ignited. ``These should be taken off the market       immediately!!!''        While fires caused by USB cords are uncommon, they are       possible, according to electrical engineers who said a range       of factors could be at play in situations like this--from       problems with whatever device the cord is plugged into to       defects within the cord itself.        The AmazonBasics lightning charger that this review was       written about became unavailable after CNN began its       reporting.        An industry non-profit, the USB Implementers Forum Inc,       said it docs not believe user error is a significant cause of       overheating USB cables. A cable that is substandard, whether       because of a design or manufacturing defect, can be dangerous       and lead to electric shock, overheating, sparks or fire, it       said. The group has certified a number of AmazonBasics cables       as meeting their standards, though it focuses on the       functionality of the cables and making sure their       specifications are in compliance--emphasizing that it is       ``not a replacement for industry best practices or any       applicable local, state or government statutes, rules or       regulations pertaining to safety.''        The group also said it conducted an internal review of       several cables CNN brought to its attention and found them to       be compliant. It does not certify proprietary lightning USB       cords used for Apple devices, however, such as Parra's cord.       Apple said it allows manufacturers to use its lightning       connectors in their products if those items are tested and       confirmed to meet high quality standards, and that the       company expects manufacturers to meet any applicable safety       standards.                 Have you purchased an AmazonBasics product?         Amazon meanwhile said it investigated the safety claims       about the kind of cord used by Parra and determined it met       the company's standards. ``If we determine that a product is       unsafe, we remove it from our stores and take all necessary       actions, which may include contacting regulators and       customers,'' it said, specifically in response to questions       about the cord used by Parra, which was removed from the       site.        The retailer did introduce a new version of the product,       however, saying it made updates to improve the customer       experience.                                 Losing trust         Matt Citro purchased his AmazonBasics surge protector to       protect his family from a fire. Instead, he said that in       January 2018, the surge protector itself caught fire. A       single phone charger was plugged into the device, but was not       being used at the time.        Sitting on the couch as his 9-month-old son slept in his       nursery nearby, Citro said he noticed flames coming out of       the surge protector--turning it into what resembled a       ``blowtorch.'' He told CNN that he quickly pulled the flaming       device from the wall. He wasn't injured but said he was left       with more than $1,000 of damage after the surge protector       burned a hole in the wall outlet and seared part of his wall.        Matt Citro says that he sent back his charred surge       protector so that it could be investigated by Amazon. He       never heard anything back, but did receive a payment to cover       damage to his home. (Courtesy Matt Citro)        He had never experienced any electrical issues in his home       before this, he said, and was convinced the AmazonBasics       surge protector was to blame.        ``DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! . . . If I wasn't home my       entire house would have burnt down from this cheap product,''       Citro wrote in a review. ``I'm extremely disappointed in       Amazon. We put a lot of faith in their products and to have       (one) almost burn down my home does not make me trust them.       This product has amazons name on it!''        Citro said he immediately contacted Amazon and told the       company what happened. At first, he said he was offered a       replacement or a refund. Not satisfied, he continued to call       customer service.        He said he finally got through to someone who connected him       with an insurance company, and he was ultimately paid $1,469,       according to a settlement document reviewed by CNN in which       Amazon denies any liability.        Amazon continued to sell the surge protector for nearly two       years after Citro posted his review, during which time more       reviews about similar situations and other concerns piled up.       More than 40 customers reported that the product was a fire       hazard, had caused damage to their home or belongings or       described other dangers.        These reviews represented around 1.7% of the roughly 2,600       US reviews posted about the $10.99 device as of late last       year, before Amazon removed it from the site. Several       included claims of flames and fires like Citro's. As a       comparison, a similar product made by a major consumer       electronics company and also sold on Amazon's site had six       reviews about possible safety concerns earlier this year,       representing .07% of its more than 8,000 reviews. And none of       the six mentioned actual fires. Amazon said its own analysis,       which added global reviews about the AmazonBasics surge       protector, found 1.1 % involved claims of overheating, fire       and other dangers.        One former AmazonBasics product manager, who asked to       remain anonymous because she still works in the industry,       said she was surprised to hear that such a high percentage of       reviews raised safety issues about an AmazonBasics item.       ``Once you get 40, oh my gosh, no, that would not be       acceptable in any shape, way or form,'' she said of the       reviews found by CNN, adding that a ratio of around .05%       would have been seen as more acceptable when she worked       there. But she defended her former employer, saying this was       just one product and that during her  [[Page H4987]]       time with the company, she believed the retailer was even       more vigilant than competitors in trying to react to safety       concerns.        More than 40 customers reported dangers involving the same       surge protector that Citro said burst into flames.        Weeks after CNN began reporting on the surge protector--      reaching out to customers and employees and ordering the same       item as part of the investigation--Amazon pulled it from its       site in December despite its high average rating of 4.4 stars       as of a month earlier. The company did not appear to provide       any notification to customers, including to the reporters who       purchased it. And it did not post any message on its site       about why it was taken down.        Amazon declined to comment on individual customers, and       would not say why the page was removed or whether Citro's       surge protector was tested. It did say an updated version of       the product had been released, but when asked for the link to       the updated version, the company said ``this product is       currently unavailable.''        Citro, who said he still shops at Amazon frequently, said       he sent his burned surge protector back for testing as the       company requested, but never heard anything about what its       investigation found.        ``I do wish this particular product was tested more       thoroughly,'' he said. ``A lot was on the line with my son's       bedroom in the next room.''        Just like Parra's phone cord, this specific kind of surge       protector has not been officially recalled.                              Behind the scenes         Three former Amazon employees said the vast majority of       AmazonBasics electronics are made in Asia. The company's list       of suppliers used for its various private label lines--      including AmazonBasics--shows that only around 10% are in the       United States and nearly half are located in China.        The retailer typically brings AmazonBasics items to market       in two ways, explained the former product manager. It either       goes straight to manufacturers that are able to meet its       standards and works closely with them to create items for the       AmazonBasics line. Or Amazon finds an existing product and       works with a third-party company, which may use an outside       manufacturer of its own, to brand the item with the       AmazonBasics name.        The reviews        More than 90% of the reviews CNN analyzed were about       ``verified purchases.''        Some 400 reviews posted on the site included photos or       videos as visual evidence of their claims.        Reviews came from around 70 product pages, which sometimes       included multiple variations of an item (such as USB cords in       different lengths or colors), which may have separate       identification numbers.        Reviews were excluded if a product had clearly been used       incorrectly--for example, those saying non-rechargeable       batteries were placed in a charger.        Most reviews did not include people's full names, but CNN       did reach more than 30 customers, and many provided       information such as evidence of their purchases, photos,       additional details and correspondence with Amazon.        She said both methods have been implemented for       electronics, but that in this second scenario, Amazon       typically has less insight into the manufacturing process and       is less involved in quality and safety testing. Amazon       disputed this, saying it verifies that products meet the same       safety standards regardless of the business model. The       company also said it most frequently works directly with       manufacturers.    Related: Fake and dangerous kids products are turning up for sale on                                   Amazon         Another former employee who was involved with AmazonBasics       in its earlier years and asked to remain anonymous because of       a confidentiality agreement, said employees on the       AmazonBasics team would randomly order items to inspect and       stay on top of reviews to make sure red flags were being       caught. ``We didn't have a lot of problems in my time but       were much smaller than they are now so it was easy to keep       things under control,'' the former employee said.        Former Amazon manager Rachel Greer, who left the company in       2015, said that when she worked in compliance at the company,       she believed AmazonBasics products were closely monitored       from conception to the years following their launch, saying       there was extensive testing done. She said safety issues were       rare, but when they occurred, they were caught quickly and       addressed as soon as possible. ``If someone complained on a       review, we took it very seriously,'' she said.        This required staying on top of manufacturers and making       sure corners weren't cut, she and the AmazonBasics product       manager both said. In the case of USB cords, for example,       Greer described how she made sure there was frequent testing       of the cords to ensure that manufacturers hadn't begun to       swap in thinner wiring which could be more likely to cause       cords to overheat.        A customer said this AmazonBasics retractable USB cord       began melting only a few months after he purchased it. ``Had       my wife not heard it crackling it could have started a       fire,'' he wrote in a review.        ``When you're in charge of compliance for something that       has the Amazon brand on it, I didn't think it should be       something we're messing around with,'' Greer said. ``When       you're outsourcing production there's a lot of things that       can go wrong.''        When she left Amazon, she said she was growing concerned       that a drive to increase sales would overshadow a focus on       safety as the number of AmazonBasics offerings continued to       rise. Prior to her departure, she would increasingly disagree       with product managers, who she said pushed to get items into       the pipeline faster and more cheaply. Performance evaluations       reviewed by reporters backed up the idea that Greer had       clashed with colleagues but also described her as ``an       evangelist for product safety,'' saying ``she is passionate       about keeping customers safe.''        Greer now works as a consultant to third-party sellers, and       said she wasn't surprised to hear that customers were       complaining of alleged dangers. She said that when she worked       for Amazon, she was never aware of anything close to the       number or level of seriousness of the reviews identified by       CNN, and questioned whether testing was still as rigorous as       it had been in the past.        ``If this had happened on a seller product, the second       complaint of fire it would have been taken down,'' she said,       while scanning through some of the more than 150 reviews       about serious problems with a voice-activated AmazonBasics       microwave--the same product tested by CALCE.        Greer said that if she was still at the company and had       seen so many reports of fire about a single item, she likely       would have reported the microwave to the CPSC and worked with       the business teams to enact a voluntary recall by the       company.        Since the microwave's release in the fall of 2018, its       product page has been flooded with reports from consumers       about problems including flames, smoke and sparks. These       kinds of reviews made up roughly 5% of the AmazonBasics       microwave's more than 3,000 reviews as of February, when       CNN's final analysis was conducted. Another roughly 1,000       reviews have been posted since then, with fires being       reported as recently as September. A microwave that has been       reviewed less frequently but is the same size and wattage had       only 10 reviews describing similar safety issues--amounting       to around .7% of its roughly 1,350 reviews on Amazon.        Research scientists use x-ray CT scanning to test       AmazonBasics retractable charging cords and microwave parts.        While the retailer did not provide unit sales, Amazon said       that as the best-selling microwave on the site, it may have a       higher number of sales and reviews, which could result in       more mentioning possible concerns.        The company disputed Greer's comments, saying safety       testing had not become any less rigorous and that it was not       aware of any manufacturers using thinner cables ``than they       were directed to use.'' It said safety testing is handled by       reputable third-party labs with global facilities, including       in China and that her statements about the microwave were       speculative since she was not part of the team that worked on       this item and was not involved in the testing of the device.       Amazon also said it proactively sends safety-related customer       reports to the CPSC and noted the agency has not issued any       consumer warnings about the AmazonBasics microwave.                                Still for sale         Amazon declined to provide details about why certain       products were investigated and removed from its site, while       others with repeated complaints about the same hazards are       still available to purchase today.        Leeona Smail said her AmazonBasics battery charger began to       melt and smoke.        New mom Leeona Smail posted her review about an       AmazonBasics battery charger late last year. When CNN reached       her, she recounted how she and her husband were forced to       evacuate their home in the middle of the night when they       detected the unmistakable smell of something burning. They       gathered their dogs, cats and 4-month-old baby by their front       porch, called 911 and waited for help to arrive.        It wasn't until after the firefighters left that the Smails       said they found what they believed was the culprit: an       AmazonBasics battery charger. They had used the device for       several years to charge batteries. But this time, Smail said,       after unplugging it from the wall and placing it in a box on       their coffee table, it began to melt and smoke. When the fire       chief returned the next day to check on them, she said, he       was amazed to see the source of the smell.        A Vandergrift, Pennsylvania fire chief confirmed that his       team was dispatched to investigate ``a smoke odor and light       haze'' at the Smail home. He said they ultimately learned       that a battery charger ``overheated and melted,'' and said it       was unclear whether it would have caused the house to catch       fire if it hadn't been found.        Other reviews about the same battery charger have described       similar concerns. It is still available for sale.        Smail posted a photo of the burned device along with her       review before throwing it away. Amazon eventually gave her a       refund--though she said she only received a partial one       because the warranty window had passed.        Credits        At least 21 other reviews about the same battery charger,       which had around 2,000 total reviews at the time of CNN's       analysis, also said the device had overheated, melted or       burned. Three described the same situation that Smail       reported: the charger had not even been plugged in and had no       batteries in it at the time.  [[Page H4988]]         The item was still for sale on Amazon at the time of       publication.        The company said an investigation confirmed the product was       safe, and that there were no broader design or safety       concerns. But when asked whether it tested any of the actual       chargers customers had flagged, and if so, what those tests       had found, Amazon said it did not have ``information to       share.''     In July, I introduced the INFORM Consumers Act with  Congresswoman Kathy Castor, which would require platforms such as  Amazon to verify third-party sellers. It is my sincere hope that this  body can move, first, on the legislation that we are addressing today  and, finally, on legislation that would protect consumers in a deeper  way.   I thank Representative Duncan, my friend and colleague, for  introducing this legislation with me, this important consumer safety  legislation. I would also like to take a moment to recognize both  majority and minority committee staff who worked hard on this and each  of the other bills that are before us today that moved through the  subcommittee that I have the privilege of chairing: Lisa Goldman, Anna  Yu, Daniel Greene, Chloe Rodriguez, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Tim Kurth, and  Bijan Koohmaraie.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, I also would like to thank the authors  of this legislation, Representatives McNerney, Burgess, Soto, Matsui,  and Davidson.   This legislation would direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to establish a pilot program that uses artificial intelligence  technology to protect consumers from unsafe products.                                time  1345    CPSC would have to use AI technology to track trends related to  injuries from consumer products, monitor the sale of recalled products,  or identify products prohibited from being imported into the United  States. In carrying out the pilot program, the agency would have to  consult with AI experts, manufacturers, and consumer product safety  organizations.   CPSC would have to report to Congress on the extent to which AI  technologies improved the agency's work after the pilot program has  ended. This is exactly the right approach and a good complement to all  the consumer protection bills that we are moving today.   The measure would also direct the Commerce Department to conduct, in  consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and other relevant  agencies a study on the commercialization and use of blockchain  technology that was added to this bill. It would direct the FTC to  report on deceptive practices related to digital tokens and provide  recommendations to Congress on improving Federal protection of  consumers from blockchain-related fraud.   Again, I want to thank Chairman Pallone and the sponsors of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking  Member Walden for your leadership, and of course, to the leadership of  my ranking member on the Subcommittee of Consumer Protection and  Commerce, Representative Rodgers, for her innovative work on the  American COMPETE Act. I am so proud to support that, and I urge all of  my colleagues, along with Representative Rodgers and, from the  Democratic side, Mr. Rush, as a cosponsor of that legislation.   Madam Speaker, I think all of us would agree with the importance, and  I love the phrase about winning the future. I think this legislation  does lay a kind of blueprint of the direction that we can go in and the  kinds of technologies that are really at hand if we put our energy and  our minds to making it happen. I thank you very much.   Madam Speaker, I also just want to take this opportunity to say a  special thank you at this moment and recognize the service of the  ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Walden.   There are so many things that you can now attribute your service to,  the legislation that has passed, but I think even more than that, I  just wanted to thank you for the kind of tone that you have set, both  as the chairman and as the ranking member of the committee.   I think we can be so proud of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We  have passed so many bills. We really are a legislative powerhouse. But  we have also done it with the kind of integrity that I think shines so  well on the Congress of the United States.   I just want to acknowledge what a great colleague he has been. I  consider him a friend, and I wish him absolutely the best of luck. He  will definitely be missed. I thank him so much.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to recognize Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member Rodgers for the part that she has  played and the partnership that I believe we have had. Of course, we  have sometimes wanted to move at a different pace or had different  ideas, but again, I just want to thank the gentlewoman for the tone  that she helped set at our hearings and in our efforts to pass  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Ranking Member Rodgers on her hard work  to move this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, although I was unable to join in  person tonight, I want to lend my voice to the chorus of colleagues  assembling to honor John Shimkus' service in Congress. I thank John for  his friendship, and commitment to public service. I wish him nothing  but health and happiness for himself and his family during his upcoming  retirement from Congress.   John came to Washington one term before I did. We had offices next to  each other on the fifth floor of the Cannon Building. As most members  and staff know, most of the elevators in Cannon do not go to the fifth  floor, making those offices not the most desirable real estate. But  John and I not only stayed there as Freshman members, but we stayed a  few terms, enjoying the larger offices and the somewhat quieter halls.  John and I, as well as our staff, got along well, especially Cathy  Hurwit, my long time Chief of Staff and Craig Roberts, John's then and  current Chief.   Though there were issues on which John and I disagreed, we had the  opportunity to work closely together on issues affecting our state. The  Illinois Delegation had a tradition of monthly bipartisan lunches. The  agendas focused on issues specific to Illinois. Often we would agree to  support legislation, funding or projects that could help all our  constituents and benefit our state. Illinois was one of the few  delegations that was able to work so smoothly together, and John was a  leader in that effort.   John and I both earned positions on the prestigious Energy and  Commerce Committee. I saw up close how passionately John fought for his  beliefs and constituents. His tone was always positive, even as he  disagreed with other members. I have enjoyed serving with him on the  Committee all these years.   John Shimkus is well liked on both sides of the aisle. Why? Because  John Shimkus is a kind man, a smart man, and a gentleman. We have been  able to debate without spite, collaborate, and sometimes find common  ground. This is how collegiality and compromise work, and I wish we  could bottle it and send it around the halls of Congress.   John will be missed here. I hope he enjoys every extra moment he's  earned with Karen, David, Joshua, and Daniel.                            ____________________
