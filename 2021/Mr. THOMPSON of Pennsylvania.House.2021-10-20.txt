 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize this  week as National Forest Products Week.   In Pennsylvania, forest products have long been an essential industry  by producing logs, lumber, furniture, paper, and more. These are  products and materials that Americans nationwide use each and every  day.   The forest products industry employs roughly 64,000 Pennsylvanians  and generates $36 billion in total economic impact statewide.   I am proud to represent Pennsylvania's only national forest, the  Allegheny National Forest. This incredible forest, established in 1923,  spans more than half a million acres in the northern portion of my  district, across Forest, Elk, McKean, and Warren Counties.   Whether it is forestry, energy production, timber harvesting, or an  abundance of outdoor activities, Allegheny National Forest has it all.   For generations, the ANF has brought economic prosperity to our  region, and it is essential that we are able to contribute to the  longevity and  [[Page H5681]]  sustainability of the Allegheny National Forest.   In my role as Republican leader on the House Agriculture Committee, I  am dedicated to putting forth policies that promote natural solutions  to keep our forests healthy for generations to come.   These policies include working closely with the Forest Service, a  division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to manage our forests,  foster healthier lands, and allow this economic engine to thrive.   By supporting the Forest Service and encouraging active stewardship,  we can support healthy forests and rural communities for generations to  come.   Currently, we have two bills focused on improving our forest  management: the RESTORE Act from Doug LaMalfa from California and the  FIRE Act from Dusty Johnson from South Dakota. These bills aim to  improve and expedite forest management and restoration projects for  healthier and more resilient forests.   Of course, we cannot talk about forest products without discussing  the environmental benefits of a well-managed forest and forest  productivity. We know the best solutions are natural solutions, not  burdensome regulations or carbon taxes, but active innovation.   Landowners and foresters are among the strongest environmental  advocates in our country. I recognize their efforts and continue to  promote forest health by empowering the original stewards of our land.   According to the Forest Service, forests are sequestering 14 percent  of all U.S. carbon emissions. That number could nearly double with  policies that increase forest management, forest health, and forest  production.   Active management, including timbering, holds the greatest potential  for sequestering carbon and storing it indefinitely in forest products.   To help encourage new markets for forest products and forest health,  I was proud to help lead the Timber Innovation Act. This bipartisan  legislation, which was included in the 2018 farm bill, directly  supports the development of cross-laminated timber and tall wood  building construction.   Mr. Speaker, Forest Products Week is more than forestry or timber  harvesting. It is a time to focus on the great resources our forests  provide. From a natural habitat for wildlife, to an abundance of  outdoor recreational activities, to carbon sequestration, to a strong  rural economy, our forests, big and small, must continue to be utilized  for our needs today and for our future generations.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, last week, we celebrated  National Farmer's Day. On October 12, we recognized farmers past and  present for their hard work in providing our Nation and the world with  food, fiber, and energy.   It is a day to thank those who work by acres not by hours. Did you  know that only 2 percent of the population feed and sustain the other  98 percent?   On National Farmer's Day, we can pay tribute to the men, women, and  families who put food in the grocery stores and on our kitchen tables.   In 2020, agriculture and related industries provided more than 10  percent of U.S. employment. While National Farmer's Day has already  passed, it is never too late to show your support or to thank a farmer.  Consider visiting a local farmers market where you can buy directly  from local farmers or spend a fall afternoon with the family at a pick- your-own farm where you can get the freshest fall apples and pumpkins.   Madam Speaker, it is important for us to thank our farmers and  recognize their hard work not just on National Farmer's Day, but all  year round.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank my  good friend and colleague for organizing and leading this leadership  hour.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the Biden administration's  energy crisis. This is a crisis that was created by the Biden  administration.   Last week, the price of gas reached a 7-year high. In fact, in my  home district, Pennsylvania-15, we are now paying anywhere from $3.49  to $3.67 a gallon--well over the price any American should have to pay.   In 2019 and 2020, the United States was a net total energy exporter.  This means for the first time since the 1950s we were exporting more  energy than importing. We were energy independent, and we saw the many  benefits across all sectors of United States manufacturing, production,  and consumption. For example, in 2020, the average gasoline price in  the United States was $2.17 per gallon.   I am proud to represent a district and come from a State that plays  such a large role in domestic energy production. In fact, Pennsylvania  is the second largest producer of natural gas and the third largest net  supplier of energy to other States. Without the energy production of my  district and others in rural America, our cities would wake up cold, in  the dark, and hungry. But President Biden chose to stifle American  energy production, issuing executive order after executive order  reducing and even pausing our own access to oil and natural gas.   In addition, the Biden administration has reached out to OPEC-Plus  begging them to produce more oil which--let's not forget--is less  environmentally friendly, less humane, and less regulated than United  States sources.   Last week, I joined my colleagues in a letter to this administration  opposing the pleas, the begging to OPEC-Plus, and encouraging the use  of American produced energy to meet our current needs. We asked the  administration to reverse the crushing executive orders impeding our  own energy production and to work with Congress on issues affecting  American energy security and supply. We know the answer to this self- imposed crisis: we must lift the limitations on our own energy supply.   By repealing these executive orders and encouraging American  producers to harness our abundance of natural resources, we can meet  our energy needs and we can ensure Americans and our allies have access  to affordable, reliable, and exportable energy produced in the United  States.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman, once again, for his  leadership.
