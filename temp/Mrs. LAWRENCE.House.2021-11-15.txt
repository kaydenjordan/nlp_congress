 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my CBC colleague, my  CBC chair, an amazing leader for our country, Joyce Beatty, for leading  this Special Hour. I also want to thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson  Lee, my colleague and mentor. She is just amazing.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Build Back Better.  We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a transformational  change for women, for families, and for communities of color.   Abigail Adams wrote a strong letter to her husband, John Adams,  ``Remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than  your ancestors.''   Today, I stand on the floor so proud and blessed to say that we have  President Biden and Vice President Harris, who are laser-focused on  helping women and families in Michigan and across the country.   We are talking about remembering women and women of color. From  affordable childcare, eldercare, expanding the child tax credit, and  providing universal pre-K, this agenda lifts women out of poverty and  educates our children while lowering costs.   I want to be very clear as we stand here today as the Congressional  Black Caucus, Black women in America carry the highest amount of  student debt in America. So when we talk about Pell grants, this has a  direct impact for Black women in America. When we talk about childcare  and eldercare, women are the predominant workforce in eldercare and  childcare, and they are disrespected with one of the lowest salaries  for employment in the country.   Let's talk about expanding the child tax credit. We know that for  single women heads of households and families who are struggling to  work and put their children in safe and affordable childcare, this is  transformational.   Madam Speaker, I had a father text me. We were on a Zoom townhall on  this issue of childcare. He said: Congresswoman, I pay more for  childcare than I do for the mortgage of my home.                                time  1945    This is transformational. When we talk about build back better, we  are not talking about going back to a time in history. We are talking  about being transformational and visionary and planning and plotting a  path to success for all Americans. We know it is women--we saw this  very clearly during the pandemic--who are bearing the brunt of all of  these social challenges and Black women being in the top of that group  bearing the brunt of this pandemic.   It is Black and Brown women who disproportionately make up our  childcare workers, and, again, I emphasize making poverty level wages.  We can't turn a blind eye to this. The Black Caucus will not be quiet.  The Women's Caucus will not be quiet. We know that when we lift women-- when we lift Black women--out of poverty, we are changing the economic  structure in America. There are women who work two jobs--one to pay for  childcare and one to pay for the mortgage, food, and shelter. I want  you to know, Madam Speaker, that the Build Back Better plan builds back  better for women and families, and it is time to get it done.   I am so proud today to sit outside and watch the President sign into  law the largest investment in our infrastructure to fix roads. For me,  the priority is fixing the water infrastructure in America. A pothole  is an inconvenience, but we need water to drink to stay alive and for  human life.   We know we have kicked this can down the road. We have had so many  infrastructure weeks. But now history will say that Joe Biden led the  way with this Congress and this Senate to start investing in our  infrastructure. We are going to get the job done. We are really going  to build back better.
