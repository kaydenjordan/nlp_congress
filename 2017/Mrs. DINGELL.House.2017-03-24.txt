 Mr. Speaker, today, the House will vote on a bill that  will take us back in our Nation's history. My family has worked for  decades for affordable quality health care for every American. It took  a long time to achieve the progress we have made today.   We began with Social Security, then we created Medicare, developed  the National Institutes of Health, the children's healthcare program,  and many other efforts that have helped every single one of our  communities across this country.   Hearing after hearing, amendment after amendment, the Affordable Care  Act was eventually developed. Coverage was expanded. Costs were  lowered. Certainty was brought to uncertainty.   Let me remind you that before the Affordable Care Act, many had to  decide between bankruptcy and death. Children hit lifetime caps. Cancer  and being a woman were preexisting conditions where it costs too much  money for premiums, or you couldn't get them at all.   Millions now have coverage who didn't, lifesaving screenings,  preventative care, and, today, we are talking about taking it back by  eliminating essential services. Please vote ``no'' for America's heart  and soul.
