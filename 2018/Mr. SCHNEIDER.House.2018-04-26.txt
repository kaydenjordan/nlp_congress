 Mr. Speaker, in 2016, more than 63,000 people died  from drug overdose, more than 30,000 of these from opioids. We also  know that 80 percent of heroin users started with prescription opioids.  Reducing opioid-related deaths will take a broad, multifaceted effort,  and everyone has a role to play, including physicians.   In congressional hearings and community conversations, I constantly  hear that enhancing continuing education for prescribers on the risks  associated with opioid medication and indications and treatment of  addictive behaviors can help reduce dependence and abuse of these  drugs.   This week, I was proud to partner with Congresswoman Susan Brooks of  Indiana to introduce the bipartisan ADAPT Act. Our bill would help  ensure prescribers have continuing medical education on safe  prescribing, opioid risks, pain management alternatives, early  detection of drug abuse, and treatment options for patients suffering  from addiction.   We know more about opioid addiction today than we did 20 years ago.  With ongoing research, we will continue to gain new insights and  understanding. We need our doctors to be equipped with the latest tools  and best practices when treating patients.   I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this effort to equip  those on the front lines of the opioid crisis with the latest and best  training to help our communities.
