 Madam Speaker, July 16 marked the turning point for  America.  [[Page H6927]]    For the first time in our history, anytime, anywhere in America, you  can call 988 for immediate help during a mental health crisis.   But to truly meet this moment and carry forward the full potential of  988, we need to do more.   Right now, America's default for people who need immediate help when  experiencing a mental health crisis is to call 911, and the default  treatment facilities are jails and emergency rooms.   Time and time again, we have seen repeating tragedies of police  officers killing individuals during a mental health emergency. The fact  is, we need to stop criminalizing mental illness and get people the  crisis help that they need.   To truly fulfill the promise of 988, we must make sure anyone who  dials 988 will have someone to call, someone to come if they need help,  and somewhere to go for compassionate continuous care.                            ____________________
