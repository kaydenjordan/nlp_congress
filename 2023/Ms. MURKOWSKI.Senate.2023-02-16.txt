 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor for a few  moments this afternoon to recognize a woman of great distinction, a  woman of valor, a woman by the name of Elizabeth Peratrovich, who  championed civil rights for all Alaskans.   February 16, in Alaska, is a significant day. It is a day that the  State of Alaska recognizes and observes Elizabeth Peratrovich Day. We  have designated this day as early as 1988, but it is a time for us, as  Alaskans, to reflect on the contributions of a pretty extraordinary  Native woman, a Tlingit woman.   So I think it is important, and I have had an opportunity over the  years to speak about Elizabeth Peratrovich. Senator Sullivan and I  advanced a resolution recognizing Elizabeth Peratrovich's contributions  when it comes to civil rights, and I think it is always important and  timely to pay attention, to reflect on the legacies of those who have  really worked to advance a more inclusive society and a more  representative democracy.   Elizabeth Peratrovich carried the Tlingit name Kaaxgal.aat. I am  attempting to do that well but certainly with respect to honor her  name. She was of the Lukaax.adi clan. She was born on Independence Day.  I think that is pretty fitting--born on Independence Day in Petersburg,  AK, in 1911.   It was just right after that, right after the period that Elizabeth  was born in Petersburg, that a group of Native people from across  Southeast Alaska formed an organization called the Alaska Native  Brotherhood, ANB. Two years later, the Alaska Native Sisterhood was  formed, ANS. These are considered the oldest indigenous civil rights  organizations in the world, coming out of Southeastern Alaska. ANB and  ANS sought to advance equal opportunities for education, employment,  housing; and they fought to secure Native civil rights.   So Elizabeth Peratrovich and her husband Roy became active in ANB and  ANS in the forties. They moved to Juneau, our State's capital, in 1941.  And their personal accounts of the discrimination that they encountered  in Juneau, as Alaska Natives--you read the accounts, you read the  stories, and it truly parallels the Jim Crow practices of the South.   But rather than be diminished, rather than be deterred, Elizabeth and  Roy Peratrovich were advocates, advocates against the adversity that  they saw in their own communities. And it was through their work with  ANB and ANS that they began advocating for an anti-discrimination bill  in the territorial legislature.   And they pointed out the simple fact that Alaska Natives were paying  taxes for a public school system, the same public school system that  excluded their very own children. They pointed out that Alaska Native  men were fighting in World War II and then, when they returned from the  war, those Alaska Native veterans were denied rights that others  enjoyed.   These very real, very immediate confrontations with discrimination  drove their pursuit of equal rights for people all across the State of  Alaska. So they worked on this anti-discrimination bill that was  advancing through the legislature. It took a period of time. It was  reintroduced in 1945, and in 1945 the measure passed the Alaska State  House and moved on to the State senate.   And the debate on the senate floor was apparently quite animated and  vocal throughout, but there was a territorial senator who denounced the  efforts to desegregate. And he argued, and the words he quoted are ones  that, as Alaskans, we see. The story told a lot. He said:         Who are these people, barely out of savagery, who want to       associate with us whites, with 5,000 years of recorded       civilization behind us?    That is what he said on the senate floor.   At the end of the floor debate, at that time, it was not unusual to  open up for comments from those who might be part of the public. I  served in the Alaska State Legislature, and we have galleries that sit  directly behind the chambers that are open to the chambers. And  Elizabeth Peratrovich was sitting in the gallery listening to this  extended and very offensive debate, quite honestly. But she rose, and  she said:         I would not have expected that I, who am barely out of       savagery, would have to remind the gentlemen with 5,000 years       of recorded civilization behind them of our Bill of Rights.    She stood gracefully. She stood firmly. She refuted clearly. And when  asked if she thought that the bill would eliminate discrimination--so,  again, a pretty interesting exchange between members of the senate and  a member of the public in the gallery--and not just a member of the  public in the gallery but a Native woman speaking up and challenging,  forcefully and calmly but with a determination and a resolve.   And when she was asked if she thought the bill would eliminate  discrimination, she replied:         Do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent those       crimes? No laws will eliminate crimes, but at least you as       legislators can assert to the world that you recognize the       evil of the present situation and speak your intent to help       us overcome discrimination.    A pretty powerful reminder.   And there was a long period of silence after her remarks, and then a  wave of applause went through the gallery and through the senate floor,  including from some who had previously opposed the bill. Alaska's  Governor at the time, Ernest Gruening, was the one to sign the anti- discrimination law, the Nation's first anti-discrimination law. He  signed it into law on February 16, 1945. This was almost two decades  before the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. It is pretty significant  when you think about the contributions of this woman, Elizabeth  Peratrovich, her husband Roy Peratrovich, and other Alaska Native  leaders, at a time when discrimination was rampant throughout our  country, that they had the courage and the strength and the  determination to stand up for what is right.    She is an inspiration because she set the example that, when you see  injustice, you speak out, you take action. And she also provided a  great example for why we need to listen to the perspective of all  voices, especially--especially--those who have been left out or were  left behind.   Elizabeth Peratrovich is, as I mentioned, recognized in Alaska on  this day. She has also been recognized nationally. In 2020, the U.S.  Mint released these $1 coins commemorating Elizabeth Peratrovich, and  2020 was the 75th anniversary of when the anti-discrimination law of  1945 became law in our State.   On the one side of the coin, it features the portrait of Elizabeth,  the name of the legislation that she advocated for, and the symbol of  the Tlingit Raven moiety, of which she was a member. So it is, indeed,  a significant reminder to each of us, Alaskan and non-Alaskan.   I think Elizabeth Peratrovich Day is also a timely reminder for those  of us who serve here in the Senate. It may not be easy to take on some  of these complicated issues, especially when partisanship is pulling  Members back to their corners, but we know we can make good progress.  We have done it. We certainly did it with the Violence Against Women  reauthorization. We need to follow a process that allows us to get  something done as opposed to simply sending messages.   So as Alaska celebrates Elizabeth Peratrovich Day, I would hope the  Senate would look to her legacy, her example as an inspiration, as we  seek unity, as we follow her example of treating fellow citizens with  respect.   I yield the floor.
