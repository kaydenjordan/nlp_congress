 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the compromise appropriations  package that includes major wins for our national security and our  economic success. In fact, this move tonight will authorize seven  different appropriation bills that fund critical agencies and programs  within our government.   Now, this is not the bill that I would have written, and this is  probably not the bill that any of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle would have written, but we have all finally found a  compromise that Congress can pass and the President has indicated he  will sign into law.                                time  2030    This is not a loss for the President, but a win for the Department of  Homeland Security, and a significant step in the right direction for  border security.   Democrats called for no wall funding. Today we will approve $1.4  billion for new barriers. Democrats called for pro-abortion policies,  but today, we will approve and maintain multiple pro-life protections.   Democrats called for less ICE detention beds. Today we will be  approving funding for an estimated 45,000 beds and an additional $750  million for 13,000 beds, if needed.   We increased ICE funding by $500 million; increased CBP by almost $1  billion; and fund the first Coast Guard icebreaker in over 40 years.   This bill strengthens our national security and brings us one step  closer to bringing our southern border under operational control.   This bill also includes many priorities that are of significant  importance to northeast Florida. There is $4 billion in additional  funding to help FEMA respond to national disasters like Hurricane  Michael and Hurricane Florence.   There is $468 million to help local communities combat opioid  trafficking, which has ravaged parts of northeast Florida.   On the first anniversary of 17 lives murdered in Parkland, Florida, I  am proud to vote in support of $100 million in grants authorized under  my STOP School Violence Act which was signed into law last year. Since  the passage of this bill, the STOP School Violence Act has yielded over  $175 million in grants to help protect schools across the United  States.   I understand this is not a perfect bill before us today, but we  cannot afford another shutdown that puts almost 1 million people out of  work. We cannot afford another CR that kicks the can down the road,  causing uncertainty and increasing the cost of government.   Let's end this stalemate, build the wall, and secure our southern  border. I congratulate the committee, and I urge my colleagues to  support this compromise package and send it to the President.
