 Mr. President, I want to congratulate the North Dakota  [[Page S149]]  Senators, my colleagues, on the great job with their football team.   ``Go Bison!''   Well done, North Dakota.    Here is a little bit of what this article says:         [President Biden] has assailed Georgia's new voting laws as       an atrocity akin to ``Jim Crow in the 21st century. . . . But       even once the GOP-passed measure [in Georgia] takes effect,       Georgia citizens will still have far more opportunities to       vote before Election Day than their counterparts in the       president's home state.    That is The Atlantic--not known as a Republican magazine or anything.   The Atlantic article goes on to say:         Delaware isn't an anomaly among Democratic strongholds, and       its example presents the president's party with an       uncomfortable reminder: Although Democrats like to call out       Republicans for trying to suppress voting, the states [the       Democrats] control in the Northeast makes casting a ballot       more difficult than anywhere else.    Than anywhere else.   Here is the point I am making. I am not trying to say that every  other State should be like Alaska, that we need to federalize elections  so every State has the same voting rights issues. I am proud of where  my State is, and I am certainly not going to let any smug argument on  the other side somehow accuse my Republican State of Jim Crow 2.0. Meet  the standards in my State before you make those arguments.   But the point is, we are not all going to be the same. I have a State  that is one-fifth the size of the lower 48. We have very unique voting  issues. And the Founding Fathers strongly believed that election laws,  for that reason, should be crafted State by State.   This is in the Constitution:         The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for       Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each       State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any       time by Law make or alter such Regulations.    Yes, this Congress may make laws and regulations, but a wholesale  Federal takeover of every State's elections law is not what the  Constitution contemplated, and it is not what would be good for each  citizen of each State in our country.   My invitation to the President and other Members who are  fundamentally demanding that we fundamentally alter this body by  getting rid of the filibuster: Save your smug Jim Crow 2.0 insults. Go  back to your own States. Undertake voter rights legislation is as  expansive as my State. Take care of your own States first before you  come here and tell us that you need to fundamentally reorder this body  and this  [[Page S152]]  country by getting rid of the filibuster--an issue that almost  everybody agreed on just a few years ago was not a good idea for the  Senate or for America.   I yield the floor.
