 Mr. President, today the Senate will continue to process  the National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA. I believe we have had  a really good process so far, and I hope this bipartisan work can get  us through to the finish as soon as possible.   We made good progress on amendments last night. It took a while, but  we have voted on 19 amendments to the NDAA and have at least 8 more  amendment votes lined up for today. We have a lot of votes to get  through, so I urge Senators--I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle--to be cooperative, to remain in the Senate Chamber as the series  of votes progresses through the afternoon so we can keep the process  moving.    Last night, we ran a hotline that includes a few additional votes and  a managers' package of 48 amendments--23 from Democrats, 23 from  Republicans, and 2 bipartisan. Each side of the aisle has amendments  they really want in that managers' package and a good number of them  were bipartisan. We have had an open and constructive amendment process  for the NDAA, with both sides--both sides--working together in good  faith. This is exactly how the process for the NDAA should look:  bipartisan, cooperative.   I want to thank all of my colleagues, particularly Senators Reed and  Wicker, for their good work.   I am also proud of our first managers' package that had 51  amendments--21 from Republicans, 21 from Democrats, and 9 bipartisan.  And some of the biggest accomplishments in this bill, I am proud to  say, are broadly bipartisan, like progress on our efforts to outcompete  the Chinese Government.   As I have been saying for weeks, passing the NDAA is a chance to show  the American people how the Senate can productively work.   Another really important thing that is in this bill is the FEND Off  Fentanyl Act, which will help give the administration tools it needs,  including emergency powers, to stop the precursor  [[Page S3714]]  drugs from flowing out of China--the Chinese Government has done  virtually nothing to help us thus far--going to Mexico, being made into  fentanyl, and then being shipped to the United States to kill our  children. Over 100,000 people have died of fentanyl last year.   So as I have been saying for weeks, the NDAA is a chance to show the  American people the Senate can work productively on significant things  they care about as well as on national security matters, which they  care about as well.   What is happening in the Senate is a stark contrast to the partisan  race to the bottom we saw in the House, where House Republicans are  pushing partisan legislation that has zero chance of passing. House  Republicans should look to the Senate to see how things get done. We  are passing important bipartisan legislation. They are throwing on the  floor partisan legislation that has no chance of passing. The contrast  is glaring. If House Republicans would look to how we are working here  in the Senate and emulate us a little more, they could be far more  productive.   We have every reason today to believe that we can finish the NDAA as  soon as possible, and I am hopeful we can get it done.                                Appropriations    Mr. President, off the floor, our appropriators continue to make good  progress on the appropriations bill. This morning, the Appropriations  Committee is marking up the remaining four appropriations bills.   It is just like the NDAA. Both sides--Democrats, Republicans--have  been working really well together. This is never an easy process. But I  really want to thank Chair Murray and Vice Chair Collins. They have  worked together in a really supremely bipartisan, almost exquisite, way  for shepherding these bills through committee with bipartisan support.  It ain't easy in this time when the country is so divided.   This is a model for how appropriations processes should always work:  both sides coming together, finding common ground, and advancing bills  that invest in American families, keep communities safe, drive down our  costs, and keep our government open. It is this type of bipartisanship  that has prevented any government shutdowns last Congress when  Democrats had majorities in the House and Senate. And the American  people certainly don't want to see a shutdown now.   So there is a lot of work left to do, but I am pleased that our  appropriators are making progress on these markups, and I thank them  again.   You look at the NDAA bill and you look at the appropriations bill,  you compare the House to the Senate, the contrast, as I said, is  glaring. And House Republicans should look to the Senate for how to  really get things done and help the American people instead of just  shouting partisan screeds.                           Artificial Intelligence    Mr. President, on the AI briefing, yesterday, we held our third all- Senate briefing on AI. This was our final briefing, in a three-part  series on AI, and it focused on U.S. investment and innovation and  American leadership in AI technology that will continue to shape our  world over the next decade and beyond.   The presentation was informative. Our briefers did a superb job  highlighting just how quickly AI technology is developing.   I want to thank our briefers: Rick Stevens from the Department of  Energy; Dr. Geri Richmond from the Department of Energy; Dr. Sethuraman  Panchanathan, nicknamed affectionately ``Panch,'' head of the National  Science Foundation; Dr. Kathleen Fisher from DARPA; and our moderator,  Dr. Jose-Marie Giffiths.   We had great attendance on all three of our AI briefings. Both  Democrats and Republicans were engaged and asked a lot of really good  questions. It shows there is real bipartisan interest in AI, which will  be necessary if we want to make progress on what really is imperative  for this country: putting together AI legislation that encourages  innovation but has safeguards to prevent the liabilities that AI could  present.   Later this fall, we will continue our work on AI by convening the  first ever AI Insight Forums. These forums will bring the top AI  developers, executives, and experts together to lay the foundation for  action on AI.   And, again, I want to thank my colleagues who attended our briefings,  including, of course, Senators Heinrich, Rounds, and Young, part of our  little group that helped to organize them.                           Remembering Tony Bennett    Mr. President, finally, on a great, great American icon, Anthony  Dominick Benedetto, more affectionately and widely known as Tony  Bennett. We lost an American icon last week, a son of Astoria, Queens,  and one of the most beloved singers of our time--the incomparable,  wonderful, caring Tony Bennett. On Tuesday, I introduced a resolution  declaring Tony Bennett's birthday, August 3, as ``Tony Bennett Day.''   It didn't matter if you were young, old, or in the middle, if you  were a close friend or a new fan, everyone just loved Tony. Just to  hear him sing a few bars, you knew he cared about you and he really  cared about the words of the song. He wasn't just getting up there to  make some money. He really wanted to show his love for music and for  people.   Tony Bennett leaves behind a tremendous legacy that will inspire  generations of artists to come, and I look forward to passing this  resolution honoring him today a little bit later.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 96, nays 3, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 202 Leg.]                                  YEAS--96       Baldwin      Barrasso      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Booker      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Brown      Budd      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Duckworth      Ernst      Feinstein      Fetterman      Fischer      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hassan      Hawley      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lankford      Lee      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Paul      Peters      Reed      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Schatz      Schmitt      Schumer      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Van Hollen      Vance      Warner      Warnock      Welch      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--3       Markey      Sanders      Warren                               NOT VOTING--1               Durbin            I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2  minutes and that Senator Gillibrand be given 2 minutes on this  amendment.    Mr. President, I want to thank my dear friend Senator  Gillibrand for her work on this amendment and for being such a fierce  advocate for 9/11 responders and survivors.   I would like to thank the Republican cosponsors, including Senators  Braun and Lummis, for their support. And Senator Wicker, I thank him as  well as thanking Leader McConnell.   This amendment is a huge step forward in making sure the first  responders and those injured on 9/11 are never left behind.   Before the smoke even cleared on 9/11 and before the rubble even quit  burning, our first responders--our firefighters, our police officers,  EMT, FBI agents, construction workers--were just running to danger,  trying to do their jobs and save lives. For their sacrifice, many first  responders developed severe health complications from working in the  aftermath of the attack--lifelong injuries, serious cancers. Many of  them are no longer with us, and some of them were friends of mine.  Twenty-two years later, people are still getting sick from the dust,  the air, the poisons.   We have created the World Trade Center Health Program so that 9/11  responders could afford the necessary healthcare, but we can't let  funding for the program dry up. We cannot fail to properly care for  those who answered the call of duty. Our work is not done. Just as the  first responders have been there for us and for America, we will  continue fighting for them.   This will fund $450 million to the World Trade Center Health Program  and another over $200 million for the military employees who rushed to  danger at the Pentagon and in Shanksville. It will be fully paid for.  It will also, for the first time, help those, as I said, at the  Pentagon and the DOD.   I hope, from all of my colleagues, that we can have unanimous and  broad support for this amendment.   I yield to the Senator from New York, my colleague, who is such a  leader on this legislation.    Will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote be  10 minutes, that subsequent votes be 10 minutes, and that we all hang  around and get the job done.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Casey) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, for the information of the Members, we  are getting very close to locking down a final agreement, which will  allow us to vote on a number of things, including the managers'  amendments and final passage this evening. We are still waiting for  some final paperwork to be done. So, in the meantime, I am going to  introduce and ask unanimous consent for a resolution praising Tony  Bennett, making August 3, his birthday, Tony Bennett Day.                            ____________________     So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 322, which was submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I am really proud today that my  resolution declaring Tony Bennett's birthday, August 3, as Tony Bennett  Day has just passed the Senate. I would like to thank Senator Cornyn  for joining me in this bipartisan resolution, as well as Speaker  Emerita Pelosi for working on a companion resolution in the House.   As we all know, we all loved Tony Bennett. Tony is an American icon,  a son of Astoria, Queens--a New Yorker through and through--and,  without doubt, one of the most beloved singers of our time. You only  come across a Tony Bennett once in a lifetime.   I would like to think Frank Sinatra got it right when he called Tony  Bennett ``the best singer in the business.''   Known for his unparalleled talent and his exceptional vocal range,  Tony spanned generations and genres. He touched the hearts of millions  around the world.   It didn't matter if you were young or old or somewhere in between, it  didn't matter if you were a friend or a fan, just about everyone loved  Tony, and Tony loved just about everyone.   And you could feel that he was in it for the right reasons, not for  the money or the fame, but he just loved making music and having people  enjoy it. Just to hear him sing a few bars, you knew he cared about the  song and he wanted to share that caring with everybody. And he cared  about you, as he sang it to you, just about more than anything.   And let's not forget, as great a musician as Tony was, he was a very  good human being. He fought and served our country admirably during  World War II. This always amazed me: He was a lifelong champion of  civil rights and marched along Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma in  1965, at a time when the agents of most entertainers discouraged them  from marching in these kinds of things because they might lose some  fans. But Tony didn't care. He believed in equality.   And he raised money for great causes, including the very disease he  was fighting, Alzheimer's.   If that still wasn't enough, he was an accomplished painter, and he  drew his inspiration from his little bench in Central Park.   Tony Bennett's legacy will live on in the hearts of fans, friends,  and countless artists he inspired along the way. I am proud we could  come together to pass this resolution honoring an extraordinary man and  his immeasurable contribution to the arts and our society.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments to S. 2226: Rubio, No. 523;  Young, No. 230; Daines, No. 1084; further, that with respect to the  amendments listed above, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order  listed, with no further amendments or motions in order, and with 60  affirmative votes required for adoption and that there be 2 minutes  equally divided prior to each vote; further, that upon disposition of  the Daines amendment, that it be in order to send to the desk a  managers' package of 47 amendments, and after the clerk reports it, I  ask that the clerk  [[Page S3726]]  also read the numbers and sponsors of each of the individual amendments  in this package and that they be the only amendments remaining in order  to be offered to S. 2226; that the Senate vote on the amendment with no  intervening action or debate; that upon disposition of the managers'  amendments, the cloture motions filed during Wednesday's session ripen  and the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute  amendment No. 935, as amended; further, that if cloture is invoked, all  postcloture time be considered expired, the Schumer amendment No. 936  be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on the substitute amendment, as  amended, with no intervening action or debate; further, that if the  substitute amendment is agreed to, the cloture motion with respect to  the underlying bill, S. 2226, be withdrawn, the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage; that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table,  with up to 10 minutes for debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on  passage; finally, that upon disposition of S. 2226, the Senate  immediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2670, which was  received from the House and is at the desk; that all after the enacting  clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill, as passed, be  inserted; H.R. 2670, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, the Senate bill then be indefinitely postponed, and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Casey) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold with respect to this amendment be vitiated and we vote by  voice.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold be vitiated and that we vote by voice.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Casey) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, let me give the order. We are almost  done. We are about to vote.   I first have to do a unanimous consent to vitiate cloture. I am going  to speak on the NDAA bill, on the pages, and yield to Leader McConnell  to follow me, and then we vote.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement    So, first, I ask unanimous consent to modify the previous order so  cloture motions with respect to the substitute amendment No. 935, as  amended, and the underlying bill, S. 2226, be withdrawn; that the  Schumer amendment No. 936 be withdrawn; that the substitute amendment  No. 935, as amended, be agreed to; further, that the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage; that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with up to 10 minutes for debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on  passage, with all previous provisions remaining in effect.    Mr. President, it has been a long day but a very  successful day.   The NDAA is a prime example of both sides coming together and  crafting a strong, bipartisan defense bill that will strengthen  America's national security, take care of our servicemembers, and keep  the United States the leader in innovation for years to come.   This was a bipartisan process through and through. I want to thank  [[Page S3729]]  Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Wicker and all the Members for their  good work on this.   A bipartisan process is precisely what the American people are  yearning for in a fractured Congress, Democrats and Republicans coming  together to provide something as critical as our national defense.   The NDAA and the bipartisan process we went through to get here  should be a glimmer of hope for the American people, a sign that  bipartisanship is alive and well in the Senate, but it is not the only  glimmer. We also came together to avert a first-ever default a few  months ago, and we are currently making great progress on the  appropriations bill, where, almost miraculously, under the leadership  of Senator Murphy and Senator Collins, they have advanced all 12 bills  out of committee with bipartisan support.   (Applause.)   I hope what has happened on this bill, the NDAA bill, and these other  bills can be a metaphor for future bills down the road.   These are two of our highest responsibilities--appropriations and  national defense--and we made great progress in these last few months.  It has been a really good Senate that the American people can be proud  of.   It was a good process on and off the floor. Listen to this: 98  amendments. We talk about how we don't do amendments--98; 44 Democrat,  44 Republican, and the rest bipartisan. That is what an NDAA bill  should look like--a full floor process with input and debate from both  sides. As a result, there are many critical provisions in this NDAA  bill as well that we should be proud of.   We made critical downpayments on our effort to outcompete the Chinese  Government by limiting the flow of investment and advanced technology  to China.   We are passing the first piece of legislation related to artificial  intelligence, including important provisions to increase data sharing  with the DOD and increase reporting on AI's use in financial services.   Maybe most important to everyone here aware of this fentanyl crisis,  we are boosting resources in a major way to tackle the fentanyl crisis  by including the FEND Off Fentanyl Act. Senators Brown, Scott, and many  others led to that legislation. This act gives the President more  powers to stop any country--China, Mexico--from sending the precursor  materials that are made into fentanyl to kill our children.   Together, all of these provisions provide a strong foundation for the  safety and security of our country.   One more point. It is in stark contrast to the partisan race to the  bottom we saw in the House. House Republicans should look to the  bipartisan Senate to see how to get things done. We are passing  important bipartisan legislation; they are throwing partisan  legislation on the floor that has no chance of passing. The contrast is  glaring. If the House of Representatives would look at how we are  working here in the Senate and emulate us a little more, they could be  far more productive.                                 Senate Pages    Mr. President, now on a final note and a serious note. Today is the  final day for this page class. It has been a busy session. The pages  can help make this place run smoothly. They are here when we need them,  and they have served this institution with grace. However, I understand  that late last night, a Member of the House majority thought it  appropriate to curse at some of these young people, these teenagers, in  the Rotunda. I was shocked when I heard about it, and I am further  shocked at his refusal to apologize to these young people.   I can't speak for the House of Representatives, but I do not think  that one Member's disrespect is shared by this body, by Leader  McConnell, and myself.
