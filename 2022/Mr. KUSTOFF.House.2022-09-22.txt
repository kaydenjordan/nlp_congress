 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 1-year anniversary  of a tragedy that stunned our community in Collierville, Tennessee.   On September 23, 2021, a gunman opened fire at the Kroger in  Collierville, shooting 15 people and killing one woman, Olivia King.   We will never forget the courage of the law enforcement officers,  firefighters, and first responders who sprang into action.   One example: In an extraordinary act, Collierville firefighters wore  bulletproof vests and rushed into the grocery store along with police  officers to save lives before the active shooter was neutralized.   The quick response of our heroic first responders truly exemplifies  the strength and resilience of the town of Collierville.   We will forever be grateful for the men and women who protect and  serve our communities each and every day. I am proud to say that today  and always we are Collierville strong.                            ____________________
