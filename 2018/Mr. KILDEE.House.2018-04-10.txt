 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office, the CBO, released a report highlighting the fact that  the budget deficit will pass $1 trillion within 2 years, thanks in  large part to the massive tax cuts granted to the wealthiest Americans  in the recently adopted Republican tax plan. $1 trillion.   This tax plan is projected to itself add close to $2 trillion to the  deficit over a decade.   This reckless plan jeopardizes our economic recovery by taking away  the  [[Page H3068]]  ability for us to invest in those elements of our communities and  society that will grow the economy. The very thought that we have a  massive deficit in our public infrastructure, and that is nowhere on  the table in the House, roads and bridges crumbling, water systems,  like the water system of my hometown of Flint, failing, and continuing  to pass on massive debt to our children and grandchildren is  irresponsible and it ought to be reversed.                            ____________________
