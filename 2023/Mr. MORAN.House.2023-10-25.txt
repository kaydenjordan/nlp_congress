 Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, freedom-loving Texan and  sitting member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, the events  in Israel these past weeks are of utmost concern, but beyond that, they  should concern every American and, frankly, every member of humanity  regardless of religion, ethnicity, race, gender, or political  affiliation.   What we have seen in these past weeks is pure hate and pure evil.  Hamas is a well-known, Iranian-backed terrorist organization whose  official charter calls for the obliteration of Israel and the Jewish  people.   Let's consider that for a moment. These last few weeks have been  proof of their commitment to this goal.   How should we respond in the United States? The U.S. should act  strategically with strength and steadiness so that those enemies of the  U.S. and Israel are overwhelmed and ultimately defeated in their  entirety. We must stand firmly with Israel with whatever they need.   Now is not the time for timidity. It is the time for strength and  unity with Israel. Such action will help deter evil in the future,  preserve life, and promote liberty.    Now is the time for us to be all in. We need to offer strength and  steadiness in this time. Let us begin by standing with Israel.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, October 26, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
