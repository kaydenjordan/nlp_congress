 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, apparently a number of our colleagues  here are having second thoughts about the strategy on the floor. We  have before us a budget resolution. It is setting the stage for a  budget process called reconciliation. To put it in layman's terms, we  are going to be moving from this budget resolution vote to a vote at a  time to be announced later, possibly in the next 2 weeks, to repeal  ObamaCare.   There has been a lot of speculation about what the impact will be if  we don't replace the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, with something  very quickly--for obvious reasons. We have seen 30 million Americans  who now have health insurance because of the creation of the Affordable  Care Act.   We have changed health insurance policies across the United States so  that if you have someone in your family with a preexisting condition,  you can't be discriminated against when you buy insurance.   Back in the old days, before ObamaCare became the law of the land,  health insurance companies could just refuse to insure your family or  charge you a premium that was beyond reach. We also eliminated the caps  that were built in--the limits that were built into these health  insurance policies. People were buying policies which covered up to  $100,000 in expenses. Then, God forbid, there is a diagnosis of cancer  or some serious illness, and $100,000 evaporates over a weekend.   So those limits are no longer allowed in health insurance policies.  We said women should be treated the same as men when it comes to  premiums. We also went on to say that, when it comes to these health  insurance companies, they have to be focused on keeping premium costs  in control, and they have to justify any profits that go way beyond the  reasonable.   Then we said: If you are a mother or father with a son or daughter  coming out of college and they are looking for a job, they are doing an  internship, and they don't have health insurance, they can stay on your  family policy until age 26.   That is pretty important for a lot of families. My family has been  through that with our kids. To know and have peace of mind that your  daughter or son can continue to be covered by your family plan--these  things are all built into the Affordable Care Act. Now, simply  repealing that, even saying it will happen at a later date, throws into  question, if not chaos, our health care system in America.   A lot of people are finally thinking about that. It is not just a  protest vote about a President who is going to be leaving office in 9  days. It is a life-and-death decision for health care for millions of  Americans. Now many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  starting to wake up to that reality.   Senator Cotton of Arkansas said: ``It would not be the right path for  us to repeal ObamaCare without laying out a path forward.''   Yesterday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Republicans want to  repeal ObamaCare ``concurrently'' with a replacement--``concurrently.''   Senator Lamar Alexander, my friend and colleague from Tennessee, who  chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, responded  by saying: ``To me, `simultaneously' and `concurrently' mean ObamaCare  should be finally repealed only when there are concrete, practical  reforms in place that give Americans access to truly affordable health  care''--Senator Alexander.   Newt Gingrich, the former Republican Speaker of the House, said: ``I  don't think Republicans want to leave 23 million people out there  worried that they are going to lose their insurance.''   So you go through the long list of Republican dissenters to this  notion of repeal and we will get back to you later: Senators Corker,  Portman, Collins, Cassidy, Murkowski. They have come up with an  amendment to this budget resolution, and they have said: Let's postpone  this whole effort until we have had time to put some work into it and  come up with an alternative to answer some of the basic questions about  what a new version of the Affordable Care Act would look like.   But the problem with that approach is that they have had 7 years--7  years--to prepare something, and they have nothing. So what are we  going to do in the meantime?   We did the responsible thing, I hope. Let's find a way to make the  Affordable Care Act even stronger, better, fairer. Sign me up. Make it  a bipartisan effort. Don't repeal it. Sit down and rewrite it in a way  that is fair and makes it stronger and better.   The basic things we want to make sure of are that people can have the  same basic protection if they wish it in health insurance. Ensure that  no one loses their current benefits, whether it is maternity care,  mental health care, or substance abuse treatment, which is now required  to be covered by health insurance plans. Ensure that no one's premiums  or out-of-pocket expenses get out of line. Protect people with  preexisting conditions and don't just simply shift the cost to States-- my State included--that could not afford to take this on. Keep drug  prices down for seniors.   You see, that is a part I did not mention. Medicare is affected by  the Affordable Care Act. Under Medicare, the 60 million Americans under  Medicare used to have something called a doughnut hole. It was on odd  invention when this bill was written into law. It said that Medicare  for seniors would cover the front end of their prescription costs, if  they are high, and, then, they have to take the middle part out of  their savings, and, then, late in the year, Medicare kicked back in.   It was costing seniors $1,000, $2,000 a year. We eliminated it with  the Affordable Care Act. Now, if you repeal that, what happens to  seniors and their prescription drug costs? Those are legitimate  questions which need to be answered before we go blindly into repealing  the Affordable Care Act.   Let's work together--Democrats and Republicans--to make this a better  law. I have said it before and I will say it again. The only perfect  law that I am aware of was carried down a mountain by ``Senator Moses''  on clay tablets. The rest of the efforts that we put into this are  always subject to review, amendment, and improvement. The Affordable  Care Act I would put in that category.   If there is a good-faith effort on the Republican side to join with  Democrats, I want to be part of it. I also want to salute my colleague,  Senator Debbie Stabenow, who will be on the floor in a couple of hours  to talk about the mental health protections and substance abuse  treatment protections in the Affordable Care Act. We used to have this  debate on the Senate floor about whether health insurance policies  should cover mental illness. We debated that. For the longest time,  they did not. People with those problems and challenges have long-term  care, in some cases.   But because of the bipartisan effort of Mr. Paul Wellstone, the late  Senator  [[Page S226]]  from Minnesota, and Mr. Pete Domenici, the retired Senator from New  Mexico--Democrat and Republican--we have included it in there. Senator  Stabenow wants to make sure that whatever we write in the future is  going to cover mental illness and substance abuse treatment.   Facing mental illness challenges across America, facing an opioid and  heroin epidemic, we can do no less. Let me tell you a story about Lori  Myers in Freeport, IL. She sent me a letter. Here is what she said:         I am writing to ask you to fight to preserve the ACA . . .       it has literally saved our daughter Brianne.        Brianne has been insured through the ACA since its       inception. . . . She has multiple health concerns and her       prescriptions are insanely expensive without insurance.    Lori writes:         It is imperative that she continue to have health coverage       in order to remain a functioning and productive adult. . . .       She has excellent policies purchased through the       Marketplace--with BlueCross BlueShield, and she receives a       subsidy to assist with cost.        The increase in premium this year was offset by an increase       in the subsidy. She is actually paying $20-$30 less for her       policy this year than she did last year for basically the       same coverage.    Ms. Myers says:         The election of our incoming President and the Republican-      controlled Congress has our family in a panic mode. Paul Ryan       and company want to take away programs that are assisting       people: like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and       healthcare.    She makes this final plea:         I am asking you, as our elected official, to stand strong       against any attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and       these other extremely vital programs.    What does it mean for seniors--the Affordable Care Act?   Well, the first thing it did was to start to contain the growth in  health care costs. That had a dramatic impact on Medicare and its  future. Because of the Affordable Care Act and the changes it includes,  which give to seniors, for example, free preventive health exams and  that sort of thing, and because of prescription drugs now being covered  so it does not come out of pocket for many seniors--because of these  changes and others--Medicare is now financially solvent through 2028.   ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care Act, added 10 years of solvency to  Medicare. That is critically important. What happens when they repeal  it? Because we slowed the pace of Medicare costs, seniors are now  paying $700 less each year in premiums and cost sharing, on average.  Premiums are down, and Medicare solvency is up. We want to repeal that?   Our health care system now prohibits insurers from charging seniors  much higher premiums simply because of age. Seniors were often charged  five times what younger people paid for health insurance--banned by the  Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare, as I mentioned earlier, closed this  doughnut hole, saving 11 million seniors an average of $2,127 on their  prescription drugs. They want to repeal that?   Thanks to ObamaCare, more than 30 States have expanded their Medicaid  Program. People often forget that the vast majority of money spent on  Medicaid is for seniors who are in an institutional or at-home-by- themselves setting. So when you cut Medicaid--and people say that it  must be the poor unemployed; it is--but the largest amount of money is  going to seniors--mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers.   The Affordable Care Act has been good for kids across America.  Between 2013 and 2015 we saw the largest decline of children uninsured  in our Nation's modern history. Today, more than 95 percent of kids in  America are insured. We ought to be proud of that. In Illinois, there  is a 40-percent decline in the number of children uninsured. Under our  current health care system, children can now stay on their parents'  plans till age 26, as I mentioned.   The number of young adults ages 19 to 25 without health insurance has  declined by over 50 percent since we passed this bill. In Illinois,  more than 90,000 young people have signed up. Today, insurance  companies are required to cover important health care for children free  of charge--vaccinations, vision checks, lead poison screening. Of  course, we ended the preexisting condition provisions. The Republicans  want to repeal this. What will they replace that with to protect  children and seniors?   When it comes to women, because of ObamaCare, the uninsured rate for  adult women in America has declined by 44 percent. Today, women can no  longer be charged more than men simply because of their gender. Our  health care system now prohibits insurers from discriminating based on  preexisting conditions. There was a time, literally, when health  insurance companies said being a woman is a preexisting condition. We  are going to charge you more.   Our health care system now ensures that women can get free preventive  health services. Before ObamaCare, 62 percent of individual health  plans did not cover maternity or newborn care. Today, it is a  requirement.   So when you talk about cutting the cost of health insurance and that  we will just take off some of these benefits, understand what you are  doing. If you take the basic maternity care out of a health insurance  plan, and it is not included and it is needed, that family is going to  have to bear that expense.   If they can't pay the bill--some won't be able to--who is going to  pay for it? The hospital will deliver the baby and send the mother and  baby home happy and healthy, I hope. But the cost will be passed on to  everyone else who shows up at that hospital with a health insurance  plan. That was the old days. Do the Republicans want to return to that?   In the area of behavioral health, as I mentioned earlier, thanks to  ObamaCare, health insurance plans now cover mental health and substance  abuse disorders. The law extended protections under the Mental Health  Parity and Addiction Equity Act to 60 million Americans in private  health plans. This means that insurers can no longer discriminate  against individuals with mental illness or addiction.   Our health care system now prohibits insurers from discriminating  based on preexisting conditions, including the 44 million Americans  with some history of mental illness and 20 million with a substance  abuse disorder.   When you repeal this, as the Republicans plan on doing, what will  they replace it with? What will they say to the families who have  someone with a mental illness or someone suffering from a drug  addiction?   Substance abuse and mental health disorders often present in young  adulthood, and that is why the provision that families can keep their  kids on their plan is at the right time and the right place for many  young people.   There is a long list of things that were done by the Affordable Care  Act. It is one thing to campaign and say: We will repeal it. People  cheer. And then you ask yourselves: What are you going to say, as some  of the Republican leaders have said, to the people who are going to  lose this coverage, to the people who want their guarantees built into  their health insurance plans?   I can still remember--and I will bet many watching this debate can  too--the bad old days when you called up that adjuster for the health  insurance plan that you owned and wondered how long you were going to  sit on hold for the person on the other end and if the person on the  other end would even be able to comprehend what you were asking.   These sorts of things don't need to be returned as evidence that we  are making progress. If we go back to those bad old days, it is a step  in the wrong direction for millions of Americans.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                                    Russia     Madam President, the most popular dictionary defines an  act of war as an act of aggression by a country against another with  which it is nominally at peace. Let me repeat, an act of aggression by  another country against another with which it is nominally at peace.   On Friday, America's intelligence community issued a damning,  detailed assessment concluding that Russian strongman President  Vladimir Putin ordered an attack on our Nation's electoral system to  sow mistrust and favor one candidate over another. The evidence was  sweeping, overwhelming, and troubling.   The key findings, quoted directly from the public version of this  report from the intelligence agencies, said as follows:         Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential       election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's       longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal       Democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a       significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and       scope of effort compared to previous operations.        We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the U.S. Democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton,       harm her electability and potential presidency. We further       assess that Putin and the Russian Government developed a       clear preference for President-elect Trump.        We also assess Putin and the Russian government aspired to       help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible       by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting       her unfavorably to him.    They go on to talk about the types of influence Moscow inspired.   I am not going to stand here and argue that if the Russian efforts  had not taken place, there would have been a different outcome in the  election. No one will ever know that. And when asked directly, the  intelligence agencies, despite these strong statements, say there is no  evidence of direct vote tampering or tampering with election equipment,  thank goodness. That isn't the point.   The point is, Vladimir Putin and the Russians did what they could to  influence our election. Americans should stand up and listen because  what is at stake is the sovereignty of our Nation and the reliability  and integrity of our election process.   What the Russians did was truly staggering and momentous--a foreign  adversary intentionally manipulating America's democracy and election.  I don't know if it is an act of war by classic definition. It is an  attack on our Nation by any definition. It should not go unanswered.   For those who have been following Vladimir Putin's bullying actions  over the last several years, this is no surprise. Instead of building a  modern global economy based on the great talents of the Russian people,  he and his closest neighbors have created false enemies in the West,  sadly and dangerously creating a narrative that domestic Russian  problems are really the result of NATO, the United States, and the  West.   He has tried to discredit the West and its Democratic free market  institutions. He has used manufactured enemies of Russia to rally  domestic support for his tactics and leadership.   It is, ultimately, a tired narrative that when combined with domestic  political repression and manipulation, helps keep Putin in power.   Let's not be fooled into thinking his actions are merely annoying.  The threats are real and dangerous, and they go directly not just at  the United States but many of our strongest allies.   I have a list which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record  in detail.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         April-May 2007 Estonia: Angered by an Estonian plan to move       a Russian World War II memorial and Russian soldiers' graves,       Russia disabled Estonia's internet with a particular focus on       government offices and financial institutions.        June 2008 Lithuania: Similarly, when the Lithuanian       government banned the display of Soviet symbols, Russian       hackers defaced government web pages with hammer-and-sickles       and five-pointed stars.        August 2008 Georgia: After Georgia's pro-Western government       sent forces into a breakaway Russian-backed region, Russian       hackers shut down the country's internal communications to       coincide with a military seizure of Georgian territory.        January 2009 Kyrgyzstan: As part of an effort to persuade       the president of Kyrgyzstan to evict a U.S. military base,       Russian hackers shut down two of the country's four internet       service providers. Kyrgyzstan in turn removed the base and       received $2 billion in Russian aid.        April 2009 Kazakhstan: After Kazakh media published a       statement by the country's president that criticized Russia,       a Russian-attributed attack shut down the publication's site.        August 2009 Georgia: Russian hackers shut down Georgian       Twitter and Facebook on the first anniversary of the 2008       Russian military invasion.        May 2014 Ukraine: Three days before Ukraine's presidential       election, a Russia-based hacking group attacked and disabled       the country's election commission, including its backup       system. Ukrainian officials say the arrested hackers were       trying to rig the results in favor of the pro-Russian       candidate.        March 2014 Ukraine: As in Georgia, Russian allegedly       coordinated military and cyber attacks, disabling the       internet in Ukraine while Russian-armed proxies seized       control of Crimea.        May 2015 Germany: German investigators discovered hackers       had penetrated the computer network of the German Bundestag,       the most significant hack in German history. Security experts       said hackers were also trying to penetrate the computers of       Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Party.        December 2015 Ukraine: Hackers believed to be Russian took       control of a Ukrainian power station, locking controllers out       of their own systems and cutting 235,000 homes from power.        October 2015 Netherlands: Security experts believe Russia       tried to hack into the Dutch government's computers to remove       a report about the downed Malaysian airliner over Ukraine.       The Dutch Safety Board eventually concluded that the       passenger plane was brought down by a Russian-made missile       fired from an area held by pro-Russian rebels in eastern       Ukraine.        January 2016 Finland: A security firm announced that it       believes Russian hackers were behind attacks on Finland's       Foreign Ministry several years before.        December 2016 Germany: The head of German intelligence       warned last month, ``There is growing evidence of attempts to       influence the federal election next year,'' specifically       citing Russia as the source of the attacks, adding, ``We       expect a further increase in cyber-attacks in the run-up to       the elections.'' Experts believe Russia wanted to undermine       Chancellor Merkel who has supported sanctions against Russia       for its actions in Ukraine.     Madam President, NBC News compiled a document of activity  by Russia and Vladimir Putin. It starts in April of 2007 in Estonia,  where the Russians were disabling their Internet; in June 2008, in  Lithuania, where the Russian hackers were defacing government Web  pages; in August 2008, in Georgia, where the Russian hackers shut down  the country's internal communications system; in January 2009, in  Kyrgyzstan, as part of an effort to persuade the President there to  evict a U.S. military base, the Russian hackers shut down two of the  country's four Internet service providers.   April of 2009 in Kazakhstan. After Kazakh media published a statement  by the country's president that criticized Russia, Russian-attributed  attacks shut down the publication's Web site.  [[Page S244]]    August 2009 in Georgia, there was similar activity; May 2014 in  Ukraine; March 2014 in Ukraine; May 2015 in Germany; December 2015 in  Ukraine; October 2015 in the Netherlands; January 2016 in Finland;  December 2016 in Germany.   Of course, there was also the Russian military seizure of sovereign  territory in the nation of Georgia in 2008 and their invasion of  Ukraine in 2014. In fact, Russian forces and their proxies still hold  captured land in Georgia and Ukraine, and from that spot in Ukraine  separatists shot down a civilian airliner 2 years ago, murdering 283  innocent passengers, including 8 children.   This is our adversary. This is the man who is trying to undermine the  American electoral system. We cannot take it lightly.   Twenty years ago, when I was elected to the Senate, I was a member of  the Government Affairs Committee. The first hearing we had was a  lengthy investigative hearing. What was the basis of it? We had just  concluded a Presidential campaign, and allegations were made that the  Chinese Government 20 years ago was trying to insert itself into the  Presidential campaign of the United States, specifically in support of  the Clinton-Gore ticket.   Fred Thompson was chairman of that committee, a pretty well-known man  who has since passed, but he was a pretty outstanding lawyer in  addition to being a pretty famous actor. He was my chairman. He spent  months in public hearings investigating whether the Chinese tried to  insert themselves in any way, shape, or form in the election of  Clinton-Gore. They found virtually no evidence, other than a handful of  Buddhist nuns writing checks to the campaign, which nobody ever really  explained. But there was no evidence that the Chinese Government was  involved in this in any specific way. We spent months on that theory in  open hearings, and then published reports--conflicting reports on  conclusions from that committee. We took it that seriously 20 years  ago.   What are we doing about this? Well, Senator McConnell, the Republican  leader, said that we will do the regular order; we will let the regular  committees go about their business and figure out what might have  happened in the course of that. That is not good enough. Regular order  may put this investigation in the Intelligence Committee. Do you know  what that means? It means you are not going to see their hearing. You  are not going to be able to see their witnesses and listen to their  testimony, and much of the evidence that is going to be presented will  never be shared with the public.   I understand the need to protect classified material. We must do  that. I insist on that. But at the same time, we need to answer some  basic questions about what Russia tried to do in this last election and  to make it clear to them and to the world that the United States is not  going to be a sucker. We are not going to allow anyone who can hack  into our systems to try to undermine the electoral system of the United  States. We are proud Americans. We will handle our own elections, thank  you. Keep your hackers out of business in the United States.   Recently, we have had allegations--and I underline the word  ``allegations''--of other involvement of the Russians with the Trump  campaign and the preparation of certain documents, which have not been  collaborated as of this date. They may lead to nothing, but they  certainly deserve investigation so that we know what the facts may be.   Yesterday at the Senate Judiciary Committee, I asked Senator Jeff  Sessions of Alabama, a man who is aspiring to be Donald Trump's  Attorney General, if he could recuse himself from investigations into  Russian connections with the Trump campaign. He had just said earlier  he was going to recuse himself from investigations involving Hillary  Clinton. Senator Sessions said, ``I would review it and try to do the  right thing as to whether or not it should stay within the jurisdiction  of the attorney general or not.''   I hope that Senator Sessions, if he in fact becomes the Attorney  General, will have some second thoughts. It is far better to consider a  special counsel in the Department of Justice in light of the political  circumstances of these allegations.   Secondly, we need to have a select committee--not the Intelligence  Committee--of either the House or the Senate that will meet and  consider this information and investigate it in a responsible way. In  fact, I think it is of such gravity that we ought to consider a public- private commission--a commission of elected officials, as well as  private citizens, whom we respect. I think of the names of General  Colin Powell and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as  chairs and cochairs of that effort, people of unquestionable integrity  who will make the right findings for America and not for any political  reasons, as far as I am concerned.   Today, I asked Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General under  President George W. Bush, whether the Attorney General has the  authority to shut down an FBI investigation, and he answered very  simply, ``yes.'' So we need more information. We need to make sure that  this is taken seriously and that we address it in a serious manner  because it is a serious issue.   What, in fact, has been the response from the other side of the  aisle? With a few notable exceptions, that party of Ronald Reagan, the  40th President--who really understood the old Soviet regime--has  greeted this information with near silence. That is right. Except for a  few voices--my colleagues Senators Graham and McCain in particular-- there has been near silence.   How in the world did an attack ordered by a former Soviet KGB  official on our Nation become a partisan issue that is largely ignored  by a majority of one of our Nation's two great political parties? How  did the Republican Party, which now controls both Chambers of Congress,  decide that repealing health care insurance for millions of Americans  was the most urgent, first priority to deal with amid this sweeping  evidence of a Russian attack on our democracy? Ronald Reagan must be  rolling in his grave.   Does anyone remember his clarity about standing up against attacks on  the West and its allies when the Soviets shot down a civilian Korean  airliner in 1983? This is what President Reagan said:         And make no mistake about it, this attack was not just       against ourselves or the Republic of Korea. This was the       Soviet Union against the world and the moral precepts which       guide human relations among people everywhere. It was an act       of barbarism born of a society which wantonly disregards       individual rights and the value of human life and seeks       constantly to expand and dominate other nations.    There was a time in this town when national security issues were  truly bipartisan, when security meant patriotically putting aside  partisan agendas. Can anyone here imagine for a second--just one  second--the debate we would be having here now if the situation were  reversed? The House alone spent millions of dollars on countless and  ultimately fruitless investigations into the tragic events of Benghazi.  Here we are, with overwhelming evidence of an actual attack on our  Nation, and the majority party is largely silent. That is incredible.  It is quite simply an abdication of political responsibility not to  address a verified national security threat to our Nation.   With the release of Friday's report, I urge my colleagues to read  both the public and classified reports. The classified version contains  the same damning and sweeping conclusions I mentioned here today from  the public document, but it goes into detail. As such, I urge this body  to come up with an appropriate response to this attack. I have joined  in bipartisan Russian sanctions legislation with Senators Cardin,  McCain, Menendez, Graham, Shaheen Rubio, Klobuchar, Sasse, and Portman.  We urge that we quickly advance as an urgent priority Russian sanctions  to make it clear that what they have done is reprehensible,  unacceptable, and will not be tolerated.   This Congress can also do what many tried to do in the past and  failed--which is certainly timely--and that is pass meaningful cyber  security legislation.   We have to maintain our strong NATO Alliance, stand firm against  Russian meddling or attacks, and tell our friends in the Baltics and  Poland, in particular, that we stand by their side, that nothing has  changed, and that our friends in Ukraine can trust that we will be with  them as they establish democratic sovereignty. We must work with the  new administration to fully accept and counter this  [[Page S245]]  Russian threat. We must work to undermine any such future attacks at  home and against our allies. We should get to the bottom of the  extremely troubling allegations that have been made recently.   Yes, ultimately we must work with Russia where those efforts serve  our global interests--and I think there will be some common areas--but  we must not do so from a position of weakness. We will never be taken  seriously by Putin or our adversaries otherwise.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.
