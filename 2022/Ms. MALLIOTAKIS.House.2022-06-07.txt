 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this  legislation that includes my language to secure additional funds for  the Staten Island seawall to protect my constituents from a future  hurricane.   In October, it will be 10 years since Hurricane Sandy devastated  parts of New York City. Particularly hard-hit was my borough of Staten  Island, where 24 lives were lost, hundreds of families were displaced,  and thousands of homes were damaged.   Since the project's approval in 2013, bureaucratic red tape resulted  in costly redesigns and repeated delays. This vital flood mitigation  project is long overdue, and I made a commitment that when I came to  Congress I would get it back on track.    In February, the city and Federal Governments came to an agreement on  the radiation clean-up in Great Kills Park, which will allow for  construction on the project's levee, floodwall, and tide gate.   This fall, the contract for the first phase is expected to be issued  so we can break ground on the drainage portion in South Beach and  finally begin this long-awaited project that is critical to the  livelihoods of my constituents, and will help reduce flood insurance  costs.   Today, we will ensure that the project will be fully funded through  this bill. I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation.
