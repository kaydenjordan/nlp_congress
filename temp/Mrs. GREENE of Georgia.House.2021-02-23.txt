 Mr. Speaker, as we convene this week, I would  like to ask all of my fellow colleagues and Members of the 117th  Congress to reflect on the words right there on the wall: In God We  Trust.   God created us male and female. In His image, He created us. The  Equality Act that we are to vote on this week destroys God's creation.  It also completely annihilates women's rights and religious freedoms.   It can be handled completely differently to stop discrimination  without destroying women's rights, little girls' rights in sports, and  religious freedoms violating everything that we hold dear in God's  creation.   As we are reflecting on the 500,000 people who have died from COVID- 19, I would like to remind everyone that over 62 million people have  been murdered in the womb in our country and that our tax dollars many  times have funded it. This is an evil that should not exist in our  land, and I ask all Members of Congress to stop this evil now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
