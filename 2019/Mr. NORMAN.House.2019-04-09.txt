 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American,  Gerald Alexander Knight, who was born on April 11, 1944. He was the  middle child of five children born to his parents, Woodrow and Virda  Knight.  [[Page H3136]]    His family, like most American families, had much to overcome during  the ending of World War II and the economic and emotional hardship that  ensued during the postwar period.   While the Knight family struggled to make ends meet, the American  values of hard work, pride in what you do, and determination were  instilled at a very young age. Gerald began working at the early age of  6 when he routinely walked a half mile to gather 3 gallons of water  from his grandparents' home.   When he turned 14, he earned his driver's license and began driving a  pulpwood truck at 4:30 every morning to earn money for his family.  After finishing his early morning drive to the lumberyard, he would  attend school and then returned home to gather another load of wood.   Gerald would often say: ``I was born into poverty, but I did not  choose to stay in poverty.''   After graduating from Flat Creek High School in 1962, he joined the  Air Force and boarded a bus to San Antonio, Texas, where he entered  training to become an air traffic controller. He was one of only three  out of 18 to graduate, and he became an air traffic controller as part  of the 648th SAGE Squadron serving during the Cuban Missile Crisis,  where he monitored air traffic in the Southeastern United States and  Puerto Rico to Cuba.   Gerald was soon stationed in Germany. During a visit to his home, he  met his future wife, Joyce, on a blind date set up by his brother  Charles. After one date, he asked her to marry him. However, being a  senior in high school and needing to graduate, Joyce declined but  promised to wait for Gerald until his military service was completed.   Gerald spent the next 2.5 years in Birkenfeld, Germany, where he  continued to work in air traffic control and warning systems,  monitoring the airspace of Europe, including tracking and identifying  all aircraft in the airspace.   After completing his service in the Air Force, Gerald hitchhiked  home, where the Vietnam war was raging. His younger brother Ronnie had  been drafted and sent to serve in Vietnam. Gerald, wanting to be with  his brother, offered to reenlist in the Air Force, provided he went to  Vietnam. He never served in Vietnam due to a clerical error by the Air  Force and was, instead, sent to Maine, where he declined and returned  to South Carolina.    He married Joyce on November 6, 1966, and by 1970, they were the  proud parents of two small girls, Carrie and Bobbie.   After working in the textile industry for a short time, he was hired  by the DuPont company located in Camden, South Carolina, where he  initially worked as a spinner operator. The company quickly realized  that Gerald had a unique talent for listening and relating to people  and moved him into the employee assistance department, where he was  certified and began investigating sexual harassment cases and  representing DuPont in Federal court.   He counseled employees and their families dealing with addiction  problems, as well as working for the Lancaster Recovery Center, which  served the entire community on these issues. Gerald was uniquely  qualified to deal with these issues as he had struggled with alcohol  abuse in his younger years until surrendering his life to Christ at the  age of 38.   Gerald was instrumental in writing new human resources policy for  DuPont and was once told: ``You are the best outhouse lawyer I have  ever seen.''   His career at DuPont was stellar, and he was characterized by his  peers as being honest, caring, and treating everyone with respect and  dignity, regardless of their status in life.   When Gerald was asked what his greatest accomplishment was in life,  his response was: ``My girls. I look at their lives to measure my  success, as they are well-adjusted human beings with their own families  serving God.''   Gerald Alexander Knight has lived a life with a sense of moral  obligation to duty and a personal creed of God, family, and country, in  that order.   He is a proud member of the Greatest Generation and will be  remembered for his kindness, generosity, and integrity.   God bless you, Gerald Alexander Knight. The world was a better place  because you were in it.                            ____________________
