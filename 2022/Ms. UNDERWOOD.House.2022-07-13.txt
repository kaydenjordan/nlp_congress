 Madam Speaker, this week, we are making history as we  pass the Honoring Our PACT Act and move one step closer to sending the  legislation to President Biden's desk to be signed into law.   The journey to this point has been long. As a member of the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of  the PACT Act when we introduced it over a year ago.   Now, we are finally at the finish line, ready to expand healthcare to  3.5 million veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service.   We are upholding our end of the pact we made with our veterans to  ensure they have the care they need and deserve when they come home.   I am grateful to the veterans and military families in my community  who have made their voices heard on this urgent cause, and I am  thankful for the tireless advocacy of the VSOs across the country who  have made this moment possible.                            ____________________
