 Mr. President, I rise today during national small  business week to honor and recognize Dan and Jan Smoots of Emporia, KS.  The Smoots were recently announced as the Small Business  Administration's Small Business Persons of the Year for Kansas, and  once you hear why, it is clear to see they are more than deserving of  the award.   The Smoots' business, Fanestil Meats, was recognized in part for  surviving multiple flood disasters on the Cottonwood River. Their  facility's foundation is just south of Emporia in the flood plain,  making it susceptible to flooding any given year. Yet, through the  hurdles, the Smoots persevered to keep their business running. Of  course, the COVID-19 pandemic brought on a whole new set of challenges  for the Smoots, but once again, they trekked along. With 100 employees  to take care of, along with unprecedented supply chain disruptions,  they had to be resourceful through this new challenge. Thankfully,  Fanestil Meats was able to secure a loan through the Paycheck  Protection Program, which the Smoots say was instrumental in keeping  the business afloat throughout the pandemic.   Moving forward, Fanestil Meats is now constructing a new 40,000- square-foot meat-processing facility that will replace the original  plant and help expand the worldwide reach of their beloved product, the  Party Time Ham. The new facility is located adjacent to the cold  storage warehouse, retail store, and administrative offices that were  constructed in 2015 in Emporia, KS.   This award is truly an honor that everyone at Fanestil should be  proud of. The Smoots have worked long and hard to expand and improve  this business since they took over in 1997, which is no small task.  Yet, thanks in part to the Smoots' ownership, Fanestil continues to  rise to the occasion and prosper, even when faced with adversity. I ask  my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dan and Jan Smoots for their  dedication to their business and for representing Kansas greatly.                            ____________________
