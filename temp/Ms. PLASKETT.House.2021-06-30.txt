 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.   On January 6, we witnessed one of the darkest days in our history, a  violent attack on the U.S. Capitol during the formal counting of the  votes on the election of a President. They attempted to destroy our  House, the people's House.   As the elected stewards of this House, it is our responsibility to  investigate the breakdowns and breaches in security that failed us,  that led us to January 6.   It is our collective responsibility to use the authority given to us  for a select panel devoted solely to the proper and thorough  investigation of the facts and causes of the attack; not just the  attackers, but the conspirators and the enablers.   If you can't protect the people's House, God help your family's house  if the former President wishes to loot that as well.   Madam Speaker, consideration and passage of this resolution today is  timely, as Americans across the Nation prepare to celebrate Fourth of  July, the signing of our Declaration of Independence. Our country was  founded on a democratic process of fair elections. I cannot think of a  more genuine celebration of our independence than the commitment to  protect our democracy.
