 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of the  Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act.   In recent years, Utah has witnessed incredible growth in our tech and  innovation sector, bringing thousands of jobs and strengthening our  economy. However, everywhere I go, I hear from business leaders that  they do not have enough high-skilled workers.   Even as we work to strengthen STEM education and bolster the number  of homegrown engineers and programers, the demand continues to outstrip  the supply. Current limitations in our immigration system are forcing  talented engineers who have trained in our universities to remain on  temporary visas or leave entirely for competing countries, while  important jobs go unfilled and economic opportunities are lost.   This legislation will create a first-come-first-served system,  providing certainty to workers and families and enabling U.S. companies  to flourish and compete in a global economy as they hire the brightest  people to create products, services, and jobs, regardless of where they  were born. As these companies expand operations with greater input from  high-skilled workers, they create countless more American jobs.  [[Page H5326]]    Mr. Speaker, with the debate around our broken immigration system  growing increasingly challenging in recent years, I have been thrilled  to see this bipartisan groundswell of support around this effort. I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
