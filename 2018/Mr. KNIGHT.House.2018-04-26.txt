 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   Chairman Shuster and his staff should be recognized for their  tireless work to bring all stakeholders together to modernize our  aerospace system, streamline the process for bringing new aircraft  technology to market, and lay the groundwork for safely integrating  unmanned aircraft systems into the 21st century commerce.   This bill is important for the continued growth of the U.S. aircraft  industry and for all passengers of today and the future, and for the  continued legacy of aviation innovation in southern California. Their  safety is underwritten in several portions of the bill, including  several drawn from the FLIGHT R&D Act, a bill I introduced last year to  prioritize research and development on several critical civil airspace  challenges.   As reflected in this bill, the FAA must develop a streamlined, risk- based process for certifying the operation of new UASs.   The FAA has a key role in working with private sector partners to  tackle sense-and-avoid technology challenge and enable safe testing of  beyond-line-of-sight operations. Putting appropriate resources behind  these technology priorities will ensure American innovations have the  space to test, develop, and safely integrate UAS technology before  foreign competitors capture these emerging industries.    Mr. Chairman, this is a fiscally responsible bill, and  was drafted to ensure taxpayer resources are wisely and efficiently  used to meet public objectives for safety and economic growth and a  better way to move around the country. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.
