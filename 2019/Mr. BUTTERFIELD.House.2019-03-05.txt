 Madam Speaker, I rise today, along with my  colleagues, to remember and honor a great, great public servant, a  great North Carolinian, devoted husband and father, a man of great  faith, and my personal friend for over 40 years, Congressman Walter B.  Jones, Jr.   And, Madam Speaker, I emphasize the word ``junior,'' because I knew  Walter's father and knew him very well, for he was the Congressman for  eastern North Carolina for many years. And though Walter did not use  ``Junior'' in his official name, he was indeed a junior.   Walter Jones passed away on Sunday, February 10, 2019, on his 76th  birthday.   He was a lifelong public servant, serving in the North Carolina  National Guard for four years, the General Assembly of our State for  ten years, and the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 long years,  where he served North Carolina's Third Congressional District.                                time  1945    Since coming to Congress, I watched Walter cast difficult votes with  conviction, standing firm in what he believed was right for his  constituents and for the American people. That is why the people of  North Carolina's Third District sent him back to Congress again and  again and again, electing him 13 times since 1994.   Even as Walter gained seniority in the Congress, he maintained his  strong conscience and principles. As a senior member of the House  Committee on Armed Services, Walter was an outspoken and effective  voice for our military.   Anyone in eastern North Carolina who knew Walter Jones, or knew of  him, would know of his love for the military. He was committed to  safeguarding the well-being of our Nation's veterans and active  servicemembers. In fact, Congressman Jones sponsored and cosponsored  more veterans legislation in the last three congressional terms than  any other sitting Member of Congress.   Madam Speaker, it was one of the greatest honors of my life for my  friend, Congressman Walter Jones, to ask me to administer his oath of  office, which I performed at his Farmville home on January 4, 2019. And  I might say that his home in Farmville is 20 minutes from my home in  Wilson.   I am equally proud to say that a 30-Member delegation traveled to  Greenville, North Carolina, for the homegoing service for Congressman  Jones. That 30-Member delegation was led by the dean of our delegation,  Congressman   David Price, and the ranking Republican among our  delegation, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx.   I will miss Walter Jones in these halls and in our beloved State.  Walter would drive home each week. We would sit right here on the House  floor each Friday and talk about our weekends. He would tell me how he  was preparing to drive home and how he dreaded the traffic, but that he  would offset the dread of the traffic by listening to audiotapes in his  car while he would drive.   Madam Speaker, we may have stood on opposite sides of the aisle here  in the House, but there was always a mutual respect and friendship  between us. I would say to the gentlewoman from Hawaii who spoke a few  moments ago that he, too, called me Mr. Chairman. I never understood  exactly why he would do that, but that was his vocabulary, and I found  it very honorable that he would do that.   Although our friend is no longer here, he has left an indelible mark  on eastern North Carolina, on the House, and on the Nation. May our  friend, Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr., rest in peace and have  eternal life with our Father in Heaven.   To Joe Anne, Ashley, and all the family and friends of Walter Jones,  we wish you God's blessings in the years to come.
