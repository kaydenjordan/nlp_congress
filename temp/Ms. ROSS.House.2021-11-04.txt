 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent need to  pass the Build Back Better agenda, a transformational package that will  help individuals and working families across North Carolina.   This bold legislation will bring down the high costs that have held  families back for decades by making childcare, home care, education,  healthcare, and housing more affordable. This is a package for the  people--all the people--and it spans generations, providing support to  infants, students, working adults, and older Americans.   Right now, the average annual cost for a child in North Carolina to  attend a childcare center is nearly $9,000. The average North Carolina  family with two young children spends more than 20 percent of their  annual income on childcare. That is unacceptable. For kids to thrive  and for parents to excel in the workplace, we need quality, affordable  childcare.   I have a constituent from Cary, North Carolina, named Katy, she works  at a nonprofit and has a 1-year-old child. She told me this:         Becoming a mom has opened my eyes to how broken our       Nation's childcare system is.        We felt lucky to find a spot for my child at a high-quality       childcare program, but the cost was shocking. We pay more       than $800 a month for my son's care.        At the same time, the director and teachers at my son's       program likely don't make a living wage.        They're doing one of the most important jobs in the world,       helping raise the next generation. Why aren't they       compensated fairly?        Childcare providers shouldn't have to work second jobs on       the weekends to feed their families, but many do.        At the same time, parents can't shoulder the burden.        In fact, the extremely high cost of childcare is a major       factor for my family as we decide to have a second child.    Katy's story is so common. If we claim to value our children and our  families, we need to stop turning a blind eye to the exploding costs of  childcare. We can do better.   That is why the Build Back Better Act will provide universal pre-K  for all 3- and 4-year-olds and limit childcare costs for working  families to no more than 7 percent of their income.   Mr. Speaker, we also need to do more for our seniors and their loved  ones. Every American should be able to look forward to a comfortable,  secure retirement. Our seniors should not have to worry about  financially burdening their children and their grandchildren.   In my family, my father-in-law wanted to stay in the home he loved,  and he did until he was 98 years old. We found  [[Page H6186]]  it very difficult to find him home care. I continue to hear stories  from seniors in my district who have had to give up their homes simply  to stay in a nursing home.   Again, we can do better. That is why the Build Back Better Act will  provide a historic investment in home care in order to help the more  than 800,000 people on State Medicaid waiting lists.   Mr. Speaker, when we pass this bill, more of our people will stop  struggling to make ends meet and start experiencing true financial  security.   When we pass this bill, more of our children and our seniors will  receive the care they deserve. And, most importantly, when we pass this  bill we will be one giant step closer to an America where everyone has  the chance to pursue the American Dream and the means to support their  families.                            ____________________
