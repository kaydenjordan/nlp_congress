 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a remarkable  man who was a giant in our community and who had an immeasurable impact  on the lives of many, many people. Sadly, Sam Granato passed away  peacefully at his home after a 2-year battle with cancer. He fought his  personal medical battle the same way he approached life: with grit,  determination, and perseverance.   Sam spent most of his life as a resident of Millcreek, UT, where he  learned from his father, Frank, the value of  [[Page S2511]]  hard work. Frank taught his son the elements of the food industry,  imparting to Sam invaluable lessons that he would later implement as he  established and operated several Italian delis and distributed food to  Utah stores and restaurants. Lunch at Granato's was a mainstay for  people from all walks of life. Some of the most interesting political  discussions, for people on both sides of the aisle, have taken place in  the ``boardrooms'' of Sam's beloved restaurant.   To Sam, everyone was his best friend. Sam enthusiastically greeted  every person who walked in the door of Granato's, whether he had known  you for decades or had just met you. His mantra was always, ``How can I  help you?'' Time after time, I watched Sam put his arm around someone,  lean in, and offer a word of encouragement or help.   Sam contributed to so many areas of Utah life. He was a successful  businessowner, an effective Salt Lake councilman, an advocate for the  needy, and a loving husband and father. He often brought people  together--Mormon and Catholic, Republican and Democrat--and would  bridge the gaps that confronted us. He represented a better era in  politics in which we focused more on where we agree than where we  disagree.   With Sam's passing, Utah has lost an important member of its  community. Sam was a man whose small stature belied his huge impact.  Elaine and I extend our deepest sympathy and love to his wife, Ann, and  to their four children. May our Heavenly Father's loving arms encircle  them as they mourn his loss and celebrate his life. I will miss my  friend and his kindness and support, but I know that the contributions  he made will continue to bless our State for generations to come.                            ____________________
