TITLE III--DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS       SEC. 301. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 598.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking Mr. Connolly and Mr.  Kinzinger for authoring this excellent bill.   This measure comes before us at a crucial time. As President Trump  takes a sledgehammer to our country's standing in the world, it falls  to the Congress to uphold our relationships with our friends and  partners. Strong alliances and partnerships make a stronger, safer  America, and it is important for our national security to make sure  that our friends can defend themselves against hostile adversaries.  That is especially true for a country like Georgia, who is fighting  President Putin's aggression every single day.   In 2008, Russia invaded and occupied parts of Georgia, flagrantly  breaking international law and violating Georgia's sovereignty and  territorial integrity. And now, over a decade later, Russia hasn't let  up the assault on Georgia. Cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns,  human rights violations--this is what the people of Georgia endure from  Putin's regime all the time. So we must support Georgia's efforts to  protect itself.   The Georgia Support Act calls on the U.S. to continue to support  Georgia's democratic institutions, territorial integrity, and  sovereignty. It also provides critical assistance for Georgia's  struggle against Russian aggression, supporting efforts to boost  cybersecurity and counter Russian disinformation. And it slaps  sanctions on those responsible for human rights violations in the  Russian-occupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.   We should be strengthening our relationship with Georgia and bringing  it into the fold of the EU and NATO. This is a good bill that moves us  in the right direction, showing that Congress stands with Georgia. I  strongly support this measure, and I urge all Members to join me in  doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, October 21, 2019.

Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the author of this important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing. This is a good, strong, bipartisan bill to  support Georgia as it fends off Russian aggression. I thank my Foreign  Affairs Committee colleagues, Mr. Connolly and Mr. Kinzinger, for their  work on this measure.   If you look back at history when the Soviet Union existed, Georgia  was part of the Soviet Union and really felt the yoke of Russian  aggression on their necks. When the Soviet Union broke up and Russia  tried to influence all the surrounding countries, Georgia resisted with  good cause, because Georgia does not want to be part of a country that  makes them subservient.   So it really to me is so important for the United States to support  Georgia. It is in a difficult neighborhood, right near Russia. It faces  constant threats every day. As I and my colleagues have said, Russia is  now occupying a large part of their territory, and it really should not  be left to stand.   Personally, I have said this many times, I think that the West made a  mistake back in 2008 when Georgia tried to become part of NATO and was  turned down. I believe that both Georgia and Ukraine should be part of  NATO. I think that is very important. And I think that is part of the  reason why we see such Russian aggression in both Ukraine and Georgia.   So I hope all Members will join us in supporting the passage of this  bill. The people of Georgia need to know that the United States  Congress stands with them against Putin's aggression.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 552) calling on the Government of the Russian  Federation to provide evidence of wrongdoing or to release United  States citizen Paul Whelan.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 552         Whereas United States citizen Paul Whelan is a resident of       Novi, Michigan, and a United States Marine Corps veteran;        Whereas Paul Whelan traveled to Moscow for the wedding of a       personal friend on December 22, 2018;        Whereas Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Paul       Whelan at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow on December 28, 2018,       and charged him with espionage;        Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison and       continues to be held there more than eight months after his       arrest;        Whereas the Federal Security Service has not provided any       evidence of supposed wrongdoing;        Whereas a Moscow court has extended Paul Whelan's pre-trial       detention multiple times without publicly presenting       justification or evidence of wrongdoing;        Whereas officials from the United States Embassy in Moscow       have routinely had their topics of discussion with Paul       Whelan severely limited by the Federal Security Service;        Whereas even Paul Whelan's Federal Security Service-      appointed lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 2019,       ``[The Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out what they       have, but in this case, we've seen nothing concrete against       Whelan in five months. That means there is nothing.'';        Whereas the United States Ambassador to Russia, Jon       Huntsman, responded on April 12, 2019, to a question about       the detention of Paul Whelan, ``If the Russians have       evidence, they should bring it forward. We have seen nothing.       If there was a case, I think the evidence would have been       brought forward by now.''; and        Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Russian       Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and urged him       to ensure United States citizens are not unjustly held       abroad: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       present credible evidence on the allegations against Paul       Whelan or immediately release him from detention;        (2) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide unrestricted consular access to Paul Whelan while he       remains in detention;        (3) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       ensure Paul Whelan is afforded due process and universally       recognized human rights;        (4) encourages the President and the Secretary of State to       continue to press the Government of the Russian Federation at       every opportunity and urge the Russian Government to       guarantee a fair and transparent judicial process without       undue delay in accordance with its international legal       obligation; and        (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Paul Whelan and       expresses hope that their ordeal can soon be brought to an       end.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 552.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we stand here on the House floor, an American citizen  is being wrongfully held in a Russian prison without trial, without any  evidence of his supposed crime, denied his rights, suffering, deprived  of the medical attention he so desperately needs.   This is how Vladimir Putin is treating Paul Whelan, a U.S. citizen  who has been unjustly imprisoned in Russia for almost a year. There has  been no evidence offered to show that Mr. Whelan has done anything  wrong or anything to deserve this horrific imprisonment with no end in  sight.   Paul's family in Michigan wants to see him returned home safely, and  Congress must stand with them and demand justice.   H. Res. 552 sends a strong message from Congress. It calls on Russia  to either offer up some legitimate evidence  [[Page H8363]]  that justifies why they have Mr. Whelan in prison or immediately  release him and let him come home to his family in the United States.   We can't accept this current situation to go on any longer with Mr.  Whelan languishing in his cell with no understanding of why he is being  subjected to this horror.   Sadly, this injustice is what life is like in Putin's Russia. There  is no independent judicial process. There are no rights for defendants.  There is abuse, mistreatment, corruption. It is critical that we all  keep this in mind. That is why it is so important for the United States  to stand strong in condemning Putin and upholding our commitment to the  rule of law.   I want to thank Ms. Stevens for her hard work in offering this  measure. As Mr. Whelan's congressional representative, she has been  tirelessly pushing for Paul's release as has the entire Michigan  delegation.   This is a good bipartisan measure I am pleased to support. I urge all  Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), the author of this important resolution    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Representative Stevens for her hard work  on this measure.   Paul Whelan, an American citizen, as my colleagues have mentioned,  has endured mistreatment in a Russian prison without the Russian  Government offering up any evidence that he has done anything wrong.   H. Res. 552 calls on the Russian Government to either provide some  evidence of wrongdoing to explain Mr. Whelan's imprisonment or release  Mr. Whelan immediately so he can come home to the United States and  receive the proper medical treatment he so urgently needs. He and his  family have suffered enough as part of Putin's political games.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  their strong support for this resolution. It is a good measure. I urge  all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 32) expressing the sense of  Congress regarding the execution-style murders of United States  citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Serbia in  July 1999.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 32         Whereas brothers Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were       citizens of the United States, born in Chicago, Illinois, to       ethnic Albanian parents from what is today the Republic of       Kosovo, and who subsequently lived in Hampton Bays, New York;        Whereas the three Bytyqi brothers responded to the       brutality of the conflict associated with Kosovo's separation       from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of       Yugoslavia of which Serbia was a constituent republic by       joining the so-called ``Atlantic Brigade'' of the Kosovo       Liberation Army in April 1999;        Whereas a Military-Technical Agreement between the       Government of Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Council came       into effect on June 10, 1999, leading to a cessation of       hostilities;        Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were arrested on June 23, 1999,       by Serbian police within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia       when the brothers accidently crossed what was then an       unmarked administrative border while escorting an ethnic       Romani family who had been neighbors to safety outside       Kosovo;        Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were jailed for 15 days for       illegal entry into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in       Prokuplje, Serbia, until a judge ordered their release on       July 8, 1999;        Whereas instead of being released, the Bytyqi brothers were       taken by a special operations unit of the Serbian Ministry of       Internal Affairs to a training facility near Petrovo Selo,       Serbia, where all three were executed;        Whereas at the time of their murders, Ylli was 25, Agron       was 23, and Mehmet was 21 years of age;        Whereas Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was removed       from office on October 5, 2000, following massive       demonstrations protesting his refusal to acknowledge and       accept election results the month before;        Whereas in the following years, the political leadership of       Serbia has worked to strengthen democratic institutions, to       develop stronger adherence to the rule of law, and to ensure       respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including       as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia evolved into a State       Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, which itself       dissolved when both republics proclaimed their respective       independence in June 2006;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, was       informed on July 17, 2001, that the bodies of Ylli, Agron,       and Mehmet Bytyqi were found with their hands bound and       gunshot wounds to the back of their heads, buried atop an       earlier mass grave of approximately 70 bodies of murdered       civilians from Kosovo;        Whereas Serbian authorities subsequently investigated but       never charged those individuals who were part of the Ministry       of Internal Affairs chain of command related to this crime,       including former Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko       Stojilkovic, Assistant Minister and Chief of the Public       Security Department Vlastimir Djordjevic, and special       operations training camp commander Goran ``Guri''       Radosavljevic;        Whereas Vlajko Stojilkovic died of a self-inflicted gunshot       wound in April 2002 prior to being transferred to the custody       of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former       Yugoslavia where he had been charged with crimes against       humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war during       the Kosovo conflict;        Whereas Vlastimir Djordjevic was arrested and transferred       to the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the       former Yugoslavia in June 2007, and sentenced in February       2011 to 27 years imprisonment (later reduced to 18 years) for       crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs       of war committed during the Kosovo conflict;        Whereas Goran ``Guri'' Radosavljevic is reported to reside       in Serbia, working as director of a security consulting firm       in Belgrade, and is a prominent member of the governing       political party;        Whereas the Secretary of State designated Goran       Radosavljevic of Serbia under section 7031(c) of the       Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs       Appropriations Act, 2018 as ineligible for entry into the       United States due to his involvement in gross violations of       human rights;        Whereas two Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs officers,       Sretan Popovic and Milos Stojanovic, were charged in 2006 for       crimes associated with their involvement in the detention and       transport of the Bytyqi brothers from Prokuplje to Petrovo       Selo, but acquitted in May 2012 with an appeals court       confirming the verdict in March 2013;        Whereas the Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic promised       several high ranking United States officials to deliver       justice in the cases of the deaths of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet       Bytyqi;        Whereas no individual has ever been found guilty for the       murders of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi or of any other       crimes associated with their deaths; and        Whereas no individual is currently facing criminal charges       regarding the murder of the Bytyqi brothers despite many       promises by Serbian officials to resolve the case: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--        (1) those individuals responsible for the murders in July       1999 of United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi       in Serbia should be brought to justice;        (2) it is reprehensible that no individual has ever been       found guilty for executing the Bytyqi brothers, or of any       other crimes associated with their deaths, and that no       individual is even facing charges for these horrible crimes;        (3) the Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries       and offices, including the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's       Office, should make it a priority to investigate and       prosecute as soon as possible those current or former       officials believed to be responsible for their deaths,       directly or indirectly;        (4) the United States should devote sufficient resources       fully to assist and properly to monitor efforts by the       Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices       to investigate and prosecute as soon as possible those       individuals believed to be responsible for their deaths,       directly or indirectly; and        (5) progress in resolving this case, or the lack thereof,       should remain a significant factor determining the further       development of relations between the United States and the       Republic of Serbia.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 32.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Mr. Zeldin for authoring  this resolution.   This measure is one particularly close to my heart. In my career in  Congress, I have had long dealings with the Albanian community both in  the Balkans and in America, so this one really hurts since I know the  family of these three brothers who were murdered.   Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were three brothers from New York  State who were killed execution-style by Serbian officials after they  mistakenly crossed the unmarked Serbia-Kosovo border. Their bodies were  discovered with their hands bound behind their backs in a mass grave in  2001.   Serbian President Vucic promised me 3 years ago that his government  would bring the murderers to justice, but this hasn't happened. In  fact, there isn't even a serious criminal investigation underway. This  is appalling.   Sadly, it is part of a pattern we see with Serbian war criminals  responsible for crimes against the people of Kosovo.   The Bytyqi brothers are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to  post-conflict justice in Serbia. We had a hearing on the Foreign  Affairs Committee several weeks ago about this very topic.   Approaching 3 years ago, the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center  released a dossier detailing the murder of nearly 1,000 Kosovars,  killed by Serbs in Kosovo, then transported to Serbia, and dumped in a  mass grave.   The U.S. Government has raised this atrocity with the Serbian war  crimes prosecutor. But once again, no one has been held accountable,  although I believe with all my heart that Serbian authorities know who  is responsible for this.   Let's be clear, if Serbia wants to join the West and its  institutions, they must deal with their past and prosecute those  responsible for war crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage our EU friends to hold Serbia to this  standard when considering Serbia's candidacy.   Today's resolution makes it clear that Serbia must fully investigate  the Bytyqi brothers' case and bring justice to the families of these  murdered New Yorkers. Their family currently lives in New York in Mr.  Zeldin's district.   It also calls on the U.S. Government to encourage and assist a  successful prosecution of this case.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure, and I again thank Mr.  Zeldin for his excellent work and partnership with me in trying to push  the Serbian Government to find justice for these New Yorkers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good measure to seek justice for this  senseless murder of three innocent American citizens, three innocent  New Yorkers. We cannot allow this horrific crime to continue to go  unpunished.   As Mr. Zeldin mentioned, and others who we have worked with, we have  raised this repeatedly with the Government of Serbia to no avail. They  know exactly who killed these American citizens. They know what  happened and why their bodies were dumped in a mass grave. They are  withholding it.   It is unconscionable that these American citizens cannot get justice,  that their families cannot get justice.   We will not stop. I know Mr. Zeldin and I won't, and other people  won't, until we get justice and answers as to who killed these American  citizens, the Bytyqi brothers, who were born in the United States of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join me in supporting this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
