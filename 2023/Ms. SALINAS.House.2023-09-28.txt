 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill for  reasons beyond what I can list in the allotted time, but primarily  because it would force America to abdicate its leadership role on the  global stage.   This bill contains too many harmful provisions to count, but for the  benefit of the American people, I will do my best to summarize a few of  them:   This bill would severely reduce our ability to combat the climate  crisis.   It would make massive cuts to global health programming through USAID  and the WHO.   It would shortchange economic and humanitarian assistance and global  peacekeeping funding.   And as if those self-imposed restrictions on our international  leadership weren't bad enough, my Republican colleagues are using this  bill as a Trojan horse for more poison pill riders, just as they have  done with other appropriations bills.   The majority's obsession with anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ, and anti- diversity politics precludes them from putting forth a bill that has  any chance of becoming law.   Specifically, their bill would reinstate the global gag rule and  prohibit contributions to the UNPFA, restricting women and girls around  the world from receiving the reproductive and maternal healthcare they  need.   They are just not content to undermine reproductive freedom at home.  No, they need to take their draconian quest abroad to the tremendous  shame of the majority of Americans who value reproductive freedom.   Mr. Chair, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to recommit  this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I would have  offered the motion with an important amendment to this bill.   My amendment would strike the global gag rule and allow contributions  to UNPFA.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support reproductive rights and believe we  should be a global leader guaranteeing it to all women and girls,  regardless of where they may have been born. I hope my colleagues will  join me in voting for the motion to recommit.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Ms. Salinas moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4665 to the       Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Strike section 7057.     Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
