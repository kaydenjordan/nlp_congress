 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Casey's question is directed to the House managers:         In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton writes that the       subjects of impeachment are ``those offenses which proceed       from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from       the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' Could you       speak broadly to the duties of being a public servant and how       you believe the President's actions have violated this trust?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate.   President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign  nation to interfere in our elections for his own benefit, and then he  actively obstructed Congress in his attempts to investigate his abuses  of power. These actions are clearly impeachable. The key purpose of the  impeachment clause is to control abuses of power by public officials;  that is to say, conduct that violates the public trust.   Since the founding of the Republic, all impeachments have been based  on accusations of conduct that violates the public trust. When the  Framers wrote the phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' they  intended to capture the conduct of public officials, like President  Trump, who showed no respect for their oath of office. President Trump  ignored the law and the Constitution in order to gain a political  favor. The Constitution and his oath of office prohibited him from  using his official favor to corruptly benefit himself rather than the  American people. That is exactly what the President did, illegally  withholding military aid and a White House meeting until the President  of Ukraine committed to announcing an investigation of President  Trump's opponent.   In the words of one constitutional scholar: ``If what we're talking  about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable.''   This is precisely the misconduct that the Framers created the  Constitution, including impeachment, to protect against.   I want to add something in reference to some of the comments that  were made by some of the President's counsel a few minutes ago. They  talk about the subpoena power, about the failure of the House to act  properly in the subpoena power because they said the House did not  delegate by rule--have a resolution authorizing the committees to offer  subpoena power. They apparently haven't read the fact that the House  has generally delegated all subpoena power to the committees. It wasn't  true at the time of the Watkins case; it wasn't true 15 years ago; but  it is true now.   Second, the House power is the sole power of impeachment and the  manner of its exercise may not be challenged from outside. Whether the  President should be convicted upon our accusation is a question for the  Senate, but how we reached our accusation is a matter solely for the  House.   Thirdly, they talked about executive privilege, and they pointed to  the Nixon case that established executive privilege; that the President  has a right to private, candid advice and, therefore, executive  privilege is established. The same case says that executive privilege  cannot be used to hide wrongdoing and, in fact, President Nixon was  ordered in that case to turn over all his material.   Thirdly, there is a doctrine of waiver. You cannot use executive  privilege or any other privilege if you waive it. The moment President  Trump said that John Bolton was not telling the truth when he said that  the President told him of the improper quid pro quo, he waived any  executive privilege that might have existed. He cannot characterize a  conversation and put it into the public domain and then claim executive  privilege against it. The President, by the way, never claimed  executive privilege ever. He has claimed, instead, absolute immunity--a  ridiculous doctrine that the President has absolute immunity from any  questioning by the Congress or by anybody else. It is a claim rejected  by every court that has ever considered it.   Finally, the difference from this President and any other President  claiming privilege of any sort is that this President told us in  advance: I will defy all subpoenas, whatever their nature. I will make  sure that the Congress gets no information. In other words: I am  absolute. The Congress cannot question what I do because I will defy  all subpoenas. I will make sure they get no information, no matter what  their rights, no matter what their situation.   That is the subject of our article II of the impeachment because that  is a claim of absolute monarchical power.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
