 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me this  opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, America is home to some of the most creative,  innovative, inspirational people imaginable. When empowered, Americans  design and build in ways that change the world, and change it for the  better.   But far too often, our innovators are bogged down by red tape, thanks  to a government that thinks it knows better how to think, how to  believe, how to run their businesses, and how to live their lives. It  is not only making life more difficult. It costs us nearly $2 trillion  a year. That is about $15,000 a family. So we are rolling back these  regulations and offering much-needed relief to families and businesses  across the country.   Thanks to my good friend, Representative Jason Smith's leadership,  the SCRUB Act provides another powerful tool that gives control back to  the American people through their Representatives. This bill creates a  long, overdue process to identify ineffective, outdated, and  duplicative regulations for repeal, with priority being given to the  older, major, more expensive rules.   We made a promise to the American people. Their voice matters in our  government. We are going to do whatever we can to restore that voice  and put it at the center of every decision we make.   I am proud of Representative Smith's work to rein in government. I am  proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Farenthold).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Farenthold).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   You know, some time ago, when I first got involved in this political  processing, I made it known that I felt that the silent killer of  American business was the regulatory regime that we have in place,  where over 50 years this Congress has ceded its authority to  unelectable, unaccountable bureaucrats. Today we have 175,000 pages in  the Code of Federal Register that is evidence of that. It is time that  we, as a Congress, on behalf of our constituency, on behalf of the  future well-being of this country, take back that authority with  oversight and accountability through this SCRUB Act.   It has been said that there is approximately, on average, $20,000 a  year per employee of a manufacturer that is attributable just to  compliance with regulation. We need to make sure that we have our  manufacturers, our businesses, doing that which they do best within a  reasonable regulatory scheme, and that is what this act offers: a  reasonable regulatory scheme that allows Congress who has the  authority--actually has the only authority--to hold accountable these  unelectable bureaucrats. The SCRUB Act will allow us to do that.   It will allow due process through a discovery process. More  importantly, the review board, the commission, the five bipartisan  members who are appointed by the President must be confirmed by the  Senate. This, in and of itself, is a sense of due process, a sense of  accountability, and, more importantly, a strong sense of purpose that  the American people would want to see this Congress be able to go in  and take back the authority that they have delegated--at sometimes  recklessly--to these bureaucratic organizations.   We talk about the $30 million. I know the $30 million is always big  in any equation that you have, but when you allow the $30 million to be  spent over 5 years and you allow that to have the removal of certain  regulations, you will pay for this $30 million 10 times over in no time  at all.   So it is with a sense of advocacy on behalf of not only congressional  authority, but also a sense of advocacy on behalf of American business  and the future economic growth of this country, that I ask my  colleagues to wholeheartedly support the SCRUB Act.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chair, although I am not in opposition to the  amendment, I do wish to speak in support and further explain my  support, because I believe that the gentleman from Virginia offers some  very good merit to his amendment.   The amendment clarifies that the commissioners are covered by the  Ethics in Government Act, which is in line with current law.  Commissioners should be free from financial conflict as much as any  other Federal employee should. The Beyer amendment prohibits the  appointment of a commissioner to the retrospective regulatory review  commission who has been a registered lobbyist in the previous 2 years.   Ensuring commissioners are not lobbyists with financial interests in  the commission's work is in line with the commission's goal of  identifying wasteful or unfair regulations. The 2-year ban allows  genuine experts with some past lobbying experience to contribute their  knowledge to the commission. This provision is very similar to the  President's 2-year ban on former lobbyists working in the  administration.   For those reasons, I do support the amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).   The amendment was agreed to.                                time  1500                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-20.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 14, after line 22, insert the following new       subparagraph (and redesignate the following subparagraph       accordingly):        (K) Whether, and the extent to which, the repeal of the       rule or set of rules would impact public health.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman  from California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of this  amendment to H.R. 998. As drafted, the SCRUB Act requires Federal  agencies to repeal existing regulations to offset the cost of new  regulations. The bill also authorizes up to $30 million for a new  commission to review the Code of Federal Regulations and recommend  regulatory repeals.   This commonsense amendment ensures the impacts of public health,  including the costs and benefits associated with those impacts, are  considered under processes established by the SCRUB Act. This, I  believe, is a reasonable improvement to the bill. It ensures that  Federal agencies appropriately consider the true costs and benefits of  Federal rules with an eye towards saving hard-earned taxpayer money.   As a member of the California State Senate, I worked with a  Republican administration to help enact this legislation as the first- ever health act of its type in the country in a State. It was based on  the sensible premise that understanding the impacts of government  actions on public health not only saves lives, but saves money.   This effort helped provide California State agencies with the  direction they needed to effectively collaborate on the complex  environmental, financial, and sustainability factors that contribute to  poor health and inequities. Over the 6 years of its existence, this  policy has resulted in increased collaboration across large State  agencies, saving taxpayer money while promoting improved public health  throughout the Nation's largest State.   Today, U.S. taxpayers face a growing burden of largely preventable  chronic illnesses. Heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes are but  a few of the myriad health issues that millions of Americans face every  day that also drive many of their financial and professional decisions.   In many of our most disadvantaged communities, fewer resources are  available to benefit health outcomes that are clearly seen in the  levels of chronic illness in these communities and shorter life  expectancies. It doesn't take a genius to connect the dots of  government policies on public health in our economy.   If the goal of this legislation is eliminating existing regulations  to pay for new regulations, doesn't it make business sense to  understand the impacts of these decisions on our Nation's public  health? For example, eliminating the Department of Labor's silica rule  might save an employer the expense of  [[Page H1378]]  purchasing mitigation equipment, but does that employer truly save  money if his health insurance premiums go up due to associated  respiratory illness?   When the majority pushed to eliminate the Department of the  Interior's stream protection rule, thereby allowing mountaintop mining  companies to dump potentially toxic mining debris in nearby streams,  there was little consideration to the costs associated with mitigating  the inevitable drinking water contamination and healthcare costs of  those who will be sickened after drinking contaminated water.   This amendment ensures that Federal agencies, at the very least,  consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a  regulation. This amendment will help to go a long way in preventing  unnecessary healthcare costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive  improvement to the bill.   If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating Federal  regulations, I hope that they agree that at least we can make sure that  this independent commission will at least consider the benefits of  public health as they do their analysis. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on this commonsense amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 998, the  SCRUB Act.   As currently drafted, the SCRUB Act requires federal agencies to  repeal existing regulations to offset the cost of new regulations. The  bill also authorizes up to $30 million for a new commission to review  the Code of Federal Regulations and recommend regulatory repeals.   This commonsense amendment ensures that impacts to public health,  including the costs associated with those impacts, are considered under  processes established by the SCRUB Act. This is a reasonable  improvement to the bill ensures that federal agencies appropriately  consider the true costs and benefits of federal rules with an eye  towards saving hard-earned taxpayer money.   As a member of the California State Senate, I helped to enact  legislation focused on promoting public health throughout the state  while saving taxpayer dollars. Based on the sensible premise that  understanding the impacts of government actions on public health not  only saves lives, but saves money.   This effort helped provide California state agencies with the  direction they needed to effectively collaborate on the complex  environmental, financial, and sustainability factors that contribute to  poor health and inequities. Over six years of existence, this policy  has resulted in increased collaboration across state agencies, saving  taxpayers money while promoting improved public health throughout the  state.   Today, U.S. taxpayers face a growing burden of largely preventable  chronic illnesses. Heart disease, stroke, obesity, and diabetes are but  a few of the myriad health issues that millions of Americans face every  day that also drive many of their financial and professional decisions.

This amendment ensures that federal agencies, at the very least,  consider the health impacts and costs associated with eliminating a  regulation. This effort will go a long way in preventing unnecessary  health care costs, which I hope we can agree is a positive improvement  to the bill.   If my colleagues across the aisle insist on eliminating federal  regulations, it only makes sense to ensure that removing such rules  does not harm the public.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``YES'' on this commonsense amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Florida is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Madam Chair, this commission that we have here in the SCRUB  Act is established to clear out old and unnecessary regulations. It  currently requires the commission to consider whether the rule could be  repealed without significant adverse effects, whether the rule is  unnecessary, whether the costs are justified by the benefits, and  certain other criteria.   I think that the consideration of public health certainly fits within  whether the rule would have significant adverse effects, whether it is  necessary, and whether the benefits justify the cost. Health, safety,  and welfare of the American people is foremost to what we do, and I  laud my colleague from California for filing this amendment.   This amendment clarifies that the commission should consider the  impact on public health of repealing any regulation. I think that,  again, my colleague from California gave fine examples of that  particular balance.   We agree that we want regulations that are necessary to protect  public health. I am excited to see one of my Democratic colleagues  working with us to improve regulatory reform legislation. I look  forward to future opportunities to continue this work.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I look forward to, in the future,  working on true bipartisan regulation. I think it is one of those  areas, at least in my experience in local and State government, that we  should be working in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill I do  not believe accomplishes that.   So regulatory oversight is probably the most important thing we could  do, and I hope that we can do it in a bipartisan way in the future. I  would encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. McSally    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in House Report 115-20.   Ms. McSALLY. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 14, after line 22, insert the following new       subparagraph (and redesignate the subsequent subparagraph       accordingly):        (K) Whether the rule or set of rules is in full compliance       with the requirements of section 801(a)(1)(A) of title 5,       United States Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.   Ms. McSALLY. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of the underlying legislation, H.R. 998, the  SCRUB Act, and urge adoption of my amendment.   The Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission created in the SCRUB  Act is an important tool to help Congress reclaim its constitutional  role of serving as a check to the executive branch and will help bring  back jobs and opportunity to hardworking Americans.   In 2016 alone, the Obama administration added 97,110 pages to the  Federal Register. That is over 75 times more than the Bible, without  any of the good news. These rules and regulations accumulate with no  relief and touch every aspect of life all the way down to recordkeeping  for contact lenses, vending machine food labeling, and walk-in freezer  testing.   Of the over 3,500 final regulations issued in 2016, 34 will cost over  $100 million, and 105 are deemed to have significant impacts on small  business. We  [[Page H1379]]  need to reduce this regulatory burden on American households and small  businesses, which costs the economy over $2 trillion per year.   The Congressional Review Act gives Congress 60 legislative days to  introduce and pass into law a disapproval resolution overturning a rule  or a regulation. Once agency actions are overturned using this process,  agencies are unable to reissue, substantially in the same form, a  regulation or guidance in the future.   A little known provision in the Congressional Review Act requires  Federal agencies to submit to Congress and the Government  Accountability Office a report on the rule or regulation. The 60-day  clock for congressional action begins either when the rule is published  or when Congress receives this report, whichever comes later.   Independent studies have shown many rules since 1996 have been  implemented without this report, often due to Federal agencies' push to  hastily implement new rules. This means that there are still many rules  and regulations that may still be eligible for Congress to overturn  using the Congressional Review Act disapproval resolutions process.   My amendment to the SCRUB Act requires the Retrospective Regulatory  Review Commission to consider for removal rules and regulations for  which Congress did not receive the report as required by the  Congressional Review Act. According to GAO, approximately 29 percent of  final rules failed to submit required reports in 2013. This prudent  step will help give Congress the opportunity to, where appropriate,  make use of the Congressional Review Act disapproval process to  expedite the rollback of flawed rules and regulations that are choking  our economy.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Long). The gentleman from Florida is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the commission is permitted, under this bill,  to spend $30 million over 5 years for administrative purposes. By  removing the funding in this amendment, the commission will not be able  to hire staff, rent office space, establish the public website as  required in the bill, or hold the public meetings, which are also  required in the bill. This amendment essentially guts the bill.   The commission established under this bill has a momentous job ahead  of it. The Code of Federal Regulations totals more than 178,000 pages.  This is approximately 36,000 pages of regulations for review every year  of the 5 years the commission has to conduct its work.   But it is not just simply reading the pages. There is work behind  understanding whether the regulations are effective. There is outreach  and public hearings to understand how the regulations are or aren't  effective.   I believe the savings from eliminating unnecessary costs and the  improved efficiency from weeding out unneeded regulations will far  outweigh the resources applied to this effort.   The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that regulations  impose a cost on the economy of $1.8 trillion. Who bears that cost but  the consumers? This amendment would gut the bill. $30 million over 5  years is more than reasonable, considering the economic impact that  these regulations have had on the American business and the American  economy. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by  [[Page H1381]]  the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. McNerney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in House Report 115-20.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 31, line 17, insert after ``Code'' the following: ``,       except that the term does not include any rule relating to       the physical and cyber security of the bulk-power system (as       defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824o(a)), including any emergency action to protect and       restore reliability of the bulk-power system''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman  from California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It  exempts from the bill any agency rule relating to the physical and  cybersecurity of the bulk power system, including any emergency action  to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised  of facilities and control systems necessary for operating an  interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reliability.   Our Nation's electrical system touches each and every part of our  lives, hospitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our  national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our  Nation's critical infrastructure because all other components of our  infrastructure depend on it.   The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of high-voltage  transmission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines.  This network is undergoing a transformation. There are an ever- increasing number of devices that are connected to the grid;  technological advancements are allowing for efficiencies and cheaper  production of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and  consumers have more choices and more control. With increased  digitization, automation and interaction also have enhanced grid  flexibility and security.   While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as  new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional  physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution  systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats  and challenges in detecting problems, responding to intrusions, and  keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The long-term  health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared  responsibility between communities, consumers, industry, and  government.   Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of  industry stakeholders and the Federal Government working well together,  when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding.   Transmission and distribution providers have taken it upon themselves  to establish industry-led standards, best practices, and supply chain  management when it comes to grid security. They have worked well with  NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection  standards for the bulk power system.   These Critical Infrastructure Protection standards cover critical  cyber asset identification, security management, personnel and  training, electronic security, physical security, systems security,  incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are  72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforcement.  These standards aren't always perfect, but they do represent compromise  and collaboration.   A well-protected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power  outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and  data suggests that electrical system outages attributable to weather- related events are increasing, costing the U.S. economy an estimated  $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are projected  to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone  by the year 2020, and are expected to invest nearly $53 billion to  enhance the grid.                                time  1530    These are significant investments, but essential investments as well.  A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit  from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including  from the Federal Government.   We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have  partnered together via the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium. We should  provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its  mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient,  and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative  technologies to the grid.   We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are  seeking to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and  technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt.   I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify  and remove regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical  Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures  that Federal agencies will have the flexibility needed to respond to  challenges without sacrificing any other necessary protections.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this bill requires the commission to identify  regulations that should be repealed. These are all regulations under  the bill. While I appreciate my colleague from California's efforts in  his amendment, I just cannot support it.   The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out of date,  no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete. No regulations  should be exempt from this bill.   Ensuring the physical and cybersecurity of the bulk power system is  absolutely important and critical. We should know whether or not the  existing regulations are effective and are useful.   This amendment would prevent the commission from reviewing these  important regulations and ensuring that they are current and effective.   I would urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).   The amendment was rejected.                Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Krishnamoorthi    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in House Report 115-20.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned earlier, the bill requires the  commission to identify regulations--all regulations--which should be  repealed. The commission focuses on rules and regulations that are out  of date, no longer useful, and otherwise unnecessary or obsolete.  Again, no regulations should be exempt from this bill.   Ensuring the safety of the National Airspace System is critically  important. We should know whether or not the existing regulations are  effective and useful. This amendment would prevent the commission from  reviewing these very important regulations and ensuring that they are  not only current but also effective.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate the argument about an  unelected commission, I must say that these regulations are already  being promulgated by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.   Again, if we are going to have to have a review--an oversight--of our  regulatory scheme, we should not exempt any regulations. I, therefore,  would submit that this amendment would do just that. It would create a  slippery slope of exceptions. Therefore, I, again, would urge my  colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, everyone agrees that airport noise is very  annoying.   Effective regulations that protect our communities from unwarranted  noise are very important. However, regulations that impose excessive  and costly restrictions that are ineffective at achieving their goals  do not help anyone.   Why not take a look at these regulations and just consider whether  they are working?   If they are, then the regulation stays in place and we continue to  protect our communities from unwarranted noise. If those regulations  are not working, then we repeal them and put in regulations that  achieve the goals and reduce costs.   There is no reason why we should create special carve-outs from the  commission's consideration.   For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will tell you that regulations are  regulations. They need to be reviewed at every level. What the SCRUB  Act offers is that opportunity. What this amendment does is limit that  ability.  [[Page H1383]]    For those reasons, I, again, urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
