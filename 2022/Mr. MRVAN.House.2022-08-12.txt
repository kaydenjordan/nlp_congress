 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Inflation  Reduction Act, the historic measure that takes action to lower costs  for individuals and families in northwest Indiana and throughout our  Nation.   Of particular importance to me are the provisions that finally  address the unfair disadvantage our seniors face when deciding between  missing a meal or missing a prescription drug.   As a local elected official, I sat at the table with individuals  making those choices, and we were able to find solutions. I appreciate  more than anything that, under this legislation, Medicare will  negotiate certain prescription drug prices, limit out-of-pocket costs  for insulin at $35 per month, and, for the first time ever, cap  Medicare part D out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000. It is to the  seniors' advantage to have this passed.   This is real progress that provides real relief to seniors, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.
