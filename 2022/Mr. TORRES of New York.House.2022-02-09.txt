 Mr. Speaker, I proudly stand before you to  celebrate the 14th independence of Kosovo, one of the world's youngest  nations.   Rising from the ruins of ethnic cleansing at the murderous hands of  one of the worst dictators in the 20th century, Kosovo has built a  burgeoning democracy in whose heart the United States holds a special  place.   Indeed, the U.S. has no greater friend in southeast Europe than  Kosovo, and Kosovo should have no greater friend in the world than the  U.S. We owe it to that friendship, as well as to the greater cause of  democracy, to stand firmly with Kosovo as it seeks universal  recognition from the international community and membership in both the  EU and NATO.   The time has come for Kosovo to be given the full respect and  recognition that an independent country deserves.   The United States must stand with those that not only stand with  America but also stand for America. Kosovo stands for the American  vision of a more democratic world.                            ____________________
