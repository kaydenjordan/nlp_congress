 Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend, the new chairman of  our committee, for yielding to me.   Mr. Chairman, this tiny--I will call it modest--2.6 percent pay raise  authorized by H.R. 790 does not begin to make up for the long overdue  pay raise our Federal workers are due. It does not begin to make up for  the puny raises--sometimes as low as 1 percent, sometimes no raise at  all--that our Federal workers have had to bear, and it certainly does  not make up for 35 days of no pay for the longest shutdown in American  history.   It is particularly unconscionable to follow the Trump shutdown with a  Trump pay freeze. Every Member in this House represents Federal  workers. Every Member should be on the floor speaking for them.   For years, Congress recognized pay increase equity between civilian  and military personnel. But perhaps with the disparagement of Federal  workers by Republicans and Republican Presidents, and perhaps to save  money, we no longer even try to bring together these two parts of our  workforce. It is hard to justify bifurcation of the civilian from the  military workforce today.    For example, what about the many who work side by side  such as the civil servants who guard our borders who are hardly  different from the soldiers who do the same thing around the country?   The 2.6 percent pay raise proposed here does not begin to make up for  the 32 percent average difference between Federal and private-sector  employees who do the same work according to the council that measures  this work every year. But for now, after 35 days of no pay, now is the  time to try to insinuate some fairness into pay for Federal workers  with this modest 2 percent pay raise.                                time  1130
