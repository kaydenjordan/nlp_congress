Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 1259,  which would require the VA to submit a report to Congress at the end of  each fiscal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to senior-level  executives.   In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses,  which was 24 percent more than they received in 2014. The average bonus  for a senior executive was $10,000.   I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans  admirably each day. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who  are grateful for the compassionate care that they receive from local VA  clinics throughout upstate New York. VA employees should be fairly  compensated for their work and awarded for their achievement.   It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just this  month, an audit of several VA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia  revealed that wait times continue to be misrepresented and that nearly  14,000 veterans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found  that veterans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health  specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of 6  days. In light of this information, the American people are right to  wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year.   My amendment adds a simple reporting requirement to the bill that  will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency  to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount  of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of  the individuals and the location of their employment. Given the  patterns of mismanagement at the VA, the American people deserve to  know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. This bill increases  transparency over the bonus process without placing any undue burdens  on the agency.   I would encourage my colleagues to support it, and I thank the  committee for the opportunity to offer this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), who is the chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), who is the chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR.

ACCOUNTABILITY OF SUPERVISORS AT DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR ADDRESSING PERFORMANCE OF                     EMPLOYEES.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my second amendment to H.R. 1259,  Kuster amendment No. 8. I am concerned that an unintended consequence  of the bill before us would be retaliation against whistleblowers at  the VA.   After my 4 years on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and my time  as ranking member of its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I  know that whistleblower protections are a bipartisan issue for our  committee, and I know that this Congress recognizes the incredible  importance of whistleblowers at the VA.   Whistleblowers provided many details that made Congress and the  public aware of the Phoenix scandal. They provided valuable information  in uncovering the Aurora construction debacle. Whistleblowers save  lives and save taxpayer money. Unfortunately, whistleblowers are  sometimes targeted for retaliation by their supervisors. My amendment  seeks to address this.   My amendment requires supervisors to detail their efforts to correct  poor performance and misconduct, efforts that come before the  procedures outlined by this bill. It requires supervisors to detail the  efforts they have made to improve their work environment and ensure  that employees of their team uphold the primary mission of the VA: to  serve and to honor our Nation's veterans.   The amendment will also improve training of supervisors to ensure  they are equipped to be leaders that improve employee performance and  the quality of care at the VA. More importantly, this enhanced training  will include instruction on the rights of whistleblowers and how to  address concerns or complaints raised by them.   These provisions could help to protect those whistleblowers who are  actually experiencing retaliation because it would provide evidence of  the past actions a supervisor has taken to address alleged misconduct,  and it will highlight leadership shortfalls that could implicate  attempted actions taken against an employee.   Together, these provisions will proactively improve the culture of  management at the VA so it reflects the virtue and quality that  Congress has strived to achieve for so many years. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, Kuster No. 8.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
