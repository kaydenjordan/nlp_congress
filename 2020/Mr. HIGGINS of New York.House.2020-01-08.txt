 Mr. Speaker, 4,559 U.S. soldiers have been  killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and occupation. Despite their  sacrifices, 17 years later, Iran now owns and controls Iraq today.   2,430 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan, and today we are  negotiating for peace with the Taliban, the terror organization that is  most responsible for the killing of our soldiers.   These wars have cost nearly $5 trillion and have taken nearly 7,000  lives of U.S. soldiers.   Before going after Qasem Soleimani, the 5,200 U.S. soldiers still  stuck in Iraq should have been evacuated and out of harm's way. But  they weren't. They were put in harm's way by our Commander-in-Chief  during Iran's highly predictable retaliatory attack last night on U.S.  military installations in Iraq.                            ____________________
