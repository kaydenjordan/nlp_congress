 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the committee  for including language that will authorize the Department of Defense to  include the role of women in their research on the National Strategy on  Countering Violent Extremism.   Mr. Chairman, we are learning every day that women are active agents  deterring or engaging in violent extremist movements.   A 2017 report by the organization Futures Without Violence found that  several contemporary organizations, for example, the Islamic State and  Boko Haram, capitalize on women's efforts and demonstrate keen  awareness of the strategic and tactical potential of female extremists.   And while many, many more women are victims of terrorism, some are  serving as supportive wives and mothers to the next generation of  extremists; others are acting as propagandists, fundraisers, and  suicide bombers.   The apparent proliferation of female actors in extremist groups,  often underestimated, calls for strategies that effectively counter  their participation in violent extremism.
