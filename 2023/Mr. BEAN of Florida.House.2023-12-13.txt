 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding  time.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen the evil and hatred of anti-Semitism find  its voice across American college and university campuses, and we have  seen the full force of Jewish hatred grow as student organizations  continue to celebrate the horrific October 7 terrorist attacks.   These institutions have become hate factories that are quick to allow  the spread of anti-Semitism but slow to condemn it, if at all.   Harvard President, Claudine Gay, even said, calling for the genocide  of Jewish students ``depends on the context'' when it comes to  violating the university's code of conduct.   Let me be clear: Today, the faces of modern anti-Semitism in American  education are Harvard, UPenn, MIT.   These institutions have gone from elite to elitist.   At Harvard, if you use the wrong pronouns, that is a violation of  their code of conduct, but violently targeting Jewish students and  calling for the genocide of the Jewish people, that is acceptable  Harvard conduct.   The history of the Holocaust reminds us what will happen when hatred  is met by silence. We cannot stand by while students feel threatened.   It is more than a discussion, Mr. Speaker. It is a call to action.   That is why I am proud to support Representative Stefanik's  resolution condemning anti-Semitism in institutions of higher learning  and specifically condemning Presidents Magill, Gay, and Kornbluth for  failing to denounce the calls for genocide on their campuses.   Mr. Speaker, 17 times it was asked; 17 times they failed the  question.   Mr. Speaker, it bears repeating, anti-Semitism is not activism.
