 Madam Speaker, to paraphrase one of our  founding mothers, Abigail Adams:         A people may let a President fall, yet still remain a       people, but if a President lets his people slip from him, he       is no longer a President.    Just as Abigail Adams warned, Donald Trump has let the people slip  from him. He works for himself, not us.   He tried to extort a foreign government into investigating a  political rival, and he has unlawfully withheld witnesses and evidence.   If we want a democracy, today we must stand for the rule of law.   A vote to impeach is a vote to remain a government that is of, for,  and by the people.   It is a vote born of great fear for our future, but also rooted in  optimism: that if we stand for the truth, for our Constitution, we can  continue to create a country of liberty, justice, and equality for all.
