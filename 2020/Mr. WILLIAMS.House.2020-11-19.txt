 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of National Rural Health  Day and to commend our healthcare providers across the 25th District of  Texas for their determination during this once-in-a-generation public  health crisis.   Throughout COVID-19, these men and women have stepped up to continue  serving Texans and protecting the well-being of our families.   I am proud to closely partner with rural health facilities in our  district like Goodall-Witcher in Clifton and Baylor Scott & White in  Marble Falls, and to provide them with tangible relief and resources  under the CARES Act.   To further support their mission, I introduced the Ensuring  Telehealth Expansion Act that would help ensure ease of care for both  physicians and their patients, especially during the pandemic.   As our world becomes more dependent on technology for healthcare  delivery, it is crucial we adapt by creating policies that ensure the  highest quality of care possible.   To our central Texas doctors, nurses, physicians, first responders,  and all other medical professionals, we simply say thank you.  [[Page H5941]]    May God bless you, may God bless Texas, and may He continue to bless  the United States of America.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
