 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Denise  Burditus.   Denise was a mother of two and a grandmother of three. She was  looking forward to the birth of her fourth grandchild. She had recently  left her job, after 30 years of working at a bank, so she could return  to school and spend more time with her grandchildren.   She went to the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas with her  high school sweetheart and husband of 32 years, Tony Burditus.   Denise is remembered by her friends and family for being full of  life, for always being positive, and for her devotion to her family.   I extend my condolences to Denise Burditus' family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
