 Mr. Speaker, Biden and his  administration have abused power by ignoring Congress for a failing  liberal agenda.   Biden finalized regulations over $200 billion in costs in his first  year and proposed more than $1 trillion in new regulations in 2022 on  consumer's increasing costs.   Such abuse of power is why House Republicans are introducing the  REINS Act led by Congresswoman Kat Cammack of Florida. This will  provide for American families to avoid new costs. It requires  Congressional approval for rules with an annual burden of $100 million.   Examples of Biden executive abuses evading Congress include:   Bans on oil and gas lease sales, increasing gasoline costs.   Mandated, fabricated climate disclosures.   Banning of gas stoves, affecting 40 percent of American homes.   Sadly, an abuse by Biden today is the political prosecution of Donald  Trump.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
