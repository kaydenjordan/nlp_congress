 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing  [[Page H5902]]  outstanding leadership to this issue. And I thank my good friend,  Congresswoman McBath, for her outstanding leadership on helping to  reauthorize this very important legislation that really saves lives.   In my own district, we lost a heroic Sergeant Preston of the Houston  Police Department for one of the most dangerous calls that police get,  domestic violence. He was killed. The 11-year-old son was shot, but,  thank God, he survived. What terrible, senseless violence.   We know that in this program, more than 76,000 people a day are  helped. It is important to take note of the fact that intimate  partnership violence is a crucial element of this legislation. To be  able to reauthorize the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act is to save lives.   In addition, it is important to take note of my amendment that has  been accepted. I look forward to debating it on the floor and the $2  million extra that the State of Texas will give.   But the most important part of it is the recognition that we will  save lives and help to bring families together and to unify the Nation.    As indicated, 76,000 victims of domestic violence  are helped, but 11,000 are unable to get help because of the lack of  funding.   It is important, as well, to note that, on average, more than one in  three women and one in four men in the United States will experience  rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner.   It is also important to relieve the regulations, the strangulations  that were on this bill before. It now opens it to up provide more to  individuals who are suffering.   What we want to do is to end family domestic violence, and what we  want to do is to end that intimate partner violence and bring families  together, protect children. I am supporting this legislation, and I  believe it is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R.  2119, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act,  which makes a good bill even better.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman McBath of Georgia, for  introducing this important legislation which will improve the  protection and prevention for Americans affected by family violence,  domestic violence, and dating violence.   The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the bill by requiring the  Comptroller of the United states to produce a report on the success of  outreach efforts to minority communities.   Through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA),  survivors receive services such as emergency shelter, crisis  counseling, safety planning, and assistance recovering from financial  abuse and housing insecurity.   FVPSA is the only federal funding source dedicated to providing  support to domestic violence shelters and programs.   Madam Speaker, this bill marks an historic effort to acknowledge and  address the unique suffering of family violence survivors from  marginalized communities.   I thank the Rules Committee for including my amendment, because this  amendment is straightforward and makes this important bill even more  effective than it already is.   We must recognize that not all survivors are a monolith.   Different communities and cultures have different perceptions of  domestic violence and reactions to it--therefore different communities  and cultures need different treatments and prevention measures to  address domestic violence.   That is why I am proud to support this bill, which includes  provisions that are tailored to these specific populations.   Such provisions include:   1. Providing new grants to local programs serving culturally specific  or traditionally underserved communities;   2. Increasing access for survivors from racial and ethnic communities  to services by creating a national grant program to build the capacity  to address domestic violence; and   3. Increasing funding for Native American tribes by allocating tribal  grants as a set-aside to acknowledge their sovereign authority.   These are laudable initiatives, and my amendment goes a step '  further to sustain this commitment by adding a requirement that the  Comptroller of the United States must produce a report on the success  of outreach efforts to minorities.   Specifically, my amendment requires the Comptroller General to  include in the study and report described in Section 19 the results of  outreach efforts conducted pursuant to section 308 to certain groups-- including racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities,  tribal populations, and individuals who are geographically isolated-- regarding increasing the availability and ease of access to services.   Simply put, receiving accurate feedback about our efforts will inform  our decision-making, allowing us to adapt and improve upon our programs  to reach more minority survivors.   It is these communities specifically that are in the most need of our  help.   In my home state of Texas, 29 percent of domestic violence victims  are Black despite making up only 12 percent of the population.   The share of domestic violence victims in Texas who are Native  American is twice as much as the proportion of Natives in the general  population.   Madam Speaker, no member should be complacent with these egregious  statistics.   With this bill's increased commitment to prevention and treatment of  family violence, we are sending a message to survivors that you are not  forgotten.   For these reasons, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2119, the  ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement Act.''    Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman very much  for his work, and again let me thank my colleague, Congresswoman  McBath, a member of the Education and Labor Committee and a member of  the Judiciary Committee.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support my amendment, and all of the other  amendments, which in particular my amendment provides an outreach that  I think is extremely crucial to providing an outreach to populations  that have been unnecessarily victims of domestic violence.   I do want to, again, emphasize the issue of Sergeant Preston, who  died in the course of a police encounter with a domestic abuser with a  gun, and to emphasize that an average of 24 people per minute are  victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner  in the United States; more than 12 million women and men over the  course of a year. Nearly 3 in 10 women, or 29 percent, and 1 in 10 men,  in the U.S. have experienced physical violence and/or stalking.    This reauthorization is long overdue. Just under 15 percent of women,  14.8 percent, and 12 percent of men in the U.S. have been injured as a  result of intimate partner violence that included rape, physical  violence, and stalking by an intimate partner. More importantly, how  many of them have been killed?   In my own district, we had a circumstance of a domestic violence  incident where the woman was killed in the bed, and laying next to her  was her newborn infant. The stories are without comparison.   When you talk to women's shelters, the great need that they have and  the funding that is going to come from this particular effort is $2  million to the State of Texas alone. The effort that is most important  is vulnerable women, women of color, and Native Americans. The Tribal  dollars that are in here are crucial as well.   The Violence Against Women Act, I hope that we will see its passage  in the Senate, along with the reauthorizing of the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act as well, because we, too,  address the question of Tribal women.    Madam Speaker, Tribal circumstances are an  enormously difficult circumstance to be engaged in. The abuse in the  Tribal areas, and the utilization of vicious acts then coming out and  not being prosecuted is really unseemly.   But this is going to be intervention. This is going to be saving  lives.   I would just offer, as I close, a comment on who we should expand  this to: the LGBTQ community, the transgender, individuals who have to  deal with the remnants of a rape. That is, of course, a pregnancy that  my State, the State of Texas, has now violated all human dignity with  their abortion bill that not only stops women from engaging with their  faith leader, their family members, and their doctor, but it also  stalks women and sends people out for a bounty to get $10,000.   So this is the kind of uplifting legislation, reauthorization after  10 years, that is going to address the question of women who are  desperately in need and also protect law enforcement officers as well.    Madam Speaker, this is also going to protect law  enforcement officers as well. In tribute and memory to Sergeant  Preston, a veteran of the HPD, the idea of being able to go and help  and come back with your own life and protect those who are being  victimized. The less we have of that and the more intervention that we  have, the more we can save lives.   So I want to claim that this particular legislation is lifesaving. I  ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, which is, in  essence, attempting to get more resources, more information, and  support the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2119,  the ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement Act,'' which  will improve the protection and prevention for Americans affected by  family violence, domestic violence, and dating violence.   I would like to thank my good friend, Congresswoman McBath, for  championing this important legislation and shepherding it to the floor.   Through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA),  survivors receive services such as emergency shelter, crisis  counseling, safety planning, and assistance recovering from financial  abuse and housing insecurity.   The FVPSA supports life-saving services throughout the country via  grants to states, tribal governments, and territories through three  primary sets of activities, all of which are administered by HHS.   First, the FCPSA funds a national domestic violence hotline that  receives calls for assistance related to this violence. The hotline  provides crisis intervention and counseling, maintains a database of  service providers, and provides referrals for victims and others  affected by domestic violence.   Second, FVPSA funds efforts to prevent domestic violence through a  program known as Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and  Leadership Through Allies (DELTA).   Third, FVPSA supports direct services for victims and their families.  Most of this funding is awarded via grants to states, territories, and  tribes.   FVPSA is the only federal funding source dedicated to providing  support to domestic violence shelters and programs.  [[Page H5906]]    FVPSA provides base core funding to support more than 1,600 local  public, private, nonprofit, and faith-based organizations and programs  in their response to the urgent needs of over 1.3 million domestic  violence victims and their children.   In 2020, the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) found  that in just one day, FVPSA-funded programs helped 76,525 victims of  domestic violence.   However, over 11,000 people were unable to be served due to a lack of  funding.   This shortage of funding is especially severe with shelters serving  rural and marginalized populations, and increased funding and  culturally-specific programs are essential to addressing the needs of  these communities.   FVPSA was first passed in 1984 and was most recently reauthorized in  2010. Its authorization expired in 2015.   Madam Speaker, this bill marks an historic effort to acknowledge and  address the unique suffering of family violence survivors from  marginalized communities.   Different communities and cultures have different perceptions of  domestic violence and reactions to it--therefore different communities  and cultures need different treatments and prevention measures to  address domestic violence.   That is why I am proud to support this bill, which includes  provisions that are tailored to these specific populations.   Such provisions include:   1. Providing new grants to local programs serving culturally specific  or traditionally underserved communities;   2. Increasing access for survivors from racial and ethnic communities  to services by creating a national grant program to build the capacity  to address domestic violence; and   3. Increasing funding for Native American tribes by allocating tribal  grants as a set-aside to acknowledge their sovereign authority.   Simply put, receiving accurate feedback about our efforts will inform  our decision-making, allowing us to adapt and improve upon our programs  to reach more minority survivors.   It is these communities specifically that are in the most need of our  help.   In my home state of Texas, 29 percent of domestic violence victims  are Black despite making up only 12 percent of the population.   The share of domestic violence victims in Texas who are Native  American is twice as much as the proportion of Natives in the general  population.   In addition to addressing the special needs of minority communities,  there is a litany of other exciting provisions in this bill that build  upon the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, such as:   1. Increasing the funding authorization level to $253 million to  address chronic underfunding that resulted in 11,000 people not  receiving services in a single day.   2. Technologically updating the National Domestic Violence Hotline  and improving hotline services for underrepresented populations.   3. Authorizing funding for tribal coalitions, which provide support  to tribal domestic violence programs but are not currently authorized  by statute to receive FVPSA funding.   4. Authorizing new grants of up to $150,000 to each state,  territorial and tribal coalition to prevent domestic violence.   A bill of this nature is incredibly important for my home state of  Texas, where it is estimated that 1 in 3 Texans will be a victim of  domestic violence during their lifetime.   Madam Speaker, no member should be complacent with these egregious  statistics.   With this bill's increased commitment to prevention and treatment of  family violence, we are sending a message to survivors that you are not  forgotten.   For these reasons, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2119, the  ``Family Violence and Prevention Services Improvement Act.''    Madam Speaker, I want everybody to know there is  breaking news, and you are going to see something exciting on the floor  of the House tomorrow.   First of all, Go Astros. The big orange is rolling into Atlanta. And  I know the red, white, and blue is in Atlanta, called the Braves. But  we are coming in because there is nothing more meteoric than the  Astros.   And breaking news, we will be on the floor tomorrow with some  exciting challenges. Go Astros, all the way to the World Series.   But I don't mind accepting a challenge, and tomorrow I think we will  have some folks from Atlanta and Georgia and some folks from Texas and  Houston on the floor tomorrow with some breaking news. Go Astros.                            ____________________
