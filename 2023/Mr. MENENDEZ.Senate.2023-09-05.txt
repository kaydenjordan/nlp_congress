POLICY JUSTIFICATION      Australia--M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS)         The Government of Australia has requested to buy up to       twenty-two (22) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems       (HIMARS); sixty (60) M30A1 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket       System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) Pods with Insensitive       Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); forty (40) M31A1 GMLRS       Unitary (GMLRS-U) High Explosive (HE) Pods with IMPS; sixty-      six (66) M30A2 Extended Range (ER)-GMLRS AW Pods; and twenty-      four (24) M31A2 ER GMLRS Unitary (HE) Pods. Also included are       Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) Pods; intercom systems       to support the HIMARS Launcher; M1084A2 HIMARS Re-Supply       Vehicles (RSV); trailers; 9300-SL60TN Forklift, Side Loader;       radio/communication mounts; machine gun mounts; wheel guards;       ruggedized laptops; training; training equipment;       publications for HIMARS and its munitions, and spares;       services; other support equipment; and other related elements       of program and logistic support. The estimated total program       cost is $975 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats, and will enhance       interoperability with U.S. forces and other allied forces.       Australia will use the capability to strengthen its homeland       defense and provide greater security for its critical       infrastructure. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing       this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX; L3Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL; Leonardo       DRS, Arlington, VA; and Oshkosh Corporation, Stafford, VA.       There are no known offset agreements in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Australia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-59       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Ml42 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton Family of Medium       Tactical Vehicles truck chassis and is transportable by C-      130. HIMARS is the modern Army-fielded version of the       Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) M270 launcher and can       fire all of the MLRS Family of Munitions (FOM), including       Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the       Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS       FOM, the HIMARS can engage targets between 15 and 300       kilometers with GPS-aided precision accuracy.        2. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) M31A2       Unitary is the Army's primary munition for units fielding the       M142 HIMARS and M270A1 Multiple Launcher Rocket System (MLRS)       Launchers. The M31 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery       rocket that uses Global Positioning System/Precise       Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)-aided inertial guidance to       deliver a single high-explosive blast fragmentation warhead       accurately and quickly to targets at ranges from 15-70       kilometers. The rockets are fired from a launch pod container       that also serves as the storage and transportation container       for the rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead shares a greater       than 90% commonality with the M31A1 Unitary. The primary       difference between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS-AW is the       replacement of the Unitary's high explosive warhead with a       200-pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against       large area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance and control system, fusing mechanism, multi-option       height of burst capability, and effective range of 15-70km.        4. The Extended Range (ER) GMLRS provides a persistent,       responsive, all-weather, rapidly deployed, long-range,       surface-to-surface, area- and point-precision strike       capability. The XM403 Alternative Warhead (AW) carries a 200-      pound fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives       which, upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The XM404 Unitary variant is       a 200-pound class unitary with a steel blast-fragmentation       case, designed for low collateral damage against point       targets. The ER GMLRS maintains the accuracy and       effectiveness demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS out to a       maximum range of 150 km while also including a new Height of       Burst (HOB) capability.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology       being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary       in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to       Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 23-66       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Stryker Family of Vehicles (FoV) are all derived       from the Flat Bottom Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV). The ICV       supplies the common suspension (except for the ICVD), drive       line, major C4 components, and hull to the FoV. The FoV is       powered by a 350 horsepower C7 Caterpillar diesel engine and       runs on eight wheels that feature run flat capability and a       central tire inflation system (CTIS). It contains a vehicle       height management system to aid in transportability. The FoV       is supported by a communications suite that integrates the       Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)       radio family and Global Positioning System (GPS) and their       commercially exportable equivalents, and has a Mission       Equipment Package that add to the ICV common capabilities.       The Stryker is deployable by C-130 aircraft and is combat       capable upon arrival; it is also capable of self-deployment       by highway and can conduct self-recovery. It has a low noise       level that reduces crew fatigue and enhances survivability.       It moves about the battlefield quickly and is optimized for       close, complex, or urban terrain. The Stryker program       leverages non-developmental items with common subsystems and       components to quickly acquire and field these systems.        2. The XM914E1 is a single feed chain gun that fires       linked, percussion-primed 30mm 113mm ammunition. The gun is       powered by a 1 horsepower 28V (volt) direct current (DC)       motor and incorporates hang fire safety protection. Actual       operation of the gun is accomplished via the platform's fire       control system in conjunction with and through the dedicated       Gun Control Unit (GCU). The GCU provides all electrical power       to the gun, including operational and sensor level 28V DC       power. The weapon has a cyclic firing rate of 200       25 shots per minute. Actual firing rate varies within the       specification range due to system level characteristics, such       as inputted voltage and ammunition feed system loads.        3. The RS6 Remote Weapon System (RWS) is an externally       mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the       gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while       firing a variety of crew-served weapons, including the       XM914E1 chain gun. The RS6 allows for remote day and night       sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-      burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range       while on the move.        4. The AN/VAS-5 Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) is compact       thermal camera providing armored vehicle drivers with day or       nighttime visual awareness in clear or reduced vision (fog,       smoke, dust, etc.) situations. The system provides the driver       a 50-degree viewing angle using a high-resolution infrared       sensor and image stabilization to reduce the effect of shock       and vibration. The viewer and monitor are ruggedized for       operation in tactical environments.        5. The Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE-Wide) mounted on the       XM1296 ICVD, is a compact thermal camera providing armored       vehicle drivers with day or nighttime visual awareness in       clear or reduced vision (fog, smoke, dust, etc.) situations.       The system provides the driver a 180-degree viewing angle       using a high-resolution infrared sensor and image       stabilization to reduce the effect of shock and vibration.       The viewer and monitor are ruggedized for operation in       tactical environments.        6. The Common Remote Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) is an       externally-mounted weapon mounting and control system that       allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by       armor while firing a variety of crew-served weapons. The       CROWS allows for remote day and night sighting and ballistic       control capability, providing first-burst engagement of       targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move.        7. hC2 BMS solution--the hC2 Software Suite is a complete       COMMAND and Control (C2) solution that offers clarity,       simplicity, and high performance to address real world C2       challenges at all echelon levels. The hC2 Suite connects the       headquarters all the way down the echelon to the tactical       edge. At the core of the hC2 Suite is hC2 Tactical       Communications, which enables full integration and       interoperability of the three hC2 components: COMMAND, PATROL       and DISMOUNT. hC2 Tactical Communications provides networked       COMMAND and control and shared situational awareness,       allowing for information exchange across echelons. hC2       Tactical Communications is operable on limited bandwidth,       high latency tactical radio data communications frequencies.       hC2 also supports IP and non-IP radios and can handle       different types of radios, even within the same vehicle.        8.
