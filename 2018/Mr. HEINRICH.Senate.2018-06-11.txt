 Mr. President, from June 4 to June 6, 2018, I was  unavoidably absent during rollcall votes Nos. 112, 113, 114, 115, 116,  and 117. I was in New Mexico helping to address the devastating  wildfires. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on these rollcall  votes.                            ____________________
