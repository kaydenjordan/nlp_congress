 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, something disturbing is happening in  Washington this week. A group of politicians are trying to set aside  election results, overrule American voters, and break--break--our  institutions to get a political outcome they want.   I am speaking, of course, about the Senate Democratic leader and the  radical left. The Senate Democratic leader is trying to bully his own  Members into breaking their word, breaking the Senate, and silencing  the voices of millions of citizens so that one political party can take  over our Nation's elections from the top down.   In January 2021, a mob tried to intimidate and change the Senate, and  they failed. In January of 2021, the Senate stayed true to itself, and  it stood strong.   But in January of 2022, some of the Senate's own Members want to  permanently damage this institution from within. They want to shatter  its central feature. The Democratic leader is using fake hysteria--fake  hysteria--about 2021 State laws to justify a power grab he began  floating actually back in 2019 and an election takeover that was first  drafted in 2019.   President Biden has spread so much misinformation about the basic  facts of State voting laws that he was called out and debunked by-- listen to this--the Washington Post. A sitting President of the United  States who pledged to lower the temperature and unite America now  invokes the brutal racial hatred of Jim Crow segregation to smear--to  smear--States whose new voting laws are more accessible than, for  example, Delaware. Ten days of early voting and excuse-only absentees  in Delaware is just fine, but 17 days of  [[Page S124]]  early voting and no-excuse absentees in Georgia is racist Jim Crow?   The Senate Democratic leader pretends it is a civil rights crisis  that Georgia has enshrined more early voting and more absentee  balloting than his own State of New York has ever allowed. This is  misinformation. It is a Big Lie designed to reduce faith in our  democracy, justify a top-down election takeover, and justify smashing  the Senate itself. Some years back, a veteran Democratic Senator  explained:         [The] nuclear option is ultimately an example of the       arrogance of power . . . [it] would transform the Senate from       the so-called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked       about . . . to a purer majoritarian body.    That was then-Senator Joe Biden. He continued:         At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee       or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation.    Now, before President Biden abruptly reversed this position he held  for decades, he was actually in very good company. Senator Robert Byrd  of West Virginia, the legendary Senate institutionalist, was this  crucial tradition's fiercest defender. The current Democratic leader  has tried to invoke Senator Byrd in support of this push to vandalize  the Senate. This is more misinformation. Senator Byrd went out of his  way to rebut Leader Schumer's arguments, years in advance. Here is a  direct quote from Senator Byrd:         Proponents of the so-called nuclear option cite several       instances in which they inaccurately allege that I blazed a       procedural path toward an inappropriate change in Senate       rules. They're dead wrong--    Said Senator Byrd--         Dead wrong. They draw analogies where none exist and create       cockeyed comparisons that fail to withstand even the       slightest intellectual scrutiny.    That is how Senator Byrd felt about it. Down to his final public  statements before his death in 2010, Senator Byrd was completely  consistent:         I oppose cloture by a simple majority, because it would       immediately destroy the uniqueness of this institution . . .       minority rights would cease to exist in the U.S. Senate.    Senator Byrd, shortly before his death.   That Democratic leader knew how to serve and protect the Senate.   This Democratic leader wants power so badly he will misrepresent his  own late predecessor if it helps him get it. Senator Byrd's successor,  the current senior Senator from West Virginia, has eloquently restated  the very same points. Our colleague Senator Manchin published an op-ed  explaining why ``there is no circumstance in which I will vote to  eliminate or weaken the filibuster''--Senator Manchin.   He pointed out that finding compromise across party differences and  differing regional interests was ``never supposed to be easy . . . but  it is the work we were elected to do.'' He noted that current rules  guarantee ``that rural and small states and the Americans who live in  them . . . always have a seat at the table.''   Our colleague also pointed out that the 60-vote threshold keeps  Federal law durable and predictable:         If the filibuster is eliminated or budget reconciliation       becomes the norm, a new and dangerous precedent will be set       to pass sweeping, partisan legislation every time there is a       change in political control . . . our nation may never see       stable governing again.    This has been a key point for Senators on both sides going back  generations. In his farewell address before retirement, our former  colleague, Lamar Alexander, put it this way: The Senate rules exists to  ``force broad agreements on controversial issues that become laws that  most of us will vote for and that a diverse country will accept.''   In other words, major changes need major buy-in. Otherwise, every  policy would ping-pong wildly whenever the gavels change hands.   This is a point which our colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona,  has explained powerfully. As Senator Sinema wrote just a few months  ago, ``the 60-vote threshold . . . compels moderation and helps protect  the country from wild swings . . . and radical reversals in Federal  policy.''   Sometimes the effect of the filibuster is to block bills outright.  Republicans are using the tool to stop one-party election takeovers. In  2020, Democrats used it to kill Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill.  But as President Biden argued decades ago, the filibuster is about more  than what gets blocked. It shapes almost everything the Senate actually  does pass. It gives all kinds of citizens and all kinds of States a  meaningful voice in nearly everything.   By breaking the Senate, this Democratic leader wants to silence the  voices of millions and millions of Americans. He wants to throw whole  regions of the country into a political power outage because those  voters don't agree with his radicalism. We will see which Senators have  the courage and the principle to put a stop to it.   Finally, on a more practical level, I want to make something very,  very clear. Fifty Republican Senators, the largest possible minority,  have been sent here to represent the many millions of Americans whom  Leader Schumer wants so badly to leave behind. So if my colleagues try  to break the Senate to silence those millions of Americans, we will  make their voices heard in this Chamber in ways that are more  inconvenient for the majority and this White House than what anybody  has seen in living memory.   Last year, the Senate passed major bipartisan legislation on  infrastructure, on hate crimes, on government funding, on competing  with China. Last year, Senators helped speed through noncontroversial  nominations.   So what would a postnuclear Senate look like? I assure you, it would  not be more efficient or more productive. I personally guarantee it.   Do my colleagues understand how many times per day the Senate needs  and gets unanimous consent for basic housekeeping? Do they understand  how many things would require rollcall votes, how often the minority  could demand lengthy debate?   Our colleagues who are itching for a procedural nuclear winter have  not even begun to contemplate how it would look. Our colleagues who are  itching to drain every drop of collegiality from this body have not  even begun to consider how that would work.   If the Democratic leader tries to shut millions of Americans and  entire States out of the business of governing, the operations of this  body will change. Oh, yes, that much is true. But not in ways that  reward the rulebreakers, not in ways that advantage this President,  this majority, or their party--I guarantee it.
