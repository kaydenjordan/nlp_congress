 Do you commit to making sure that there is a       peaceful transfer of power?         Are you willing tonight to condemn White       supremacists and militia groups--        President TRUMP. Sure.         And to say that they need to stand down and       not add to the violence at a number of these cities as we saw       in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland?        President TRUMP. Sure. I'm willing to do that.         Will you say that specifically?        President TRUMP. I would say--         Then go ahead, sir. Do it. Say it.        President TRUMP. I would say--    Let's hear now the President's response.   (Text of video presentation.)         Mr. Chris WALLACE. Do it, sir. Say it. Do it.        President TRUMP. Say it. Do it. Say it. You want to call       them--what do you want to call them? Give me a name. Give me       a name. Go ahead.        Mr. Chris WALLACE. White supremacists and White proud--        President TRUMP. Who do you want me to condemn? Proud Boys,       stand back and stand by.    When asked to condemn the Proud Boys and White supremacists, what did  our President say? He said:         Stand back and stand by.    His message was heard loud and clear. The group adopted that phrase,  ``Stand back and stand by'' as their official slogan. They created  merchandise with their new slogan, which they wore proudly across their  backs at Trump's rallies and they followed the President's orders.   You will see more about this later in the trial, but you will see in  these photos to the left, Dominic Pezzola, and to the right, William  Pepe, two of the leaders of the group heading to the Capitol on January  6. They were later charged with working together to obstruct law  enforcement.   As we go through this evidence, I want you to keep in mind these  words by President Trump when asked to condemn violence:         Stand back and stand by.    And see example after example of the kinds of people, like the Proud  Boys, who he had standing by on January 6.   By October, as my colleagues Mr. Castro and Mr. Swalwell showed you,  Donald Trump was escalating his big lie that the only way he could lose  the election was if it was rigged. So as election day neared, his  supporters were frustrated and they were angry. They were prepared to  ensure his victory by any means necessary.   One of these violent acts was on October 30. Sometime after 12:30  p.m., a caravan of more than 50 trucks covered in pro-Trump campaign  gear confronted and surrounded cars carrying Biden-Harris campaign  workers and a Biden-Harris campaign bus as they were traveling down  Interstate 35 from San Antonio to Austin.   (Video presentation.)   According to witnesses, this caravan repeatedly tried to force the  bus you saw and you see in that video to slow down in the middle of the  highway and then to run it off the road. What that video you just saw  does not show is that the bus that they tried to run off the road was  filled with young campaign staff, volunteers, supporters, surrogates-- people.   As the Trump supporters closed in on th bus, a large black pickup  truck adorned with Trump flags suddenly and intentionally swerved and  crashed into a car driven by a Biden-Harris volunteer. News of the  event went viral on social media. The President of the United States,  in a campaign, saw his own supporters trying to run a bus carrying his  opponents' campaign workers off the highway, to physically intimidate  people in this country campaigning.    Here was his response the next day.   (Text of video presentation.)         Three, two, one, go!        Welcome to the Red Kingdom.        Yeah.        Red Kingdom.        Welcome to the Red Kingdom.        Yeah.        Red Kingdom.        Welcome to the place where we run it.    The President of the United States tweeted a video of his supporters  trying to drive a bus off of the road. You will recall in that first  video that I showed you there was no sound. Well, the one that he  tweeted had a fight theme song placed to it that the President--the  President--put that music to that video and he added at the top: ``I  LOVE TEXAS!''   By the next evening, that tweet that he did had been viewed 12.6  million times. And it wasn't just the tweet.   On November 1, at a Michigan rally with a sea of supporters, the  President talked about that incident again. Here it is.         President TRUMP. You see the way our people, you know, they       were protecting his bus yesterday because they're nice. So       his bus--they had hundreds of cars, ``Trump,'' ``Trump,''       ``Trump,'' ``Trump'' and the American flag. You see ``Trump''       and the American flag.    The President made a public joke of violence against campaigners in  an American election. He made light of it. This was not a joke. In  fact, it was so violent, it put so many people in harm's way that the  FBI investigated the incident and the criminal responsibility of those  who attacked these campaign workers.   Now, our President, Donald Trump, could have said: OK, I didn't  realize how bad that was. This was very violent. Please stop.   But he didn't. He saw the investigation and made a statement in  defense of his supporters' attack on the bus writing:         In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong.   [[Page S629]]     Engaging in violence for him made them patriots to Donald Trump. For  anyone who says Donald Trump didn't know the violence he was inciting,  I ask you to consider his supporters tried to drive a bus off a highway  in the middle of the day to intimidate his opponents' campaign workers,  and his response was to tweet the video of the incident that had fight  music, joke about it, and call those individuals in that incident  patriots.   And once again, Donald Trump's praise worked to incite them further.  Emboldened by that praise, they remained ready to fight, ready to  ``Stand back and stand by.'' This link is not hypothetical.   Just like we saw the Proud Boys showing up in full force on January  6, Donald Trump's encouragement of this attack made sure his supporters  were ready for the next one. The caravan bus attack had been organized  by a Trump supporter named Keith Lee. Leading up to the attack on our  Capitol of January 6, Mr. Lee teamed up with other supporters to  fundraise to help to bring people to Washington, DC, for that date.   The morning of the attack, he filmed footage of the Capitol, pointed  out the flimsiness of the fencing, and then addressed his supporters  before the attack, saying:         As soon as you all get done hearing the President, y'all       get to the Capitol, we need to surround this place.    During the attack, he used the bullhorn to call out for the mob to  rush in. He later went to the Rotunda, himself, and then back outside  to urge the crowd to come inside. These are the people that President  Trump cultivated, who were standing by.   I would like to look at another example. After the election on  December 12, Trump supporters gathered in mass to protest the  ``stolen'' election in DC. It was billed by his loyalists as the second  Million MAGA March. The rally was organized by Women for America First,  the same group that you will see later secured the permit for the  January 6 rally. And who else was there? The Proud Boys, standing by.   Donald Trump did not attend that rally, but he made sure to make  clear to his supporters, throughout the day, how he felt about the  event. At 8:47 a.m., he sent out a tweet:         WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!    And then the rally began. And Donald Trump's allies who spoke at the  rally carried on his message of the stolen election and the importance  of fighting to stop the steal.   Here is Nicholas Fuentes, a commentator who had organized a ``stop  the steal rally'' in Michigan with Trump supporters.   (Text of video presentation.)
