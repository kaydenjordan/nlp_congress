 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Mr. President, sometimes attempting to block a  Presidential nominee is justified. If a President nominates a candidate  who clearly is unfit for the office for which he or she has been  nominated, then, as Senators, we should try to stop the confirmation of  that nominee. But that is the exception. The Senate's advice and  consent power is not supposed to be used to slow-walk all of a  President's nominees simply because one party doesn't like the  President who is doing the nominating.   In the past, once Presidential nominees had been vetted and approved  by the appropriate committee, their confirmation was pretty painless.  Cloture  [[Page S2169]]  votes designed to end filibusters of candidates and allow their  nominations to come to a vote were rare because Senators only tried to  block nominees in extreme cases. But that is no longer the case. Since  President Trump took office, Democrats in the Senate have engaged in a  systematic campaign of obstruction, pointlessly delaying qualified  nominees for no reason other than the fact that Democrats dislike this  President.   But wait, you say. Not so fast. Maybe Democrats obstructed all of  these nominees because they didn't believe any of them were qualified  for the positions for which they had been nominated--except we all know  that is not the case because again and again Democrats have delayed and  obstructed nominees they have ultimately supported.   One egregious example occurred in January of 2018, when Democrats  forced the Senate to spend more than an entire week considering four  district court judges even though not one single Democrat voted against  their confirmation. That is right--Democrats forced the Senate to spend  more than a week of our floor time considering the nomination of four  judges even though not one single Democrat opposed their confirmation.  These judges could have been confirmed in a matter of minutes by voice  vote, but Democrats forced the Senate to spend more than a week on  their consideration--time that could have been spent on genuinely  controversial nominees or on some of the many important issues facing  our country.   Another ugly example occurred during my chairmanship of the Commerce  Committee last Congress, when Democrats pointlessly delayed the  confirmation of the Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy, Derek  Kan. Mr. Kan, who had been confirmed by voice vote just 2 years earlier  as a member of the Amtrak board of directors, was delayed for months in  2017, with Democrats ultimately requiring the filing of cloture--but  not because Democrats had any problem with his qualifications. When the  vote on his nomination finally came, he was confirmed by an  overwhelming margin of 90 to 7. Once again, Democrats obstructed for  obstruction's sake.   During President Obama's first 2 years in office, his nominees were  subjected to a total of 12 cloture votes. Do you want to know how many  cloture votes President Trump's nominees faced during the President's  first 2 years in office? One hundred and twenty-eight--more than 10  times as many cloture votes as President Obama's nominees faced over  the same period--128 to 12.   Democrats' slow-walking of nominees is obviously a problem for this  President and his administration. Essential positions have stayed  vacant for months longer than they should have, making it more  challenging for the administration to carry out its responsibilities.  But Democrats' actions are not just a problem for this administration;  they are setting a terrible precedent that could derail the work of the  Senate and inhibit the President's ability to govern for many years  into the future. Just imagine if Democrats' behavior over the past 2  years becomes the norm. Presidents could be waiting years to adequately  staff their administrations, and the Senate would be perpetually tied  up on unnecessary cloture votes, leaving less and less time to actually  do the business of governing.   Democrats and Republicans need to curb this rampant obstruction  before it becomes a permanent precedent here in the Senate. Later  today, we will have a chance to do so when we vote on the Blunt- Lankford resolution.   Back at the beginning of President Obama's second term, Democrats and  a number of Republicans, including me, passed a measure streamlining  the confirmation process for lower level positions, such as district  court judges and Assistant Secretaries. This was obviously something  that benefited President Obama and only President Obama since the rules  change expired at the end of that Congress, but Republicans signed on  because we believe that Presidents should be able to staff their  administrations in a timely fashion. So we worked with Democrats to  streamline consideration of lower level administration nominees.   The Blunt-Lankford resolution is very similar to the rules change we  passed in 2013. Like the 113th Congress rules change, the Blunt- Lankford resolution would streamline the process for consideration of  lower level nominees, while preserving the current rules for high-level  nominee positions, such as Cabinet officials and Justices.   Thirty-four currently serving Democratic Senators also served in the  113th Congress and voted for that rules change, and I am hearing that  Democrats would be willing to support the Blunt-Lankford resolution as  well. But there is one catch: Democrats apparently would only support  the rules change if we delay the effective date of the resolution to  2021--in the hopes that they will have a Democrat in the White House by  then.   That is an outrageous demand, this ``We will take the rules change  when it helps us, but we will do everything we can to make sure the  other party doesn't get its share of the benefits, but that ``The rules  don't apply to us'' attitude has unfortunately become pretty typical of  the Democratic Party lately. Think about recent Democratic support for  packing the Supreme Court. Why has that long-dead idea come back to  haunt us? Because Democrats are angry that President Trump has gotten  two individuals confirmed to the Supreme Court. Apparently, the only  good Supreme Court Justices are the Justices nominated by Democrats.  Take the Democratic proposal to abolish the electoral college.  Democrats are still mad about their loss in the 2016 Presidential  election. We get that. Their solution is not working harder to win in  2020 but changing the rules to favor their party.   Simple intellectual honesty would dictate that the 34 current  Democratic Senators who voted for the rules change in the 113th  Congress vote for the rules change today. I hope they will. Nothing  less than the future of the Senate is at stake here.   Democrats have a choice to make: They can vote to restore the  Senate's tradition of efficiently confirming noncontroversial nominees  so the work of the government can get done, or they can continue to  pursue a damaging, virulent partisanship that will negativity affect  the Senate's ability to function for decades to come.
