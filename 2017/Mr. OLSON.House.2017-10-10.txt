 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend from Montana  for bringing this bill forward this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, this is a great day back home in Pearland, Texas,  because right now this House is about to honor a fallen hero from  Pearland, Endy Ekpanya.   Endy was born in Nigeria in 1985, the same year I graduated from  college. When he was 11, his family left Nigeria to come to America to  provide a better life for them. They moved to Long Island in 1996. He  obtained a degree in psychology and sociology from Hofstra University  in New York and later earned his MBA and master's degree in criminal  justice from the University of Maryland.   The call to serve his country and his community never left Endy,  which is why, after moving to Pearland, Texas, he enrolled in the Alvin  Community College Police Academy. He graduated with the 105th class in  December of 2015, and he was sworn in as a Pearland police officer 6  months later.   In less than 6 months after December of 2015, his time with us was  cut short just 2 days before his 31st birthday. At approximately 4 a.m.  on the morning of June 12, 2016, Endy was hit head-on by a drunk driver  while responding to an emergency call. He was the first officer to die  in Pearland while on duty in over 40 years.   Endy's life embodies the selfless dedication of our law enforcement  officials back in Pearland. His sacrifice will never ever be forgotten.  That is why I am proud that today this House will pass a bill to name  the post office at 2700 Cullen Boulevard after Endy. It will be a  source of great pride for our local community and will ensure that his  sacrifice is remembered for generations to come.   This small gesture can't make up for the loss of Endy's life. The  grief his wife, his young son, and his parents have will never go away.  The Pearland community has suffered, but this small gesture is a  testament to Endy's commitment to protect and serve. It will be an  inspiration for future generations to strive to improve their community  just like Endy did in his short time with us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
