 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1176, I call  up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform  and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the Department  of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purpose, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the conference report  to H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018.   It is fitting that the House today consider that farm bill because,  28 years ago, another proud Texan, President George H.W. Bush, signed  into law the 1990 farm bill.   For the first time since 1990, Congress is poised to pass a new farm  bill in the same year that the legislation was first introduced.   In many ways, the 1990 farm bill laid the groundwork for today's U.S.  farm policy. The U.S. farm policy is no longer the old command and  control policies of the New Deal, but, rather, a market-oriented, risk  management approach that helps America's farmers and ranchers survive  natural disasters and the predatory trade practices of foreign  countries like China.   Our Nation's farmers and ranchers are the very best in the world, but  they cannot compete alone against a sea of high and rising foreign  subsidies, tariffs, and nontariff trade barriers, nor can they survive  alone in the face of record droughts, hurricanes, wildfires, and other  natural disasters. That is why we have a farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, not since the early 2000s has a farm bill been more  desperately needed than it is today. Our farmers and ranchers are going  through a very difficult recession right now. Net farm income is down  50 percent from where it stood just 5 years ago, the largest drop since  the Great Depression. And farm bankruptcies are more up by more than 30  percent.   We have all seen the devastation of recent wildfires and hurricanes.  Less noticed, but no less destructive, is the severe drought that has  gripped many parts of the country, perhaps none more so than the one I  get to represent.   Even less noticed is the rampant cheating going on in the global  trade that hurts our farmers and ranchers every single day. China  recently oversubsidized just three crops by more than $100 billion in a  single year.  [[Page H10143]]    Put in perspective, China spent more on excess illegal subsidies in a  year than the entire U.S. safety net covering all commodities will cost  in roughly two farm bills. That is why passage of this farm bill is so  important.   The farm bill is never easy to pass. The needs of our farmers and  ranchers are greater than they have ever been in a long time, but we  have operated under a flat budget.   For my colleagues who are concerned about the deficit spending,  please note that this farm bill is budget neutral. This follows on the  heels of the 2014 farm bill that has come in significantly under budget  also.   Mr. Speaker, here are some specifics of the 2018 farm bill:   First, the farm bill honors the request of nearly every farmer and  rancher that we do no harm to Federal crop insurance.   Second, we strengthen the farm bill safety net for all farmers and  ranchers. Believe it or not, there was actually pressure from some in  the other Chamber to cut the farm safety net at a time when the whole  point of a farm bill is to help our farm and ranch families.   Third, we strengthened key conservation initiatives, especially the  Environmental Quality Incentives Program. These highly successful  conservation initiatives serve as a prime example of how voluntary,  incentive-based conservation beats burdensome, arbitrary, and costly  Washington regulations every single time.    Fourth, we honored the requests of farmers and ranchers to fully fund  our trade promotion initiatives, which could not be more important than  they are right now. This includes fully funding the Market Access  Program and the Foreign Market Development Program.   We also succeeded in maintaining the vital link between America's  farmers and ranchers and U.S. food aid by preserving the in-kind food  assistance to our neighbors in need from around the world.   Fifth, we make some extremely important investments elsewhere in this  farm bill: We increase individual Farm Service Agency loan limits,  which have not been updated in 16 years; we increase agriculture  research funding at a time when we are dangerously lagging behind  China.   We also provide Secretary Perdue with the tools he requested to  effectively combat the opioid epidemic and also to expand high-quality  broadband service in all of rural America.   We increase investment in new crop uses and in specialty crops,  including fruits and vegetables, and we increase investments in the  Nation's livestock sector by strengthening our Nation's animal disease  prevention and management efforts, including the stockpiling of foot- and-mouth disease vaccine.   Finally, it is fair to say that there has been philosophical  differences in this conference committee. Achieving commonsense SNAP  reforms, preventing wildfires, and providing regulatory relief are just  three of the examples.   Despite this, we made commonsense reforms and improved the program  integrity and work requirements under SNAP, including involving  Governors in the work requirement waivers so that there is political  accountability and by reducing State allowances for able-bodied adults  without dependents.   We required States to adopt case management practices to help move  SNAP beneficiaries from welfare to work, and we eliminate $480 million  in bonuses we pay to States for simply doing their jobs. These and  other reforms will build on the success we have had in moving more than  9 million people off of SNAP rolls and into the workforce over the past  5 years.   The farm bill will also reduce the forest fuel loads to reduce the  incidence and intensity of wildfires. This is achieved by expanding the  insect and disease categorical exclusion to remove hazardous fuel loads  and empowering State, local, and Tribal authorities to remove timber.   Nobody deserves more credit for working to improve our Nation's  forest management than my friend Bruce Westerman from Arkansas, whom I  am proud to have as a signatory on this conference report.   These reforms are important, and they are only a start in what we  need to be done. Ultimately, we had to make a decision between making  as many inroads on reform in these areas as we could or allow farmers  and ranchers to be held hostage. Faced with that choice, I chose the  route of getting this farm bill done.   We made important inroads wherever we could on these reforms. We  worked to provide the strongest safety net possible for our Nation's  farmers and ranchers.   In closing, I thank Ranking Member Peterson and our counterparts in  the other Chamber for bringing this conference report to final  consideration. I extend my sincere gratitude to President Trump and  Secretary Perdue for their unwavering support of our farmers and  ranchers, and I greatly appreciate the support and hard work of House  leadership and members of my Conference, especially my fellow  conferees, for all they have done to stand by rural America and those  families who feed and clothe us.   For the sake of rural America and our struggling farmers and  ranchers, I urge my colleagues to support this farm bill so the  President can sign this measure into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the former chairman of the committee and current  chairman of the Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).  [[Page H10145]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), a former member of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  chairman for allowing me, even when I am opposed to one of the  provisions, to speak about it.   As you may know, this bill has a lot of good things and good  provisions for all the States and for the territories as well, but  there is one provision that we are not allowed to even discuss in a  public hearing, and that is the prohibition, or ban, to cockfights in  the territories.   The current farm bill allowed territories to have and regulate that  industry. In the case of Puerto Rico, that represents more than $18  million in revenues and taxes. We are on the brink of a lot of  financial situations, and now this regulation will put another burden  on the people of the island.   So I am against that prohibition, mostly because the people of Puerto  Rico have regulated the industry of cockfighting since 1933. So this is  something that is not only affecting Puerto Rico, but the rest of the  territories, as we have been facing this kind of industry and sport.   We don't have the votes in the Senate. We can't vote on the floor of  the House. So our people are not fiscally represented, and as well  Congress is taking an action that would put another burden on our  economy.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my opposition, and the people of Puerto  Rico, against that provision, but in favor of the rest of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Faso).  [[Page H10147]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is left  on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I finish, I would like to also add my thanks to  the majority staff and the minority staff in the House, as well as the  minority and the majority staff in the Senate. Untold hours were spent  getting us to this place by these hardworking men and women who labor  in relative anonymity. Collin and I get all the gratitude, pats on the  back, hugs, and smooches, and they do all of the hard work.   I would like to recognize Matt Schertz, my staff director; Bart  Fischer, deputy staff director and chief economist; Patricia Straughn;  Nicole Scott; Rachel Millard; Josh Maxwell; Jennifer Tiller; Paul  Balzano; Trevor White; Callie McAdams; Caleb Crosswhite; Carly  Reedholm; Mollie Wilken; Mindi Brookhart; John Weber; Jeremy Witte;  Ashton Johnston; Yasmin Rey; Darryl Blakey; Abigail Camp; Ricki  Schroeder; Margaret Wetherald; John Konya; Maggie Mullins; Faisal  Siddiqui; Brian Martin-Haynes; Kevin Norton; Brandon Reeves; and Nicole  Bayne for all of their hard work and all of the time spent away from  their families over the last year-plus getting to this point.   Mr. Speaker, in a few minutes, there are going to be red and green  lights go up behind your head. Pressure that is facing America's  farmers and ranchers and their families is just unimaginable to those  of us who aren't directly in the business: pressures of 5 years of  reduced income; 5 years of burning through savings and capital; 5 years  of really difficult circumstances; commodity prices low with no real  relief on the horizon; trade turmoil across the world; lots of things  going bad; as I mentioned earlier in my conversation, a 30 percent  increase in bankruptcies. But, Mr. Speaker, the one thought that  troubles me the most is the increase in suicides. The pressures of  losing a multigenerational farm and ranch operation must be incredible  to cause men and women to decide to make an awful decision as a result  of those pressures.   This bill will help alleviate that. This bill takes a look at those  pressures, takes a look at the stresses and strains across all of rural  America--economic development issues, the issues within just the  practice of farming and ranching--and says here are Federal resources  that we want to put against those problems, against the issues of  farmers going out of business, and continuing to provide to the  American consumer the most abundant, safest, and affordable food supply  of any developed nation in the world.   Across these last 2 years, with President Trump in office, you have  seen an awful lot of comments about ``buy America'' and ``let's produce  things in America.'' There is nothing more American than food produced  in our Nation, and this bill will keep us in that vein. It will keep  those farmers and ranchers taking those risks, risks that none of us  could imagine, year in and year out: worrying about Mother Nature, too  much rain, too little rain, rain at the wrong time, too hot, not hot  enough, all of those things that they have no control over. They will  fight that fight day in and day out, and they are the best in the world  at doing it.   What they can't do, though, is fight against the cheating in the  trade world that is out there, fight against commodity prices that they  can't control. They can't control their input costs. They are takers of  those costs, and they are takers of prices. They are at the mercy of an  awful lot of pressures and stresses and strains that this bill tends to  address.   So, Mr. Speaker, the green lights, in my view, when they start  lighting up, will be the Members who have taken a look at all these  things, all these issues that are facing rural America and our farmers  and ranchers, and will say, yes, this bill does, in fact, address  those; it does get at those issues; it does offer 5 years of stability  for these folks, 5 years of lenders being able to know what the safety  net will look like and being able to lend against next year's crop, 5  years of certainty.   We all work better under certainty, and knowing what this farm bill  looks like, wrong or different, is far better than the option of us  rolling this over to next year and starting this process over. Those  green lights will be Members who have looked at all of that and said,  yes, this bill is worthy of my support, worthy of my vote.   Mr. Speaker, the red lights will say something entirely different. It  will say that we looked at those exact same issues, we looked at these  solutions, these Federal resources, and said either they are too much,  not enough, they want it to go somewhere else, or, Mr. Speaker,  unfortunately, there will be some who will say, well, there just  weren't things in there that we would like to have happen.   Mr. Speaker, the House version that we passed back in June took some  mighty bold steps toward reforming SNAP and moving in a direction that  most of us believe was supported by the American people. Asking SNAP  recipients to work 20 hours a week in order to maintain that public  benefit, that public effort, we believe was the right way to go. That  was not supported broadly by the body across the building, and we made  the compromises necessary to get us to this place.   In spite of that, though, Mr. Speaker, we made good reforms toward  the SNAP process, toward program integrity, and making the program work  better for folks who need these programs.   The House version never intended to touch, nor did it touch, the  folks we will always take care of: the elderly, the mentally and  physically disabled, those who are temporarily out of whack. It never  touched that.   What it did, Mr. Speaker, was go after those folks who are able- bodied, should be working and should be in the workforce. We have 7  million unfilled jobs today, and there is work ahead of us to make this  happen.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, I thank my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle. I thank Collin Peterson for his hard work on the  conference committee. I thank our Senate colleagues who took a  different view, but we are here today. Mr. Speaker, I pray that when  the lights go up behind your head that there are more green lights than  red lights, we can get this to the President's desk, and get that  certainty for rural America that is necessary.  [[Page H10149]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
