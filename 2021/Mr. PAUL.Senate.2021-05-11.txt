 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Space Tango of Lexington, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Growing up on a family farm outside Bardstown, Twyman Clements loved  building and launching model rockets with his three brothers. His  passion for innovation and engineering led him to the University of  Kentucky, UK, where he earned a BS and MS in mechanical engineering. As  a graduate student at UK, Twyman worked with Kentucky Space, a  nonprofit consortium of universities and public and private groups  supporting space entrepreneurship. At the time, Kentucky Space was  using miniature satellites called cubesats to conduct experiments on  the International Space Station. Realizing the need to simplify and  reduce the cost of spacebased research and development, R&D, Twyman  founded Space Tango in 2015.   Today, Space Tango is a thriving small business enabling R&D and  manufacturing in zero gravity. Since 2017, thanks to a National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, Space Act Agreement, Space  Tango provides facilities on the International Space Station U.S.  National Laboratory. Their CubeLabs generate scalable and efficient  research and manufacturing in microgravity. Space Tango has worked with  several commercial partners, including Anheuser-Busch and LambaVision.  They regularly partner with educational institutions such as the  University of Florida, University of Pennsylvania, and Boston  University.   Over the years, local and national organizations have recognized  Space Tango's groundbreaking work. Twyman was inducted into the  Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame in 2017, and ranked No. 25 on Fast  Company's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business in 2018. Jim  Bridenstine, former NASA Administrator, visited Space Tango in 2020,  commending their biomedical research and manufacturing capabilities. In  addition to working on projects for various Federal agencies, Space  Tango won three NASA Utilization Awards for Low Earth Orbit of  Biomedical Applications. Looking forward, Space Tango is developing ST- 42, an autonomous manufacturing facility for advanced materials and  biomedical devices located in Earth's orbit.   Notably, Space Tango is committed to investing in the next generation  of innovators, scientists, and entrepreneurs. Twyman and his colleagues  regularly host and present at educational events at Kentucky schools,  universities, and scientific institutions. Space Tango's robust  internship program includes students from Kentucky's universities and  colleges across the country, with several former interns joining their  team.   Space Tango is a testament to Kentucky innovation, ingenuity, and  industry. Small businesses like Space Tango form a critical part of  American's domestic manufacturing base and play a unique role educating  the next generation of Kentucky engineers and entrepreneurs.  Congratulations to Twyman and the entire team at Space Tango. I wish  them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky and beyond.                            ____________________
