 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the exemplary  leadership and career of Sergeant John Aiton, a native of the Palmetto  State, born and raised in my hometown of Rock Hill, South Carolina.   Upon graduating from Rock Hill High School, John Aiton attended East  Coast Bible College, where he received a bachelor of arts in pastoral  ministries, later earning a master's degree in biblical interpretation  from Pentecostal Theological Seminary.   After a brief teaching and coaching stint at the Heritage Academy in  Fort Mill, Sergeant Aiton joined the Rock Hill Police Department. John  always had a special place in his heart for helping the community, so  after 2 years of patrol work, he left to join the juvenile division as  a DARE instructor.   During his work early on, he was promoted to special investigator,  and was selected to serve on the police force's first crisis  negotiating team, forming the department's neighborhood watch program.   Because of his dedication to the local community, he began to serve  as the department's chaplain and continued work with the Worthy Boys  and Girls Camp. This ultimately led him to his best-known role, a  school resource officer for 22 years; 11 years at Northwestern High  School, followed by another 11 years at South Pointe High School.   Throughout his distinguished career, Sergeant Aiton went above and  beyond his job to protect and serve the community. Due to his service,  he was promoted to sergeant of the Community Service Division, but  because of his commitment to student safety, he relieved himself of  those duties.   John is a truly inspirational citizen and a community servant whose  pride and joy is found in protecting students.   After a distinguished career, Sergeant John Aiton retired from the  force in June of 2019. It is truly an honor to recognize and  congratulate Sergeant John Aiton on his well-deserved retirement. Rock  Hill could not have asked for a better, selfless role model for our  community.   In the words of Winston Churchill, who made famous a quote when Great  Britain was about to be under siege, he said:         There will be a time when doing your best is not good       enough. You must do what is required.    Sergeant Aiton did what was required to make a true difference.                            ____________________
