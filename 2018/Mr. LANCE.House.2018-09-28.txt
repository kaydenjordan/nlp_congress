 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, which  delivers greater resources, treatment, and mitigation tools to fight  opioid addiction.   I am especially pleased that a bill that I sponsored related to  infectious diseases is included in the final package. I commend the  Congressman from Massachusetts, Mr. Joe Kennedy, for being my lead  cosponsor on this part of the overall whole.   Infectious diseases complicate the lifelong path toward addiction  recovery. H.R. 6 is one of the most important measures to pass this  Congress. It should be supported unanimously.
