 Madam President, Hurricane Harvey is a horrible tragedy.  It has ruthlessly taken lives. It has taken diplomas and baby albums.  It has taken homes and gardens and playgrounds. It has also given us  many new pictures of volunteerism, heroism, and neighborliness, and God  bless those many helping hands. It has also revealed the willingness,  the advanced planning, and the hard work of many government employees  in the State and local governments, in the National Guard, in FEMA, and  beyond.   So what are we doing here today in this body? And what should we be  doing? What is the specific duty of the U.S. Congress at this moment?  We should provide emergency funding relief. We should provide emergency  funding for FEMA and for related agencies. They are doing important  work, and they need it.   The amount agreed upon by the administration and the House of  Representatives on Tuesday--just 48 hours ago--was $7.8 billion. It  passed noncontroversially. The vote was 419 to 3. They did the right  thing. So let's approve it. Let's do the exact same thing. Let's let  FEMA spend that $7 billion. It is important money. There is a genuine  emergency. There is real need. I am a small government guy, but there  is a clear and urgent governmental role in this moment, so we should do  it.   But what we should not do are unrelated things that we will pretend  are hurricane relief. We should not fool ourselves into pretending that  the legislation on the floor today is actually doing what it says it  does just because it has a certain name on the top of the legislation.  What we are actually considering doing today in this body is much, much  larger, much clunkier, and much less explicable or defensible to your  and my constituents.   Do your constituents know, for example, that far less than half of  all of the spending in this bill before us today is in any way related  to emergency relief for Hurricane Harvey? Think about that. Do your  constituents know that far less than half of the spending is actually  related to hurricanes? Shouldn't they know that? Shouldn't they know  that the vast majority of the money this body is going to spend today,  under the pretend guise of an emergency in the Schumer-Pelosi-Trump  bill, is not actually emergency spending at all?   Do your constituents know that we are using the hurricane as an  excuse to extend the debt ceiling? Translated, that means we can't pay  our credit card bill, so we are just going to take over the credit card  company and change our credit limit without any discussion. We are not  going to have any conversation about the fact that  [[Page S5035]]  we constantly spend more money than we have, and we have to borrow to  do it.   There is a mechanism by which, when we hit up against our debt limit,  we are supposed to pause and have a conversation, but we are not going  to do that today. We are going to use the hurricane as an excuse to  hide from that truth.   What we are really doing right now is borrowing from our kids. There  is no other explanation for what we are doing. What we are doing is we  are intergenerationally stealing. We are passing on debt to the next  generation for current spending. We are not funding infrastructure  here. We are not funding roads and bridges and IT systems and weapons  systems. These are not things that could be called investments in the  future.   Again, I am not talking about the hurricane spending. We should do  all of the hurricane spending. But mostly what this bill is going to do  is spend current priorities--current-year money--month over month, as  we always do, but we are going to pass the price tag and the debt on to  our kids, and we are going to hide from our constituents what we are  actually doing. We are not going to admit it. We are not going to have  a conversation about it. We are not going to have an honest accounting  about how much money we are going to spend. What we are going to do is  increase the odds that we will have a debt crisis soon. At the moment  that comes, we will have another emergency that we will be able to use  as an excuse to do things that we then also will not want  accountability for.   We should separate these two things. We should do all of the  hurricane spending. We should not do things that are not hurricane  spending but, rather, are excuses to kick the can down the road on the  nature of the obligations we are constantly incurring beyond our  ability to pay.   What we are not doing in this body today is draining the swamp. What  we are doing is running a whole bunch of hoses to the edge of the  swamp, turning them on to the highest possible volume flow, and then  turning our backs on the swamp and shouting that there is nothing to  see here. That is what we are doing. We are doing the opposite of  draining the swamp today.   Finally, do your constituents know that what we are doing today  actually increases the likelihood of both a government shutdown and a  government default in December? The odds of a government shutdown are  up and the odds of a government default are up in December.   Do your constituents know that Chuck Schumer--whose title is minority  leader, not majority leader--just made himself the most powerful man in  America for the month of December? Chuck Schumer has made himself the  key man in all negotiations in December because of the legislation we  are going to pass today.   Do your voters know that real and fundamental tax reform is going to  get less likely because of today?   What is going to happen today is that the calendar for the next 90  days will be laser-beam focused on that December shutdown and showdown,  and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi now hold most of the cards for when  we get to December. This is an embarrassing moment for a Republican- controlled Congress and a Republican administration.   Here is the good news. We still have an off-ramp before us. We can do  better, and we have a legislative pathway to do better.   I have a motion at the table that is simple. It funds all of the  emergency relief that the administration has requested for Hurricane  Harvey. Hear that clearly. What the House did yesterday morning that  they negotiated Tuesday night funds all $7.8 billion that the  administration says they need for hurricane relief. It passed 419 to 3.  We can still pass that same legislation. That is it. That is what my  legislation does. It doesn't do anything that is not hurricane relief  and pretend it is hurricane relief; it just goes back to the bill that  funds all of the hurricane relief that the administration says they  need.   I am not offering lots of other stuff. I am not kicking the can down  the road on the conversation that we should have tonight and tomorrow  and Saturday and Sunday about the debt crisis we face. All I am trying  to do is make a bill that says it is about hurricane relief, actually  be about hurricane relief instead of a majority of other stuff  masquerading as hurricane relief.   In short, if you want hurricane relief, this amendment is your  vehicle to get to hurricane relief, not other pretend stuff calling  itself hurricane relief. Just as the House did earlier this week in a  419-to-3 vote, we can do hurricane relief clear, plain, and simple, and  we don't have to hide a whole bunch of other stuff in it.   Thank you, Madam President. I thank this body for its consideration.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                    Motion to Refer With Amendment No. 816    Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to table the motion to refer,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion to table.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
