 Mr. Speaker, as we debate the farm bill this  week,  [[Page H3939]]  the House has an opportunity to permanently eliminate one of the worst  examples of runaway government and unaccountable bureaucracy by the  Obama administration.   The 2015 waters of the United States rule, better known as WOTUS, is  harmful to farmers and agricultural producers in Indiana and across the  country. This rule gives unelected bureaucrats at the EPA the power to  broadly interpret what is a navigable waterway. This rule can be  interpreted in a way that even a puddle can be considered a navigable  waterway subject to Federal regulation.   I am proud to represent nearly 12,000 farms in northeast Indiana, and  each and every one of these operations could be subject to this  overreaching rule. At a time of falling commodity prices, the last  thing that Hoosier farmers need is an ambiguous, broad, and costly  government decree that seeks to regulate nearly every aspect of their  operation.   I applaud efforts by the Trump administration to delay this damaging  rule, but it is time to permanently repeal WOTUS. I urge my colleagues  to support its elimination as Congress considers the farm bill this  week.                            ____________________
