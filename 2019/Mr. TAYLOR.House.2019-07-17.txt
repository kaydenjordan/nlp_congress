 Mr. Speaker, from its inception, the Islamic Republic of  Iran had an anti-American bent: what it did in our Embassy, its attack  on the Marines in Beirut in 1983, its efforts in Iraq.   In 2003, I was part of the invasion force. I saw with my own eyes the  Iranian efforts to destabilize Iraq, and they continue to do that there  today.   They continue to support the Assad regime in Syria. They continue to  overthrow the regime in Yemen, support the Houthi rebels attacking  Saudi Arabia.   Around the Middle East, Iran has become the enemy of freedom and  democracy.   If America is going to succeed, we need to have allies; we need to  have friends. We need to support those allies and those friends. Making  sure that Saudi Arabia or UAE have the weapons that they need to fight  back against Iran's terrorism and warmongering around this region is  mission-critical for the survival of our Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I stand against this resolution.
