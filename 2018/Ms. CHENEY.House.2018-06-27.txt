 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 964 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 964         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for further       consideration of the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations       for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending       September 30, 2019, and for other purposes. No further       amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order except       those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution and available pro forma       amendments described in section 3 of House Resolution 961.       Each further amendment printed in the report of the Committee       on Rules shall be considered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment except amendments described in section 3       of House Resolution 961, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from June       29, 2018, through July 9, 2018 --         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  It shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order to consider concurrent resolutions providing       for adjournment during the month of July, 2018.               Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my colleague from California (Mrs. Torres)  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 964,  which provides for the consideration of additional amendments to H.R.  6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations  [[Page H5760]]  Act for fiscal year 2019. This rule makes in order an additional 29  amendments: 8 Republican, 16 Democratic, and 5 bipartisan amendments.   Mr. Speaker, as we discussed on this floor yesterday and many times  previously, providing funding that our men and women in uniform need to  defend this great Republic is by far the most important responsibility  we have as Members of the United States Congress. Today's rule gives us  the opportunity to get the input and hear the voices of additional  Members as we listen to and consider their amendments to H.R. 6157.   In the National Defense Strategy that was released late last year,  Secretary Mattis described the situation facing our Armed Forces this  way: ``Today, we are emerging from a period of strategic atrophy, aware  that our competitive military advantage has been eroding. We are facing  increased global disorder, characterized by decline in the longstanding  rules-based international order--creating a security environment more  complex and volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory.''   Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I would say more than any that we have lived  through and any that we have existed in since World War II.   Without the kind of sustained and predictable investment that  appropriations bills and the appropriation process needs, we will  simply not be able to restore readiness to modernize our military or to  maintain our strategic advantage. We will rapidly lose our ability to  project our forces as well as our military advantage.   We cannot allow that to happen. The rule and the underlying bill that  we are debating today are both crucial steps to continue the progress  that we have already made and crucial steps toward ensuring that the  commitment that we made in order to provide 2 years of funding for our  men and women in uniform is kept.   This bill helps provide the very resources and modernization that the  National Defense Strategy said were so crucially needed. We have to  make sure that our Department of Defense can provide combat-credible  military forces needed to deter war and protect the security of our  Nation.   Today's rule, Mr. Speaker, gives us the opportunity to debate this  important piece of legislation and get the input from Members of this  body who would like to make it even better.   One of the amendments, Mr. Speaker, made in order by this rule was  offered by my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Wittman) and cosponsored by  a bipartisan group of Members. It would allow the Department of Defense  to dual buy CVN-80 and CVN-81. These are our next two aircraft  carriers. The Navy has stated that this dual buy authority could likely  save taxpayers $2.5 billion on these two aircraft carriers.   This amendment serves two purposes. It helps ensure that we are using  taxpayer resources wisely, and it helps move us toward the Navy's  necessary and stated goal of a 355-ship Navy.   There are several other good amendments, Mr. Speaker, made in order  by this rule, some that I probably won't support. But the rule takes  serious ideas about how we can strengthen the Nation's Armed Forces,  how we can make the defense of this Nation our priority, and brings  them to the floor of this House for our consideration.   I look forward to considering each amendment and completing the  Defense Appropriations process in this House. The work we are doing  here is vital, but it is only part of the job, Mr. Speaker. We have to  pass the appropriations bill through this body, and then we have to  make sure that our colleagues on the other side of this building, our  colleagues in the Senate, do the same. We can't hold funding for our  military hostage to other priorities, even for additional domestic  spending. We simply must provide reliable funding at necessary levels  for the men and women in uniform who are putting their lives on the  line for all of us.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule that will allow  consideration of additional amendments to H.R. 6157.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the underlying bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would point out that this House actually is going to  be taking up a bill that addresses these issues. Mr. Goodlatte's bill  will come up within the next hour or so here on this floor. The bill  itself would require that the Department of Homeland Security maintain  the care and custody of aliens together, with their children, as well  as providing funding for DHS family residential centers.   So I think that it is fair to say that there is bipartisan concern  for the plight of these children, the plight of these families. I think  all of us who are mothers understand the emotions involved here and  understand that we don't want to perpetuate a situation that, in fact,  also was occurring when President Obama was in office.    But I think it is also important to note that we have got to secure  our border and we have got to be in a position where we are recognizing  that people who come here illegally cannot be allowed to stay. People  who come here illegally must, in fact, be deported, must, in fact, be  apprehended.   We need to end, as we have, the practice of catch and release that we  saw during the Obama administration. It is a security issue for us.   The pain and the emotion that we all feel for the families that have  been separated I think we all also feel for the angel families, the  families that President Trump has met with, the families that have been  the victims of violence perpetuated by people who have come to this  country illegally.   So I would say, Mr. Speaker, that it is absolutely the wrong thing to  do, as my colleague urges the notion that we should defeat this rule so  that we can address immigration. It just simply is wrong on a  procedural matter. We ought to, in fact, support this rule, pass this  rule, not once again hold hostage the men and women in uniform to  another issue.   The position of the minority here is apparently that we should stop  our bipartisan process and our bipartisan movement on funding the  troops so that we can take up an issue that we are already planing to  take up. It is not necessary and it is unjustified. I actually would  urge exactly the opposite of my colleague from the Rules Committee. We  ought to, in fact, pass this rule.   Mr. Speaker, as we think about this issue, we have got to remember  that there are families involved not just with respect to the issue of  immigration; there are families involved with respect to the men and  women who are defending all of us.   I don't think that it is acceptable, I don't think it is justifiable,  for us ever to be in a position where we are telling the mother or the  father or the spouse of a servicemember that we couldn't get them the  funding they needed because our process is broken, that we couldn't get  them the funding that they need because we are bickering with each  other. I think that is, in fact, absolutely an abrogation of our  constitutional responsibilities and duties.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert), who is vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would thank my colleague very much for her son's  service in our Armed Forces, and I would also just note that we agree.  We don't think that our military servicemembers' salaries should be  held hostage for any issue, no matter the issue. That is why we in this  body believe we should pass a stand-alone Defense Appropriations bill.  That is why we believe that we ought to pass the rule that we are  debating today, so that we can get to the debate and the discussion  about the stand-alone Defense Appropriations bill. That is why we  believe the Senate should take it up and pass it that way as well.   We shouldn't add any legislation to it. The funding that our men and  women in uniform need should not be made a situation where it is held  hostage to other political issues. It is simply not justifiable, no  matter the issue.   I would note once again, Mr. Speaker, and this is crucially  important, that one of the fundamental values that our men and women in  uniform are fighting for and defending is the rule of law, and for too  long in the previous administration we had policies like catch and  release that were sanctioned from the top. We had policies like  sanctuary cities that were sanctioned from the top. We had situations,  Mr. Speaker, where the laws of the Republic that were passed by this  body, passed by the Senate, signed into law by the President, were  simply not enforced. That is not a situation that we can allow to  continue.   I think it is important that we address the issue of the separation  of families at the border. No one wants to see that happen or that  continue. I think we need to focus on it. We need to make sure that we  come up with solutions for it, like the kinds of solutions that are  going to be presented on this floor shortly.   I think, as we do that, we have also got to remember the larger  issues involved, including the security of the Nation. That is not just  about the resources that this bill provides; it is also about making  sure that our borders are secure.   One of the things that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have refused to deal with and to address time and again is funding for  a border wall. President Trump has made clear that part of securing  this Nation is providing funding for a border wall. That is something  that we have got to make sure we appropriate. That is also something  that the bill that we will consider this afternoon does.    I am hopeful that we will see support from the other side of the  aisle for a bill that deals with the issue of separating children from  families at the border.   I also would point out, Mr. Speaker, that this House has been very  dedicated and focused and very active in dealing with the issue of  human trafficking. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know  very well that many of the situations we are seeing at our border that  involve children are not family situations. They are situations where  those children are brought here by human traffickers. Those children  are brought here to be exploited. That is something we have got to make  sure we protect against.   When we as a nation allow sanctuary cities to continue to exist, when  we look the other way and say we won't enforce our immigration laws, we  are, in fact, perpetuating a system where those children are put at  risk, and we are not doing our duty, our fundamental obligation, to  protect and defend those children.   I wish, Mr. Speaker, that the concern for the children of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle were as broad as it needs to  be, to encompass, frankly, all of the threats that these kids are  facing.   I think it is important that we pass this rule, we pass this  underlying bill, and we move on to address and focus on the issue of  immigration in a way in which Members on both sides of the aisle can  agree.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague and I agree that the court determination,  essentially rejecting the Korematsu decision yesterday, was the right  one. And we agree that the episode in our Nation's history, in which we  were holding Japanese Americans in internment camps, was a dark one and  was something that should not have happened. But I think that it is  unjustifiable, and I think, frankly, it just politicizes the challenge  that we are all facing to compare the current situation at our borders  with Japanese internment camps, or with concentration camps, or many of  the other exaggerations and, I think, highly irresponsible language  that we have heard throughout this debate.   We all have to come together to solve the problem, but we have to  come together to enforce our laws. If, in fact, my colleagues are  interested in enforcing the laws, if they are interested in solving the  problem for the families at the border, and if they are interested in  closing the loopholes in the law that have resulted in the separation  of those children, then I assume that they will be voting in favor of  Mr. Goodlatte's bill that will be coming up for consideration today.   I would also say, Mr. Speaker, it is not accurate for our colleagues  to say that families seeking asylum are having their children ripped  out of their arms. Anybody who is seeking asylum, who goes to a port of  entry, is not going to be subject to prosecution and will not be  separated from their families.   I think it is very important for us to make clear that we are talking  about people seeking to come into this country illegally, and, in many  cases, as I mentioned before, we are talking about children who are  being trafficked. We have to make sure, as we deal with this issue and  as we come to a resolution and a solution that will help these kids,  that, in fact, we do it in a way that addresses the facts.   Mr. Speaker, it is really important that we focus back on the issue  that we are here to talk about today, and that is Defense  Appropriations.   What we have seen this afternoon is the same thing that we seem to  see every time this bill comes up. This is a really important, really  good bipartisan bill, and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  want to talk about everything under the Sun, apparently, except Defense  Appropriations.    If we don't get Defense Appropriations right, if we don't get it  passed through this House and passed through the Senate and signed  before September 30, we are looking at the possibility of another  continuing resolution for the Defense Department.   Now, we have seen this happen before. We saw it happen last year. We  watched the Democrats in the Senate, for example, shut down the  government because they wanted to hold our troops hostage, because they  were in a position where they wanted to do everything possible except  just pass Defense Appropriations.   Tragically, Mr. Speaker, this isn't just a matter of words like  ``readiness,'' ``modernization,'' and ``capability.'' Those words all  matter. But there are real men and women behind those words, and  families behind them.   So when we are in a situation where we abrogate our duty, and we  don't provide the funds that our men and women in uniform need, we end  up putting the lives of our servicemen and -women on the line. I don't  think that any Member of this body ever wants to be in a situation  again where the Secretary of Defense, or the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs, or the service chiefs come in and say that we, as a body, have  done more damage to the military than any enemy has in the field. That  is what we have heard consistently and repeatedly over the course of  the last several years.   Taking the step of passing this rule and making sure that we pass  this underlying appropriations bill is a crucial part of continuing on  the path of fulfilling the commitment that we made and fulfilling the  commitment that the President of the United States made that he would  rebuild our military.   Every man and woman in uniform, who puts the uniform on, as Secretary  Mattis has said, is essentially writing a blank check to this Nation,  and it is a blank check that is payable with their lives. We ought to  stop spending our time on this floor debating a whole bunch of other  things. The Senate ought to stop spending its time stuck in the  filibuster rule, stuck in the process of going on and on for hours and  hours over matters that, frankly, don't have anywhere near the  importance that funding our troops does, and they ought to move to get  this bill passed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and H.R. 6157.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 964 Offered by Mrs. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6236) to require the reunification of families separated upon       entry into the United States as a result of the ``zero-      tolerance'' immigration policy requiring criminal prosecution       of all adults apprehended crossing the border illegally. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6236.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the  [[Page H5765]]       opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was       entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-      Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been refused,       the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked       the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled       to the first recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Chairman, during the previous administration, deep  funding cuts as well as budget dysfunction in Congress have allowed a  real atrophying of our military readiness in the Department of Defense.  We have seen a steep decline in our capabilities while at the same time  our adversaries have been making advances and increasing their ability  to threaten us.   We now face a situation, particularly with nations like China and  Russia, where they are developing capabilities that we may not be able  to defend against.   Countering this threat requires funding for the space-based missile  defense tracking system in line 117 of the defense-wide RDTE account,  funding that was authorized but not included in the appropriations  bill.   This capability is absolutely critical to improving our missile  defense capabilities, particularly to address the rapidly increasing  threat from hypersonic weapons, which our committee has placed  particular focus on this year with broad bipartisan support.   Additionally, Mr. Chairman, funding was not included in line 92 of  the defense-wide RDTE account to continue critical development of laser  scaling technologies for boost-phase ICBM missile defense. This  technology has the potential that we need and that is crucial to give  our warfighters the capability to shoot down missiles while they are  still in a boost phase, making our adversaries have to think twice,  understanding that missiles they fire at us could be destroyed over  their own soil.   Mr. Chairman, funding for both of these capabilities is included in  both the House and Senate version of the NDAA.   I have offered amendments, Mr. Chairman, to provide funding for these  capabilities consistent with the NDAA and the Missile Defense Agency's  revised budget request for fiscal year 2019. In an effort to allay  concerns about finding offsets for these, I am willing to withdraw my  amendments, and I would ask Chairwoman Granger for a commitment to  fully support the capabilities during the conference process on the  appropriations bill in the Senate.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's willingness  to work with me on this important issue, as well as her tireless work  on this critical bill. I will not be offering my amendments.
