 Madam President, on March 3 of this year, over 9 months  ago, President Biden nominated Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy  Administrator of the Small Business Administration.   Mr. Syed has spent decades building and scaling successful  businesses, as well as advocating for struggling entrepreneurs and  small business owners in underserved areas. It is clear that he is  eminently qualified to help lead the SBA at a time when the Agency is  providing unprecedented assistance to help small businesses survive and  recover from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.   Last April, during Mr. Syed's hearing before the Senate Small  Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, my Republican colleagues  raised concerns about PPP and EIDL loans received by Lumiata, the  company for which Mr. Syed served as CEO. As chairman of the committee,  I gave a commitment to work in a bipartisan manner to secure additional  information from the SBA about these loans.   I kept my word. On June 8, the SBA made materials on the loans  available for my review, for the ranking member's review, and for the  review of every Member of the committee. The materials proved that  there was absolutely nothing irregular about these loans. In fact, the  company did the right thing and repaid the forgivable PPP loan after  its lenders determined  [[Page S9225]]  that the company did not require that level of government assistance.  You wish more companies would have followed the lead that this company  did.   But then, a week later, a new issue arose. Republican Members accused  Mr. Syed of having anti-Israel bias because of his involvement with  Emgage, a nonprofit organization that supports the Muslim American  community. This accusation was completely unfounded. As the American  Jewish Committee wrote:         The unsupported accusation that somehow Jewish businesses       or those with ties to Israel may not fare as well under       Mr. Syed's leadership in the Small Business Administration       (SBA) has no factual grounding. Indeed, he has       specifically disavowed support for the boycott,       divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement, which seeks the       dissolution of Israel.    The AJC went on to say that Republican accusations against Mr. Syed  were ``un-American.''   Two weeks later, after the AJC released its statements, Republicans  on the committee concocted yet another reason to block Mr. Syed's  nomination. This time it was Planned Parenthood. Committee Republicans  announced that they would boycott all votes on the nomination because  Planned Parenthood affiliates received loans under the Paycheck  Protection Program, despite the fact that these loans were made during  the Trump administration and had nothing to do with Mr. Syed.   In response to Republican demands, on November 24, Administrator  Guzman sent the committee a detailed four-page response that gave a  full explanation of SBA's policy on providing PPP loans to nonprofits,  including Planned Parenthood. The SBA provided the specific data on the  number of loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates, as well as the total  dollars loaned and forgiven. The Administrator's letter makes clear  that the SBA is implementing affiliation standards for Planned  Parenthood in the same manner it is implementing the affiliation  standards for other nonprofits such as United Way, Boys and Girls  Clubs, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Goodwill.   Then there was another request for information and, once again, the  SBA sent another detailed letter to our committee to the ranking  member, Senator Rand Paul, dated December 15, 2021. That letter spells  out the specifics on every loan given out by the SBA--again, under the  Trump administration, initially--to the Planned Parenthood affiliates:  the numbers that apply for PPP; the numbers that withdrew those  applications; the total dollar amounts; the loans that were forgiven  under the original PPP amount and the total dollar amounts; the amount  of PPP No. 2 loans given out requested by Planned Parenthood; the  number that were withdrawn; the dollar amount that was given out; the  dollar amount that has been forgiven. All that has been made available  to our committee by the Small Business Administration.   Quite frankly, I don't know what else we can do. The SBA is required  to carry out the laws that Congress passed. We made it clear we wanted  nonprofits eligible for the help under the small business loan programs  that we created. We made it clear that the affiliation rules would be  applied, and the affiliation rules were applied the same way they were  applied to all nonprofits that have a national affiliation. And the  initial determination made under the Trump administration was reviewed  under the Biden administration to make sure that those affiliate rules  were applied and they were applied fairly to all nonprofits.   Thanks to the hard work of the SBA personnel, tens of millions of  small businesses and nonprofits have received Federal assistance to  keep their doors open and their employees on staff. The SBA has  provided relief through multiple rounds of the Paycheck Protection  Program, EIDL loan program, targeted grant programs, the Shuttered  Venue Operators Grant Program, and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.   Unfortunately, the SBA has had to implement these programs without  the benefit of a Deputy Administrator, the person whose job it is to  oversee the day-to-day operations of the Agency, and it gives us an  opportunity to have a confirmed person at the SBA who is answerable to  Congress and the American people.   Many nonpartisan, small business organizations support the nomination  of Mr. Syed, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business  Investor Alliance, and the Small Business Entrepreneurship Council. I  could read into the record numerous recommendation letters from the  whole gambit of the stakeholder community.   In April, the Chamber of Commerce wrote to the committee stating:         The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the nomination of       Dilawar Syed to be Deputy Administrator of the U.S. Small       Business Administration (SBA). We believe that it is       essential for SBA's senior leadership team to be in place to       deliver on the agency's COVID-19 small business emergency       relief responsibilities and we believe Mr. Syed is well       qualified for this position.    I agree. That is why, again, I am going to ask that the nomination be  discharged from the Small Business Committee and Mr. Syed receive an  up-or-down vote on this nomination. I might tell you that we have had  action in our committee. So this is not inconsistent with the action of  our committee.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small Business  Committee be discharged and the Senate proceed to the following  nomination: PN231, Dilawar Syed, of California, to be Deputy  Administrator of the Small Business Administration; that the nomination  be confirmed; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statement be  printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action.     I certainly regret that an objection has been made, but  let me at least correct the record. PPP money, Paycheck Protection  money, does not go to healthcare services. It goes to personnel costs.  It goes to related expenses. It does not go to healthcare services.   The law that we pass is the law that the administration implemented.  There were no restrictions referenced to what Senator Paul is referring  to included in the Paycheck Protection Program. The restrictions on a  nonprofit dealt with affiliation rules. Those affiliation rules were  applied to Planned Parenthood as they were applied to similar  organizations that I already put into the Record.   What Senator Paul is complaining about could have been taken up  during the debate of the Paycheck Protection Program, but it was not.   The bill was passed with Republican majorities in this body and with  President Trump signing it into law. It would have been against the  will of Congress for the Trump administration under the SBA or under  the Biden administration under the SBA to use its own judgment and not  the judgment of the policymaking branch of government--the legislative  branch of government.   So I just want to put on the record that the response by Senator Paul  is not the factual circumstances that we are dealing with. We are  dealing with a qualified person who should be confirmed by this body,  and the administration is carrying out the will of Congress in the way  that it has implemented the Paycheck Protection Program.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
