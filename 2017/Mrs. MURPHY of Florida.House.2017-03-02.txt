 Mr. Speaker, a century ago today, a Federal  law granted U.S. citizenship to individuals born in Puerto Rico. Island  residents have made countless contributions to this country in times of  peace and war, serving with exceptional valor in our Armed Forces. The  bonds between Puerto Rico and Florida are unbreakable. The State is  home to over 1 million Puerto Ricans, with most living in central  Florida.   Puerto Rico is going through difficult times, and I am determined to  help the Island get back on its feet. The main reason Puerto Rico is  struggling is because, as a territory, it is treated unequally under  Federal law. I support equal treatment for Puerto Rico because I oppose  second class citizenship.   Ultimately, I believe Puerto Rico should discard its territory status  and become a State or a sovereign nation. The choice lies with the  people of Puerto Rico. However, my personal hope is that they will  choose statehood so that they have full voting rights and full  equality.   Puerto Ricans have earned the right to become first class citizens of  the Nation they have served with honor.                            ____________________
