 Mr. Speaker, every week, we seem to learn more about  the sophisticated network of social media bots and online ads used by  Russia to spread disinformation during the 2016 election. But, as we  approach our next election, the Trump administration refuses to see the  very real threats or take the very necessary actions.   Earlier this year, we learned the office tasked with countering  foreign propaganda, the Global Engagement Center, the GEC, at the State  Department had not deployed any of the $120 million it had been  allocated to counter Russian information warfare, nor had it recruited  a single analyst who speaks Russian.   Mr. Speaker, the administration needs to take this threat seriously  and act with appropriate urgency. That is why I have introduced  legislation with my colleague, Ted Lieu, to clarify responsibilities  for the GEC, expand its hiring authorities, and establish stronger  congressional oversight. The GEC has a crucial role to play,  understanding, exposing, and countering foreign propaganda and  disinformation efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us on this legislation to  ensure we are better prepared to counter all efforts to interfere in  our electoral process.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  cruel and partisan safety net cuts masquerading as the farm bill.   The farm bill has long been a partisan cause, offering assistance and  security to farmers and needy families alike in a way that both  Democrats and Republicans can support. But this extreme bill cuts more  than $23 billion from nutrition assistance programs through eligibility  restrictions, kicking a projected 1 million households off the SNAP  program and reducing benefits for millions more.   Let me be clear: these are vital, lifesaving benefits to help  Americans put food on the table during moments of need. The average  family spends just 10 months on SNAP, receiving assistance just long  enough to get back on their feet. At the same time, the program helps  set our kids up for success. Hungry children perform worse in school,  and studies have shown that children on SNAP achieve higher test scores  and are more likely to graduate from high school. Children on SNAP  achieve higher test scores and succeed, and they have the opportunity  to do well later in life.   Mr. Speaker, the partisan approach was the wrong way on tax reform,  it was the wrong way on healthcare, and it is the wrong way now. I urge  my Republican colleagues to abandon this party-line legislation and  instead approach the farm bill in the fair, bipartisan manner we have  in the past.
