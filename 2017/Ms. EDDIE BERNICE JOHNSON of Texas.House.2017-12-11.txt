 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs). Nine HBCUs--Alabama State University, Barber- Scotia College, Fayetteville State University, Howard University,  Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State  University, St. Augustine's University, and Talladega College,  celebrate 150 years of excellence this year.   HBCUs are pillars of the black community and important contributors  to the strength of our nation. 40 percent of the Congressional Black  Caucus (CBC) are graduates from one or more HBCUs and with their  representation they continue to remind us of the importance of fighting  for these institutions. HBCUs not only provide a college education for  300,000 students every year, but they are economic powerhouses. Since  2017 HBCUs have generated an annual economic impact of $14.8 billion  annually--nearly $5 billion higher than in 2006.   I've seen the substantial impact of HBCUs in my district by the  example Paul Quinn College has set. Paul Quinn College plays a major  role in the economic success of its graduates by enhancing their  education, training and leadership skills. A college degree opens the  door to economic prosperity through greater employment and earnings  potential. In fact, Paul Quinn College's class of 2014 can expect total  earnings of $53 million over their lifetimes--that's 77 percent more  than they could expect to earn without their college credentials.   Paul Quinn College not only contributes to the economic success of  its students, but it also provides a foundation for students to grow.  Like many HBCUs, Paul Quinn College is committed to the holistic  development of their students. Professors not only focus on academic  excellence, but they also invest in the professional and individual  development of their students.   HBCUs will always be a prominent force in our nation. As a member of  the Congressional Black Caucus I recognize the importance of its  funding and legacy in our country. Please join me in recognizing the  legacy of HBCUs across our country.                            ____________________
