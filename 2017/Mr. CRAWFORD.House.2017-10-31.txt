 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2921) to establish a vegetation management pilot program on  National Forest System land to better protect utility infrastructure  from passing wildfire, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2921         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Forest System       Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHTS-OF-WAY VEGETATION                     MANAGEMENT PILOT PROGRAM.         (a) Pilot Program Required.--To encourage owners or       operators of rights-of-way on National Forest System land to       partner with the Forest Service to voluntarily perform       vegetation management on a proactive basis to better protect       utility infrastructure from potential passing wildfires, the       Secretary shall conduct a limited, voluntary pilot program,       in the manner described in this section, to permit vegetation       management projects on National Forest System land adjacent       to or near such rights-of-way.        (b) Eligible Participants.--A participant in the pilot       program must have a right-of-way on National Forest System       land. In selecting participants, the Secretary shall give       priority to holders of a right-of-way who have worked with       Forest Service fire scientists and used technologies, such as       Light Detection and Ranging surveys, to improve utility       infrastructure protection prescriptions.        (c) Project Elements.--A vegetation management project       under the pilot program involves limited and selective       vegetation management activities, which--        (1) shall create the least amount of disturbance reasonably       necessary to protect utility infrastructure from passing       wildfires based on applicable models, including Forest       Service fuel models;        (2) may include thinning, fuel reduction, creation and       treatment of shaded fuel breaks, and other measures as       appropriate;        (3) shall only take place adjacent to the participant's       right-of-way or within 75 feet of the participant's right-of-      way;        (4) shall not take place in any designated wilderness area,       wilderness study area, or inventoried roadless area; and        (5) shall be subject to approval by the Forest Service in       accordance with this Act.        (d) Project Costs.--A participant in the pilot program       shall be responsible for all costs, as determined by the       Secretary, incurred in participating in the pilot program,       unless the Secretary determines that it is in the public       interest for the Forest Service to contribute funds for a       vegetation management project conducted under the pilot       program.  [[Page H8281]]         (e) Liability.--        (1) In general.--Participation in the pilot program does       not affect any existing legal obligations or liability       standards that--        (A) arise under the right-of-way for activities in the       right-of-way; or        (B) apply to fires resulting from causes other than       activities conducted pursuant to an approved vegetation       management project.        (2) Project work.--A participant shall not be liable to the       United States for damage proximately caused by activities       conducted pursuant to an approved vegetation management       project unless--        (A) such activities were carried out in a manner that was       grossly negligent or that violated criminal law; or        (B) the damage was caused by the failure of the participant       to comply with specific safety requirements expressly imposed       by the Forest Service as a condition of participating in the       pilot program.        (f) Implementation.--The Secretary shall utilize existing       laws and regulations in the conduct of the pilot program and,       in order to implement the pilot program in an efficient and       expeditious manner, may waive or modify specific provisions       of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, including       modifications to allow for formation of contracts or       agreements on a noncompetitive basis.        (g) Treatment of Proceeds.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, the Secretary may--        (1) retain any funds provided to the Forest Service by a       participant in the pilot program; and        (2) use such funds, in such amounts as may be appropriated,       in the conduct of the pilot program.        (h) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) National forest system land.--The term ``National       Forest System land'' means land within the National Forest       System, as defined in section 11(a) of the Forest and       Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C.       1609(a)) exclusive of the National Grasslands and land       utilization projects designated as National Grasslands       administered pursuant to the Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C.       1010-1012).        (2) Passing wildfire.--The term ``passing wildfire'' means       a wildfire that originates outside the right-of-way.        (3) Right-of-way.--The term ``right-of-way'' means a       special use authorization issued by the Forest Service       allowing the placement of utility infrastructure.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Agriculture.        (5) Utility infrastructure.--The term ``utility       infrastructure'' means electric transmission lines, natural       gas infrastructure, or related structures.        (i) Duration.--The authority to conduct the pilot program,       and any vegetation management project under the pilot       program, expires December 21, 2027.        (j) Report to Congress.--Not later than December 31, 2019,       and every two years thereafter, the Secretary shall issue a       report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of       the Senate, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and       Forestry of the Senate, the Committee on Natural Resources of       the House of Representatives, and the Committee on       Agriculture of the House of Representatives on the status of       the program and any projects established under this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2921, the National Forest  System Vegetation Management Pilot Program Act of 2017. This  legislation authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to create a pilot  program to assist in the management of our Federal forests to reduce  wildfire risk and associated costs. These management pilot projects are  approved by the Forest Service, but will be conducted and paid for by  the private sector.   This collaborative approach will ensure a more stable power grid for  Americans in rural areas. Deteriorating forest health is a problem felt  across the United States, particularly in the West. This has resulted  in increased fire threats to the electric transmission and associated  utility infrastructures across the Forest Service land.   The Government Accountability Office has found that fuel reduction  treatment projects reduce flammable vegetation, minimize the severity  of wildland fires, create landscape resiliency to fire, and provide  firefighter access during fire suppression activities.   Utility infrastructure destroyed by a fire or a fallen dead tree is  costly to repair or replace, and outages can result in significant  economic costs to businesses and homes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to  allow utilities to collaborate with the Forest Service to keep the  lights on in rural communities, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage  of H.R. 2921, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2941) to provide for the conveyance of certain National  Forest System land within Kisatchie National Forest in the State of  Louisiana.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2941         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Kisatchie National Forest       Land Conveyance Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDING.         Congress finds that it is in the public interest to       authorize the conveyance of certain Federal land in the       Kisatchie National Forest in the State of Louisiana for       market value consideration.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Collins camp properties.--The term ``Collins Camp       Properties'' means Collins Camp Properties, Inc., a       corporation incorporated under the laws of the State.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Agriculture.        (3) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of       Louisiana.       SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF CONVEYANCES, KISATCHIE NATIONAL                     FOREST, LOUISIANA.

(d) Consideration.--Consideration for a conveyance of       Federal land under this Act shall be--        (1) in the form of cash; and        (2) in an amount equal to the market value of the Federal       land being conveyed, as determined under subsection (e).        (e) Market Value.--The market value of the Federal land       conveyed under this Act shall be determined--        (1) in the case of Federal land conveyed under subsection       (b), by an appraisal that is--        (A) conducted in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal       Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions; and        (B) approved by the Secretary; or        (2) if conveyed by a method other than the methods       described in subsection (b), by competitive sale.        (f) Hazardous Substances.--        (1) In general.--In any conveyance of Federal land under       this Act, the Secretary shall meet disclosure requirements       for hazardous substances, but shall otherwise not be required       to remediate or abate the substances.

SEC. 5. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF LAND.         The Secretary shall deposit the proceeds of a conveyance of       Federal land under section 4 in the fund established under       Public Law 90-171 (commonly known as the ``Sisk Act'') (16       U.S.C. 484a).       SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION.         (a) Costs.--As a condition of a conveyance of Federal land       to Collins Camp Properties under section 4, the Secretary       shall require Collins Camp Properties to pay at closing--        (1) reasonable appraisal costs; and        (2) the cost of any administrative and environmental       analyses required by law (including regulations).        (b) Permits.--        (1) In general.--An offer by Collins Camp Properties for       the acquisition of the Federal land under section 4 shall be       accompanied by a written statement from each holder of a       Forest Service special use authorization with respect to the       Federal land that specifies that the holder agrees to       relinquish the special use authorization on the conveyance of       the Federal land to Collins Camp Properties.        (2) Special use authorizations.--If any holder of a special       use authorization described in paragraph (1) fails to provide       a written authorization in accordance with that paragraph,       the Secretary shall require, as a condition of the       conveyance, that Collins Camp Properties administer the       special use authorization according to the terms of the       special use authorization until the date on which the special       use authorization expires.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2941, the Kisatchie  National Forest Land Conveyance Act.   This measure introduced by our colleague, Mr. Abraham, authorizes the  USDA to sell specified Federal land in Winn Parish, Louisiana. The  rural residential qualities of the land make it incompatible with  National Forest management, and this transfer would eliminate  unnecessary administrative and boundary maintenance costs on the  already strained Forest Service.   The Kisatchie National Forest is rich in renewable wildlife  resources, and supporting wilderness habitat is vital to their  sustainability. This transfer, supported by the Forest Service, will  allow the forest to be managed at the highest level of stewardship.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage  of H.R. 2941. I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her support.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3567) to authorize the purchase of a small parcel of Natural  Resources Conservation Service property in Riverside, California, by  the Riverside Corona Resource Conservation District, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds as follows:        (1) Since 1935, the United States has owned a parcel of       land in Riverside, California, consisting of approximately       8.75 acres, more specifically described in section 2(a) (in       this section referred to as the ``property'').        (2) The property is under the jurisdiction of the       Department of Agriculture and has been variously used for       research and plant materials purposes.        (3) Since 1998, the property has been administered by the       Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of       Agriculture.        (4) Since 2002, the property has been co-managed under a       cooperative agreement between the Natural Resources       Conservation Service and the Riverside Corona Resource       Conservation District, which is a legal subdivision of the       State of California under section 9003 of the California       Public Resources Code.        (5) The Conservation District wishes to purchase the       property and use it for conservation, environmental, and       related educational purposes.        (6) As provided in section 2, the purchase of the property       by the Conservation District would promote the conservation       education and related activities of the Conservation District       and result in savings to the Federal Government.       SEC. 2. LAND PURCHASE, NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE                     PROPERTY, RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.         (a) Purchase Authorized.--The Secretary of Agriculture       shall sell and quitclaim to the Riverside Corona Resource       Conservation District (in this section referred to as the       ``Conservation District'') all right, title, and interest of       the United States in and to a parcel of real property,       including improvements thereon, that is located at 4500       Glenwood Drive in Riverside, California, consists of       approximately 8.75 acres, and is administered by the Natural       Resources Conservation Service of the Department of       Agriculture. As necessary or desirable to facilitate the       purchase of the property under this section, the Secretary or       the Conservation District may survey all or portions of the       property.        (b) Consideration.--As consideration for the purchase of       the property under this section, the Conservation District       shall pay to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount equal to       the appraised value of the property.        (c) Prohibition on Reservation of Interest.--The Secretary       of Agriculture shall not reserve any future interest in the       property to be conveyed under this section, except such       interest as may be acceptable to the Conservation District.        (d) Hazardous Substances.--Notwithstanding section 120(h)       of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,       and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)) or the Solid       Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), in the case of       the property purchased by the Conservation District under       this section, the Secretary of Agriculture shall be only       required to meet the disclosure requirements for hazardous       substances, pollutants, or contaminants, but shall otherwise       not be required to remediate or abate any such releases of       hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, including       petroleum and petroleum derivatives.        (e) Cooperative Authority.--        (1) Leases, contracts, and cooperative agreements       authorized.--In conjunction with, or in addition to, the       purchase of the property by the Conservation District under       this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may enter into       leases, contracts and cooperative agreements with the       Conservation District.        (2) Sole source.--Notwithstanding sections 3105, 3301, and       3303 to 3305 of title 41, United States Code, or any other       provision of law, the Secretary may lease real property from       the Conservation District on a noncompetitive basis.        (3) Non-exclusive authority.--The authority provided by       this subsection is in addition to any other authority of the       Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3567, to authorize the  transfer of the title of land owned by the NRCS in Riverside,  California, to the Riverside-Corona Resource Conservation District. The  conservation district has invested $2.8 million in the facility with  the hope of eventually acquiring the property, and would like to invest  in further improvements when the property title issue is resolved.   Conservation districts work closely with their Federal partner, the  NRCS. This legislation is a simple fix to allow the Riverside-Corona  district to utilize the facility and serve the local folks on the  ground through voluntary, incentive-based conservation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  his remarks, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for her support, and I  urge all Members to support the passage of H.R. 3567.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2521) to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of  2002 to include South Carolina as a part of the Virginia/Carolina  peanut producing region for purposes of appointment to the Peanut  Standards Board.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2521         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``South Carolina Peanut Parity       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. SOUTH CAROLINA INCLUSION IN VIRGINIA/CAROLINA PEANUT                     PRODUCING REGION.         Section 1308(c)(2)(B)(iii) of the Farm Security and Rural       Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7958(c)(2)(B)(iii)) is       amended by striking ``Virginia and North Carolina'' and       inserting ``Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2521, the South Carolina  Peanut Parity Act of 2017.   This legislation would allow for a representative of the South  Carolina peanut industry to be eligible for appointment to the Peanut  Standards Board, which is tasked with the important role of  establishing quality and handling standards for domestic and imported  peanuts.   At the time the Peanut Standards Board was created, South Carolina  was not a major peanut-producing State. However, now they are the  fourth largest peanut-growing State and produce over 8 percent of U.S.- grown peanuts, and they deserve to have input into the establishment or  alteration of industry standards. This bill would accomplish that by  including South Carolina in the Virginia/Carolina peanut-producing  region for the purpose of appointments to the Peanut Standards Board.   I want to thank Representative Wilson and the entire South Carolina  delegation for their work on this legislation. This measure is broadly  supported by the U.S. peanut industry and the American Farm Bureau  Federation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  for his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman), a member of the State's delegation.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from  South Carolina for his comments. And to my friend, the gentlewoman from  Ohio, if only the farm bill was this easy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
