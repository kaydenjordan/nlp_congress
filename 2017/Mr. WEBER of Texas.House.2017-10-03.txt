 Madam Speaker, the science is clear, as  dismemberment abortion procedures pull children apart limb from limb,  the baby feels pain. The baby recoils as the instruments get closer.  The fight or flight instinct is there. If that isn't proof of life, I  don't know what is. These late term abortions must end.   My position on this matter is well-known. It has long been my mission  to protect the unborn.   A vast majority of Americans agree, late term abortions are wrong.  Period. Full stop.   This bill isn't just for the sake of the babies. This bill protects  their mothers. At 20 weeks, this horrendous procedure is risky and  subjects mothers to serious dangers.   Lives are at stake, both for mothers and their babies.   I support this bill, and urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, in both chambers to do the same. Thank you Mr. Franks for  introducing this important piece of legislation.
