 Mr. Speaker, on Friday, December 6, 2019,  I was unfortunately not present for roll call votes 653 through 654, in  order to attend a funeral. If I had been present for these votes, I  would have voted:   Nay on roll call vote 653 on the motion to recommit with  instructions.   Yea on roll call vote 654 on the passage of H.R. 4.                            ____________________
