 Mr. President, 2 minutes to speak, please, for two  purposes.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.                            ____________________     One, I congratulate my friend, Patrick Leahy for once  again assuming the position of President pro tempore after 6 years of  absence, I believe, and also to express my working relationship with  him in the 40 years that he and I have served together in the U.S.  Senate.   But also to the fourth estate, because we always read about rancor on  television, radio, and print--they never speak about how Senators get  along. We have seen a peaceful transfer of leadership position in the  U.S. Senate, from a Senator from Kentucky to a Senator from New York.   Now, for the first purpose of rising, because most of my colleagues  don't know, when there is nobody on the Senate and I open the Senate up  for prayer and for the Pledge of Allegiance, I usually give a 1-minute  speech. And I would like to give my last 1-minute speech as President  pro tempore. I am not saying that I won't take advantage of that  opportunity when nobody else is around, as well.   Four years ago, our Nation's Capital was full of people who had come  to celebrate a new President's inauguration, and it was full of people  who came to protest the winner of that election.   This Biden inauguration was different in that respect. But this year,  just like 4 years ago, there are Americans who question the election  outcome and did not want the inauguration to proceed. Since election  day, I have urged Americans to have faith in our constitutional system  and let the Constitution work the way it has for 240 years--work its  course. Today was the culmination of that process.   Like 4 years ago, I know that many Americans are not happy with how  it turned out. That is absolutely fine, just like 4 years ago was fine  for those people that resisted.   In our country, nobody is obliged to like or support a President,  but, hopefully, people will really respect the Office of the  Presidency, regardless who holds it.   However, while the Presidency changed hands, I hope we can retire,  hashtag ``resist.''   You wouldn't know it listening to partisan commentators from the  right or left, but you do not have to make a choice between giving your  President unqualified support or total opposition to the President.   As a legislator, I would be doing a disservice to those I represent  if I did either unqualified support for a Republican President or total  opposition to a Democratic President. In my work on behalf of Iowans, I  have to engage with the administration of the day if I want to be a  responsible Senator.   As I have with every President, I will seek to find common ground  with President Biden wherever possible, but I will strongly oppose  policies that I think are not good for Iowa and all Americans. That  will be on input that I receive from my fellow Iowans.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on January 11, I had the honor of  administering the oath of office to Iowa's speaker of the house,  Patrick Grassley, who also happens to be my grandson. It was a  privilege for me and my family to participate in the opening day of the  Iowa Legislature's 89th General Assembly. Pat has represented the  people of house district 50 since 2007. He is in his second year  serving his caucus as speaker.   In addition to celebrating Pat's professional accomplishments, we  were also moved by the prayer that was written and shared by our great  granddaughter Reagan, alongside her siblings Indee and Chance, as the  legislature convened.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Reagan's prayer be printed in  the Record following my remarks.   She is 11 years old. Barbara and I are truly blessed to spend  memorable days like this one together as a family.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                        State of Iowa House Journal                           MONDAY, JANUARY 11, 2021                   First Calendar Day--First Session Day                    Hall of the House of Representatives                 Des Moines, Iowa, Monday, January 11, 2021         Pursuant to chapter two (2), sections two point one (2.1)       and two point three (2.3), Code of Iowa, the House of       Representatives of the Eighty-ninth General Assembly of Iowa,       2021 Regular Session, convened at 10:03 a.m., Monday, January       11, 2021.        The House was called to order by the Honorable John Wills,       state representative from Dickinson County.        Prayer was offered by Reagan Grassley. She is the daughter       of Speaker Grassley.         Dear Heavenly Father,        Thank you for bringing us here today.        Thank you for giving these leaders the opportunity to not       only serve the state of Iowa, but to serve you.        You are a good father who promises beauty for ashes and joy       for our sadness, but we are hurting Father. This world is       hurting. We pray that we can learn to love ourselves, and       others in this room, more like you.        In a broken world these truths remain: you are pain taker,       a way maker, and a chain breaker.  [[Page S72]]         May our lives be a direct reflection of who you are and our       service would show your goodness.        We pray that you will continue to protect us and keep us       safe.        In your son's name we pray, Amen.                             PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE         The Pledge of Allegiance was led by Indee, Reagan and       Chance Grassley. They are the children of Speaker Grassley.                            ____________________
