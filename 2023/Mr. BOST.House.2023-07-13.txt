 Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a family trucking business, a  company that I worked with for years, and I spent my years driving over  the road. I knew the challenges our truck drivers faced: Time  pressures, lack of sleep, and nowhere to stop for the night.   When I came to Congress, I joined the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and made it a top priority to expand access  for safe truck parking.   Now, I knew we had a threat to public safety when exhausted truck  drivers pushed that extra mile just to end up sleeping on the highway  shoulder on an off-ramp because there is not enough space in our rest  areas. Critics who didn't understand the issue said it wasn't a  priority, and they asked why they should care.   Well, early yesterday morning, a Greyhound bus traveling from  Indianapolis to St. Louis veered into the shoulder of an off-ramp in  Madison County, Illinois. Parked on the off-ramp were three tractor  trailers and the drivers resting inside.   Three passengers on the bus were killed. Over a dozen were injured.  It is a tragedy that didn't have to happen.   I have introduced legislation to direct existing Federal funding to  build more truck parking spaces. I am hopeful that we get the Truck  Parking Safety Improvement Act signed into law. Let's act before we  have another tragedy.   My prayers are with the families and the victims of this accident.                            ____________________
