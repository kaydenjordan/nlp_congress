 Mr. President, today, I have reintroduced legislation to  protect Americans from being stripped of their legal rights by little  known clauses that are now hidden in an alarming number of contracts.  When we enter into agreements to obtain cell phone service, rent an  apartment, or accept a new job, most are not made aware of the forced  arbitration clauses that are tucked away in the legal fine print. But  these dangerous provision force us to abandon our constitutional right  to protect ourselves in court and instead send hard-working Americans  to face wealthy corporations behind closed doors in private  arbitration. This must change.   When Congress passed the Federal Arbitration Act in 1925, it was  intended to help businesses resolve legal disputes with each other. But  over the past two decades, private arbitration has been abused by large  companies to push Americans out of court. In doing so, these companies  have effectively opted out of critical labor, consumer, and civil  rights laws that give Americans the ability to assert their claims  before our independent judiciary.   Forced arbitration clauses now appear in nearly every contract we  sign. Unfortunately, examples of the injustice caused by these clauses  are equally ubiquitous and can be found all across the country. They  affect consumers, workers, seniors, veterans, and families in Vermont  and every other State, and the cases are heart-wrenching.   Just last week, the Washington Post reported that hundreds of current  and former employees of Sterling Jewelers--a company that earns $6  billion in annual revenue--have for years alleged that the company is  engaged in pervasive gender discrimination and has fostered a culture  that condones sexual harassment. The stories now being reported are  shocking and date back to the early 1990s. Yet, despite the fact that  women at the company have been alleging misconduct for decades, no one  knew about it. That is because their claims were hidden behind closed  doors because of private arbitration. To this day, we still do not know  the full details.   The press has helped to bring attention to other instances of forced  arbitration in recent years. In 2015, the Los Angeles Times revealed  that Wells Fargo used arbitration clauses to deny customers whose names  were used to open fraudulent accounts an opportunity to seek justice in  court. In fact, Wells Fargo asked a Federal court in Utah to move a  number of sham account allegations to arbitration. The New York Times  dedicated a three-part investigative series to highlighting the impact  on consumers and workers of forced arbitration clauses. And becoming  the story herself, television journalist Gretchen Carlson was barred  from speaking publicly about her allegations of sexual harassment  against former FOX News chairman Roger Ailes.   I have long raised concerns about the practice of forced arbitration,  and as chairman led hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007,  2008, 2011, and 2013. This should not be a partisan issue. Both  Republican and Democratic attorneys general have repeatedly spoken out  against the Federal Arbitration Act's intrusion on State sovereignty  and a State's compelling interest in protecting the health and welfare  of its citizens. In Vermont, lawmakers enacted commonsense legislation  to limit the abuse of forced arbitration clauses and raise consumer  awareness, but but this law was invalidated because it conflicted with  Federal law. Companies have effectively created a ``get out of jail  free'' card that guts our laws and shields bad actors from any type of  public accountability. This is an unconscionable situation, and  Congress must act.   The Restoring Statutory Rights Act that I am reintroducing today/will  protect Americans' right to seek justice in our courts. It will ensure  that our Federal laws will actually be effective by ensuring that  Americans cannot be stripped of their ability to enforce their rights  before our independent court system. This bill also ensures that when  States act to address forced arbitration, as my home State of Vermont  has, they are not preempted by an overbroad reading of our Federal  arbitration laws.   This effort is supported by the Leadership Conference for Civil and  Human Rights, the National Employment Lawyers' Association, and  consumer groups such as National Association of Consumer Advocates,  Consumers Union, Public Citizen, the National Consumer Law Center, and  Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. For years, these groups and  many others have worked tirelessly to highlight the injustice of forced  arbitration and the full scope of the number of people it affects.   All Senators should care about ensuring that corporations cannot  unilaterally circumvent the statutes that this body writes, debates,  and enacts into law. Senators should also care about the ability of the  States to protect consumers from unconscionable contracts. I urge  Members to support this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Whitehouse, Ms.          Warren, Mr. Reed, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blumenthal, and Ms. Hirono):   S. 553. A bill to provide that chapter 1 of title 9 of the United  States Code, relating to the enforcement of arbitration agreements,  shall not apply to enrollment agreements made between students and  certain institutions of higher education, and to prohibit limitations  on the ability of students to pursue claims against certain  institutions of higher education; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 553         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Court Legal Access and       Student Support (CLASS) Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON LIMITATIONS ON ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO                     PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS OF                     HIGHER EDUCATION.         Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(30) The institution will not require any student to       agree to, and will not enforce, any limitation or restriction       (including a limitation or restriction on any available       choice of applicable law, a jury trial, or venue) on the       ability of a student to pursue a claim, individually or with       others, against an institution in court.''.       SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take       effect 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 555. A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
