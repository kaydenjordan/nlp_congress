 Mr. President, recently Hawaii public schools resumed  classes for the start of the 2020-2021 school year.   Faced with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, our schools had planned  to combine in-person, distance, and blended learning this year.  Unfortunately, a sudden increase in coronavirus cases required a shift  to fully distance learning through the first quarter. Now schools are  navigating distance learning as they determine how they will return to  the classroom.   The pandemic has made it difficult to plan, and our principals,  teachers, parents, and students are doing the best they can. Many are  still recovering from earlier this year, when the coronavirus closed  campuses for two months--resulting in 46 fewer days in the classroom  for students, who almost certainly experienced learning or  instructional loss.   I have heard from parents and students, and they have been effusive  in their praise for educators who are making this school year work. I  have also heard from educators, who have been clear in their need for  more training and resources--especially when it comes to learning new  strategies for providing effective distance learning and addressing  instructional loss in students. Many educators are concerned about how  the pandemic will disproportionately impact at-risk and marginalized  students. In Hawaii, educators are concerned about how it will impact  Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students, who before the pandemic  already experienced achievement gaps in reading, math, and science, and  graduated from high school and attended college at lower rates than  their peers. These are not new challenges that we need to address, but  they could certainly be made worse by the pandemic unless we provide  the appropriate resources.   Until a vaccine is widely available, we must make decisions based on  the best science and public health information we can get in order to  keep families, teachers, and school support staff safe. For many school  districts around the nation, distance learning will be a key component  of our education system, and we owe it to our students to do it right.  For these reasons I am introducing the Learning Opportunity and  Achievement Act, or ``LOAA'', which would provide professional  development and training resources for educators, tutoring and academic  services for students, and resources for innovation grants, learning  hubs, and research and best practices related to instructional loss in  at-risk and marginalized students.   No one anticipated how the coronavirus would change our schools, as  the abrupt shift to distance learning this past spring showed. Our  educators need additional professional development and training  resources so that they can provide the most effective educational  experience to students of all ages and backgrounds.   LOAA provides these resources through new and existing programs.  Specifically, the bill provides $2.25 billion for ESSA Title II-A  programs, $50 million for new professional development programs, and  $100 million for new training programs.   Building on what we know about effective professional development,  the bill promotes programs that are evidenced-based, collaborative,  job-embedded, content-based, and sustained. These kinds of programs  will be helpful for educators.   We do not know the full impact the coronavirus will have on schools,  but preliminary estimates have indicated that recent closures could  result in severe setbacks for students--including, on average, 7 months  of instructional loss for all students, 10.3 months for Black students,  9.2 months for Hispanic students, and more than a year for low-income  students. LOAA provides $50 million for new tutoring programs to  address instructional loss in at-risk and marginalized students.   The bill also includes funding for innovation grants and learning  hubs to give public schools the resources they need to provide  effective, equitable distance learning opportunities to all students.  These resources will allow different school districts to take different  approaches based on their local needs and circumstances, while offering  opportunities for at-risk and low-income families who cannot afford to  create privately tutored ``pods'' to ensure that their children don't  fall further behind.   And finally, the bill includes requirements for the U.S. Department  of Education to identify and disseminate best practices for schools to  address instructional loss. It also requires the Department to study  instructional loss in at-risk and marginalized students.   Let me be clear. K-12 schools need additional support during this  difficult time. Senate Democrats are fighting to provide this support,  including at least $175 billion for K-12 schools, and will continue to  do so. But we can go even further to make sure our educators have the  resources they need to help students succeed--not only during the 2020- 2021 school year, but also in future years. LOAA would help to provide  these resources.  [[Page S6380]]    I encourage my colleagues to support this important bill.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Markey, and Mr.          Booker):   S. 4837. A bill to repeal the Alien Enemies Act, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Neighbors  Not Enemies Act. This long overdue legislation would repeal the Alien  Enemies Act, one of four laws from 1798 that were collectively known as  the Alien and Sedition Acts. These controversial laws were enacted  during a period of threatened war and were an attempt to severely limit  freedom of speech and press and the rights of noncitizen residents. Of  the four laws, only the Alien Enemies Act remains in effect. The Alien  Enemies Act allows the President of the United States to ``apprehend[  ], restrain[ ], secure[ ] and remove[ ],'' noncitizens without due  process during times of war.   In 1941, President Roosevelt used the authority of the Alien Enemies  Act to apprehend ``alien enemies deemed dangerous to the public health  or safety of the United States by the Attorney General or Secretary of  War.'' These actions allowed for the detention of Japanese, Italian,  and Germans as well as confiscation of their property. Then in 1942,  Roosevelt expanded on his actions by issuing Executive Order 9066,  which authorized the mass removal and incarceration of 120,000 Japanese  Americans, both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, during World War II. The  internment of Japanese Americans was a shameful act, and it was not  until 1988 that the Civil Liberties Act was passed, formally  apologizing to Americans of Japanese ancestry and providing reparations  of $20,000 to each surviving victim who was incarcerated during World  War II.   During the 2016 election, Donald Trump invoked President Franklin D.  Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act during World War II  when he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United  States. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to advance  divisive policies and hateful rhetoric that target and demonize Muslim  and other minority communities. The President's cruel anti-immigrant  policies have resulted in the separation of children at the border,  detention of families with no end in sight, and many more harmful  policies that betray the principles and values on which our Nation was  built upon.   The President has brought the need to repeal the Alien Enemies Act to  the forefront. We must stop his attempts to divide us through  intolerance and fear. We must prevent civil and human rights travesties  from happening on U.S. soil again. Sadly, we cannot trust the  President. The Neighbors Not Enemies Act would help keep our Nation  from repeating history in targeting an entire group of noncitizens for  unconstitutional and discriminatory arrest, detention, and deportation.  The repeal of the Alien Enemies Act is long overdue, and I call on my  colleagues in the United States Senate to swiftly pass the Neighbors  Not Enemies Act during the 116th Congress.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
