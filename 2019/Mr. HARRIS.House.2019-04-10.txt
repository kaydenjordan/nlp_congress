 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule  this important bill to save the lives of these babies who are born  alive after an abortion attempt. This bill is exceedingly important and  should be brought to the floor.
