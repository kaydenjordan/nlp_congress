 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, this week, thousands of law  enforcement officers, their families, and their supporters from around  the country gathered in Washington, D.C., to commemorate National  Police Week.   We are here tonight to thank those who put on the uniform every day  to protect our communities and put their lives in the breach between  the criminal element and the public they protect.   We are also here to recognize those who have completed their service  and now enjoy a well-deserved thank-you for their selfless service to  their communities.   But, most importantly, we are here to honor the fallen.   Last year, 158 police officers gave their last measure of devotion to  their communities. Among these heroes, you will find every gender,  every creed, every race, every religion. They hail from every corner of  America.  [[Page H3914]]    One of those 158 officers was not only from my district, but served  at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office with me, where I spent a 41-year  career.   Officer Lance Whitaker began his career with the Atlantic Beach  Police Department and then served 17 dedicated years at Jacksonville  Sheriff's Office. He was tragically killed while responding to a call  in the early morning hours of May 15, 2018, almost 1 year ago today.   He left behind his son, Cade; his mother, Lannie; and his sister,  Angela. He also left behind a memory and a legacy that will live on in  the hearts and minds of those who knew him.   Many of us are here today to honor friends, family, and loved ones  like Officer Whitaker, who gave his last full measure of devotion to a  community he loved and a community that loved him back.   I now ask that we observe a moment of silence for Officer Whitaker  and all of the 158 brave law enforcement officers who lost their lives  protecting our community.   Tonight, Madam Speaker, in a very bipartisan fashion, we will hear  from Members on both sides of the aisle and from all across the country  as we join together to show our unity in supporting our police  officers.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Hill), my friend who is from a law enforcement family and brings a  strong pro-police voice to Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Hill, and I look  forward to working with her on some of the bills she just highlighted.  I know that her law enforcement family is proud, so I thank her.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil),  my good friend, who is from Wisconsin's First District.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and the great  State of Wisconsin for their support of law enforcement.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Torres  Small), a colleague from New Mexico's Second District. She serves on  the Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, and,  actually, after law school, worked for a U.S. district judge in New  Mexico, so she has got that law enforcement background, also.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the kind  words of support for our law enforcement community, and I thank her for  her service earlier, as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), my  good friend from Nebraska's Second District. He serves on our  Agriculture Committee and Armed Services Committee. He is a retired  brigadier general and did his deployment in Iraq, and we thank him for  that service.    Madam Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the  gentleman's LEOSA bill, and having been a law enforcement officer, I  understand exactly what the gentleman is trying to accomplish. I  support him 110 percent in that effort, and I appreciate the words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger), who serves on the Foreign Affairs and Agriculture  Committees. She is also--I think we can say this--a former CIA case  officer.   Is it safe to say that now?    Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman's father was a career  law enforcement officer also.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from  Virginia and just know that our condolences go to those two officers'  families, those heroes that you lost this last year. God bless.   Madam Speaker, I would like to introduce the Member from the great  State of Minnesota's Eighth District, Pete Stauber. He serves on the  Transportation and Infrastructure and Small Business Committees and was  a police officer in Duluth, Minnesota, for 23 years. I thank the  gentleman for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the gentleman's 23  years of service. I know what commitment that is, and God bless him for  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer), who is my good friend.   Josh Gottheimer is from New Jersey's Fifth District who serves on the  Financial Services Committee and worked in both the public sector as a  White House speechwriter and in the private industry for Ford and  Microsoft. I thank the gentleman for being here this evening.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey for having the backs of police officers who have our back, and I  thank the gentleman very much for being here tonight to show that  support for law enforcement that is so important across the country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).  Representative Ben Cline serves on the  [[Page H3917]]  House Judiciary and Education and Labor Committees. He is a lawyer and  serves as an Assistant Commonwealth Attorney and was also chief of  staff and--I didn't know this--chief of staff for my good friend, Bob  Goodlatte, who is one of my heroes from Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia.   In particular, I want to offer, again, our condolences to those  officers, those heroes from Virginia, who gave their lives in service.   Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Representative Clay Higgins  from the great State of Louisiana, their Third District. He was a  National Guard military police officer for many years, a SWAT operator.  I am sure he will have some great words for us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Louisiana  for all his service those many years.   I would like to recognize, again, my cohost for tonight,  Representative Katie Hill. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Hill).    Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to be here with  the gentlewoman tonight to recognize our law enforcement community.   Madam Speaker, I will close with this. It is from Ralph Waldo  Emerson. He said:         The purpose in life is not to be happy. It is to be useful,       to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some       difference that you have lived and lived well.    Madam Speaker, the 158 lives that we honor tonight, all the thousands  of law enforcement officers serving this moment, they live well. For  that, we are grateful.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
