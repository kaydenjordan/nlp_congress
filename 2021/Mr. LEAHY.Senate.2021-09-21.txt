 Mr. President, innovation is the lifeblood of the American  economy. Thanks to our Founders, our Constitution anticipated the power  of innovation and enshrined the basic idea that inventors should be  given the incentive to do what they do best. The intellectual property  clause has pushed the United States to be the longstanding global  leader in innovation. Unfortunately, like too many other aspects of our  society, the benefits of our innovation ecosystem have not been equally  felt by Americans from all backgrounds. Today, I am proud to introduce  the bipartisan Unleashing American Innovators Act, legislation that  will make the patent system more accessible to Americans from all  backgrounds and ensure that we do more to harness the untapped  potential that exists in our country.   The Unleashing American Innovators Act builds on a legacy of  broadening access to the patent system that I am particularly proud of.  Ten years ago last week, Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America  Invents Act, which was the most significant update to our patent laws  in nearly sixty years. Under the Leahy-Smith Act, we created a network  of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) satellite offices around the  country, bringing the PTO closer to where Americans actually innovate.  We lowered fees for small businesses and created a new micro-entity  status to lower fees even further. We also created a Patent Pro Bono  program to help make legal resources more accessible to prospective  inventors.   Now is the time to build on that success. The Unleashing American  Innovators Act will further boost access to the patent system for  underrepresented groups by explicitly directing existing PTO satellite  offices to reach out to those who are underrepresented in in patent  filings. A recent PTO study found that only twenty-two percent of U.S.  patents list a woman as an inventor, even though women make up more  than fifty percent of our population. Other studies have found that  African Americans apply for patents at about half the rate of white  Americans. We need to boost participation from inventors in rural areas  like Vermont as well. Congress must do more to ensure that these and  other underrepresented groups have the opportunity to participate in  the system.   This bill will go further than our efforts ten years ago by requiring  the PTO to study whether additional satellite offices are needed to  increase participation in the system by women, people of color,  military veterans, individual inventors, and any other groups that are  currently underrepresented. It will also create a network of smaller  community outreach offices, which will do the hard work of meeting  prospective innovators where they live. These offices will partner with  local community organizations to create community-based programs to  educate Americans about the patent system and the benefits of  innovation and entrepreneurship. One such office will be located in  northern New England so that it can help provide assistance to  inventors in Vermont.   The Unleashing American Innovators Act will also establish a  patentability assessment pilot program to assist first-time prospective  inventors in determining whether an idea they have is likely to meet  the threshold for patentability. It will give the PTO study the  efficacy of the Patent Pro Bono Program to ensure that it is meeting  the needs of underrepresented groups. Finally, it will further reduce  application fees for small businesses and micro entities to reduce the  costs of obtaining a patent.   By building on the structures we put in place in the Leahy-Smith Act  ten years ago, we can ensure that the next generation of innovators in  America reflect the full potential of our greatest natural resource-- the genius of the American people. I am proud to partner with Senator  Tillis on this important piece of legislation. Expanding access to the  patent system is not a partisan issue; it is an issue of maintaining  American competitiveness and extending opportunity to all Americans, no  matter their background, economic status, or location. I urge the  Senate to act swiftly to pass this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Tillis):   S. 2774. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to address  patent ownership, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. President. One of the fundamental underpinning of the  patent system is transparency. In exchange for obtaining limited  exclusive rights over their inventions, inventors disclose those  inventions to the public, making transparent something that might  otherwise remain secret. This transparency has tremendous benefits for  our society by accelerating innovation, and the patent system as a  whole helps to drive our economy. I have fought for many years to bring  even more transparency into the patent system to further benefit the  public, particularly by pushing for public disclosure of who actually  owns a patent.   I am proud today to continue my partnership with Senator Tillis on  intellectual property issues by introducing the bipartisan Pride in  Patent Ownership Act, which requires patent owners to disclose their  true identity when a patent is issued and when it is sold. I have long  supported efforts in the Senate to achieve this goal and am excited to  spearhead this effort now.   The American people--any of whom may be charged with infringing a  given patent--have a right to know who owns a patent, which often  changes hands after being issued to the initial inventor. Currently, to  know who owns a patent, you have to engage in costly, time-consuming  litigation to uncover that information. That simply shouldn't be the  case. This bill helps to ensure a fair innovation system for small  businesses, non-profits, and independent entrepreneurs who lack the  resources to engage in costly litigation just to discover who possesses  exclusive patent rights over a particular invention.   Transparency in patent ownership will also help us better understand  how we are doing in the global competition for innovation. Currently, a  whopping 52% of U.S. patents are issued to foreign applicants. But  there is no systematic way to track ownership of U.S patents, including  when patents are sold to foreign entities. And Chinese companies like  Huawei--which often serve as proxies for the Chinese Communist Party-- are wielding patent portfolios of unknown size and scope in the United  States.   Although we do not know what specific patents Huawei owns, in the  last two years, it claims to have received an estimated $1.2 to $1.3  billion in patent licensing fees, and it is likely that most of those  licensing fees come from Americans, based on U.S. patents. Furthermore,  Huawei's patents cover fundamental technologies that will power our  global future, such as the 50 mobile network. Its dominance over these  cutting-edge technologies unquestionably advantages China and  disadvantages America. It is imperative, both for our innovation  economy and national security, to know who owns what patents and who is  profiting.   Senator Tillis and I feel strongly about transparency in patent  ownership. We initially proposed this bill as an amendment to the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act earlier this Congress, and it was  cleared by the Chair and Ranking Member of the full Judiciary Committee  for inclusion in that bill's manager's package that ultimately failed.  We have since received feedback from a wide spectrum of stakeholders,  whose input we have worked hard to incorporate. As Chairman of the  Senate's Intellectual Property Subcommittee, I will continue to utilize  all of our Subcommittee's tools along with Ranking Member Tillis to  improve transparency around patent ownership. This bill is an essential  next step in that process, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to pass  it.  [[Page S6590]]                                ____________________
