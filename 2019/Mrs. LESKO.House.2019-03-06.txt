 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Cole, the  ranking member of the Rules Committee, for yielding me time to speak on  this most important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I tell those of you who are here today and throughout  America, this is a terrible bill. I have to tell you, the more that I  read about it, the more that I study about it, the worse I think that  it is.   First of all, it is a total overreach of the Federal Government into  States' rights. In this bill, the majority didn't even consult with the  secretaries of States and the election officials throughout the entire  country to see if they even liked it. And so you are mandating to the  States how they should run their elections.   Not only that, it is mandating to the States how they should run  redistricting. Now, in the State of Arizona, the voters of Arizona set  up a redistricting commission and determined how it should be run. But  in this bill it says, no, no, it shouldn't be up to the State. It  shouldn't be up to the voters. We know better here in Washington, D.C.  how to do your business.    Mr. Speaker, the worst part is that it subsidizes  politicians with public money, a 6-to-1 matching ratio giving millions,  billions more dollars to candidates. My constituents don't want to see  any more of those TV commercials at all; no more signs; no more  robocalls. This bill would add more money to those nasty things.
