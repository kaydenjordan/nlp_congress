 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, President Biden delivered his  [[Page S924]]  State of the Union Address. While the President tried to put a positive  spin on things, the truth of the matter is the United States is not  thriving under Democratic control.   On the economic front, of course, Americans are struggling under the  burden of the worst inflation in 40 years. There are Americans raising  families today who had not yet been born the last time inflation was  this bad.   Under Democratic control, Americans have seen their standard of  living decline as they face massive increases in the price of basic  necessities from groceries to gas. Inflation is so bad that despite  wage increases in 2021, Americans saw a de facto pay cut. After months  of ignoring soaring inflation numbers, the President and congressional  Democrats have at last been forced to start talking about inflation.    Unfortunately, it has become clear they still don't understand why  this inflation disaster happened and how their massive government  spending spree--the so-called American Rescue Plan Act--helped create  this crisis. ``The American Rescue Plan helped working people--and left  no one behind,'' the President said in his speech last night. ``It  worked.'' ``It worked,'' he said. If President Biden believes that, I  have some oceanfront property in South Dakota to sell him.   The truth of the matter is that working Americans are struggling  right now in large part due to the American Rescue Plan. The American  Rescue Plan Act was not a targeted COVID relief bill. It was a massive,  unnecessary spending spree that sent too much government money into the  economy, and, predictably, the economy overheated as a result.   I am glad that Democrats are starting to acknowledge our inflation  crisis, but it would be nice to see them recognize how it actually came  about and commit to not repeating their mistakes in the future.   Inflation is not the only domestic crisis that we have been facing on  Democrats' watch. Our Nation is also experiencing a border crisis that  has resulted in a security, enforcement, and humanitarian nightmare.  Almost from the day the President took office, we have seen a massive  surge in attempted illegal immigration across our southern border, and  there is no end in sight.   In January, the Border Patrol encountered more than 150,000  individuals illegally trying to cross our southern border, the highest  January number in more than 20 years. These numbers, of course, only  reflect individuals the Border Patrol has been able to apprehend. A  Department of Homeland Security official recently stated that more than  200,000 individuals have successfully evaded apprehension since October  and have disappeared--disappeared--into our country, more than 200,000  individuals. It is not surprising. The Border Patrol is stretched thin  and lacks sufficient resources to deal with this never-ending border  surge. But it is deeply concerning. There are 200,000 people entering  our country without any security check or vetting, raising the risk of  drug traffickers, criminals, or even terrorists finding their way into  our communities.   But perhaps the most concerning thing is that a full year after this  massive surge began, the President generally continues to act as if  this border crisis doesn't exist. He is apparently unaware of or can't  be bothered to deal with the real security risk that this represents  for our country.   The President did allude to securing the border last night--something  he does periodically--but given his track record, I am not holding my  breath. In fact, he hasn't even visited it nor has the Vice President,  for that matter.   When it comes to the world stage, things are a little better. The  President's first year in office was distinguished by his disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan, which weakened our national security,  diminished our standing with our allies, and resulted in our abandoning  thousands of Afghans who had worked with us and whom we had promised to  protect.   Currently, we are facing another international crisis--Russia's  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. While this is a crisis of Vladimir  Putin's making, President Biden was slow to move weapons and resisted  imposing sanctions before Russia attacked. I hope that in the days to  come, the President will stand strong against Russian aggression and  not hesitate to impose any additional sanctions that may be necessary  to isolate Putin and his cronies and to halt the Russian advance.   As I said, the United States is not thriving under Democratic  control. A big reason for that is because the President and  congressional Democrats have had one thing on their minds since taking  office and that is implementing a wide-ranging, far-left socialist  agenda.   Democrats' lack of leadership on the big issues facing our country  and our world has been striking. I think the truth is that Democrats  have seen those big issues as distractions from their real goal in  taking office, and that is implementing that far-left agenda. While  inflation spiked and then spiked again, Democrats were AWOL. They were  focused on passing a massive tax-and-spending spree that would  unquestionably make our inflation problem even worse.   And when that failed, they turned their focus to a Federal takeover  of election law that they hoped would give them an advantage in the  November elections.   This week, as Vladimir Putin continued to pursue his apparent dream  of reconstituting the Soviet Union by pushing further into Ukraine,  Democrats took a vote on, of all things, legislation to remove  virtually all State-level restrictions on abortion.   Yes, that was the big vote this week--legislation to remove nearly  every State-level restriction on abortion, despite the fact, I might  add, that the majority of the American people support restrictions on  abortion. But that doesn't matter to Democrats. If the Planned  Parenthood wing of the party wants a vote on unrestricted abortion on  demand, that is what it gets.   In yet another example of just how far the Democratic Party has run  to the left and just how disconnected Democrats have become, last week,  John Kerry, who serves as President Biden's climate chief, expressed  his hope that war with Ukraine would be averted because of the carbon  emissions such a war would create and how the war might distract from  climate change.   You can't make it up. At the time of his remarks, Russia was on the  verge of invading a sovereign nation--and possibly condemning an entire  country to Soviet oppression--and a key member of the President's  administration was worried about how the war might distract from  climate change.   I am a longtime supporter of clean energy, but we have a big problem  when members of our country's leadership are looking at the imperialist  takeover of a sovereign nation, and their biggest concern is not human  life and human freedom but carbon emissions.   But it is another sign of just how ideological the Democratic Party  has become. Nothing--nothing--is allowed to come between the Democratic  Party and its far-left agenda.   President Biden made some nods toward bipartisanship last night, but  it remains to be seen whether Democrats and the President are capable  of setting aside their far-left agenda to address the priorities facing  this country. And given some of the measures the President proposed  last night, I have my doubts.   But I hope--I hope for the sake of our Nation--the Democrats will  rethink their evermore rigid allegiance to the far left and instead  work with Republicans in a bipartisan fashion.   The American people deserve better than what Democrats have given  them over this past year.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe).
