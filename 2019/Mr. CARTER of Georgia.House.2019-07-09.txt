 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major  General Lee Quintas for his service to our Nation with the 3rd Infantry  Division at Fort Stewart.   On June 17, Major General Quintas departed to be the Deputy  Commanding General for the U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg.  However, he is leaving both Fort Stewart and the First Congressional  District of Georgia in a better place.   Major General Quintas' colleagues admire him as an extraordinary  leader with extensive experience who ensures soldiers and units are  ready for any mission.   During his 30 years of service with the United States military, he  has done everything, from deploying in Iraq to leading the 3rd ID in  hurricane response missions in Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Major General Quintas for his service to our  Nation and the First Congressional District of Georgia. He has been a  great leader for the 3rd Infantry Division.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Major General Quintas the best of luck in his new  position at Fort Bragg.                            ____________________
