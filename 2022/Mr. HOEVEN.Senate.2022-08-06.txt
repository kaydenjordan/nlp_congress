 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the names be  waived.    Mr. President, the American people are hurting. Inflation  has soared to the highest we have seen in 40 years, and the Consumer  Price Index is now 9.1 percent. Americans are seeing increased prices  on everything from the grocery store to the gas pump. Gas prices have  gone up $2.25 a gallon just since the President took office. Diesel  prices since this administration took office are up $2.81--that means  60 percent more since President Biden took office. The cost of food is  up more than 12 percent.   We not only have inflation, we have our economy stagnating as well-- stagflation. It is something we haven't had since the late 1970s, early  1980s. We have the resources and the capabilities to reduce that  inflation to address the stagnation. This tax-and-spend bill is not the  way to do it.   I ask that we return this to committee and come up with a plan that  will actually get our economy going and reduce inflation. I ask for  support on this motion.    Mr. President, the bill increases taxes and increases  spending. It will not bring down costs, and it will not bring down  inflation.                           Vote on Motion to Commit    I ask for the yeas and nays.
