 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1192) to impose requirements on the  payment of compensation to professional persons employed in voluntary  cases commenced under title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight Management  and Economic Stability Act (commonly known as ``PROMESA'').   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Puerto Rico Recovery       Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021'' or ``PRRADA''.       SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE BY PROFESSIONAL PERSONS SEEKING APPROVAL                     OF COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 316 OR 317 OF                     PROMESA.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) List of material interested parties.--The term ``List       of Material Interested Parties'' means the List of Material       Interested Parties established under subsection (c)(1).        (2) Oversight board.--The term ``Oversight Board'' has the       meaning given the term in section 5 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C.       2104).        (b) Required Disclosure.--        (1) In general.--In a case commenced under section 304 of       PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), no attorney, accountant, appraiser,       auctioneer, agent, or other professional person may be       compensated under section 316 or 317 of that Act (48 U.S.C.       2176, 2177) unless prior to making a request for       compensation, the professional person has filed with the       court a verified statement conforming to the disclosure       requirements of rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules of       Bankruptcy Procedure setting forth the connection of the       professional person with any entity or person on the List of       Material Interested Parties.        (2) Supplement.--A professional person that submits a       statement under paragraph (1) shall promptly supplement the       statement with any additional relevant information that       becomes known to the person.  [[Page H231]]         (3) Disclosure.--Subject to any other applicable law, rule,       or regulation, a professional person that fails to file or       update a statement required under paragraph (1) or files a       statement that the court determines does not represent a good       faith effort to comply with this section shall disclose such       failure in any filing required to conform to the disclosure       requirements under rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules of       Bankruptcy Procedure.        (c) List of Material Interested Parties.--        (1) Preparation.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Oversight Board shall establish a       List of Material Interested Parties subject to--        (A) the approval of the court; and        (B) the right of the United States trustee or any party in       interest to be heard on the approval.        (2) Inclusions.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), the       List of Material Interested Parties shall include--        (A) the debtor;        (B) any creditor;        (C) any other party in interest;        (D) any attorney or accountant of--        (i) the debtor;        (ii) any creditor; or        (iii) any other party in interest;        (E) the United States trustee and any person employed in       the office of the United States trustee; and        (F) the Oversight Board, including the members, the       Executive Director, and the employees of the Oversight Board.        (3) Exclusions.--The List of Material Interested Parties       may not include any person with a claim, the amount of which       is below a threshold dollar amount established by the court       that is consistent with the purpose of this Act.        (d) Review.--        (1) In general.--The United States trustee shall review       each verified statement submitted pursuant to subsection (b)       and may file with the court comments on such verified       statements before the professionals filing such statements       seek compensation under section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2176, 2177).        (2) Objection.--The United States trustee may object to       applications filed under section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2176, 2177) that fail to satisfy the requirements of       subsection (b).        (e) Limitation on Compensation.--In a case commenced under       section 304 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), in connection with       the review and approval of professional compensation under       section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177) filed       after the date of enactment of this Act, the court may deny       allowance of compensation or reimbursement of expenses if--        (1) the professional person has failed to file the verified       disclosure statements required under subsection (b)(1) or has       filed inadequate disclosure statements under that subsection;       or        (2) during the professional person's employment in       connection with the case, the professional person--        (A) is not a disinterested person (as defined in section       101 of title 11, United States Code) relative to any entity       or person on the List of Material Interested Parties; or        (B) represents or holds an adverse interest in connection       with the case.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of  2021, or PRRADA, is commonsense legislation that would promote greater  transparency and integrity with respect to the ongoing financial  reorganization of Puerto Rico. This will be the third time in just over  2 years that the House will vote on this legislation, but, Mr. Speaker,  I think the third time will be the charm.   In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time,  Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic  Stability Act, or PROMESA, in 2016.   That legislation established the Financial Oversight and Management  Board with control over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans,  and regulations, and the authority to retain professionals to assist  the Board in executing its responsibilities.   Although largely patterned on Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  PROMESA did not incorporate all facets of Chapter 11 and other relevant  provisions of the code.   Importantly, this includes the code's mandatory disclosure  requirements regarding actual or potential conflicts of interest that  professional persons seeking to be retained in a bankruptcy case must  make to the court prior to their retention.   This bill would close that loophole by conditioning the compensation  of professional persons retained under PROMESA under certain  disclosures similar to those required under the Bankruptcy Code.   Additionally, the bill would require the United States Trustee to  review these disclosures and to submit comments in response to the  court, and it also authorizes the United States Trustee to object to  compensation requested by professionals.   And finally, H.R. 1192 would allow courts to deny compensation for  services and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person did  not comply with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested  person, or represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy  estate. Common sense.   The House passed H.R. 1192 last February, and the Senate passed an  amended version of the Act last December. The Senate amendments  streamlined PRRADA's reporting requirements, strengthened the  incentives for good faith compliance, and clarify other provisions of  the Act.   Now, Puerto Rico's restructuring is drawing to a close, which makes  passage of this legislation especially urgent.   I thank Representative Velazquez for her leadership in championing  this bill and for her relentless dedication to ensuring that the people  of Puerto Rico receive the fair, efficient, and transparent  restructuring process they deserve.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which was passed out of  the House last year and the year before by unanimous votes, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 1192 closes a loophole under  current law by establishing disclosure requirements regarding actual or  potential conflicts of interest in the bankruptcy process under  PROMESA. In doing so, this legislation promotes transparency and  accountability in the Puerto Rico restructuring process.   I thank my colleague, Representative Velazquez from New York, the  author of the bill, for her leadership on this issue, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 1404) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23d Headquarters  Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, popularly known as  the ``Ghost Army'', in recognition of their unique and highly  distinguished service in conducting deception operations in Europe  during World War II.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1404         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ghost Army Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops (comprised of the       23d Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Special Troops,       the 603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th Combat       Engineer Company, the 3132d Signal Service Company, and the       Signal Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special Troops)       and the 3133d Signal Service Company were units of the United       States Army that served in Europe during World War II;        (2) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops was actively       engaged in battlefield operations from June of 1944 through       March of 1945;        (3) the 3133d Signal Service Company was engaged in       operations in Italy in 1945;        (4) the deceptive activities of these units were integral       to several Allied victories across Europe and reduced       casualties;        (5) in evaluating the performance of these units after       World War II, an Army analysis found that ``Rarely, if ever,       has there been a group of such a few men which had so great       an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.'';        (6) many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen-soldiers       recruited from art schools, advertising agencies,       communications companies, and other creative and technical       professions;        (7) the first 4 members of the 23d Headquarters Special       Troops landed on D-Day and 2 became casualties while creating       false beach landing sites;        (8) a detachment of Army radio operators under the command       of Lieutenant Fred Fox joined the invasion fleet for a       planned deception, Operation Troutfly, which was cancelled;        (9) Lieutenant Fox's men and their radios were instead       attached to the 82d Airborne, which had lost 95 percent of       its radio equipment, providing critical communications as the       82d Airborne fought its way inland;        (10) the secret deception operations of the 23d       Headquarters Special Troops commenced in France on June 14,       1944, when Task Force Mason, a 16-man detachment of the 23d       led by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, arrived in Normandy;        (11) Lieutenant Mason and his men set up dummy artillery to       draw enemy fire and protect the 980th Field Artillery       Battalion (VIII Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign;        (12) the rest of the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters       Special Troops arrived in France in July and August of 1944;        (13) full-scale deception efforts began with Operation       Elephant from July 1 to 4, 1944, in which the 23d       Headquarters Special Troops covered the movement of the 2d       Armored Division when it left a reserve position to go into       the line between the First United States and Second British       Armies;  [[Page H233]]         (14) Operation Elephant was the first of the 21 full-scale       tactical deceptions completed by the 23d Headquarters Special       Troops;        (15) often operating on or near the front lines, the 23d       Headquarters Special Troops used inflatable tanks, artillery,       airplanes and other vehicles, advanced engineered       soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio trickery to create       the illusion of sizable American forces where there were none       and to draw the enemy away from Allied troops;        (16) the 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service Companies,       activated in Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York, at the Army       Experimental Station in March and June of 1944, respectively,       were the only ``sonic deception'' ground combat units of the       United States in World War II;        (17) soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops       impersonated other, larger Army units by sewing counterfeit       patches onto their uniforms, painting false markings on their       vehicles, and creating phony headquarters staffed by fake       generals, all in an effort to feed false information to Axis       spies;        (18) during the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d Headquarters       Special Troops created counterfeit radio traffic in an effort       to deceive the enemy of the movement of elements of General       George S. Patton's Third Army as it shifted to break through       to the 101st Airborne Division and elements of 10th Armored       Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne;        (19) in its final mission, Operation Viersen, in March       1945, the 23d Headquarters Special Troops conducted a       tactical deception operation intended to draw German units       down the Rhine River and away from the Ninth Army, allowing       the Ninth Army to cross the Rhine into Germany;        (20) during Operation Viersen, the 23d Headquarters Special       Troops, with the assistance of other units, impersonated 2       complete divisions of American forces by using fabricated       radio networks, soundtracks of construction work and       artillery fire, and hundreds of inflatable and real vehicles;        (21) according to a military intelligence officer of the       79th Infantry, ``There is no doubt that Operation Viersen       materially assisted in deceiving the enemy with regard to the       real dispositions and intentions of this Army.'';        (22) 3 soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops gave       their lives and dozens were injured in carrying out their       mission;        (23) in April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service Company       conducted Operation Craftsman in support of Operation Second       Wind, the successful Allied effort to break through the       German defensive position to the north of Florence, Italy,       known as the Gothic Line;        (24) along with an attached platoon of British engineers,       who were inflatable decoy specialists, the 3133d Signal       Service Company used sonic deception to misrepresent troop       locations along this defensive line;        (25) the activities of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops       and the 3133d Signal Service Company remained highly       classified for more than 40 years after the war and received       minimal recognition;        (26) the extraordinary accomplishments of this unit are       deserving of belated official recognition; and        (27) the United States is eternally grateful to the       soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d       Signal Service Company for their proficient use of innovative       tactics during World War II, which saved lives and made       significant contributions to the defeat of the Axis powers.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The President Pro Tempore of the       Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall       make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of       Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the 23d       Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Services       Company, known collectively as the ``Ghost Army'', in       recognition of unique and highly distinguished service during       World War II.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike       the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and       inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Smithsonian Institution.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal       under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it shall be available for       display as appropriate and made available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       received under paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere,       particularly at other locations associated with the 23d       Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Services       Company.        (d) Duplicate Medals.--The Secretary may strike and sell       duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under this Act,       at a price sufficient to cover the cost of the medals,       including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and       overhead expenses.       SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDAL.         (a) National Medal.--The medals struck under this Act are       national medals for the purposes of chapter 51 of title 31,       Unites States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purpose of section 5134 of title       31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act       shall be considered to be numismatic items.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purposes of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 1404, the Ghost  Army Congressional Gold Medal Act. I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts, Senator Markey, and the gentlewoman from New Hampshire,  Congresswoman Kuster, for their work on this bill which honors the  resourcefulness, imagination, and artistry of the men of the 23rd  Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133rd Signal Company in conducting  deception operations in Europe during World War II.   This 1,100-man unit, known collectively as the Ghost Army, was made  up of individuals recruited from creative fields, including art  schools, theater and communications companies, and advertising  agencies. Their mission was to draw upon their creative and artistic  talents to lure the German Army away from the Allied combat units  through a series of tactical deception operations meant to confuse,  deceive, and mislead.   Following the D-Day landing in France, the Ghost Army undertook a  traveling road show utilizing fake radio transmissions, inflatable  tanks, and theatrical sound and atmospheric effects to misdirect German  units away from actual Allied unit locations and toward larger  imaginary ones.   The artists, architects, and engineers of the Ghost Army were so  effective that a later Army analysis of their performance found that  ``rarely, if ever, has there been a group of such few men which had so  great an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''   Yet, despite the overwhelming success of the citizen soldiers of the  Ghost Army, their contributions remained classified for over 40 years,  and their bravery and ingenuity was never formally recognized.   This bill honors their unique contributions to the war effort by  directing the Mint to strike a gold medal in honor of the Ghost Army.  The gold medal shall be given to the Smithsonian Institution, where it  will be available for display and serve as recognition of the  incredible service of the men of the Ghost Army during World War II.   I thank Mr. Markey and Ms. Kuster for their work on this bill, and I  urge Members to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   On a personal note, I would like to recognize First Lieutenant  Bernard Mason, mentioned in the text of this bill, for his leadership  in leading the 16-man detachment of the 23rd Headquarters Special  Troops during the invasion of Normandy. Lieutenant Mason was a  constituent of mine before his passing, and his wife and children still  live in my district. I want to thank them for Lieutenant Mason's life  and service. Today we are finally honoring his service and those of his  brothers-in-arms in perpetuity.   The stories of the creativity and innovation displayed by the members  of the Ghost Army during World War II read like something straight out  of a Hollywood blockbuster script. The only thing missing is a  Hollywood ending where the brave members of the Ghost Army are finally  recognized for their lifesaving contributions to defeating the Axis  Powers during World War II. This bill ensures official recognition for  this heroic group of citizen soldiers and their unique contributions to  the war effort.   I thank Mr. Markey and Ms. Kuster, the lead sponsor of the House  version of this bill, for ensuring that the stories of these men of the  Ghost Army receive the recognition they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 452) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Willie O'Ree, in  recognition of his extraordinary contributions and commitment to  hockey, inclusion, and recreational opportunity.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 452         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Willie O'Ree Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Willie O'Ree was the first Black player to compete in       the National Hockey League (NHL), appearing for the Boston       Bruins on January 18, 1958, in the throes of the civil rights       movement in the United States helping to end racial       segregation in the premier professional ice hockey league; he       is widely referred to as the ``Jackie Robinson of Hockey''.        (2) Willie O'Ree was born October 15, 1935, in Fredericton,       New Brunswick, Canada; he is the youngest of 13 children and       a descendant of Paris O'Ree, whose name appears in the famous       historical document ``The Book of Negroes''.        (3) Willie O'Ree was raised by his parents in Fredericton,       a predominantly White town where hockey was deeply rooted       within the culture. O'Ree was a standout athlete on the ice       and the baseball diamond.        (4) At age 21, O'Ree was being scouted by professional       baseball teams and seriously considered baseball as a career.       Upon experiencing the segregated South for the first time       while appearing for a minor league tryout, his dream changed       and his attention turned solely to ice hockey.        (5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie was struck in his       right eye with a puck and lost his eyesight. He was told by       doctors to abandon his hockey career; instead, never       disclosing the extent of his injury, he pursued his dream of       playing professional hockey.        (6) At the age of 22, O'Ree was called up from the Quebec       Aces of the Quebec Hockey League (QHL) to play for the NHL's       Boston Bruins at a time when only 6 teams existed in the       league. O'Ree was unaware he had broken the color barrier at       the top level of the sport until he read it in the newspaper       the following day.        (7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at times       throughout his career, O'Ree persevered and played       professional hockey for 22 years, tallying over 1,000 points.        (8) In 1996, 17 years after O'Ree retired from professional       hockey, the National Hockey League hired O'Ree as the first-      ever Diversity Ambassador. Having already changed the game       forever through his courage and convictions, O'Ree gives new       definition to what it means to be a trailblazer.        (9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador with the NHL,       O'Ree set out to grow the sport by providing access,       opportunity, and motivation for children of all races,       ethnicities, origins, and abilities. With O'Ree providing a       vivid example of what is possible and serving as a relentless       supporter of children pursuing their dreams, more than 30       nonprofit youth organizations, dubbed Hockey is for Everyone       programs, were developed across North America, each committed       to offering minority and underserved children an opportunity       to play hockey, leveraging the sport to build character,       foster positive values, and develop important life skills.        (10) Through Hockey is for Everyone programs, more than       120,000 boys and girls have been positively impacted. O'Ree       has devoted nearly 2,500 days on the ground with the youth       participants, visiting more than 500 schools, community       centers, and rinks to speak to hockey's core values and       beliefs: stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain       committed and disciplined; and always respect your teammates,       coaches, and parents.        (11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have provided       important opportunities for youth to partake in physical       fitness. Today in the United States, fewer than half of the       children ages 6-11 engage in the recommended amount of       physical activity, and that number is lower for low-income       families. O'Ree has stood as a champion of youth athletic       participation and its health benefits for decades.        (12) Hockey is for Everyone programs provide numerous off-      ice services to youth: SAT and academic tutoring, mentoring,       nutrition education, college counseling, community service       opportunities, and more. The program has excelled at using       hockey as a vehicle to improve the social and emotional       wellness of youth and improve students' academic performances       both in primary school and beyond.        (13) O'Ree was also named a Member of the Order of Canada       in 2008 and, in 2018, the City of Boston released an official       Proclamation recognizing January 18, the anniversary of the       day he broke into the game, as ``Willie O'Ree Day''.        (14) In November 2018, 60 years after O'Ree entered the       NHL, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the       ``builder'' category in recognition of his efforts to grow       the game, using his position and the platform of hockey to       improve the lives of children throughout North America.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 452, the Willie O'Ree  Congressional Gold Medal Act.   I thank Michigan Senator Stabenow and the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Quigley) for their work on this bill which honors Willie O'Ree, a  trailblazer for diversity and inclusion in sports and the first Black  player in the National Hockey League.   Born in 1935 in the predominantly White town of Fredericton, New  Brunswick, Canada, O'Ree made a name for himself as a standout athlete  in both ice hockey and baseball. At age 21, he was being scouted by  professional baseball teams in the United States. However, upon  experiencing racial discrimination and the effects of segregation  firsthand while in the south for minor league tryouts, he shifted his  focus solely to ice hockey.   In 1958, at the age of 22, O'Ree was called up to play professionally  as a winger for the NHL Boston Bruins. In doing so, he became the first  Black professional ice hockey player in the league. Despite being blind  in one eye from an injury during his time as an amateur hockey player  and enduring racist attacks from hockey fans and players alike, O'Ree  persevered and continued to play professional hockey for 22 years.   In 1996, the National Hockey League hired O'Ree as its first-ever  diversity ambassador, which set out to transform the predominantly  White sport of ice hockey by providing greater access and opportunity  for children of all races, ethnicities, and origins.  [[Page H236]]    O'Ree has personally devoted thousands of hours to Hockey is for  Everyone programs which provide community outreach and support for  youth participants to partake in physical fitness and live out hockey's  core values of commitment, discipline, and respect for your teammates,  coaches, and parents.   In 2018, 60 years after O'Ree first broke the color barrier for ice  hockey, he was inducted into the NHL Hockey Hall of Fame in recognition  of his longstanding support for greater access and diversity in the  sport.   This bill honors O'Ree's trailblazing legacy both on and off the ice.  I thank Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Quigley for their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge members to vote ``yes'' and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Massachusetts an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Willie O'Ree is often referred to as the ``Jackie Robinson of ice  hockey'' for helping to end racial segregation in the National Hockey  League. Mr. O'Ree's positive impact on the sport of ice hockey goes far  beyond his role in ending racial segregation in the sport.   This bill honors O'Ree for both his barrier-breaking role and his  decades of championing diversity and greater youth access to the sport.  I thank Ms. Stabenow and Mr. Quigley, the lead sponsor of the House  version of the bill, and our other colleagues who worked so hard on  this bill for ensuring that Mr. O'Ree and his trailblazing legacy of  sportsmanship and inclusion receive the recognition he so richly  deserves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H238]]
