 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my beloved colleague and my  friend for yielding. I would like to thank our colleague, Mr. Austin  Scott, for organizing this Special Order tribute to a great man, to a  wonderful human being.   Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Senator Johnny Isakson, a son of  Atlanta, Georgia. Senator Isakson is a special man. He is a good man. I  want to thank him for his years of service in the Georgia State  Legislature, in the United States House of Representatives, and, now,  in the United States Senate.   On February 25, 1999, I introduced Johnny as the newest member of the  Georgia congressional delegation to the House of Representatives. He  came to Congress as a graduate of the University of Georgia and a  successful businessman.   Before coming to Congress, he served as a member of the Georgia Air  National Guard, the State house minority leader, a State senator, and  the chair of the State board of education.   On that day, I said he brought a wealth of knowledge with him. I  explained to our colleagues that, in his decades of public service in  our home State, Johnny developed a great reputation as a bridge  builder, a man who has strong beliefs but was also willing to work with  others to get things done.   Very quickly, Members of the House and Senate discovered how true  this was. The Senator does not make a lot of noise, but he has the  ability and the capacity to speak truth to power.   When Johnny served in the House of Representatives, we always found a  way to come together, and we continued that tradition when he was  elected to the Senate. Over the years, we worked together on many, many  issues, like transportation, water, housing, and veterans affairs. We  always found a way to get along and to do the good work the people  deserved.   Time and time again, he stood with us, he worked with us to uplift  African Americans in the State of Georgia, to recognize individuals  like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jackie Robinson, native of  Georgia. He did not just talk the talk, he literally walked the walk.   Senator, you not only supported the reauthorization of the Voting  Rights Act in 2006, but, a few years later, you even co-led the  congressional pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama. I want to say thank you for  all of your good and great work.   Those of us who know you will agree that you are always thoughtful  and mindful, a warm and welcoming gentleman in the truest sense of the  word.   For two decades, you, Senator, led a team that could cross the aisle  without compromising their values. Whenever a constituent came over  from a meeting with you and your staff, they felt heard and respected.                                time  1545    I hope you do not mind, but I would like to share a moment that  stands out for me and will always stand out for me as long as I live,  to this very day.   One morning, before I was scheduled to read the 13th Amendment on the  House floor, Senator Isakson asked me to come and speak with his staff  about service and my own experiences. We had an honest and thoughtful  discussion. It was one of the most meaningful, memorable experiences of  my years in Congress. I carry it in my heart to this very day, to this  very moment, what Senator Isakson said. I believe 20 years have passed  since I stood on this very floor to introduce Senator Isakson to  Congress.   As Johnny returns to private life with his beloved wife, Dianne, of  51 years and his wonderful, beautiful children and grandchildren, I  would like to thank Johnny for his years of service. I would like to  thank Johnny for his service to our State, our Nation. I wish Johnny  health and happiness.   I hope the Senator takes some time to enjoy a beautiful and wonderful  life in the State of Georgia. Senator Isakson has been very good to the  people of the State of Georgia, and I am lucky enough, and just blessed  really, to call him a friend and a brother. I thank him so much.   Madam Speaker, it is almost difficult to yield back the time when I  speak of this good and great leader from the State of Georgia. I thank  Johnny for his service. I will come over and meet you, brother.
