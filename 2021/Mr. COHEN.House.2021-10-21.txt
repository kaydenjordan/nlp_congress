 Mr. Speaker, Ford Motor Company recently announced it is  going to place a facility to construct electric trucks at the Memphis  megasite in west Tennessee. This site is 50 miles from Memphis and has  been developed for the purpose of industrial opportunities for people  in west Tennessee who need it well, and it affects Memphis.   We are happy and proud that Ford picked this site for these jobs and  for this important environmental effort to have electric batteries for  vehicles and electric trucks. We think Ford will be a great  representative in Memphis. They have been a good representative in  Louisville.  [[Page H5737]]    As the Speaker well knows, Louisville shouldn't get everything.  Memphis deserves something, too. I appreciate Ford coming to Memphis.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, they won't question Trump's statement that  the insurrection was November 3 because that is the day each and every  one of them and each and every one of us was elected. It was a free and  fair election when it came to electing Congresspeople, but for  President, they think it was an insurrection. Horse manure.   Bannon, who was thumbing his nose at the Constitution and this  Congress by not responding to his subpoena, said that it would be  different than on election day, on January 6. It wouldn't go as  expected, because he was part of plotting what was an overthrow of our  government.   He was pardoned by President Trump for ripping off Trump supporters.  He got them to give money to an effort to build the wall, and he took  over $1 million for his own personal expenses. Fraud. But Trump didn't  care that he ripped off Trump people for a Trump wall. He pardoned him.  The whole thing is a con game, and we need to end it before democracy  goes out the window.   I urge you to support the rule and the underlying resolution. Protect  America and protect democracy.
