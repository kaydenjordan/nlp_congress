 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support  for H.R. 5003, the Fair Debt Collection Practices for Servicemembers  Act, sponsored by Representative Dean, which passed the House  unanimously. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill and was glad to vote  for it.   As a former Army infantry officer, I have seen debt collectors harass  servicemembers. This is made worse by collectors who contact  servicemembers' superiors.   The U.S. military does not owe these debts; they are the debt of the  servicemember. So why should debt collectors be in contact with someone  who does not owe the debt?   From a readiness perspective, our commanding officers and  noncommissioned officers should be focused on training our soldiers to  fight and win our Nation's wars, not on keeping track of who owes what  money to what debt collector.   Just as debt collectors cannot humiliate civilians by calling their  bosses, neither should they be allowed to use such practices on our  fighting men and women. I am glad to see that we can all agree that  collection companies should abide by the same rules and restrictions  for enlisted servicemembers as they do when collecting debts from  private citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage the Senate to take up this bill immediately.                            ____________________
