 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of  H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   Our country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic requiring  unprecedented actions, like the HEROES Act the House sent to the Senate  more than 6 weeks ago. Beating back this virus will test us in  unimaginable ways, and we cannot afford to allow petty politics to push  us backward.   Sadly, inconceivably, that is exactly what the Trump administration  asked from the Supreme Court last week when they argued to fully  overturn the Affordable Care Act.   With more than 2.5 million infections, and more than 125,000 lives  tragically lost, we need to expand access to affordable healthcare;  lower the cost of prescription drugs; and improve outcomes for those  hardest hit, especially in communities of color and rural communities.   Madam Speaker, the end of the Affordable Care Act and other actions  previously announced by this administration, with no plan of their own,  will instead leave millions of Americans at risk of losing their  insurance. It will result in higher premiums for millions of  individuals and small businesses.   Remember this: The 130,000 of us with preexisting conditions,  including those who have been infected with COVID-19, will pay the  heaviest price.   Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is essential to ensuring  Americans have access to affordable and quality healthcare. It is still  under attack by our President and his allies.   Today, I and my colleagues demonstrate our commitment to protecting  it. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act will  strengthen the ACA by strengthening protections for those with  preexisting conditions. It will ensure that no one pays more than 8.5  percent of their income for quality coverage. It will allow  negotiations for lower drug costs. It will help address the  inequalities in healthcare faced by so many in our country, especially  communities of color.   Madam Speaker, this is the kind of bill that should receive  bipartisan support in the middle of a historic pandemic, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for it.                                time  1200
