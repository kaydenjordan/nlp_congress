 Mr. Speaker, the nature of democracy is that in every  election there is a winner and a loser. The success of democracy  depends on the loser believing the vote was fair and accepting the  result. You see, the vote is not the foundation of democracy, the  integrity of the vote is its foundation.   That is just as important for the winner as it is for the loser. The  winners depend on the integrity of the vote for their legitimacy. The  loser depends on it for their acceptance.   That is precisely the issue in the aftermath of this election. The  widespread allegations of illegal votes and illegal processes must be  resolved before the election can confer legitimacy. Among those  questions are the acceptance of ballots received after election day,  votes cast by ineligible voters, backdated ballots, illegally  duplicated ballots, voting systems that misallocated votes, and the  counting of votes outside any meaningful observation.   Now, there is either evidence to support these allegations or there  is not. Fortunately, we are blessed with a well-established system of  administrative and judicial review to answer these questions.   Georgia, for example, is now undertaking an audit and hand count. The  audit should resolve some concerns over illegal votes, and the hand  count should resolve concerns over illegal processes. Meanwhile, judges  across the country are hearing complaints and weighing the evidence to  support similar concerns.   So I rise today to ask that we all calm down, stop the hyperbolic  rhetoric, and allow this process to unfold as it should. Our system is  more than capable of working through these issues and providing answers  that can satisfy both sides.   We also need to ask ourselves why so many Americans currently believe  the election was riddled with fraud. I think it is because so many  safeguards built into our system have been removed.   We call it ``election day'' for a reason. Until recently, we all  waited until the campaigns were over and every candidate had their say.   Then on a single day, election day, we personally went to the polling  place in our community in what George Will calls ``the communion of  democracy.'' We all took the time because we knew it was important. We  brought our children to watch the process, and we taught them to  respect it.   The polling place was often at a neighbor's garage or the local  elementary school. Each of us looked our neighbors on the precinct  board in the eye as we identified ourselves and signed the roll. They  then handed us our ballot. We immediately took that ballot into a  curtained booth where no one could look over our shoulder or plead or  threaten or cajole us to vote a certain way. We cast our vote in  absolute privacy, according to our own conscience, and then handed the  ballot back to our neighbor, who immediately placed it into a locked  box in the presence of observers from all parties.   It was very hard to commit fraud in such a system because every  ballot had a clear and simple chain of custody. At 8 p.m., the total  number of votes was known, and the count began under the watchful eye  of observers, and we usually knew the results of most races by 10  o'clock that night, midnight if it was close.   Now, consider how we have perverted that simple and secure process  that we once prided ourselves upon. Today ballots are mailed out to  voter rolls that contain untold numbers of people who have moved or  died. There is no chain of custody from the time the ballot is mailed  until the time it is returned. In many States, ballot harvesters can  knock on doors and collect these surplus ballots.   Even legitimate votes can be cast weeks before the debate is  concluded and under the duress of family or friends or precinct  workers.   This corrupted process cannot continue. Even if it doesn't rob our  elections of their actual legitimacy, it certainly robs them of their  perceived legitimacy, destroying the trust that the  [[Page H5800]]  loser of any election must have to accept and respect the will of the  electorate.   The old process assured the presumption of fairness. The new process  offers none. Acceptance of an election cannot be obtained by  browbeating. It can only be earned by a full and open review of the  integrity of the election establishing for all Americans that their  vote was fairly and accurately recorded and that the result speaks as  the will of the Nation. And I eagerly await that day.                            ____________________
