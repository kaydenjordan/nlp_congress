 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7120, the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   Just to reflect on the comments from the gentleman, my colleague from  Louisiana, we all believe that cops are good people who became--most  cops are good people who became officers to serve their communities.  The provisions in today's bill will help us support the good cops by  rooting out the bad ones.   But, fundamentally, the culture of policing in this country must  change. There is a tremendous amount of support nationally, and I  believe in this body, for better training, transparency, and  accountability. It is devastating that we are acting too late to save  the lives of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Eric Garner and the  many other victims who haven't even made headlines.   But there is hope that this bill can save lives and protect Black  lives moving forward. We may not finish today, but this is an important  start.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and vote ``yes.''                                time  1800
