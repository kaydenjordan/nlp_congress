 Madam Speaker, payments in lieu of taxes, or PILTs, are  Federal payments to local governments to help offset losses in property  taxes due to the presence of nontaxable Federal lands within their  boundaries.   Through my role on the Energy and Water Development, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I have gotten to know the good  people of Pike County, Ohio, where the Department of Energy owns 3,700  acres of land where a uranium enrichment plant once operated. And  wouldn't you know it, Pike County has one of the highest cancer rates  in the State of Ohio.   Yet, their PILT payment is a paltry $47,000 a year. These are the  people who enriched the uranium during the Cold War; they live in  southern Ohio where corporations have gone in, extracted resources, and  taken the profits out, and now we need to help this community get the  kind of payment that they need. For all the radiation, all the  sacrifice that they have made and endured over the years, it is long  past time that the Federal Government increased the PILT payment for  Pike County, Ohio.                            ____________________
