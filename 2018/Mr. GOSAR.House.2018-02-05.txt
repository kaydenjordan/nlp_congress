 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2371) to require the Administrator of the Western Area Power  Administration to establish a pilot project to provide increased  transparency for customers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2371         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Western Area Power       Administration Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. WESTERN AREA POWER ADMINISTRATION PILOT PROJECT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Western Area       Power Administration (referred to in this section as the       ``Administrator'') shall establish a pilot project, as part       of the continuous process improvement program and to provide       increased transparency for customers, to publish on a       publicly available website of the Western Area Power       Administration, a database of the following information,       beginning with fiscal year 2008, relating to the Western Area       Power Administration:        (1) By power system and in a consistent format, rates       charged to customers for power and transmission service.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, we are considering my bill, H.R. 2371, the Western Area Power  Administration Transparency Act. This bipartisan bill simply requires  the Western Area Power Administration, known as WAPA, to establish a  pilot project to allow for a more detailed understanding of how it uses  both taxpayer and ratepayer dollars.   This bill is the result of calls from some of WAPA's customers given  rate increase trends and other financial discrepancies. H.R. 2371  requires WAPA to develop a publicly available website that contains a  detailed accounting of its rates, expenditures, staffing, and other  operational and financial dealings. Since cost increases are ultimately  borne by its customers, WAPA needs to be more transparent about its  business practices. That is exactly what this bill seeks to achieve.  H.R. 2371 will increase transparency and afford ratepayers with the  necessary information to positively engage with WAPA about its  operation and spending decisions. I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2371 will increase transparency and  afford ratepayers with the necessary information to positively engage  WAPA about its operations and spending decisions. Imagine that: getting  back to what customers want.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2371.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.   The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2888) to establish the Ste.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2888, the Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park  Establishment Act, sponsored by Representative Jason Smith from  Missouri, would establish the Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park  in the city of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. It would also authorize the  Secretary of the Interior to acquire land for the park by donation,  purchase, or exchange.   Founded around 1750 by French Canadian settlers, Ste. Genevieve was  Missouri's first settlement. Settlers from present-day Illinois crossed  the Mississippi River attracted to the rich soil in the area. After  severe floods in 1785, the town was moved 3 miles inland, where it  still exists today, retaining many of its historic buildings,  landscapes, and community characteristics.   Ste. Genevieve is one of the oldest National Historic Landmark  districts in the country, with a portion of the landmark designated in  1960. It is famous for the use of French vertical log architecture.   In 2009, Congress authorized a National Park Service study of the  area, which concluded that the Ste. Genevieve historic district is  nationally significant and suitable for direct National Park Service  management.   There is widespread local support for the establishment of a  historical park, including the city, county commission, and Chamber of  Commerce.   Ste. Genevieve is an important part of our Nation's expansion and  agricultural history and merits becoming a unit of the National Park  System.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), the original sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that Ste. Genevieve is an  important part of our Nation's expansion and agriculture history and  merits becoming a unit of the National Park.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend that all vote for it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bacon). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2888.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 1438) to redesignate the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in  the State of Missouri as the ``Gateway Arch National Park''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1438         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gateway Arch National Park       Designation Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF GATEWAY ARCH NATIONAL PARK.         (a) Redesignation.--The Jefferson National Expansion       Memorial established under the Act of May 17, 1954 (16 U.S.C.       450jj et seq.), shall be known and designated as the       ``Gateway Arch National Park''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Jefferson National Expansion Memorial shall be considered to       be a reference to the ``Gateway Arch National Park''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, towering 630 feet above the banks of the Mississippi  River, Gateway Arch has, for 50 years, commemorated both Thomas  Jefferson's vision of expansion and America's enduring spirit of  discovery.   Clad entirely in stainless steel, the Gateway Arch is the tallest  man-made monument in the country and uniquely features two custom trams  on either side, which shuttle thousands of guests a year to a viewing  deck at the apex.   The Gateway Arch National Park Designation Act would redesignate the  Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri, as the  Gateway Arch National Park. The park would include not only the Gateway  Arch, but a museum and the old St. Louis courthouse, the site of the  Dred Scott trial.   People from across the country have been visiting the monument and  surrounding buildings since 1965, when the memorial was established.   Passing this bill today would make the Gateway Arch National Park  America's 60th National Park and allow the National Park Service to  ensure that the site would be ready for a planned Fourth of July  celebration this very year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that this Gateway National Park  has support from everybody. It is that gateway to the West that we are  so eulogizing. I ask all Members to vote for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, S. 1438.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2504         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXEMPTION OF EXPORTATION OF CERTAIN ECHINODERMS                     FROM PERMISSION AND LICENSING REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Exemption.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Director of the United States       Fish and Wildlife Service shall amend section 14.92 of title       50, Code of Federal Regulations, to clarify that--        (1) fish or wildlife described in subsection (b) are       fishery products exempt from the export permission       requirements of section 9(d)(1) of the Endangered Species Act       of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1538(d)(1)); and        (2) any person may engage in business as an exporter of       such fish or wildlife without procuring permission under such       section of that Act or an export license under subpart I of       part 14 of such title.        (b) Covered Fish or Wildlife.--The fish or wildlife       referred to in subsection (a) are members of the phylum       Echinodermata that are commonly known as sea urchins and sea       cucumbers, including products thereof, that--        (1) do not require a permit under part 16, 17, or 23 of       title 50, Code of Federal Regulations;        (2) are harvested in waters under the jurisdiction of the       United States or are processed in the United States; and        (3) are--        (A) exported for purposes of human or animal consumption;       or        (B) taken in waters under the jurisdiction of the United       States or on the high seas for recreational purposes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2504, introduced by my Maine colleagues, Chellie  Pingree and Bruce Poliquin, is a bipartisan effort to right a  bipartisan wrong. In regulations created by an outgoing George W. Bush  administration and carried on by administrations since, the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service has imposed unnecessary fees and duplicative and  costly inspection requirements on what was once a growing industry that  aims to export niche seafood to overseas markets.   Even the National Marine Fisheries Service, a bastion of Federal  regulatory growth, disagrees with its sister agency on this matter. The  stories of spoiled food shipments, loss of jobs, and bureaucratic  indifference embody the arrogance of an agency gone wild. This bill  preserves and promotes jobs as a counter.   I will include in the Record an exchange of letters with Chairman  Royce of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who also received a referral of  this bill. I thank him for his cooperation in allowing this bill to go  forward today.   Again, I commend our two Maine colleagues for working on a bipartisan  basis to address this matter. I urge adoption of this commonsense  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: H.R. 2504, To ensure fair treatment in       licensing requirements for the export of certain echinoderms,       was introduced on May 17, 2017. The bill was referred       primarily to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an       additional referral to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        I thank you for allowing the Committee on Foreign Affairs       to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This       discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support having       the Committee on Foreign Affairs represented on the       conference committee. Finally, to memorialize our       understanding, I would be pleased to include your letter and       this response in the Congressional Record when the bill is       considered by the House.        Thank you for your response and cooperation. I look forward       to further opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                      U.S. House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 2504, a bill to ensure       fair treatment in licensing requirements for the export of       certain echinoderms.        I agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee may be       discharged from further action on this bill, subject to the       understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee,       or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of conferees       to any House-Senate conference involving this bill, and would       appreciate your support for any such request.        I ask that you place our exchange of letters into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maine  (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maine  (Mr. Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, too, want to compliment the two Representatives from Maine. They  gave us a hands-on and a palate-trying type of opportunity in our  hearing. It doesn't get better than that, and I want to compliment them  for both.   I ask all of my colleagues to vote for the underlying bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2504.  [[Page H755]]    The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
