 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8665) ``to amend title 44, United States Code, to remove  pronouns from such title that reference the Archivist, and for other  purposes.''   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Archives and       Records Administration (NARA) Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H9659]]    Madam Speaker, H.R. 8665, the National Archives and Records  Modernization Act would make a small, yet important update to the U.S.  Code. This bipartisan bill would remove references to the pronoun  ``he'' when referring to the Archivist and other senior officials of  the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA.   I thank Representative Ro Khanna, chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Environment on the Oversight Committee for his leadership on this  incredibly important bill. I would also like to recognize  Representatives Yvette Herrell, Katie Porter, Byron Donalds, and    Danny Davis, who are all original cosponsors.   As the Nation's recordkeeper, NARA plays a critical role in the  preservation of the government's most important documents and  materials.   NARA's mission is to provide equitable public access to the records  of the Federal Government because public access to records strengthens  democracy and allows all Americans to understand their history so they  can fully participate in government.   Currently, the NARA is being led by Debra Steidel Wall who is serving  as Acting Archivist of the United States, and has been a public servant  at NARA for more than 30 years.   However, the United States Code does not reflect in its text that  women can hold this important position. The code is outdated in its  references to the Nation's Archivist and other senior officials as men.  It is long overdue that we update title 44 to remove reference to  pronouns in the law that wrongly assume that only a man can hold this  important role.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 8665, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 7535) to encourage the migration  of Federal Government information technology systems to quantum- resistant cryptography, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum Computing       Cybersecurity Preparedness Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Cryptography is essential for the national security of       the United States and the functioning of the economy of the       United States.        (2) The most widespread encryption protocols today rely on       computational limits of classical computers to provide       cybersecurity.        (3) Quantum computers might one day have the ability to       push computational boundaries, allowing us to solve problems       that have been intractable thus far, such as integer       factorization, which is important for encryption.        (4) The rapid progress of quantum computing suggests the       potential for adversaries of the United States to steal       sensitive encrypted data today using classical computers, and       wait until sufficiently powerful quantum systems are       available to decrypt it.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) a strategy for the migration of information technology       of the Federal Government to post-quantum cryptography is       needed; and        (2) the governmentwide and industrywide approach to post-      quantum cryptography should prioritize developing       applications, hardware intellectual property, and software       that can be easily updated to support cryptographic agility.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity  Preparedness Act.   Last year, Congressman Khanna came to me about a grave national  security threat looming on the horizon.   Today, the processes we use to encrypt data are very reliable and can  keep sensitive data secure during storage or transmission. But  tomorrow, that may no longer be the case.   Researchers around the world are making rapid advances toward quantum  computing, which is the application of quantum physics to allow  computers to perform calculations many magnitudes faster and more  powerfully than they do today.   While quantum computers have the potential to provide considerable  benefits to society, it is also increasingly likely that they could  allow our adversaries to break the best encryption we are capable of  today.   Capabilities of this magnitude are likely still a decade or more in  the future, but China and other adversaries are expected to begin  stealing sensitive encrypted data much sooner to unlock it when they  have the capacity to do so.   It is essential that the Federal Government prepare for this  inevitability now, while we still have time to protect data that is  critical to our national and economic security. The process of  migrating all Federal IT systems to quantum-resistant cryptography will  be complex and costly, but we need to start laying the groundwork for  this today.   I applaud Mr. Khanna, as well as Ms. Mace, Mr. Connolly, and Senator  Hassan, for introducing the Senate companion, all of them for putting  forth a thoughtful, bipartisan bill to establish that very process.   This bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to  quickly issue guidance requiring Federal agencies to create and  maintain inventories of all cryptographic systems currently in use, as  well as all Federal IT systems that could be vulnerable to future  quantum computers.   Within a year, OMB would be required to submit to Congress a strategy  for addressing the risk posed by quantum computing, allowing time for  assessment of this strategy before the National Institute of Standards  and Technology is expected to issue its standards for how to deal with  quantum computing in 2024.   The OMB would then be required to issue guidance requiring agencies  to develop a plan to migrate their IT systems to quantum-resistant  cryptography using those standards and to consult with the Chief  Information Officers Council to prioritize agency IT systems for  migration based on risk.   The bill before us today provides more concrete direction to support  this vision, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge concurrence in the Senate amendment  to H.R. 7535, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5349) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1550 State Road S-38-211 in Orangeburg, South  Carolina, as the ``J.I. Washington Post Office Building''.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 12, 2022, on page H9661, in the second column, the  following appeared: of the United States Postal Service located at  1550 State Road Su 38 u 211 in Orangeburg, South Carolina, as the      The online version has been corrected to read: of the United  States Postal Service located at 1550 State Road S-38-211 in  Orangeburg, South Carolina, as the    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5349         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. J.I. WASHINGTON POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1550 State Road S-38-211 in Orangeburg,       South Carolina, shall be known and designated as the ``J.I.       Washington Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``J.I. Washington Post Office Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5349, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1550 State Road  S-38-211 in Orangeburg, South Carolina, as the J.I. Washington Post  Office Building.    Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 5349, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for marking up  my bill and helping to bring it to the floor.   This bill would name the post office at 400 Southern Avenue Southeast  in the District of Columbia as the District of Columbia Servicemembers  and Veterans Post Office. While it is important that our country honor  all servicemembers and veterans, our country owes a special debt of  gratitude to D.C. servicemembers and veterans, who serve or have served  their country without voting representation in Congress or full local  self-government. It is remarkable that they serve a country that denies  them basic democratic rights, rights they have often been sent overseas  to defend.   D.C. residents have served in every war since the Revolutionary War.  There are approximately 30,000 veterans who live in the District of  Columbia, and almost 200,000 D.C. residents have served in the military  since World War I. This bill is one way to recognize their service and  sacrifice.   635 D.C. residents were casualties of World War I, a casualty figure  greater than that of three States during that war. 3,575 D.C. residents  were casualties of World War II, a casualty figure greater than that of  four States during that war. 547 D.C. residents were casualties of the  Korean war, a casualty figure greater than that of eight States during  that war. 243 D.C. residents were casualties of the Vietnam war, a  casualty figure greater than that of 10 States during that war.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
