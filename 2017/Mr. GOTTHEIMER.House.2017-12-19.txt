 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bipartisan  legislation and to thank my friend, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for working across  the aisle with me on this commonsense measure.   This bill is a smart, thoughtful effort to perfect and improve our  financial safeguards, cut burdensome regulation, and spur economic  growth. Developed with Democrats and Republicans on the committee, it  addresses our systematic risk in the financial sector.   With these changes, we can free up resources at smaller banks to get  loans into the hands of New Jersey small businesses, families, and  consumers, ultimately growing our American economy. It does so by  making practical changes to protect New Jersey.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan legislation to help  constituents in New Jersey's Fifth District.
