 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr.  Williams) for yielding me time. I thank my colleagues, specifically Mr.  Crow, for co-leading H.R. 7622, the Small Business Workforce Pipeline  Act of 2022.   The bill would allow small business development centers to provide  information and assistance to small businesses on how to establish and  improve work-based learning opportunities. It also would enhance  apprenticeship programs, pre-apprenticeship programs, and other job  training programs that many of us are very familiar with.   I hear all the time from Wisconsin small businesses back in my  district about how the country's labor shortage is affecting not only  the recruitment of skilled employees but, in particular, manufacturing  and, in my district, light manufacturing.   The latest National Federation for Independent Businesses' economic  trends report showed that while optimism in recovering to prepandemic  employment levels is increasing, we still are very much behind the  eight ball. Sixty percent of manufacturing firms report unfilled job  openings.   Apprenticeships and other job training programs provide a solution to  address the needs of the manufacturing sector. Apprenticeships are  among the most successful forms of workforce development, and through  paid and on-the-job training programs, alongside classroom education,  we can make significant strides.   This bill would directly benefit manufacturers and other businesses  in Wisconsin's Fifth District by having apprenticeships and other job- training materials readily available to them.   Madam Speaker, I support the passage of this bill.
