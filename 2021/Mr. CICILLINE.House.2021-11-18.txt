 Madam Speaker, we are at critical crossroads as we  work to recover after the health and economic crises caused by the  COVID-19 pandemic here at home and around the world.   As we look to our future, we are going to build back better to create  an economy that works for every American and all families that leaves  no one behind. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform  the lives of millions of Americans by reducing costs for everything  from prescription drugs to childcare; creating good-paying union jobs  by addressing the urgency of the climate crisis; cutting taxes for  working families; and making sure that none of these investments add to  the deficit by making the wealthiest individuals and largest  corporations pay their fair share in taxes.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this investment  in our Nation's future.                            ____________________
