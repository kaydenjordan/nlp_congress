 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Camp  Pendleton's 78th anniversary.   In 1942, the Marine Corps began construction on a new base north of  Camp Elliott in San Diego. When it was ready, the 9th Marine Regiment  marched north from Camp Elliott to the new base at the former Rancho  Santa Margarita.   On September 25, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt named the base  Camp Pendleton in honor of World War I Major General Joseph H.  Pendleton.   As a key amphibious training base, Camp Pendleton is crucial to the  Marine Corps in advancing and sustaining the readiness of operations  forces. Since World War II, Camp Pendleton has served as a major  training base used by Marine forces before deploying into combat, and I  am proud of the role that they have played in defending our country.   After the horrific attacks on September 11, Camp Pendleton provided  crucial training to the Army, Army National Guard units, and allied  forces, who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.   Camp Pendleton isn't just a military base; it is a vital part of our  community throughout the 49th District. The military families and  veterans who live on and around the base make our district a special  place, and I am proud to serve them in Congress.   Those families are also just one of the reasons why serving on the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee is so important to me.   I have made the well-being of our veterans and servicemembers one of  my top priorities in Congress. They have sacrificed for our freedom,  and it is our responsibility to honor that sacrifice by supporting them  in civilian life.   Once again, I am honored to represent Camp Pendleton and the families  who call it home.   Happy birthday, Camp Pendleton.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as the designee of Chairman  Pallone, pursuant to House Resolution 1129, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, all we have to do is look at  the last few weeks in my great State of California and see record  wildfires, 3.6 million acres and counting. And we have seen this all  throughout the Western United States, truly unprecedented.   And we also have seen smoke. All I had to do a few weeks ago is just  open the window, even though I am miles away from the center of any of  the wildfires, and we could see the thick, dark smoke, gray and orange.  We saw the pictures in the city of San Francisco. It is truly  unprecedented in our great State of California.   The amendment that we are offering will hopefully uncover the true  cost of this smoke. We must figure out exactly what type of health  impacts wildfire smoke is having, not just in California, but  everywhere where this has impacted our communities throughout the  Western United States.   So we are also going to need to develop better smoke forecasts. This  amendment would do that. And it directs the EPA to collect data and  coordinate research on the impacts of acute air pollution exposure from  wildfires. It is $100 million that I think is well spent.   An article published just a few days ago, September 19, in the Los  Angeles Times, is titled, ``How Bad Is All That Wildfire Smoke to Our  Long-Term Health? `Frankly, We Don't Really Know.' '' We don't really  know, and that is why we need this research, this funding.   A good friend of mine from Stanford University, my alma mater, an  economist named Marshall Burke, has done great work on the cost of  climate change and the cost of inaction. He has estimated that between  1,000 and 3,000 excess deaths--think of that number, 1,000 and 3,000  excess deaths--will be caused by the smoke from these wildfires. Five  thousand extra visits to the emergency room in California will be  caused by these wildfires.   And we know from other research at Harvard University and elsewhere  that short-term changes in particulate matter of 2.5, and other  criteria air pollutants, dramatically increase mortality.   It is very clear: Wildfire smoke is a dominant source of air  pollution in the United States in some years. Health costs associated  with wildfire exposure are greater than we thought, previously.   The more we learn about this, the more we recognize just what a  significant toll this is taking on our health, on our ability to deal  with the economic impacts that this causes. And we have seen, in  California, some of the studies on things like preterm birth, this has  had an impact even on preterm birth.   And, of course, as is so often the case, when we talk about  environmental issues, environmental justice is key here. We know that  the poor and communities of color have been impacted most by this as  well.   In my district, we have got the University of California at San  Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and I am very proud of all  of the work they are doing.   One of the researchers there recently made the link between air  pollution and increased risk of COVID-19 and, specifically, the  severity of symptoms that one would get if they were to have COVID-19  and if they were to be impacted by wildfire smoke. It could exacerbate  the degree to which COVID-19 causes more serious conditions.   As that researcher said: ``I really hope I am wrong, but what we may  expect to see in the next few weeks is an increase in the fatality rate  from COVID-19.''   So we know that wildfire smoke is here. This is not theoretical.  Oftentimes, when we talk about climate change, we think of something in  the future; we think of something theoretical.   One of the things that I so appreciate about this legislation, and  specifically about this amendment and the series of amendments from Mr.  Schrader and my friends from California--Josh Harder, Ami Bera,   Mike  Thompson, and   Jimmy Panetta--is that all of these amendments are  things that impact us in the here and now.   Wildfire smoke is not some far-off, theoretical thing that may or may  not  [[Page H4942]]  happen in the future. We know that it is happening, and happening right  now.   So, as I mentioned, in addition to our amendment, which establishes a  program to improve wildfire smoke emissions modeling and to develop  smoke forecasts and directs EPA to collect data and coordinate research  on the impacts of acute air pollution exposure from wildfires, Mr.  Schrader of Oregon has an amendment that would establish the home  wildfire risk reduction rebate program to provide rebates to homeowners  to defray the cost of retrofitting an existing home to be wildfire  resistant.   Of course, we are thinking of all of our friends throughout the  Pacific Northwest. We have family in Oregon and Washington that have  been so dramatically impacted by all of this.   As I mentioned, my friends Josh Harder, Ami Bera, and   Mike  Thompson, all fantastic Representatives from northern California--and  they have really borne the brunt of the wildfires throughout  California--have offered amendments that, among other things, create a  geospatial map that depicts wildfire risk around utilities to allow for  better planning, for grid hardening, vegetation management, emergency  access points, and more.   Their amendments also establish an electricity reliability standard  regarding extreme weather events and direct the Department of Energy to  help States and local utilities on ways to improve the resiliency of  their electrical grids. It is so important that we study these  wildfires and we understand the impact on our electricity grid.   My friend Representative Panetta offers several amendments, including  one that expands weatherization assistance for low-income families and  enhancement in innovation to cover the use of materials that are  resistant to high heat and fire in dwellings occupied by low-income  persons in areas at risk from drought and wildfires.   I think it is important to just mention we are not talking about  wildfires in a vacuum. We have seen record drought and record  temperatures, and those conditions create the environment that we now  have seen that creates these wildfire risks.   Finally, my friend Representative Bera has an amendment that directs  the Secretary of Energy to support R&D on tools and technologies for  improving the electric grid and the energy sector for safety and  resilience during concurrent or colocated severe weather events.                                time  1245    I am extremely proud at the support that we have been able to achieve  for these amendments, and for the package for H.R. 4447. It is a  comprehensive bill that we really do need to move forward on.   It has been a dozen years, a dozen years, since we have been able to  update the structure and the authorizations of critical clean energy  research and demonstration programs at the Department of Energy, and we  have learned so much about our environment, about climate change.   I graduated from law school in 2005, and I became an environmental  attorney and a clean energy advocate working in a variety of clean  energy organizations, businesses, and now as a legislator. And what I  can tell you is that between the time I graduated from law school in  2005 and today, we know significantly more, and much different  information about climate change than we did back then. Yet, we have  not updated the research and development now for 12 years, it is simply  unacceptable.   So our amendment and the other amendments that I discussed will go a  long way, and I hope we can achieve bipartisan consensus in this, and  in the months and years ahead to actually tackle these problems as they  face Californians.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the  distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
