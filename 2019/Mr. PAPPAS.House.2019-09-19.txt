 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of all New Hampshire  residents and Americans in support of the Christa McAuliffe  Commemorative Coin Act.   Christa McAuliffe was a dedicated high school social studies teacher  who understood how history is defined by ordinary people doing  extraordinary things.   Christa dared to touch the future as a teacher and as an astronaut.  Selected from more than 11,000 applicants for NASA's Teacher in Space  Program, she inspired the world and furthered our Nation's commitment  to exploration inside and outside the classroom. I remember watching  the shuttle launch as a kindergarten student on January 28, 1986,  feeling the pride that a New Hampshire teacher from just up the road in  Concord was making history.   Although Christa McAuliffe and six other souls were tragically lost  in the Challenger explosion, her legacy endures. The creation of the  commemorative coin is one way we can honor her and all of our educators  for opening doors of opportunity and challenging students to succeed.  The proceeds from these coins will support FIRST Robotics, a program  that is building the next generation of creators, leaders, and  dreamers. I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation  today.                            ____________________
