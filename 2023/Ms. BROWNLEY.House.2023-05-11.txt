 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2, House Republicans' so-called  border security bill, is yet another glaring example of the false  outrage exhibited by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   As they speak blatant mistruths about concerns over Americans'  safety, they turn a blind eye to the deadly epidemic of gun violence  within our borders.   Instead, House Republicans clamor around a bill that guts the U.S.  asylum process and eliminates any realistic pathways to legal  immigration.   Their proposal costs the American people $6.1 billion and does  nothing to increase border security personnel. In fact, the bill would  pay for the former President's vanity project, an expensive and  ineffective wall that would make our Nation more vulnerable to drug and  human trafficking.   It is with a deep understanding that we are a nation of laws and a  nation of immigrants that House Democrats are working to pass  comprehensive immigration reform that will protect our communities, the  American people, and the American Dream.                            ____________________
