 Mr. President, last weekend, 10 people were  tragically killed in a plane crash near Whidbey Island, WA, sending  waves of shock and sadness through the entire State. Today, I join with  communities across Washington in honoring their memories and grieving  this immeasurable loss for their families and friends.   One of these 10 people was Sandy Williams, a beloved member of the  eastern Washington community, and a powerful civil rights advocate who  worked to lift up Black voices across the State. Sandy Williams was  born and raised in Spokane Valley and, starting at a young age, worked  hard in pursuit of equality and justice. In fact, when her middle  school offered a home economics class for girls but wouldn't allow them  to take the shop class with the boys, she refused to take no for and  answer and pushed back until she and other girls were allowed to take  shop. Her fight for fairness and equality would lead her to leave an  indelible mark on eastern Washington which she loved so dearly, in so  many ways.   Sandy helped establish the Pride Center at Eastern Washington  University to support LGBTQ+ youth. Sandy also served eastern  Washington as its member of the Washington State Commission on African  American Affairs. And she worked nonstop to lift Black voices and  create a community where everyone is heard, included, and empowered.   In 2016, Sandy started publishing a newspaper called ``Black Lens''-- that she ran out of her home--to tell the  [[Page S4511]]  stories that mattered most to Black Washingtonians. Sandy was dedicated  to a vision of eastern Washington where Black people could come  together as a community and worked hard to make that vision a reality  by helping create the Carl Maxey Center. The Carl Maxey Center is a  testament to Sandy's legacy; it remains a hub of economic, social, and  cultural activity in Spokane. It provides rental assistance, social  services, business support, resources for students, and more. It helps  plan beloved events like Unity in the Community and the Riverfront Park  Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. And it will continue to be an example  of Sandy's steadfast commitment to community.   Through her advocacy, through her example, and through her action to  make dreams realities, Sandy made Washington State a fairer, more just  place, and her legacy and impact will endure for generations to come.   Sandy is survived by her daughter Renika, her brother Rick, and many  loved ones in Spokane.                            ____________________
