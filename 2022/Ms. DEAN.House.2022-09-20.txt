 Madam Speaker, last week, nearly 50 migrants who sought  asylum and refuge in America were met with grossly un-American actions.   Governor DeSantis deceived them and shipped them across the Nation,  like chattel, to Martha's Vineyard all in search of hollow political  points.   Not only was this a failed political stunt, it was a failure of  common humanity--of common decency.   To think of what men, women, children--a 1-month-old--endured to seek  asylum in our great Nation. To think of the bravery and the agony to  leave your home, your family, your country in search of a better way of  life--fleeing communism, political and economic instability in  Venezuela.   Madam Speaker, Members come to this floor to give 1-minute speeches  every session, and I hear Republican speeches and I see the signs, the  stunts--Biden's border crisis.   No. This is America's problem, our problem. And a ``wall'' or these  recent, cruel stunts by shameful Governors auditioning to be the next  Trump offer no solutions, no hope.   Instead, it will take courage--courage by Republicans in both  Chambers to come back to the table and work with Democrats to fix our  long-broken immigration system. That is the American way.                            ____________________
