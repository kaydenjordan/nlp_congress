 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Police  Week, an opportunity to recognize the brave men and women in blue.   This week is meaningful to me and my family, for my oldest son is a  police officer in Michigan, and I could not be more proud of him and  his service.   Too often, we take for granted those who every day put on a badge and  a vest to protect us and our communities. Events across this country  have been politicized and stretch the relationship between law  enforcement and their community. Let us not have politics overwhelm the  dedication and commitment of our men and women in blue. Our lives, and  indeed our freedoms, are safeguarded by the thin blue line. We owe the  men and women in uniform, those who put themselves at risk every day, a  simple thank you and simply our respect.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to give the police officers at our doors here,  the officers throughout our communities, and my son, a simple thank  you.                            ____________________
