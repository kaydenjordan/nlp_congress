 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act.   Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I am confused. I serve on the Ways and Means  Committee, and a few weeks ago, we had a long, lively hearing on the  need to preserve the preexisting conditions created by the ACA. I was  impressed that every member of the Ways and Means Committee, Democrat  and Republican, spoke passionately about this protection--every one.   We emerged from that hearing with a clear, bipartisan consensus that  we would never again condemn Americans who suffer from diabetes or  cancer or heart disease or epilepsy to unaffordable insurance and  perhaps an early death.   But today my Republican friends are ready to vote against the only  bill this year to keep the Trump administration from gutting the  preexisting exclusion. They argue that, no, this is not what CMS is  trying to do, yet this is exactly what would happen with short-term  insurance plans if the various States are given the opportunity to do  so. That is why virtually every organization that protects human health  supports this bill and is against the CMS action.                                time  1500    States want waivers. States want to innovate. This bill won't keep  them from innovating or keep them from getting waivers. Remember what  States did before the Affordable Care Act when there was no prohibition  against higher costs for preexisting conditions or no insurance.   If what they say is, indeed, true, there is no harm voting ``yes''  for this bill. States will still be able to innovate, as long as they  don't violate the preexisting conditions exclusion.
