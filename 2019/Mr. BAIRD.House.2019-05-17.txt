 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jason Dombkowski,  who is retiring after 25 years of faithful public service with the West  Lafayette Police Department. Jason has been the Chief of Police at the  department for 11 years, serving his fellow officers and community with  integrity and professionalism.   He received his master's degree in Technology, Leadership, and  Innovation from Purdue University, and has completed the Indiana Law  Enforcement Academy, the FBI National Academy at Quantico, and the U.S.  Secret Service Dignitary Protection Programs, among others.   In addition to his remarkable career, Jason remains a steadfast  pillar in the community, known for his commitment, leadership, and  service. He serves on the YWCA board, and has been a board member for  the Red Cross, Lafayette Crisis Center, the Lafayette Catholic Diocese  Bishop's Review Board.   He also volunteers with the ``Shop With a Cop'' program and coaches a  youth flag football team.   He and his wife, Cristie, have four children, and reside in West  Lafayette.   Congratulations on your retirement, Jason. I know you will continue  to serve our community well in your new capacity, and I wish you the  very best.                            ____________________
