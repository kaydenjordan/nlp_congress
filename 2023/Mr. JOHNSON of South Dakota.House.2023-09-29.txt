 Mr. Speaker, so often around here, we  vote on half measures, narrow bills that, at best, address one issue in  only a modest way. This is not that bill. This is an opportunity in one  vote to shut the border, to keep the government open, and to reduce  spending.   The five conservative leaders who, with me, crafted this proposal  knew that bold action was needed.   Crisis one: We are $33 trillion in debt. That is pushing us toward  insolvency. That number has grown by 50 percent in just the last 4  years. This bill puts us back on the right track and cuts billions of  spending, even just in the next month.   Two, a shutdown accomplishes nothing. It does not save a nickel. In  fact, it costs the American taxpayers billions. This stopgap funding  measure makes sure our government stays open.   Three, 1.8 million illegal crossings at our southern border is  unacceptable. This bill puts into place the policies that we know work  to secure our border.   Mr. Speaker, I will admit to not understanding fully those who oppose  this bill. I do not understand why anyone would choose open borders  over an open government.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to solve problems. Chaos is not a  legislative strategy. In a few moments, I will vote to keep the  government open, to cut spending, and to secure our border. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
