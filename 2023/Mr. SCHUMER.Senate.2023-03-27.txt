 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we are just learning of the horrific,  truly heartbreaking shooting at a school in Nashville earlier today-- six people, three children.   I still have the pictures of the kids at Sandy Hook--the little  children there who were shot dead--in mind.   Well, six people, including three children, were shot and killed in  their own school. Six people, three children, won't be coming home  today to their families, to their friends, to their lives.   We are holding in our hearts the families of the loved ones, of those  affected by this horrible tragedy, and thank the first responders who  were on the scene.                                    Israel    Madam President, now on Israel, I welcome the news that the judicial  legislation proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his  government have been suspended. The bond between the United States and  Israel is rooted in our shared democratic values and fealty to the rule  of law. When I was in Israel 4 weeks ago, I shared that message  directly with the Prime Minister.   I echo the call of President Herzog to find a compromise. It is a  good step that the legislation is put on hold, and I strongly urge  Israeli leaders, I urge Prime Minister Netanyahu: Come to a compromise  before pushing forward again.   Isaac ``Bougie'' Herzog has the trust of all parties and is the right  person to come up with the compromise. I urge both sides to work with  him. At a time when Israel faces real dangers, particularly from Iran,  the last thing Israel needs is divisiveness at home. Let us hope they  can come to a compromise.                   Authorizations for Use of Military Force    Madam President, on AUMF, this afternoon, the Senate will vote on  cloture on AUMF repeal, bringing us one step closer to finally  repealing the 1991 and 2002 Iraq AUMFs. Once cloture is invoked this  afternoon, we will hold a few more votes on additional Republican  amendments. Senators should then expect to vote on final passage of the  Iraq AUMF repeal as soon as tomorrow.   Repealing the Iraq AUMFs has been a good and reasonable process here  on the floor. We had a strong bipartisan vote on cloture last week. We  are allowing Republican amendments. Most importantly, we aren't being  dilatory because this is something a majority of Senators want to get  done.   I hope this can be a method, a pattern of what we do in the future.  We are willing to allow amendments, but we must move forward and cannot  be dilatory and cannot have amendments so extraneous that they just bog  down the whole process. What happened on this AUMF bill is a good model  for us for the future to get things done with bipartisan cooperation.   On this bill, I want to thank Senators Kaine and Young, the chairman  and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and  all the cosponsors of this legislation for their work on this measure.                             Military Nominations    Madam President, now on the hold on senior military nominations,  defense readiness is impossible without military commanders in place to  execute our national defense strategy. Senators have regularly worked  together to confirm routine military nominees quickly, ensuring no  lapses in the work of our military. But right now, 160 military  promotions--160--these are not political. These are men and women who  have worked their way up through the ranks and deserve a promotion to  general, to colonel, et cetera. But 160, including five three-star  generals, are on hold because the senior Senator from Alabama is  holding them up because he can't get his way on blocking 160,000 women  within the military from receiving healthcare.   Blocking military choices is unprecedented--unprecedented, hasn't  happened before--and it could weaken our national security. And the  number of those who are blocked is going to grow even larger as new  nominees are reported out of the committee, which they do regularly.   Among the general and flag officers on hold by the Senator from  Alabama include commanders for U.S. naval forces in the Pacific, the  Middle East, and the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military  Committee--something really important at a time when war rages in  Ukraine. The commanders of the 5th and 7th Fleets are the commanders of  U.S. naval forces confronting the likes of Iran and China. They are  being held up singlehandedly by the Senator from Alabama.   It shouldn't have to be said, but the Senator from Alabama's hold on  hundreds of routine military promotions is reckless. It damages the  readiness of our military and puts American security in jeopardy.   Now, look, all of us feel very strongly, passionately, at times about  certain political issues, certainly as strongly as the Senator of  Alabama feels about this one, but if every single one of us objected to  the promotion of military personnel whenever we feel passionately or  strongly about an issue, our military would simply grind to a halt.   The Senator from Alabama's actions risk permanently politicizing the  confirmation of military personnel for the first time ever, and that  would cause immense damage to the military's ability to lead and  protect us. I can't think of a worse time for a MAGA Republican to pull  a stunt like this, as threats against American security and against  democracy are growing all around the world.   I urge Members of his own party to prevail on the Senator from  Alabama to stand down in this unprecedented and dangerous move and  allow these critical, nonpolitical, nonpartisan military nominees to go  through.                           Medicaid and the Budget    Madam President, on Medicaid and the budget, today, the Governor of  North Carolina is signing legislation to expand Medicaid eligibility  following the passage of a bipartisan compromise through the North  Carolina General Assembly last week. Once signed, as many as 600,000  North Carolinians will soon enjoy healthcare coverage previously denied  to them.   House Republicans should follow the example of their State-level  counterparts and work with Democrats to expand services like Medicaid,  not cut them. They should join Democrats to strengthen healthcare for  all Americans, not threaten extreme cuts like the House GOP has been  doing for months.   In the American Rescue Plan, Democrats passed a major new incentive  to get holdout States to expand Medicaid to cover their low-income  citizens. We should build on this work.   Now, House Republicans have bent over backwards claiming Social  Security and Medicare are off the table, but what are their plans for  Medicaid? Republicans have been disturbingly evasive about whether or  not they want to cut Medicaid, and so Americans, unfortunately, remain  in the dark.   If a moderate State like North Carolina is expanding Medicaid with  bipartisan support, what the heck are MAGA Republicans doing  threatening to cut it? It shows how difficult it will be for House  Republicans to put together a plan that gets 218 votes.   So we repeat: Leader McCarthy, today is March 27. It is nearly 3  months. Where is your plan? Is Medicaid on the GOP chopping block? Are  the MAGA Republicans pulling the Republican Party here in the House  further to the right even as North Carolina, a moderate State, in a  bipartisan way passes legislation to expand Medicaid? Will tens of  millions of Americans find out that their benefits will be curtailed or  eliminated?   Let me say again, instead of obsession about ideological spending  cuts that harm millions of people, Republicans should work with  Democrats to strengthen vital healthcare services. We should do that  while also agreeing to lift the debt ceiling together, without  brinksmanship or blackmail or hostage-taking.                                 Student Debt    Madam President, on student debt, this morning, House Republicans  introduced legislation to overturn President Biden's historic student  loan debt relief program, denying millions of Americans the critical  student debt relief they need.   It is hard to believe that, at a time when millions of Americans are  struggling with student debt, Republicans are showing how callous and  uncaring they are by trying to block debt relief that will literally  transform the lives of so many for the better.   Republicans have tried to paint President Biden's plan as a tuition  bailout and a giveaway to high earners. A giveaway to high earners?  Republicans ignore the facts.  [[Page S946]]    Under President Biden's plan, 90 percent--nearly 90 percent of relief  dollars would go to out-of-school borrowers making less than $75,000 a  year. This is a party that cuts taxes on the very wealthy but then says  that this is a bailout and a giveaway to high earners, when 90 percent  of the people who get it--nearly 90 percent--make less than $75,000 a  year? Who are they kidding? What hypocrisy.   Under President Biden's plan, no one in the top 5 percent of incomes  will receive a penny in debt relief, even though Republicans were happy  to give them huge tax breaks a few years back and still want to do  that.   Rather than help the privileged few, President Biden's plan would  benefit Americans who need it most: students of color, poor Americans,  children of immigrants, working and middle-class families. These are  the people who would suffer from the Republicans' terrible proposal.                                    H.R. 1    Madam President, on H.R. 1--I have a lot to talk about today-- Republicans recently rolled out their partisan, unserious, so-called  energy package they dubbed ``H.R. 1.'' Let's call H.R. 1 what it is: a  wish list for Big Oil masquerading as an energy package.   Republicans' so-called energy package would gut important  environmental safeguards on fossil fuel projects. It would lock  Americans into expensive, erratic, and dirty energy sources. It omits  long-overdue reforms for accelerating the construction of transmission.   A serious package would help America transition to clean, affordable  energy, not set us decades back like the Republican proposal. A serious  energy package would include transmission to help bring clean energy  projects online, not leave it untouched--untouched--even though  everyone agrees transmission is needed, but the Republican proposal  doesn't mention it.   So let me make it again very clear. House Republicans' so-called  energy bill is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate. We will work in good  faith on real permitting reform talks--bipartisan, bicameral--but this  proposal is a nonstarter.                                Vladimir Putin    Madam President, finally, on the GOP embrace--the embrace of some--of  Putin, yesterday, reports came out that Vladimir Putin announced Moscow  would deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as well as position  nuclear-armed Iskander hypersonic missiles within Belarus, with a range  of 300 miles.   In the past, Putin's conduct over the last year would have won swift  and unequivocal condemnation from both parties, but today, an  increasingly vocal minority within the hard right is more comfortable  defending and excusing Putin rather than condemning him. One Republican  Governor from a Southern State even referred to the Ukraine war as ``a  territorial dispute.'' I have to wonder what he would have said if he  were around in the 1930s. We know what happened then when many refused  to stand up to aggression. A world war resulted.   This isn't hard. Vladimir Putin is a threat to American national  security and democracy, and MAGA Republicans who fail to condemn him  are only empowering him in the long run.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 28,  S. 870.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, March 27, be waived.    Madam President, just to inform the Members, I am moving  to file cloture on this bill, which would make sure that both the SAFER  grants and the AFG grants, which protect and help our paid and  volunteer firefighters, continue. It expires in a few months if we do  nothing.   Our firefighters, both paid and volunteer, are brave; they risk their  lives for us; they run to danger, not away from it; and they need both  equipment and personnel so that they can continue to do their jobs,  particularly in smaller, more rural, and more suburban areas where  there is not the tax base to support the stuff that they need. So I  hope we can move forward quickly on this legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
