 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor this year's National Christmas  Tree Contest winner who hails from my home county of Avery in North  Carolina's Fifth District, Mr. Larry Smith.   This year, Mr. Smith won the national tree contest hosted by the  National Christmas Tree Association, whose members have presented the  official White House Christmas tree for display in the Blue Room since  1966.   Growers must first win their local competitions in order to qualify  for the association's national contest. At the national competition,  growers, industry experts, and consumers vote to choose the real  Christmas tree grower who will provide the official White House  Christmas tree.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent this year's winner and was  delighted to join Mr. Smith, his family and friends in presenting the  First Family with its Fraser fir Christmas tree last week.   As a former Christmas tree grower myself, I can attest to the  importance of recognizing this often overlooked, yet highly  significant, farming industry. Christmas trees have held a historic  place in American family tradition since 1850. Long before artificial  trees were around, real trees brought Christmas spirit into homes with  their evergreen and fragrant branches during the season.   Just as importantly, Christmas trees play a vital role in the North  Carolina high country's economy by providing jobs and livelihoods for  thousands of North Carolinians. The Fifth District is one of the  largest producers of live-cut Christmas trees in the country, producing  over 20 percent of the real Christmas trees in the United States.   Representing over 95 percent of all species grown in the State, the  North Carolina Fraser fir Christmas tree is the most popular Christmas  tree in North America. It is shipped to every State in the U.S., as  well as the Caribbean islands, Mexico, Canada, Bermuda, Japan, and  other points all over the world.   Congratulations once again to Mr. Smith, and thanks to Christmas tree  growers across the country for contributing to our economy and  providing the joy of having a real Christmas tree to families  worldwide.                           Association Health Plans     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some good news with the  House. Over a year and a half ago, we passed the Small Business Health  Fairness Act.   Small businesses were hit hard by flawed mandates, soaring costs, and  limited choices under ObamaCare. The Education and the Workforce  Committee worked hard to produce the Small Business Health Fairness  Act, which expanded healthcare options and lowered costs for working  families by encouraging small businesses to come together through  association health plans and negotiate for lower costs on behalf of  their employees.   In October of last year, President Trump issued an executive order  that built on the solutions in that bill, directing the Department of  Labor to remove barriers and make association health plans a viable  option for businesses and their employees.   Well, it is working. In my home State of North Carolina, individuals  in the hospitality industry will soon have access to a new association  health plan that provides affordable, comprehensive coverage. Nearly  half a million workers in North Carolina alone will have options they  didn't have before thanks to association health plans.   In Oklahoma, chambers of commerce at the State and local level are  working with some of the smallest businesses around to form association  health plans and allow these talented individuals to keep doing what  they really want to do, innovating and creating jobs only they will be  able to create.   Even farmers in Minnesota and Nebraska are finding ways to come  together for better bargaining power that puts people and their  healthcare choices first.   Association health plans put people in charge. They empower small  businesses to offer the same benefits that  [[Page H9578]]  large companies can provide, and they allow employees to choose  coverage options that work best for them.   At the Education and the Workforce Committee, we have been proud to  do our part to bring about this sustainable healthcare solution for  millions of Americans. I welcome the news.                            ____________________
