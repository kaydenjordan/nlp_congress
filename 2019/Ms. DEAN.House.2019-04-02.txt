 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak, once again, about Peter  Biar Ajak, a renowned peace activist unlawfully detained in South  Sudan.   In July of 2018, Peter was arrested by South Sudan's security forces.  He has  [[Page H2974]]  been held without charge or trial ever since, and has been frequently  denied access to his family, to counsel, to care, and to adequate food.   Peter was one of Sudan's ``Lost Boys,'' he resettled in Philadelphia,  and attended La Salle University, where I taught for 10 years. I knew  Peter as a brilliant student and a leader. He later went on to Harvard  and to Cambridge.   He is a dedicated peace activist who co-founded South Sudan Young  Leaders Forum. In his work, he has criticized South Sudan's leaders for  failing to secure a permanent peace for their people.   Incredibly, Peter is now under investigation for crimes including  treason and terrorism. If charged and convicted, Peter could be  sentenced to death. In reality, he is being persecuted for his speech.   I call on President Kiir to release Peter and all other political  prisoners in South Sudan.                            ____________________
