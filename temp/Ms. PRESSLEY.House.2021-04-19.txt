 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1532) to require a review of the effects of FHA mortgage  insurance policies, practices, and products on small-dollar mortgage  lending, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1532         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving FHA Support for       Small-Dollar Mortgages Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FHA SMALL-DOLLAR MORTGAGE PRACTICES.         (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) affordable homeownership opportunities are being       hindered due to the lack of financing available for home       purchases under $70,000;        (2) according to the Urban Institute, small-dollar mortgage       loan applications in 2017 were denied by lenders at double       the rate of denial for large mortgage loans, and this       difference in denial rates cannot be fully explained by       differences in the applicants' credit profiles;        (3) according to data compiled by Attom Data solutions,       small-dollar mortgage originations have decreased 38 percent       since 2009, while there has been a 65-percent increase in       origination of mortgages for more than $150,000;        (4) the FHA's mission is to serve creditworthy borrowers       who are underserved and, according to the Urban Institute,       the FHA serves 24 percent of the overall market, but only 19       percent of the small-dollar mortgage market; and        (5) the causes behind these variations are not fully       understood, but merit study that could assist in furthering       the Department of Housing and Urban Development's mission,       including meeting the housing needs of borrowers the program       is designed to serve and reducing barriers to homeownership,       while  [[Page H1907]]       protecting the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance       Fund.        (b) Review.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development       shall conduct a review of its FHA single-family mortgage       insurance policies, practices, and products to identify any       barriers or impediments to supporting, facilitating, and       making available mortgage insurance for mortgages having an       original principal obligation of $70,000 or less. Not later       than the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit       a report to the Congress describing the findings of such       review and the actions that the Secretary will take, without       adversely affecting the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage       Insurance Fund, to remove such barriers and impediments to       providing mortgage insurance for such mortgages.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have five legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, when it comes to promoting access to homeownership,  much of the focus tends to be on how high housing prices are pricing  many borrowers out of homeownership. But the landscape of homeownership  opportunities is varied, and for many communities, the lack of access  to traditional mortgage financing for small-dollar mortgages continues  to be a major barrier.   Specifically, I am talking about mortgage financing for homes that  are priced at $70,000 or less. For many rural communities, and  predominantly communities of color that are struggling to overcome the  impacts of the foreclosure crisis, there are lower-value homes that  would otherwise be ideal homeownership opportunities for first-time  home buyers and working class families, but the lack of traditional  mortgage financing options acts as a barrier to those opportunities.                                time  1530    Data from the Urban Institute shows that these small-dollar mortgages  are denied by lenders at double the rate compared to larger loans, and  this trend cannot be explained away by differences in the  creditworthiness of applicants.   The bottom line is that lenders don't make as much money originating  these smaller loans, so they are less likely to make loans on  collateral that don't maximize their profit.   The Federal Housing Administration was designed to serve underserved  markets and could be instrumental in promoting more small-dollar  mortgage lending, but the data shows that the FHA is actually  disproportionately failing to serve this market. So this bill would  require the FHA to identify barriers to better serving the small-dollar  mortgage market and to come up with an actionable plan to reduce those  barriers.   This bill is desperately needed at a time when mortgage rates are at  historic lows and home prices continue to rise. We must support  affordable housing options for individual borrowers and their pursuit  of the American Dream of homeownership.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would inquire through the Chair if my  colleague has any remaining speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Tlaib for her work on this  important bill, as we work to improve access to affordable  homeownership. This bill is an important step that will help us better  understand and break down the barriers to obtaining traditional  mortgage financing for small-dollar mortgages.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1491) to amend the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to  provide enhanced protection against debt collector harassment of  members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1491         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Debt Collection       Practices for Servicemembers Act''.       SEC. 2. ENHANCED PROTECTION AGAINST DEBT COLLECTOR HARASSMENT                     OF SERVICEMEMBERS.         (a) Communication in Connection With Debt Collection.--      Section 805 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15       U.S.C. 1692c) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Communications Concerning Servicemember Debts.--        ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `covered       member' means--        ``(A) a covered member or a dependent as defined in section       987(i) of title 10, United States Code; and        ``(B)(i) an individual who was separated, discharged, or       released from duty described in such section 987(i)(1), but       only during the 365-day period beginning on the date of       separation, discharge, or release; or        ``(ii) a person, with respect to an individual described in       clause (i), described in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), or (I)       of section 1072(2) of title 10, United States Code.        ``(2) Prohibitions.--A debt collector may not, in       connection with the collection of any debt of a covered       member--        ``(A) threaten to have the covered member reduced in rank;        ``(B) threaten to have the covered member's security       clearance revoked; or        ``(C) threaten to have the covered member prosecuted under       chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code (the Uniform Code       of Military Justice).''.        (b) Unfair Practices.--Section 808 of the Fair Debt       Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692f) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(9) The representation to any covered member (as defined       under section 805(e)(1)) that failure to cooperate with a       debt collector will result in--        ``(A) a reduction in rank of the covered member;        ``(B) a revocation of the covered member's security       clearance; or        ``(C) prosecution under chapter 47 of title 10, United       States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice).''.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         The Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct       a study and submit a report to Congress on the impact of this       Act on--        (1) the timely delivery of information to a covered member       (as defined in section 805(e) of the Fair Debt Collection       Practices Act, as added by this Act);        (2) military readiness; and        (3) national security, including the extent to which       covered members with security clearances would be impacted by       uncollected debt.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Dean for her leadership on this  important bill, which will provide much-needed relief and protection  for our servicemembers.   Two out of every five servicemembers' complaints submitted to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are about predatory debt  collection practices. Some examples of what servicemembers reported  experiencing include inappropriate threats of punishment under the  Uniform Code of Military Justice, threats to the rank and security  clearance of the servicemember, and even reports of debt collectors  inappropriately contacting the commanding officer of the debt holder.   It is a disgrace that people serving in the military are being  threatened and intimidated. The impact of these abusive collection  practices is severe. Servicemembers have reported increased stress and  hardship because of predatory debt collectors.   These unfair and unnecessary practices against people who are putting  their lives on the line for this country must end, which is why the  National Military Family Association; the National Consumer Law Center;  and the former CFPB Assistant Director for Servicemember Affairs,  retired Army Colonel Paul Kantwill, all support this bill.   I am happy to say that Democrats and Republicans agree that Congress  should put a halt to these abusive practices, and this bill does just  that. Congresswoman Dean's work across the aisle and with the House  Armed Services Committee last Congress resulted in a House floor vote  of 355-0.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this bill  again so we can better protect our servicemembers, who do so much to  protect us.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  [[Page H1909]]  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), who is also the sponsor of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Madam Speaker, I commend Congresswoman Dean for her excellent work on  H.R. 1491 to help ensure our servicemembers are not threatened or  harassed by unscrupulous debt collectors.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support our servicemembers by  voting ``yes'' on H.R. 1491, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1395) to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development to discount FHA single-family mortgage insurance premium  payments for first-time homebuyers who complete a financial literacy  housing counseling program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1395         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Financial Literacy       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DISCOUNT ON MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR                     FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS WHO COMPLETE FINANCIAL                     LITERACY HOUSING COUNSELING PROGRAMS.         The second sentence of subparagraph (A) of section       203(c)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.       1709(c)(2)(A)) is amended--        (1) by inserting before the comma the following: ``and such       program is completed before the mortgagor has signed an       application for a mortgage to be insured under this title or       a sales agreement''; and        (2) by striking ``not exceed 2.75 percent of the amount of       the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage''       and inserting ``be 25 basis points lower than the premium       payment amount established by the Secretary under the first       sentence of this subparagraph''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1395, the Housing Financial  Literacy Act, a bipartisan bill authored by  [[Page H1910]]  Representative Beatty who is the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Diversity and Inclusion. The bill is also cosponsored by Representative  Stivers.   This bill would incentivize prospective home buyers to undergo  housing counseling by offering a discount on FHA-backed mortgages for  doing so. Research has consistently demonstrated that loans made to  borrowers who have received pre-purchase counseling perform better than  loans made to comparable borrowers who did not receive pre-purchase  counseling on their mortgage.   When borrowers are able to stay current on their mortgage payments,  lenders save money too. A 2013 study by Freddie Mac found that when 90- day delinquencies were lowered by 29 percent, lenders saved an average  of $1,000 per loan. So this bill would not only benefit consumers  during an environment of historically low mortgage rates, it would also  help further improve the financial health of the FHA.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Beatty for her leadership on  this commonsense, data-driven bill. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 1395, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio for pushing this  bill forward.   This bill incentivizes financial literacy that will help avoid  delinquencies and lower the upfront cost of homeownership for so many.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1565) to create an interdivisional taskforce at the  Securities and Exchange Commission for senior investors.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1565         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Senior Investor       Initiative Act of 2021'' or the ``Senior Security Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. SENIOR INVESTOR TASKFORCE.         Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.       78d) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(k) Senior Investor Taskforce.--        ``(1) Establishment.--There is established within the       Commission the Senior Investor Taskforce (in this subsection       referred to as the `Taskforce').        ``(2) Director of the taskforce.--The head of the Taskforce       shall be the Director, who shall--        ``(A) report directly to the Chairman;

(c) Senior Citizen Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term ``senior citizen'' means an individual over the age       of 65.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1565, the Senior Security  Act of 2021, which would help protect America's senior investors who  can be disproportionately vulnerable to investment-related frauds.   In 2017 alone, State securities regulators conducted nearly 4,709  investigations, leading to more than 2,100 enforcement actions,  including 255 criminal prosecutions. These actions have resulted in  approximately $486 million in restitution for harmed investors, nearly  $79 million in fines and/or penalties, and 1,985 years in incarceration  or probation being ordered.   The National Council on Aging estimated that elder financial abuse  and fraud costs older Americans from $2.9 billion to $36.5 billion  annually. Moreover, in a February bulletin, the FINRA, the NASAA, and  the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy noted that COVID- 19's unprecedented quarantines and social isolation may leave senior  investors even more susceptible to financial fraud than ever before.   This bill would establish a Senior Investor Task Force within the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In coordination and  consultation with State securities administrators, self-regulatory  organizations, Federal law enforcement agencies, and others, the task  force would be charged with identifying issues related to investors who  are older than 65 years of age. The bill would also require biennial  task force reports and require the GAO to complete a study on senior  financial exploitation.   I strongly support the safety of America's senior investors and their  right to enjoy the retirement funds that they have worked so hard to  earn. I also support regulators and law enforcement in holding  fraudsters who prey upon the elderly accountable.   It is for all these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Senior Security Act of 2021.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), who is a sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Vicente Gonzalez).  [[Page H1913]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1565 will help our financial regulators better  protect our Nation's seniors and the retirement funds they spent their  entire lives building. I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for  senior investors and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1865.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
