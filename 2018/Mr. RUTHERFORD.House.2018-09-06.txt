 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our United States  Navy's chief petty officers and their families and loved ones who are  gathering today at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena and Wall  for CPO Pride Day. This annual event celebrating their service is held  in different regions across the country, and I can tell you, it holds  significance for me.   Mr. Speaker, my father, James A. Rutherford, was a young sailor who  was deployed abroad on the USS Waccamaw the day I was born in September  of 1952. He proudly worked his way through the ranks to later attain  the position of chief petty officer.   Like so many military families both then and now, my father and other  CPOs sacrificed a great deal to defend our freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, chief petty officers are the backbone of the Navy,  responsible for training junior officers. They lead a division of  sailors and petty officers and inspire them to be part of something  bigger than themselves.   North Florida is incredibly proud to be home to so many sailors and  their families, and our community gratefully celebrates chief petty  officers today, for we owe them a debt of gratitude that can never be  repaid.   Congratulations and best wishes to them on this CPO Pride Day.                            ____________________
