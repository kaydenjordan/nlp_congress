 Madam President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a  question?    Madam President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a  question?    Madam President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a  question?    Madam President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a  question?    Madam President, will the Senator from Ohio yield for a  question?    Thank you, Madam President.   I say to the Senator, I appreciate what he is doing. I am a supporter  and one of the cosponsors of his bill. This fentanyl problem is just  devastating communities all over the country, including in my State of  Florida.   What was surprising to me to find out was that fentanyl is so much  more addictive and so much more lethal than so many others of these  drugs that ultimately lead to a person becoming addicted so badly that  they just crave fentanyl.   I appreciate very much what he has spoken about and given leadership  to. I just want him to know there are a lot of us who are trying to  raise the flags of awareness of this situation before it is too late.    In passing, I would say to the Senator from Ohio, what  was so surprising to me was, just a few grains of this deadly drug,  just by being touched by someone, is absorbed into the system through  the skin, and it can be lethal--just that innocent act of touching a  few grains. So, indeed, we have to get our arms around this problem.
