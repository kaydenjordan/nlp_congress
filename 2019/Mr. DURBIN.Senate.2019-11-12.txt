 Mr. President, I was honored today to attend the second  hearing I have attended in the Supreme Court of the United States. If  you stand right here on the floor of the Senate and look east through  these glass doors, you can almost see the Supreme Court buildings  directly across the street. The Supreme Court is, many times, the last  stop when it comes to human rights and civil rights. After all the work  that has been done by the Congress, by the President, many times, it is  the Supreme Court that has the last word.   In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, when the Supreme Court held that  segregation was constitutional, that last word was a disappointment.  And Korematsu v. The United States, when the Supreme Court upheld the  internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, that was another  disappointment.   But other times, the Supreme Court has risen to the challenge: The  famous case of Brown vs. Board of Education, which finally struck down  the concept of separate but equal; Obergefell vs. Hodges, where the  Supreme Court recognized the right to marriage equality.   Well, today, the Supreme Court faces another human rights issue  involving another group. Just a few hours ago, the street between the  Capitol and the Supreme Court was literally filled with thousands and  thousands of demonstrators. The issue before the Court today was the  fate of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.   This measure, DACA, is one that I have worked on for many years--many  years. Nineteen years ago, I introduced the DREAM Act. Before that, the  term ``Dreamer'' was hardly ever applied in the conversation about  immigration, but now, it has become standard and really defines this  group of Americans, people living in America.   In their case, they came to the United States, brought here by their  parents, when they were children. They may have had legal entry into  the United States, but at some point in their lives, they no longer  were legal. They became undocumented, in the words of the law. Most of  these young people never knew that status until they reached their  teenage years and their parents finally told them the truth of their  legal condition.   They had no control over the decision of their parents to come to  this country or file the necessary papers. Frankly, many of them were  shocked to learn that they were undocumented. They went to school with  our kids. They grew up in our communities.  [[Page S6495]]  They played on the sports teams. They probably attended the same  churches and temples and synagogues as our own kids. They were just  part of the group. But they knew--they privately knew they were not.  They knew that they were one knock on the door away from being deported  from the United States.   It was because of one of these young people that I decided to  introduce that DREAM Act legislation 19 years ago. Her name is Tereza  Lee, brought to the United States at the age of 2 from Korea by her  parents to Chicago. She grew up in a family that struggled to make ends  meet. Her father wanted to be a minister, but never quite put that  church together. Her mother worked in a dry-cleaning establishment to  feed the family. She went to public schools, and as luck would have it,  there was a program at one of these schools called the Merit Music  program that gave her a chance to learn how to play the piano.   She started playing, and she followed her father around to these  churches. Then she took it seriously, and she became an amazing pianist  to the point where, when she finished the public high school, she was  offered an opportunity to go on for music education at the Manhattan  Conservatory of Music. When she filled out her application and reached  the point where they asked her nationality and citizenship, she asked  her mom: What am I supposed to put on here? Her mom said: I am not  sure. We better call Senator Durbin's office.   They did, and we checked the law, and the law is very harsh. For  Tereza Lee--who had lived 15 or 16 years in the United States, beat the  odds by finishing high school and developing this great talent at the  piano--the law told her that she had to leave the United States for 10  years and apply to return. That is the law.   It seemed unfair to me that a young woman, brought here at the age of  2, should face that as her only legal choice, so I introduced the DREAM  Act. It said, if you were brought here as a child, raised in the United  States, went to school, and had no criminal record of significance,  that you should be given a chance--the chance to make it in the United  States to earn your way to legal status and citizenship.   That is what the DREAM Act was all about. We passed it in the House  and in the Senate, but never in the same Congress, so it is still not  the law of the land. It was 8 years ago when I appealed to my former  colleague in the Senate, Barack Obama, as President, to try to help,  and he did.   By Executive action, he created DACA, which said that young people  like Tereza Lee could apply, go through a criminal background check,  fill out the necessary forms, pay the filing fee, and be allowed to  stay in the United States for 2 years at a time, renewable, not to be  deported, and be able to legally work.   After President Obama came up with DACA, over 780,000 young people  came forward and became protected by DACA. It really changed their  lives. For the first time in their lives, they had some government- recognized status. They were no longer just undocumented. Then amazing  things happened. They went on and pursued an education, a career, a  life, a future. They started realizing their dreams. It was a good and  positive thing all around.   Then, President Trump came into office. Initially, he was very  complimentary of Dreamers, saying positive things about them, but,  unfortunately, over a period of time he changed his attitude about this  issue. On September 5, 2017, President Trump announced he was going to  end the DACA Program, end the protection for these young people.   It was a sad day and a challenge for us to decide what to do, to try  to pass legislation in the Congress that would protect these young  people, and we rolled up our sleeves and put together several  bipartisan measures in the Senate. President Trump rejected every  single one of them. He wasn't going to have it. He was opposed to our  enacting legislation that dealt with it.   That repeal of DACA has created uncertainty for hundreds of  thousands. A lawsuit was filed in an effort to try to protect them, and  the courts said their protection would continue while the case was  being argued. The case worked its way through the courts and ended up,  this morning, at the U.S. Supreme Court across the street.   I was proud to lead 172 current and former Members of Congress on a  bipartisan amicus brief in support of DACA. Now it is clearly up to the  Justices in the Supreme Court to follow the law and to reject what I  consider to be President Trump's illegal repeal of DACA, but only  Congress can provide a permanent solution for Dreamers.   The U.S. House of Representatives has responded to President Trump's  cruel decision to repeal DACA by passing the Dream and Promise Act on a  strong bipartisan vote of 237 to 187. This legislation is based on the  DREAM Act I originally introduced 19 years ago. This bipartisan  legislation would give Dreamers a chance to earn their citizenship. The  bill passed the House. It is here. It is now up to Senator Mitch  McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, to call the Dream and  Promise Act for a vote in the U.S. Senate.   Mr. President, I want to make a unanimous consent request in relation  to that measure and ask for a consent after we debate my UC request to  complete my remarks. I see a Senator on the floor who I believe is here  to object. I want to be courteous to her because she has been in the  Chair for a while. Can I have a unanimous consent to return to the  debate after I make my unanimous consent request?    Mr. President, for clarity, I ask unanimous consent to  bring to the floor the Dream and Promise Act for a vote in the Senate-- a measure which would address the very issue that is before the Supreme  Court today. I am making this on behalf of Senator Schumer, Senator  Leahy, Senator Rosen, Senator Tim Kaine, Senator Menendez, and Senator  Cardin.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 112, H.R. 6;  further, that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon table, with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, for the record, how many pieces of  legislation did we consider in the Senate last week? None. The week  before? None. How many months has this measure been sitting in the  Senate, the Republican-controlled Senate? Five months, and for five  months the Republican leader has not considered it worthy to even bring  it before the Senate for debate.   I don't control the agenda. Senator McConnell does. He has decided  this measure is not worth debating on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   When I come and make a unanimous consent request to bring this  measure to the floor, it isn't as if we are taking away an option,  which the Republican leader is using. He is not. When we look back to  the debate or at least the effort to find a compromise with President  Trump on this issue, it is next to impossible. He is surrounded by  people who are completely against DACA and Dreamers. Stephen Miller is  a good illustration of one. It used to be Jeff Sessions. He is no  longer with the administration. Every time the President starts to lean  toward DACA and the Dreamers, these people intervene and stop him, and  negotiations come to an end.   It is time for us in the Senate not to wait for a permission slip  from President Trump to pass legislation. I am prepared to bring this  matter to the floor and to accept the decision on the amendments on the  floor. We are in the minority. We will lose some of these amendments.  So be it. Let's let the Senate be the Senate and deliberate these  measures. To argue that I shouldn't be asking to bring it to the floor  because it has to go through regular order, the obvious question is:  When is Senator McConnell going to pursue regular order on a measure  that has been sitting here for 5 months?   Let me say a word, if I can, while we are on the subject, about the  people who are involved. We can talk about Senate procedure and law all  we wish, but what we should do is discuss the real people who are  involved.   In 1,000 days in office, this President has issued 11,000 tweets. No  surprise, is it? There are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 a day. He issued one this  morning about the young people who are in question here. I would like  to read President Donald Trump's tweet from this morning, as the case  was headed to the Supreme Court. Here is what he tweeted:         Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far       from ``angels.'' Some are very tough, hardened criminals.       President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order, but       would anyway. If Supreme Court remedies with overturn, a deal       will be made with Dems for them to stay!    May I address one particular aspect of the tweet of the President of  the United States on this subject affecting the fate of 780,000 young  people living in the United States? Probably the best thing is not to  do it generically but to talk about specifics.   Let me tell you a story about two DACA recipients, both attending  Loyola University in Chicago--the city I am honored to represent. They  both came to Washington, DC, today, and sat in the Supreme Court during  the argument. I am going to leave it up to my Members and colleagues in  the Senate, as well as those who are following this debate, to reach  their own conclusion about these two whom I am about to tell the story  of. You decide whether this man is a tough and hardened criminal. His  name is Cesar Montelongo. He grew up in the State of New Mexico. He was  a pretty good student. In fact, he was an excellent student. He  graduated from high school with a grade point average of 4.0 and ranked  third in his class. He went on to New Mexico State University, where he  was a triple major in biology, microbiology, and Spanish, as well as  two minors in chemistry and biochemistry. Cesar graduated with a 3.9  GPA.   This hardened criminal then went on to earn a master's degree in  biology, with a minor in molecular biology, while working as a teaching  assistant. Then DACA came along. For the first time in his life, he had  a chance to apply for medical school. He never thought that could  happen. He applied and was accepted at Loyola University's Chicago  Stritch School of Medicine. It is quite an achievement.   The Presiding Officer, who is also a medical doctor, I am sure  understands that, but he did one better. He enrolled in the M.D.-Ph.D.  program at Loyola University. He was just in my office upstairs, and he  told me that in a matter of 2 or 3 years, he will have completed his  Ph.D. in microbiology, and then he can go on to complete his medical  degree and his residency.   This tough, hardened criminal--according to the President--has  designs on becoming a medical researcher in the United States of  America. When he completes this highly competitive program, he will  have a medical degree and a doctorate degree in science.   He is one of dozens of DACA recipients at the Stritch School. My hat  is off to Loyola University. They have admitted more DACA students to  their medical school than any other medical school in the United  States. They are amazing students. I have met them. Many, if not all of  them, have promised to come back to my State of Illinois, having had  this chance to go to medical school in Chicago, and serve in  underserved areas after they have become practicing doctors. Loyola  doesn't give them any special treatment in the selection process. They  are not eligible for any Federal financial assistance.    I just want to thank them and say to the President of the United  States: Before you put out a tweet calling Cesar Montelongo or people  like him hardened criminals, Mr. President, take a minute and meet  these young people.   While you are at it, meet this young lady too. She was just in my  office. Her name is Fernanda Herrera Vera. When she was 2 years old,  her family brought her from Mexico to the United States. When she was  7, her family was forced to leave Guntersville, AL, when her father  lost his job due to his immigration status. The family settled in  Gadsden, AL, where Fernanda attended a private Catholic school on a  scholarship.   When she was 10, her parents opened a restaurant. Every day after  school, she went to the restaurant to wait tables and help run the  restaurant, doing her homework in her spare time. During Fernanda's  junior year of high school, Alabama passed the harshest anti- immigration law in the country, which forced her family to close down  their restaurant.   Alabama barred Dreamers from attending even public colleges, but  thanks to DACA, Fernanda was able to attend a private school, Samford  University in Birmingham, AL. Her parents worked hard to pay tuition.  She qualified for no Federal financial assistance. Her dad worked 80  hours a week at a chicken plant so that she could go to college. She  graduated from Samford in 2017, and her experience has driven her to  become an immigration activist. She worked at the Alabama Coalition for  Immigrant Justice.   After President Trump repealed DACA in 2017, Fernanda came to  Washington for a 4-day hunger fast with other DACA recipients on the  Capitol lawn.   Last year, Fernanda was admitted to the Loyola University Chicago  School  [[Page S6497]]  of Law. But this spring, her mother was pulled over in Georgia for  driving with a broken taillight. Her mother is now in deportation  proceedings.   It is tough enough to go to school without Federal financial help. It  is tough enough to work your way through it. It is tough enough not to  know how the Supreme Court is going to rule tomorrow or the day after  and whether it will change your fate. It is tough enough to know that  any knock at the door could mean deportation for members of your  family. Yet she has persevered.   A hardened criminal, Mr. President?   Fernanda's dream is to become an immigration lawyer. She wants to  help people just like her mom.   Without DACA, Cesar Montelongo will not become a doctor. Fernanda  Herrera Vera will not become an attorney. Will America be a better  country if they are forced to leave, if they are deported? I don't  think so.   Cesar, Fernanda, and hundreds of thousands of other Dreamers are  counting on the Supreme Court to do the right thing and reject  President Trump's repeal of DACA. They are also counting on those of us  who serve in the Senate to stop making excuses and solve this crisis.   A bill has passed the House. I tried to bring it to the floor of the  Senate, and there was an objection today. It isn't because we are  overwhelmed with work. As you can see, we spend a lot of time making  speeches.   Since Senator McConnell refuses to take any action to address the  plight of the Dreamers, I am going to continue to make this unanimous  consent request. Next week, I don't want the excuse to be that we are  not following regular order, but in the meantime, I hope the Senate  Judiciary Committee will take up this measure, as they have so many  times over the last 15 years or so, and bring it to the floor of the  Senate.   Once and for all, could we be the U.S. Senate for a week? Could we  actually consider a piece of legislation here that addresses an issue  that is critically important to hundreds of thousands of people living  in the United States of America?   What a relief it would be to see this Senate actually as a Senate, to  see Members on the floor debating issues. I am not going to win every  debate. Every amendment I want is not going to pass, but I am prepared  to accept the outcome. Let's do what the Senate was elected to do.   I am sorry there was an objection today. As long as I am a U.S.  Senator, I am going to continue to come to the floor of the Senate to  advocate for Cesar, Fernanda and all of the Dreamers. It would be an  American tragedy to deport these two promising young people.   Now it is in the hands of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican  majority leader, to give the Dream and Promise Act a vote and to say to  those 780,000 who do not know what their future will be just days or  weeks from now that there is an answer: We want you to be part of  America.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Rhode Island  (Mr. Reed), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, on behalf of the corn and soybean  farmers in my State, I object to ``small refinery relief language'' in  the fiscal year 2020 Interior appropriations bill that suggests that  the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, disregard Department of  Energy determinations on small refinery hardships. The provision  encourages EPA to continue allowing refiners to stop blending biofuels  with no transparency or evidence of hardship.   Fourteen years ago in this Chamber, I helped enact the renewable  fuels standard, RFS, which required petroleum-based vehicle fuels to  include a minimum volume of ethanol and biodiesel in them. Both fuels  are produced from corn and soybeans, driving economic activity  throughout Illinois and the Midwest.   The law has been a tremendous success. We have created new markets  for corn and soybeans and helped supply motorists with affordable fuel.  We have provided a greener alternative to MTBE and other additives. And  now the United States is the world's largest producer of ethanol,  generating commerce and creating jobs, both on and off the farm.   In fact, I can hardly think of a national policy in this generation  that has achieved greater success for rural economic growth than  biofuels. In the wake of the gasoline shortages of the 1970s, the farm  financial crisis of the 1980s, the clean air discussions of the 1990s,  the oil price spikes of the 2000s, and rural economic conditions of  today, biofuels became part of the solution. For more than 40 years,  farmers and policymakers built an industry unique to the heartland of  this country.   Yet in just 2 years, President Trump has wrestled American biofuels  to its knees. He singlehandedly has delivered one crippling blow after  another. Each action he has taken contributes to the gradual  dismantling of this enterprise. With his involvement, or outright  neglect, ethanol prices, profits, and blending are the lowest in  history, and thousands of rural jobs have been lost.   The President claims his support for ethanol and biodiesel is strong.  I say: believe it when you see it. Because when this President issues  declarations of victory on biofuels, facilities stay shuttered and the  markets stay stalled.   Congressional frustration on this topic is bipartisan and growing,  although some farm State lawmakers and interests still stare at their  shoes while a President who shares their political affiliation burns  this industry to the ground. Long after the alarm bells were ringing  and klaxons were sounding, those who should have known better at the  outset, whose earlier responses were accolades, now find themselves at  path's end, hoodwinked.   As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I pressed the EPA to  approve E15, a 15 percent blend of ethanol in gasoline, for year-round  sales as soon as possible. And I applauded that final decision in June.  For Illinois, E15 could boost 14 ethanol facilities and 20,000  downstate jobs. For motorists, E15 could save up to 10 cents per  gallon.   But pull back the curtain, and the President has allowed EPA to issue  85 secret waivers that allow oil refineries to stop blending biofuels  into gasoline. Economists have confirmed that shatters demand for E15.  Waivers mean that E15 is a fake victory by President Trump.   After increasing pressure and outcry, on October 4, President Trump  publicized an agreement ostensibly designed to restore the lost ethanol  demand caused by his waivers back to the 15 billion gallon floor--even  16 billion gallons, claimed the President. Ten days later, the Trump  administration stunned observers by publishing details that watered  down these numbers and slashed the ethanol deal by half, while  stakeholders were coached that nothing has changed.   The language in the Interior appropriations bill suggests that EPA  continue to thumb its nose at corn and soybean producers while issuing  small oil refinery waivers. Meanwhile, Big Oil is doing just fine. In  May, the Department of Energy reported that net income for top U.S. oil  companies like Exxon and Chevron has totaled $28 billion, the most  profitable in five years. For farmers, however, net income has  plummeted 50 percent from its record highs during the Obama  administration.   For years, farmers and policymakers of multiple backgrounds and  persuasions have come together, in good faith, to carefully build a new  industry that benefits consumers, farmers, and rural residents. This  pioneering innovation is rooted in the heritage of rural values, all in  jeopardy of crumbling because the void between this President's words  and acts.   I urge my colleagues to work to support rural America by ending EPA's  efforts to issue these waivers without any concern for transparency or  economic impact.
