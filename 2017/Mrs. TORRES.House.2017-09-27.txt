 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the DREAMers, and  I urge the passage of H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of 2017.   I know what it is like to leave your country of birth as a child  through no choice of your own, and I know that those kids have grown up  to become just as American as each and every one of us here.   Despite what their immigration status might say, this is their  country; this is their home. We cannot stand by and allow their lives  and well-being to be put in jeopardy. The country is on their side.  Don't let petty politics get in the way of good policy.   The DREAMers are courageous young men and women who came forward to  register in the DACA program, and now they are more vulnerable than  ever. Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to support H.R.  3440. The clock is ticking. We must act to protect the DREAMers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is a country that was built on dreams.  Our country was founded to protect not just the right to life and  liberty but also to pursuit of happiness.   Sadly, the dreams of the thousands of young DREAMers who were brought  here as children have been put on hold by President Trump's decision to  end the DACA program and Congress' inaction to pass the Dream Act.  These young DREAMers have created a life for themselves here in the  U.S., and many know no other home other than the U.S.   Today, I want to tell you about one special DREAMer from my district.  Jose is an extremely intelligent young man. He works 6 days a week and  still finds time to volunteer in his community. His parents,  unfortunately, did not tell him that he was undocumented, in an effort  to protect him. He didn't find out about his status until it was time  to apply for college. He was extremely upset, but he didn't give up.  His dream is to go to college and study business. He has so much to  contribute to our country.   These young people have become part of the American quilt, a quilt  that reflects the diversity of our history, our  [[Page H7546]]  culture, and heritage of this great country. We can't just throw them  and toss them out of our Nation.
