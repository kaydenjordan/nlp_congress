 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a  citizen of the great State of Washington, to share her story and to,  once again, urge my colleagues to make it a priority for this Congress  to end the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women.   Ruthie Kindness, a native woman of the city of Parkland, turned 31  just last month. Unfortunately, for her family and her loved ones, they  spent her birthday just as they have over the last 10 years, without  Ruthie, with no idea where she is, or even if she is alive.   Ruthie disappeared on February 7, 2011. For over a decade, her family  has gone without answers, and little progress has been made in the  investigation.   Ruthie's story is unacceptably commonplace for our tribal  communities. She is one of nearly 6,000 women, Madam Speaker, that we  know of who have been a victim of this crisis.   Native American and Alaska Native women face a murder rate that is 10  times higher than the national average. Many of their cases go  unresolved for years or even decades, as with Ruthie's case.   We made critically important strides in addressing the crisis when  President Trump signed Savannah's Act and the Not Invisible Act into  law just last year. But Ruthie and the thousands of women whose cases  remain unresolved underscore that our work here is not yet finished.   The life of Ruthie Kindness matters. Her family's grief matters. The  hole left in her community by her disappearance, that matters. Finding  answers for them, delivering justice for Ruthie, and ending this threat  for indigenous women once and for all, that matters.   I call on each and every Member of this body to join me in renewing  our commitment to our Native communities, and to delivering a lasting  solution to protect these women from the disproportionate rates of  violence that they suffer.   If anyone has any information about Ruthie's disappearance, please  call the  [[Page H4562]]  Auburn Police Department at (253) 931-3080. Together, we can deliver  justice for Ruthie and for the thousands of indigenous women who have  been victims to this crisis.                            ____________________
