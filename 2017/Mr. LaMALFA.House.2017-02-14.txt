 Mr. Speaker, you know when we swear to uphold an oath to  our country and to our States, a lot goes with that responsibility. We  have a very sacred covenant in protecting private property rights, the  cornerstone of the founding of this Nation.   So to see that after many decades or even centuries of people feeling  secure in their property, in their land, how can one government agency  come along and defy two entire States in a process they have used, the  gradient boundary survey method, in this case, along the Red River  between Texas and Oklahoma? How can you have one rogue Federal agency  coming in and saying we supersede what these two States and decades and  decades of tradition and security that these families have had along  here is completely wrong?   That is why H.R. 428 would send the right signal and give certainty  back to these families. We are talking about a court process. Well, for  private parties to have to go to a court, it is not the same as the  government with its endless resources, endless time to slog through  court in this case after 8 years. This is a lot of wear and tear on  families when their property and their longtime traditions are in  question here.   I go back to a case some years ago, the Kilo v. New London decision,  where it was deemed that government can just take property if it was  deemed beneficial to the government or to the tax base, indeed,  trampling on property rights. At least, in that case, you can count on  that there might be some compensation for having that land taken.   Will that even happen here? They are over a mile off in some of their  surveys where the BLM believes the land line is. So the true border  needs to be made certain and needs to be respectful of Texas and  Oklahoma in their process in this property right discussion.   Indeed, an 8-year-long nightmare, imagine what this does to families.  It happens in my district as well when regulators come in and decide  they are going to change the water rights. It is not even good for  their health. People, when they are going through this legal process,  it is painful for them.   So H.R. 428 is a very important method of doing, through the gradient  boundary survey, a fair way--one that is recognized by Texas and  Oklahoma for many decades as the correct way--to survey and finally put  this issue to rest after many, many more years than what it should have  been.   Indeed, private property rights are the cornerstone of part of why  this country was even founded. Why do we continue to do this to the  families who have, in good faith, paid taxes, made their land payments,  and been part of the fiber of Texas and Oklahoma around the Red River  for so many, many years?                                time  1530    Instead of confusion, let's give them certainty. I urge us to all  support H.R. 428 and go to a survey method that is fair and recognized  by two States, not by one Federal agency that wishes to override that  process.    Mr. Speaker, well, it has been national news, the  situation going on in northern California, where the Oroville Dam is.  Obviously, there has been some damage and destruction to the main  concrete spillway, as well as the situation with the lake rising and  finally going for the first time in 48 years over the emergency  spillway.   The dam itself, the earthen structure, 770 feet tall is solid. The  emergency spillway is being evaluated, but so far it looks stable  itself. It is the issue of the soil in front of it that needs to be  stabilized during these days where there is dry weather, where it can  be stabilized with rock and concrete.   So what we need to know is: Why did this happen?   This would be what we do later on. First, we need to take care of the  emergency situation, the State resources and Federal resources pulling  together to make sure people are safe and that the dam remains sound  and that we don't lose the structure.   It looks good. I think things are stable for right now. We also need  prayer for no more rain for a while, or at least not overwhelming  amounts of rain. So it looks good.   We just need patience also from the people that are in the flood  plain that have been evacuated to listen to their emergency personnel  and follow with that so that they are kept safe during this time of the  emergency.   So I think good efforts are underway, and we will investigate later  on what went wrong.                            ____________________
