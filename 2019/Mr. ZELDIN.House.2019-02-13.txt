 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. Cole's  amendment so that the House may take up H.R. 336.   The House should immediately bring this legislation up, which is a  bipartisan legislative package that would help others fight back  against the BDS movement, protect U.S. security in the Middle East by  strengthening our alliances with Israel and Jordan, and sanction bad  actors like Assad.   The Senate version of this bill, S. 1, passed with strong bipartisan  support, 77-23.   The major point of contention for some, regarding this package, is  the Combating BDS Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill with over 100  cosponsors last Congress, that would help stop the BDS movement.   It is okay to have a reasonable, legitimate concern with any  government, including Israel, as well as our own, but, keep in mind,  the founder of BDS was blatantly anti-Semitic, and, on college campuses  all across our entire country, we have college students who are being  targeted by blatant anti-Semitism in the name of BDS.   The founder of the BDS movement was a raging anti-Semite, who once  said: ``We are witnessing the rapid demise of Zionism, and nothing can  be done to save it, for Zionism is intent on killing itself. I, for  one, support euthanasia.'' That is not all he has said.   This bill would simply allow State and local governments to have the  right to counter the BDS movement by ending contracts with companies  that boycott Israel. This bill does not impede the right of any  American to boycott or criticize Israel. Instead, this bill protects  States' rights to divest from countries that boycott Israel and from  lawsuits driven by the ACLU.   The BDS movement is designed to hurt Israel by encouraging companies  to boycott Israeli goods. The BDS movement is consumed by efforts to  delegitimize and demonize Israel.   Numerous incidents are highlighted in my resolution, H. Res. 72,  condemning this behavior. For example, at NYU, after the student  government passed a resolution supporting BDS, they had to close the  Center for Jewish Life in response to threatening Twitter posts by a  student who expressed ``a desire for Zionists to die.''   There are so many other examples on college campuses all across our  country. Where the BDS grows, anti-Semitism follows. Yet some Members  in the House openly support this movement. House Democrats are holding  up this major bipartisan legislation.   This bill would provide $3.3 billion in security assistance to Israel  and authorize the 2016 MOU to guarantee Israel's security for the next  10 years by providing advanced capabilities to protect our  greatest ally.    This bill strengthens Jordan's ability to promote regional security  and stability by enhancing Jordan's military capacity in the sale of  defense articles.   This bill also sanctions those who provide financial assistance or  support to prop up the Assad regime, which is responsible for chemical  weapon attacks in Syria.   Madam Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Cole for bringing this amendment,  and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman McCaul for yielding. I have  great respect for him, as well as our committee chair, Eliot Engel.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 37, directing the  removal of U.S. Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in Yemen.  One of the reasons why is because we aren't even engaged in hostilities  in Yemen.                                time  1445    The United States is not involved in any direct live fire exchanges.  Last November, the U.S. stopped aerial refueling of Saudi jets.   According to the Department of Defense, U.S. support to the coalition  is for defensive purposes only. It focuses only on helping minimize  civilian casualties, which means that this resolution, if passed and  implemented, will actually result in less food and medicine getting  into Yemen and more civilians dying, and the war will not end.   If anyone wants to propose a bill and pass one cutting off or  conditioning specified U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, they  have the ability to do so. That is not this bill.   What is also important is that there are a lot of freshman Members  here in this Chamber, and the fact that we are rushing this to the  floor so quickly without having a classified briefing for all of those  Members is also deeply unfortunate. That should take place before  passing this resolution.   Congress has many other ways to engage in oversight efforts for U.S.  security assistance with Saudi Arabia, including approving arms sales  and through appropriations.   Our assistance for Saudi Arabia started in 2015, when the Houthis  overthrew a legitimate government, backed by Iran. The Houthis fired  missiles against Saudi Arabia with support from Iran, and the U.S.  provided intelligence and logistical support in compliance with the law  of armed conflict.   Iran poses a massive geostrategic threat to Yemen and to the United  States and many of our allies. Iran is providing training and support  to the Houthi rebels, including supplying ballistic missiles that have  been fired into Saudi Arabia. In 2016, missiles were fired by Iranian- backed Houthi rebels at a U.S. Navy warship near the Bab el-Mandeb. If  Iran has the ability to cut off global shipping through the Strait of  Hormuz and el-Mandeb, it would have disastrous consequences.   If this resolution passes, we are emboldening Iran to continue their  nefarious ambitions in the region without restraint.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.J. Res. 37. I think Iran would endorse it.
