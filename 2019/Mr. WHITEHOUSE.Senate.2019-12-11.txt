 Mr. President, I rise again to call this Chamber to  wake up to the threat of climate change, and in this particular case,  to say about the Paris agreement and to say in chorus with literally  millions of Americans, we are still in.   In truth, America is still in the Paris agreement. When you look at  the States that are still in and will honor their commitments, when you  look at the cities that are still in and will honor their commitments,  when you look at the companies and the universities that are still in,  it is the vast majority of the entire American economy. Despite  President Trump's fossil fuel nonsense, we really are still in.   Last week, I traveled to Madrid with Speaker Pelosi and the  delegation of House committee chairs and climate leaders for the U.N.  Conference of the Parties--what is called the COP--to support the Paris  agreement climate goals. The mood in Spain was optimistic. There was a  somber confidence. The Trump administration, of course, has begun the  process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord.   That is an abandonment from our American tradition of international  leadership and adherence to higher ideals. It is abandonment of our own  national security imperatives and economy well-being. This abandonment  demeans the Nation that has from John Winthrop to Ronald Reagan called  itself a ``city on a hill.''   Our military well understands the national security imperative. Back  in 2013, Admiral Samuel Locklear, the commander of the U.S. forces in  the Pacific, warned that upheaval related  [[Page S6997]]  to climate change ``is probably the most likely thing that is going to  happen . . . that will cripple the security environment''--``the most  likely thing.''   He added, ``You have the real potential here in the not-too-distant  future of nations displaced by rising sea level . . . If it goes bad,  you could have hundreds of thousands or millions of people displaced  and then security will start to crumble pretty quickly.''   That command is still concerned about it. Preparing for these risks  was a centerpiece of a recent Indo-Pacific Command briefing I attended  at their headquarters in Hawaii.   To understand the threat to our economy, we need only ask our  government-backed mortgage institution, Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac  predicts that rising sea levels will prompt a crash in coastal property  values, greater than the housing crash that caused the 2008 financial  crisis. That warning by Freddie Mac is echoed by the biggest, most  important financial institutions in the world, both in the United  States in the Federal Reserve system and abroad.   The Bank of England, the Bank of France, the Bank of Canada, and  European Central Bank, are all warning of ``systemic'' economic risks  from climate change. ``Systemic,'' that is central banker speak for  something that poses a risk to the entire economy, perhaps from  stranded fossil fuel assets when the market for fossil fuel dries up,  perhaps from a coastal property value crash when flood risk becomes  uninsurable and properties unmortgageable.   Against this national security imperative and this economic threat,  the Trump administration leaving the Paris climate accord is a  historically dumb and destructive move, particularly from a guy-- Trump--who one decade ago called climate change ``scientifically  irrefutable,'' that is a quote. ``Scientifically irrefutable and its  consequences catastrophic and irreversible,'' that is a quote as well.   The Pelosi delegation--here we are at the COP25--included powerful  House chairmen, like Chairman Pallone and Chairman Grijalva, Chairman  Johnson and Chairman Castor and, of course, the most senior and  influential Democrat in America, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   Speaker Pelosi's presence at the COP resounded not only because of  her clout and standing, but because it signaled the broad, true  consensus of the United States of America in favor of climate action.  At the State level, at the city level, across the public, and in much  of corporate America, we are indeed still in.   Indeed, at the Madrid conference right now, as I give this speech,  are representatives for thousands of American businesses, investors  managing trillions of dollars, hundreds of American municipalities and  counties, top American colleges and universities, dozens of American  faith groups, America's largest healthcare organizations, and 20  American States and Tribes. Again, all told, it is the vast bulk of the  American economy, and it still is.   America, unfortunately, at least in Congress, has to fight our way  through a persistent blockade paid for by the fossil fuel industry.  Don't believe their happy talk about acting on climate. There is a  slogan that one of their trade groups has come up with. You see it at  National Airport. You see it on billboards. It is popping up  everywhere. The slogan is: ``We are on it.''   No, they are not. They are not even close to on it. In fact, they are  the opposite. They are on the wrong side. They are funding false  science denial and ridiculous amounts of simple political obstruction.  They are paying for that. The statements from their lips do not match  the expenditure of their funds. The expenditure of their funds is still  dedicated to their political apparatus of denial and obstruction.   Ultimately, however, we will prevail. The America that the  international community knows and counts on--the America of leadership,  the America of progress, the America of confidence, the America of  clean and green energy and innovation--that America will be back and  will prevail. ``Our commitment to take action on the climate crisis is  ironclad,'' said Speaker Pelosi in Madrid. It is. Soon enough, that  commitment will topple the castle of fossil-fuel-funded climate denial  and obstruction that surrounds us today here in Congress.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
