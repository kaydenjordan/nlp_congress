 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Equality  Act. America must live up to its values by treating everyone as equals  and ending discrimination once and for all.   The Equality Act is about making sure all Americans, regardless of  sexual orientation or gender identity, can participate in our society  without fear.   New Mexico is home to diverse religious and traditional communities  and has stood up for its LGBTQ population for a very long time. The  Equality Act allows us to adhere to our faiths, while prohibiting  harmful and isolating acts of discrimination against the LGBTQ  community.   No one should have to worry about being discriminated against when  interviewing for a job or struggling to find a healthcare provider that  will treat them.   Tomorrow morning, when I vote for the Equality Act, I will be proud  to stand with my colleagues, with New Mexicans, and with my daughter,  who is a proud LGBTQ American. The time for equality is now, and we  must pass the Equality Act to live up to our values.
