 Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention  Month. The CDC data shows that nearly 50,000 Americans died by suicide  last year--an increase of 2.6 percent nationwide.   Our veterans are at special risk. The risk of suicide for veterans is  57.3 percent higher than nonveterans, and 17 veterans are still lost to  suicide every single day. In the 21st century, four times more  servicemembers and veterans have died by suicide than have died in  military combat.   We can and must put an end to this crisis. We can do it with fast  access to care, innovative mental health services, and continuing to  strengthen the VA's partnership with our community-based organizations.   The Veterans Crisis Line plays a vital role in suicide prevention.  Veterans and their families can talk safely and anonymously with a  trained crisis counselor. This type of access is proven to save lives.   We have a sacred obligation to those who defended our country. In  this Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, please reach out to anyone who  you might think would be struggling. Remember, you can dial 988 on your  phone and press 1. Let me say that again. You can dial 988 and press 1  on your phone. You are not alone. We have access to help for you.                       Honoring William ``Bill'' Black     Mr. Speaker, the picture before you here is the Honorable  William ``Bill'' Black, who I served with in the State legislature. He  passed on September 9, and I wrote these words September 9 when I  learned God had called him home. He was a close friend and a mentor.   William ``Bill'' Black. You, my friend, could teach the unteachable  because you were truly a teacher. You always did it with respect. You  were a great orator. You could deliver the message that you wanted and  needed to convey that everyone who was listening could understand,  whether you were the most educated scholar or just an average person  from the street.   In your own words, you would always put the cabbage down where the  hogs could eat it. You did it through a story of life experience or a  story of someone else's life experience. You used your ability to  communicate to benefit your students, your constituents, and your  colleagues to make your community, your State, and your country a  better place.   As a legislator, you knew and understood that every word, dot, and  comma was important and would have an effect on generations to come.  Because of this, you stood boldly in the gap of what is political  gamesmanship and true statesmanship. Thank you for being the statesman  that you were.   Your tutelage, your ability to deliver your message through  communication, and your understanding of the legislative process has  made your community, your State, this country, and me a better person  because of who you were.   I will miss you, my friend. Thank you for all you have taught me. I  love you, William, and I will miss you so.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2795) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend and modify  certain authorities and requirements relating to the Department of  Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2795         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY CLARIFICATION OF                     LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR MEDICAL                     PROFESSIONALS TO PERFORM MEDICAL DISABILITY                     EXAMINATIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS UNDER PILOT PROGRAM FOR USE OF CONTRACT                     PHYSICIANS FOR DISABILITY EXAMINATIONS.         Section 2002(a)(4) of the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe,       M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of       2020 (Public Law 116-315; 38 U.S.C. 5101 note) is amended by       striking ``three years'' and inserting ``five years''.       SEC. 2. TWO-YEAR EXTENSION OF PERIOD OF APPLICABILITY OF                     CERTAIN RELIEF FOR RECIPIENTS OF DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE WHO ARE                     AFFECTED BY CLOSURE OR DISAPPROVAL OF AN                     EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.         Section 3699(c)(2)(C) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``September 30, 2023'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2025''.       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR                     EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OF DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 8117(g) of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``2023'' and inserting ``2028''.       SEC. 4. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HOUSING LOAN FEES.         The loan fee table in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by striking ``November 14,       2031'' each place it appears and inserting ``November 15,       2031''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  S. 2795.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2795, a bill that extends  VA's expiring authorities.   The Veterans' Affairs Committee works on an extender bill every year.  This year, it was introduced by my friends, Senators Tester and Moran.   The 2023 extender bill does three things.   It would extend VA's participation in the National Disaster Medical  System for 5 years. VA has a mission to protect veterans and staff and  support public health during disasters or emergencies.   Second, the bill would also allow medical professionals who are  contracted to perform veterans' disability exams to continue practicing  across State lines. Now, VA depends on the contractors to perform most  of the disability exams, and the contractors depend on this authority.  This bill would continue the authority for 2 more years.   Finally, the bill would continue to protect student veterans if their  school closed or gets disapproved under the GI Bill. It would also  allow the Secretary to restore the entitlement to education benefits  for 2 more years.   I support this legislation because it gives VA important tools to  take care of all of our veterans. Without extending these authorities,  serious impacts to operations might mean VA's ability to protect  Americans during disasters would be limited, veterans' claims for  disability compensation would grind to a halt, and student veterans  would be left out in the cold if they attended a college that closed  due to fraud or mismanagement. We can't let that happen.   I once again thank Senators Tester and Moran for working on this  legislation in the Senate, and I also thank Dr. Murphy for his work to  lead and champion the legislation here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2795, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), the author on our side of  this Chamber for this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, many people know that I was in the State  legislature prior to coming to Congress, I was a foreleader there and I  knew and could identify when, for some reason, whether it is leadership  on one side of the aisle or the other side of the aisle, who wants to  drag the debate out. So I am going to do whatever I can to help them  out here.   Some things that were claimed here--I think it is amazing that the  claims that actually cause fear through our Nation and through people  who are providing services--we are going to try to work every way we  can not to have a shutdown, but we have a responsibility, and that  responsibility is to pass a budget.   That is not what we were supposed to be debating here at this time,  but I am glad to do that. If you remember when we were working on the  cap, where we would increase the cap, I think the other side of the  aisle said we were going to cut benefits for veterans. Veterans were  scared all over the United States because they claimed we were going to  cut benefits for veterans.   Oh, and what happened?   I told that--not only I as chair, but the Speaker and others--we are  not cutting benefits for veterans. Okay.   Let's see what actually--if the shutdown occurs, what actually is  still covered at the VA? I think it is very important that the American  people know.   Healthcare will not be cut. It won't even slow down. Compensation and  pension benefits and processing of claims on appeals, they will still  be done. The Veterans Crisis Line, it is most important, and I know  both myself and the ranking member know it is vitally important to make  sure that those veterans--the veteran numbers right now are 17 per day  that are committing suicide--we want to make sure that is open.   Housing benefits for the homeless, open. National cemeteries and  burial services and benefits, still going to be done. Essential IT  functions, network data centers, cybersecurity operations, are still  all going to be done with VA. The Office of General Counsel is still  going to operate.   The financial accounting and debt management center, maintenance and  management of VA facilities, VA customer service operations, workforce  management for electronic health records, the modernization office, VA  appeal court operations, small and disadvantaged veterans business  support operations--all not cut. Why?  [[Page H4479]]    Because we have been working already with the Secretary of the VA to  make sure those services remain in place.   Are there certain things that will slow down, paperwork and things  like that? I hope we don't go into the shutdown, but those essential  services we are going to make sure are provided for our veterans. Why?   Because our veterans deserve it.   We want to make sure that we don't have fearmongering and concern in  that way.   I think there are people that should be concerned about a shutdown. I  am concerned about a shutdown. That is why we are going to be--and this  is very important for the American people to know--I know for a fact  that I am possibly going to be offering an amendment tonight somewhere  around 1 o'clock in the morning.   We are going to work through the day and through the night. We are  going to do it all this week to try to take care of the business of  this Nation. People should feel secure that we are.   That is not why we were here today. We wanted to talk about this bill  and the importance of it. Why?   Because these are essential services we must also pass by the end of  the month. As you can see, we are going to continue to do the work. We  are going to continue to work in this way, and I hope in a bipartisan  manner that we are.   We can go out and do press conferences and stand on this floor and  claim, oh, this isn't getting done or that isn't getting done. I  understand that. I have been around this process a long time. But  understand, we are here to do our job and we are going to do our job.   There are 435 Members in this Chamber, and all of them have opinions  and all of them have ideas.   You know what? We are doing a thing called regular order because many  people called for that.   You know what? There are two things in this life you should not watch  being made because it ruins the taste of both--sausage and law. Now we  are making law. We are coming together and running our heads together  and arguing and debating.   We are debating on our side of the aisle with our own colleagues, we  are debating on that side of the aisle with their colleagues, and we  are debating together to come up with the answers that we need to for  this Nation to do it right.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, may I request the time remaining for each  side?    Madam Speaker, I am so proud to be on this floor and for  what we do for the people, but it is interesting to watch the debates  that occur on this floor sometimes to try to stretch, as I said, and  draw things out.   I actually had the opportunity earlier this afternoon during 5-minute  speeches to talk about a friend of mine from the Illinois State  legislature who did this very, very well. He was a floor leader in the  State of Illinois. His name was William ``Bill'' Black. Bill was a  great orator, and he could talk on every issue.   I explained during that time that because he was an educator and then  the president of a community college, when he became a legislator, he  knew how to explain the issues exactly the way they needed to be  explained so that whether you were a scholar or just an average person  on the street, you could understand what was going on.   Basically, he used a good southern Illinois term that said he would  put the cabbage down where the hogs could eat it. Let me tell you, that  is what I would like to do.   As we have listened here, going off and leaving the bill we were  actually debating on, we have talked about everything that is going on  around here. I said earlier that it will continue to go on. Why?  Because we have been elected by the people to work through this  process. We are going to work through this process.   I hope that there is not a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, is this  the first time we have shut down? No, it is not. What we have to know  is that we want to make sure we are getting it right. The American  people want us to get it right.   What legislators discover once we are here, with the 435 districts,  what is happening in the ranking member's district, quite often his  people feel different than the people of the Illinois 12th District,  which I represent. They feel different because they come from different  cultures. It is our job to try to come up with something that is  balanced and that can actually operate this Nation the way we need to  have it operated.   Let me also say this: We also know that we can do a whole lot of  things at the same time. Right now we are working on appropriation  bills, and my colleague from the other side of the aisle said that we  have not passed an appropriation bill. Well, we actually had one  appropriation bill out, and there wasn't a single Democrat vote on it.  It is kind of interesting to watch on this floor when somebody claims  you haven't done anything. However, not a single vote came in from that  side of the aisle. As we are moving forward, though, we do have the 12  budget bills to move.   Now, will there be a CR? I don't know. Let me tell you the first  thing we are going to do is we are going to move rules because that is  what we do. We are going to move the rule, and we are going to have  debates. I thank the members of the Rules Committee who worked all  weekend long to try to make sure that through this process they are  crossing the T's and dotting the I's.   As I said in a speech on this floor earlier today, every comma, every  dot, and every word matters. Every comma, every dot, and every word  matters. Why? It matters because it is going to affect generations to  come. It will affect people next week, next year, and 10 years down the  road.   What we do here is serious business. I am getting concerned sometimes  that the only thing people want to see is the rhetoric back and forth  when they don't understand how much time we do  [[Page H4480]]  spend working across the aisle together to having successful pieces of  legislation that actually get things done.   We both knew, the Senate knew, with Senator Moran and Senator Tester,  that this piece of legislation that we are working on today needed to  be moved by the last of this month or these services would fail.  Rightfully so, in a bipartisan manner, we have and we will move this  tonight, and it will move on to the President so those vital services  are not removed or even say a flaw in them where a problem could  happen. Remember, all I said about the words and the dots and the  commas: They aren't just words; they affect people's lives. That is why  we have got to get it right, and we are going to work to get it right.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, but I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for the spirited debate. Once again, that is the rhetoric I  was talking about, to think that people on this side of the aisle don't  want to take care of our veterans and feed our veterans, don't want to  make sure that SNAP programs are passed and that those people in need  are taken care of, that is the rhetoric we have got to stop.   In this particular bill, this bill actually does provide and make  sure that we can carry on these three areas of service in the VA that  are vitally important. We want to make sure that our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle support this legislation. I will encourage mine. I  just heard the ranking member support and encourage his Members to  support this legislation as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to restrict the  Secretary of Agriculture from using taxpayer dollars to purchase  electric vehicles.   The American people have had enough of the Green New Deal mandates.  Families and farmers in my district, who fear the steady march of Big  Government, know that it is just the beginning before Big Government  makes it harder to purchase the vehicles you want to drive and that you  have to drive to operate your farms and businesses.   I have talked to car dealers in my district that are having a hard  time even moving electric vehicles off the lot. No one wants to buy  them. Not only do electric vehicles cost more than gas-powered  vehicles, but they also make us more dependent on global adversaries  for the lithium batteries it takes to run them.   Americans should not be forced to heel under the Biden  administration's push for this radical agenda.   There are better solutions. For instance, biofuels offer a tremendous  energy opportunity for our country that supports our farmers in the  fields and the consumers at the pump with cleaner and cheaper fuel.   The USDA should be supporting and uplifting American farmers, not  selling them out to please environmental activists. My amendment shows  that the people's House will hold the Biden administration accountable  to the people.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, first off, I have actually met with members  of the Auto Dealers Association who have tremendous amounts of EVs  sitting on their lots that they can't sell. Yet, we continue to push  from the Federal Government and from the Biden administration to try to  push that.   I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chairman, let me explain this. As I said, auto dealers  themselves, since we put this in place, cannot sell these vehicles. No  one wants them even if the government is trying to force us to take  them.   They are offering tax incentives. They are offering everything that  you think would drive somebody to purchase a vehicle they don't want.   We, as United States citizens, and my constituents and your  constituents, Mr. Chair, know and understand that we are consumers. We  kind of like this freedom thing we have in this Nation. We want to make  sure that that freedom works for us.   I am going to tell you, it is vitally important that our farmers have  vehicles that are affordable, that are reliable, and that they can do  the job of providing the food, fiber, and all of the things that we  require from our farmers to make sure that we can feed the world.   Mr. Chairman, if we continue down this path, it doesn't allow them to  do that. I encourage all the Members to support this amendment. I yield  back the balance of my time.
