 Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize a milestone achievement for a ministry in  my State. The Academy of Arts Ministries is celebrating its 50th  anniversary in South Carolina on January 8, 2021. This ministry has  trained thousands of students in the arts and sent them out in their  local communities to share the Good News about God through their art.   Its founder, Dr. Nicky Chavers, has dedicated the last 50 years to  giving young people a safe avenue to be creative through the Logos  Theatre, nation-wide traveling ministries, a professional film company  and more. The young people in my great state of South Carolina have  truly benefited from the sacrifices of Dr. Chavers and the entire team  at the Academy of Art Ministries.                            ____________________
