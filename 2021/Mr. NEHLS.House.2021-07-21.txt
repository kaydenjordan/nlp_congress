 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend for his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), my  great friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Jackson for his comments.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I will address tonight the many,  many serious issues facing our country: the unprecedented crisis at our  southern border; the highest inflation we have seen in 13 years; the  Democrats' out-of-control spending and tax increases; the Democrats'  undermining of the Hyde amendment; and the Democrats' defense of the  Communist Cuba regime.  [[Page H3797]]    It is important we discuss these issues as Republicans, because our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they just won't. We owe it  to the American people to do better than this; to ensure there is still  a country left when our children grow up.   The way the Democrats and the Biden administration are spending  money, and our open borders, should not just concern Republicans, but  every American. That is why I am proud of the way my colleagues and I  will bring these issues straight to the American people in the people's  House.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for their  participation tonight. I know that we don't have anyone else here, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
