 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening with a heavy  heart to honor the extraordinary life of Bernard Tyson, who passed away  on November 10 and whom, as we speak, the Bay area is paying tribute to  in a memorial in San Francisco.   Bernard Tyson was one of our Nation's most influential African  American CEOs and healthcare leaders, serving as the first African  American CEO of Kaiser, and transforming Kaiser's healthcare system  into a model for healthcare providers everywhere.   Bernard's tireless dedication to improving the quality of healthcare  was exemplified in his push to create a more accessible and affordable  healthcare system for all.   Throughout his life, Bernard sparked systematic change and  innovation, addressing inequities that disproportionately affect  communities of color.   He was a role model and mentor to so many African American young men,  including my son, Tony, who recently had lunch with him to discuss his  insights into the future of healthcare.   I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Denise, his entire  family, to our entire community, and the country.   We lost a warrior and a great humanitarian; but, as we mourn his  passing, let us celebrate his life and make sure that his legacy lives.   May Bernard rest in peace, and may he rest in power.                            ____________________
