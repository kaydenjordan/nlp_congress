 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Suffolk County  Police Officer Thomas Wilson.   In responding to a 911 hang up call, Officer Wilson came upon a  female victim with severe stab wounds and an armed assailant who  refused to surrender. Thanks to his quick and measured thinking, while  assuming clear risk to his own life, Officer Wilson was able to subdue  and arrest the armed assailant and provide lifesaving first aid to the  female victim.   His courageous actions have earned him the Silver Shield Award from  Suffolk County PBA, and he will soon receive the Combat Medal from  Suffolk County PD.   While this is an extraordinary act of heroism, those who know Officer  Wilson are not surprised. This is the same man who worked on the pile  in the aftermath of 9/11 for 350 hours and who has traveled to D.C.  dozens of times to fight for the Zadroga Act and to fully fund the 9/11  Victim Compensation Fund.   On behalf of our entire community and Nation, I thank Officer Wilson  for his continued service.                            ____________________
