 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the key to this amendment is just four  words: ``or across State lines.''   One of my cosponsors, Mr. Donalds--I guess it is like football  practice this morning--is absent.   This amendment prohibits Federal funds from being used to transport  illegal immigrants over the age of 18 across State lines except for the  purpose of removing the individuals from the country.   As it currently stands, the bill prohibits funds from being used to  transport illegal immigrants into the interior of this country but  fails to recognize there are already folks here illegally.   This amendment will cut wasteful and unnecessary spending of taxpayer  dollars. It will get the Biden administration out of the human  trafficking business. It will focus Homeland Security operations on  removing the people who enter our country illegally.   Mr. Chair, our border States have been overwhelmed by the Biden  administration's pro-illegal immigration agenda since he first came to  office. This amendment would help our border agents do what they are  supposed to do, and that is protect our border and deport illegal  immigrants.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we are leaving out a key element of this. I,  too, trust our Border Patrol agents. They are underpaid and overworked.  I do not trust this White House. This has four words added to it: ``or  across State lines.'' That is what is currently happening. It needs to  stop, Mr. Chair. That is the bottom line.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
