 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my bill, H.R.  3434, the Territories Health Equity Act of 2021.   This bill will address the existing inequalities the territories face  under Medicaid, Medicare, and other Federal health programs.  Importantly, regarding Medicaid, it would provide us with the equitable  share of Federal funding for Medicaid beyond the upcoming fiscal cliff  when much of the existing funding for the territories is scheduled to  expire at the end of September 2021.   In the midst of a global pandemic, with more Federal attention on how  healthcare funding disparities have had a deleterious impact on the  finances of local governments and hospitals throughout the country, we  believe this is an opportune time to press for equity in Medicaid and  Medicare.   The inequities in Federal funding provided to the territories for  Medicaid and Medicare have put access to affordable healthcare out of  reach for too many in the Virgin Islands and the other territories,  making our hospitals' emergency rooms the primary healthcare provider  for one-third of our population without health insurance, which  contributes to unmanageable costs. Please support H.R. 3434.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this amendment. This amendment proposes a  technical change in title 5 of this bill, the Disclosure of Tax Havens  and Offshoring Act, to simply clarify that a ``tax jurisdiction''  includes either a country or a jurisdiction that is not a country but  has fiscal autonomy.   My concern, as the bill presently states, is that certain words used  in that part of the bill will be highly  [[Page H2855]]  problematic to U.S. territories, including my district, and our efforts  to address very important tax policy issues that have arisen in the  last few years.   My amendment seeks to correct the bill's definition of a tax  jurisdiction by removing its words explicitly analyzing U.S.  territories without the United States. While these specific words  separating the territories from the rest of the United States would be  removed, the rest of the language would be left as it currently exists  in the bill: A ``tax jurisdiction'' would mean either a country or a  jurisdiction that is not a country but that has fiscal autonomy.   My concern is with the language to explicitly distinguish U.S.  territories from the sovereign United States in such a way.   First, it would be inconsistent with the current structure of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which this bill seeks to amend. Under  that law, each of the U.S. territories are defined and treated as  States.   Secondly, it would be contrary to the position that the United States  has taken in its deliberations with the European Union and the OECD in  response to blacklisting of U.S. territories in 2017 and 2018.   A letter from the Secretary of Treasury to the Council of the  European Union addressing this issue reads: ``The United States  disagrees with the Council's decision to consider U.S. territories  separately from the United States.''   It would be more difficult for the United States to make this  argument if legislation is adopted by Congress lending credence to the  argument that U.S. territories should be treated as tax jurisdictions  without the United States as a whole.   Importantly, treating the U.S. territories as separate tax  jurisdictions distinct from the sovereign United States would also be  inconsistent with efforts that U.S. territories have been making for  relief from tax increases intended for foreign tax jurisdictions that  were unfairly imposed on U.S. territories by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Lastly, I have concerns about the language at issue categorizing U.S.  territories as fiscally autonomous. They are, in fact, legally  possessions of the United States under the tax code to this day. One of  the U.S. territories is currently in a state of bankruptcy. The U.S.  Virgin Islands has no control over its income taxes and cannot sever  itself from the mirror code tax system of the United States, and has  extensive and longstanding written agreements in place with the IRS  requiring exchange of tax information.   Thus, all I have requested with this technical amendment is that the  bill language be slightly adjusted to remove words explicitly  referencing U.S. territories as tax jurisdictions distinct from the  sovereign United States. I believe this would be more fair to the  sponsors of this measure because it would in no way impede the effect  of its policy; the meaning of tax jurisdiction would remain as either a  country or ``a jurisdiction that is not a country but has fiscal  autonomy.''   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), the chairwoman of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, since I have assurances from both the  chairwoman and the committee that they will continue to work with us to  ensure that U.S. territories are not treated as tax havens but that we  are, in fact, individuals who intend and continue to intend, through  our governments, to pay our taxes to the Internal Revenue Service and  continue to be treated equitably as part of the United States, at this  time, I yield back the balance of my time and I withdraw my amendment.
