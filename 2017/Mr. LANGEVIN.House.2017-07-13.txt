 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a blatant attack on the use of  alternative energy by the Department of Defense. So we have existing  contracts right now for renewable energy, both liquid fuels and  electricity, at the Department of Defense, and this amendment seeks to  really pump the brakes on those policies and bury them in a web of  unnecessary requirements.   So requiring procurement managers to track all Federal subsidies and  tax credits would be a burden to the government, and requiring  suppliers to provide such information would be onerous, expensive, and  may, in fact, actually drive them away. Also, this will result in less  competition for contracts, and higher costs for the Department of  Defense. Ultimately, it is going to result in higher costs to the  taxpayer.   So most alarmingly, this amendment does not include any waivers for  times of emergency when a retail, time-sensitive purchase of readily  available alternative fuels might be imperative to completing the  mission, even if it is at a price point higher than the usual market  cost.   Mr. Chairman, it also does not provide consideration for renewable  energy projects for military installations that, although they might  not reduce costs, do have other quantifiable benefits that increase  combat effectiveness or enhance mission resiliency.   This amendment is also redundant. For bulk purchases, of which the  DOD has many, current law already prohibits the Department from an  alternative fuel purchase unless fully burdened cost is cost- competitive with traditional fuels.   Burying suppliers in these requirements is an unnecessary compliance  burden and could disincentivize some suppliers from doing business with  the DOD.   Finally, this amendment is opposed by the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Chairman, as I said, I believe this amendment would  significantly hinder the Department of Defense's ability to procure  energy, and I urge its defeat. As I stated previously, this amendment  is opposed by the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chair, this amendment would strike a provision that we have  already thoroughly debated and approved in a bipartisan fashion within  the Armed Services Committee. Section 336 acknowledges what Secretary  Mattis has already said and what we already know: that a changing  climate will affect our military's readiness and alter the threat  landscape for years to come, and that we must study these impacts to  prepare for them.   I cannot see the harm in gathering information and doing an  assessment. We already see the strategic implications of new sea lanes  being cut in the melting Arctic, where countries are seeking an  economic advantage. As we speak, along our coasts, rising seas are  affecting our naval installations, including at Naval Station Norfolk,  the home of the Atlantic Fleet.   The report required in section 336 is not about causes of climate  change, nor do we discuss specific emissions, targets, or green energy  goals. Instead, my section of the Armed Service Committee is very  factual. We focus squarely on the readiness of our Armed Forces to  combat the coming and existing climate threat, starting with a study of  the 10 most vulnerable bases in each service, and a report on how a  changing climate will affect combatant commanders' strategic battle  plans.                                time  1600    As Secretary Mattis has said, ``the effects of a changing climate-- such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels,  desertification, among others--impact our security situation.''   Mr. Chairman, we need to support our leaders in the military and  intelligence communities in addressing these concerns, so I urge defeat  of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Stefanik), who is my good friend and the chair of the  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Chairman, as we noted in our committee markup,  there would be nothing controversial about studying this threat and  being prepared to mitigate the risks. In fact, that is our  responsibility.   The support for this climate resiliency language was truly bipartisan  in  [[Page H5795]]  committee, and I hope we will send a strong message of support to the  servicemen and -women who will have to lead with the effects of climate  change by opposing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simply not necessary, as it is a  solution in search of a problem.   Now, the budget request for fiscal year 2018 has no funding for  reducing the level or reducing the number of deployed ICBMs below 400,  and there are no plans to do so in the future.   It also presupposes the completion of the nuclear posture review,  which is currently ongoing and is expected at the end of this year. So  instead of jumping the gun and acting precipitously, we should allow  the administration time to finish the review and base our actions on  its findings.   This is particularly true because it may be that reducing the number  of ICBMs and reducing alert levels could, in fact, be beneficial to  enhance strategic stability. Preventing such a reduction also  disregards the crucial and fundamental role of our Nation's submarines,  which provide an assured, survivable second-strike capability, and  which dissuades an adversary from thinking they could launch a  disarming attack against the United States.   ICBMs can be seen as destabilizing in that they would force a very  rapid decision by the President and are use-or-lose nuclear weapons.  History has shown us concerns about the potential for a rushed decision  in response to a false alarm that none of us wish to see repeated.   Mr. Chairman, if we are going to talk about keeping ICBMs, it should  be done in a meaningful, informed discussion based on the findings of  the Nuclear Posture Review instead of yet another annual amendment  driven by what seems like a parochial interest, which does not consider  the other legs of the nuclear deterrent.   Instead, we should focus on increasing accountability and ensuring  that we are improving the morale and culture inside the Air Force with  regard to nuclear weapons so that some of the serious and embarrassing  problems that have plagued the ICBM missileers and security forces in  recent years may be properly addressed.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the distinguished ranking member of the House  Armed Services Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I believe, as I said before, this amendment is an  unnecessary amendment. It does not meaningfully address the three legs  of the nuclear triad. Let's wait until the Nuclear Posture Review is  done and base our decision then on facts and not on speculation.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
