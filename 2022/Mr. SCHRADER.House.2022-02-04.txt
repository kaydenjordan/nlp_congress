 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the America  COMPETES Act of 2022.   This comprehensive bill tackles the challenges everyday Oregonians  face right now with supply chain and consequent rising consumer prices.  It is a huge investment in our competitiveness on the global stage for  the 21st century. It invests $45 billion to strengthen and improve our  supply chains while incentivizing manufacturing of critical security  goods that should be made right here in the United States.   As the pandemic has shown us, active ingredients of lifesaving  pharmaceuticals and PPE gear should not be all made overseas.   I am also glad that leadership included the $52 billion in emergency  CHIPS Act funding, a priority for my Problem Solvers Caucus and the  State of Oregon. Without this Federal investment, our semiconductor  problems would only grow worse. We will continue to see critical  shortages, hindering a wide range of industries in my district and  across the Nation. Passage here will strengthen our domestic supply and  lead to good-paying jobs for our citizens and companies as they move to  expand and set up our domestic manufacturing facilities.  [[Page H950]]    This bill contains bipartisan proposals to keep us innovating and  creating in critical industries and makes sure that the United States  is not at the mercy of a tenuous international supply chain.                            ____________________
