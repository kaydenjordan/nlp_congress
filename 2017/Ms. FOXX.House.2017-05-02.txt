The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 299, in lieu of  the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, printed in the bill, an  amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules  Committee Print 115-15 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is  considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 1180         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1180.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1180.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1180, the Working Families  Flexibility Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is about freedom, flexibility, and fairness.  The freedom for workers to choose what is best for themselves and their  families, more flexibility for men and women to balance work, life, and  family, and greater fairness in how Federal policies treat workers and  families.   Under the legislation, private sector workers who are eligible for  overtime pay would be able to choose between cash wages or paid time  off. This simple choice will help improve the lives of many hardworking  Americans.   This option has long been available to government workers. More than  30 years ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to amend an  outdated Federal law and provide public sector employees more workplace  flexibility.                                time  1545    That is why comp time is a popular benefit enjoyed today by police  officers, firefighters, and other State and local government employees.  But the Federal Government still denies many private sector workers the  same opportunity. This double standard simply isn't fair. It is time to  level the playing field for those in the private sector.   Despite what we will hear from the other side of the aisle today, all  we are doing is empowering workers with a choice. For some workers,  more money in the bank may be the best choice for them. Nothing--I  repeat, nothing--in this bill will take away that right.   But other workers, if given the choice, would seize the opportunity  to turn their overtime hours into paid time off. There are single  parents who need more flexibility to spend time with their children;  students who are struggling to juggle college and a full-time job; and  a growing number of individuals need more time to care for an aging  relative.   Time is precious, yet Democrats in Congress think the Federal  Government should decide how people use it. They think they know what  is best for workers and their families. In the name of protecting  workers, our colleagues and their so-called progressive allies have  denied workers this choice for years. They continue to ignore the  bill's strong protections, including several that are more robust than  what is available in the public sector.   The bill preserves the 40-hour workweek, and comp time would accrue  at the same time-and-a-half rate as cash wages. The legislation also  requires a written comp time agreement between each individual worker  and his or her employer, or between a worker's union and employer.   Additionally, workers can cash out their comp time at any time and  for any reason. Employers who force their employees into a comp time  arrangement would face costly penalties, and the Department of Labor  would have full authority to crack down on bad actors.   Mr. Speaker, by providing more freedom and flexibility, we can  improve the quality of life of many Americans. We have an opportunity  to make a positive difference in people's lives simply by getting the  Federal Government out of the way and allowing individuals to choose  what is best for themselves and their families.   I want to thank Representative Roby for championing this effort, and  I urge all Members to vote in favor of freedom, flexibility, and  fairness for the American people by supporting H.R. 1180.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Mrs. Roby), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chair of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, as well as a member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    I would like to ask the gentleman if he could point out in  the bill where you cede the power to the employer because that is not  in this legislation. I would love it if you would just point that out  to us in the legislation.    It is totally voluntary on the part of the employee.    It is totally voluntary on the part of the employee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, this bill strengthens protections for workers and  increases penalties for abuses. It contains strong anticoercion  provisions that would prohibit an employer from directly or indirectly  trying to intimidate or coerce workers.   Employers found to have coerced employees would be liable to the  employees for double damages. And all existing remedies, including  action by the U.S. Department of Labor, are available to workers if an  employer fails to pay cash wages for overtime hours.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot), the chairman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Mrs. Roby), the author of the bill.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take the gentleman's time to  explain where in the bill. It is section 4, and we will give you the  text of it. Give us a second.    How much time, Mr. Speaker, do I have?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman had asked a question, and we are  prepared to answer on his time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to point out a couple of things in response to some of  what our  [[Page H3046]]  colleagues have said. This bill is giving workers the freedom to  choose. I want to reiterate that.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always big on  giving women, in particular, the right to choose when it comes to  abortions. This gives women and men both a right to choose when it  comes to their time; and, to me, there is no more commodity more  precious to us than our time.   I also want to say that our colleagues have said there are no  meaningful rights that they don't already have. Well, Mr. Speaker, if  the workers in the private sector already had these rights, we wouldn't  be putting this law up for a vote.   Our colleague from Illinois, a few minutes ago, outlined all these  wonderful benefits that the public sector employees have, and she is  right. The private sector people would love to have the same rights  that the public sector people have that are paid for by hardworking  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We have heard from our colleagues that we are just not doing enough  for working people, and we have also heard from our colleagues that all  employers are evil people.   I tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is astonishing to me that we have as many  people working in this country as we do under all these evil employers.  They must have run into just the worst people in the world. I don't  ever run into people like that. Everybody I know that has employees is  cherishing them because they need them, and they treat them right.   They have often said there are other things that we can do. But, Mr.  Speaker, we have this bill in front of us, and it gives workers  something that our colleagues cannot give them: the freedom to choose  and to have more time.   Edward Everett Hale said: ``I am only one; but still I am one. I  cannot do everything; but still I can do something; and because I  cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can  do.''   That is what this bill does. Congresswoman Roby has introduced a  bill--and many people have signed on--that will do one thing for people  in the private sector. It will give them the same rights that people in  the public sector have, to turn overtime into comp time.   It is a pro-worker, pro-family proposal that will make a positive  difference in the lives of many Americans. The Federal Government  shouldn't stand in the way of more flexibility in the workplace.   Today we have a chance to empower single parents, moms and dads with  a newborn, students trying to earn a college diploma, and so many other  individuals who simply need more time to meet their needs.                                time  1645    We have heard a lot of excuses from Democrats today. It is the same  story we have heard for years in an effort to deny workers the freedom  to do what is best for them based on their own values. However, the  concerns we heard have been addressed. This bill provides very strong  worker protections to ensure the decision to choose comp time is  voluntary. It gives workers a choice and puts them in control of their  time.   Let's vote in favor of freedom and flexibility for American workers  today. Let's give private sector employees the same choice that  government workers have. Let's establish fairness in our Nation's  workforce policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to help more Americans balance the  demands of work and family by supporting the Working Families  Flexibility Act.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is  recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit.   For years, so-called Progressives have clung to outdated Federal  workforce policies from the 1930s. Why? They think government knows  what is best for hardworking men and women in this country. This is a  theme they abide by day after day.   This motion is just another attempt to deny workers the freedom to  decide what is best for them and their families. Once again, Democrats  are defending a double standard--yes, a double standard. They voted to  give government workers a choice on comp time. Why shouldn't those in  the private sector, those whose taxpayer dollars pay  [[Page H3049]]  the salaries of government employees, receive the same choice?   It is time to eliminate this double standard. It is time to modernize  our Nation's labor rules to meet the needs of the 21st century  workforce. It is time for greater freedom, flexibility, and fairness  for American workers.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and  ``yes'' on the Working Families Flexibility Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
