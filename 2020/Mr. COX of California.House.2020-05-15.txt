 Mr. Speaker, the working families of Central  Valley, and the 86,000 Americans who have died, don't have the luxury  of waiting for the White House, Leader McConnell, or my friends on the  other side of the aisle to sit around and let more Americans die or go  bankrupt.   The fact is, Democrats are showing leadership in a plan that puts  Main Street before Wall Street and takes care of the families who did  nothing to cause this crisis but are paying with their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can  recharge our efforts to test, track, and treat, which is the only way  to reopen our Nation safely.
