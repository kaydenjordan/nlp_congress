 Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Jones  amendment No. 1141, cosponsored by Senator McSally of Arizona. I want  to thank the Senator from Alabama for filing this important amendment  to preserve transit funding at the levels authorized by Congress under  the FAST Act. Without this amendment, transit agencies across the  country will face a 12-percent cut. A cut of this magnitude would be  devastating, particularly for smaller agencies that rely on Federal  funding to meet their annual operating expenses and to carry out  necessary maintenance. Without this funding, communities would be  forced to scale back capital projects and bus acquisitions, and reduce  services, eliminating a major mobility option for many of our  constituents, including seniors and persons with disabilities.   At a time when the transit industry faces a $90 billion state of good  repair backlog, we should be increasing transit investments in order to  preserve these critical transportation systems. These cuts would  reverse the progress we have made over the last 2 years due to the  budget agreement that allowed for desperately needed investments in  infrastructure. We must prevent any degradation of funding for our  transit systems and instead help these agencies modernize their fleets.   This amendment is supported by over 63 associations, including the  National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of the  supporting organizations be printed in the Record.

We all recognize  that it is their efforts that make these difficult and complicated  legislative initiatives possible. On the majority staff, I thank Clare  Doherty, Jason Woolwine, Rajat Mathur, Gus Maples, Courtney Young, and  LaShawnda Smith. On my staff, I particularly want to thank Dabney Hegg,  Christina Monroe, Jessi Axe, and Elisabeth Coats.
