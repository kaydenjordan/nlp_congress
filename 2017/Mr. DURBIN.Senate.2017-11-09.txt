 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business until 11:15 a.m.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about  Veterans Day, which is just 2 days away.   On Saturday, November 11, Americans will pause to honor the courage  and sacrifice of America's veterans. More than 40 million Americans  have served our Nation in uniform, in battles from Bunker Hill to  Baghdad, and beyond.   Mr. President, as this Veterans Day approaches, I have been thinking  about the words of one of those brave patriots. He is the son and  grandson of military leaders. When his time came, he too went to war  and suffered horrific deprivation and excruciating injuries.   Years later, he said: ``Few veterans cherish a romantic remembrance  of war.'' When wars are fought, he said, ``a million tragedies ensue.''   ``War is wretched beyond description,'' he added, ``and only a fool  or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel reality.''   Those are the words of a man whom I am privileged to call a colleague  and a friend, the senior Senator from Arizona, John McCain. We owe him  and all of our Nation's veterans and their families our profound  gratitude and respect for their courage, sacrifices, and  [[Page S7133]]  the hardships they endured for all of us.   Senator McCain endured more than 5\1/2\ years of torture as a  prisoner of war during the Vietnam conflict. When he finally came home,  John McCain found another way to serve our Nation with honor. We thank  him for that.   Mr. President, this week, the Congress dedicated a commemorative  chair to honor all Americans ever held as prisoners of war and to honor  the more than 83,000 servicemembers who remain missing in action.   The antique, empty chair will stand in Emancipation Hall in the  Capitol as a solemn reminder of the servicemembers who were missing for  years in captivity and those who remain missing today.   Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate this Veterans Day, I want  to tell you about another veteran, another patriot, who was also a  prisoner of war. His war was World War II.   Like Senator McCain, he survived, came home, married, raised a  family, and spent decades in public service. His name is Richard  Lockhart. Everybody calls him Dick Lockhart. He is 93 years old, almost  94. He is a lobbyist in Springfield, IL, the capital of my State and my  hometown.   Dick Lockhart does not represent the big, monied interests. He  represents the little guys--the nonprofit groups, the public workers,  the mental health providers and the families who need them, among  others.   He is the senior practicing lobbyist in Illinois, maybe in all of  America. He will be giving up that title soon because, on December 31,  Dick Lockhart is retiring at the age of 93 from the firm he founded 60  years ago. He is not stepping down because he is tired. He still works  7 days a week, most weeks. He is still physically strong and is as  sharp as a tack mentally. No, Dick Lockhart is retiring because there  are other things to do, he says. He wants to travel more and write the  book that he has always wanted to write and explain to ordinary  citizens how to make their government work better.   Dick's life would make a fascinating book, itself.   Born in Ohio in 1924 as an only child, his family moved to Indiana  when he was young. The Great Depression hit the Lockhart family hard.  Dick's dad lost his job. Sometimes the electricity was shut off at home  for nonpayment. The family never owned a car, never took a vacation,  and never ate a meal in a restaurant. Dick delivered newspapers and  worked as a soda jerk during high school to help pay for expenses.   He was a student at Purdue University when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.  Exactly 1 year later, on December 7, 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army  infantry.   He was assigned to the Army's 106th Division, the Golden Lions. In  October of 1944, the 106th shipped out to England. In early December  they arrived in a quiet area of southeastern Belgium, near the German  border. Military higher-ups assured the men of the 106th to expect an  uneventful few weeks and that Germany would probably surrender before  Christmas.   History had another plan.   In the predawn hours of December 16, German forces launched their  last major offensive of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. The U.S.  forces were outnumbered. Lockhart's regiment, the 423rd, fought for  days. Finally--out of food, out of water, and out of ammunition--they  surrendered.   In all, some 8,000 U.S. soldiers were captured at the Battle of the  Bulge.   They were packed into railroad boxcars, crammed in so tightly that  soldiers had to take turns sitting and standing. After 2 days of being  in those boxcars, they arrived at a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany,  known as Stalag IX-B.   Camp life was brutal. Medical care was nonexistent. Men died every  day. Meals consisted of only thin ``grass soup.'' On one bitterly cold  day, Dick Lockhart was beaten savagely by a German prison guard.  Decades later, he still experiences back pain from that beating.   One memory still haunts him.   One day, the prison guards demanded that any Jewish prisoners of war  identify themselves. For several hours, no one stepped forward. After  more threats, Jewish American soldiers began to step forward,  apparently thinking that their U.S. citizenship would protect them.  They were wrong. They were shipped off to a notorious hard-labor camp  in another part of Germany.   On January 20, 1945, Dick Lockhart turned 21 while a prisoner of war  in Stalag IX-B.   On April 2, 1945, American soldiers liberated the camp, Dick  Lockhart, and the other prisoners. The Army sent Dick Lockhart home on  a 60-day furlough with instructions to get some rest and to gain back  some of the weight that he had lost in the prisoner-of-war camp.   He arrived home in Fort Wayne. He knocked at the door and was stunned  to see a stranger open it. Months before, his parents had received a  cable that read that their only child was missing in the war and was  presumed dead. His mother, overcome with grief, went to Ohio to stay  with her family. His father moved away to look for another factory job.  Fortunately, they left forwarding addresses, and Dick found them soon  and was reunited with his parents.   A month later, while Dick was still on leave, Germany surrendered.  The war in Europe was finally over.   Dick had always loved Chicago. So he decided to use his GI bill to go  to Northwestern University. He became involved in reform politics in  Chicago--a battle of a different sort. He married and had two children,  a son and a daughter.   In 1958 he founded his own lobbying firm to try to advance democracy  through good policies and laws rather than through tanks and bombs.   He is honest, hard-working, modest, empathetic, and always an  optimist. He has earned the respect of both sides of the aisle for  decades of ethical and professional service in the Illinois General  Assembly. Laws he has helped to pass have made life better for  countless people in my home State. In recognition of that fact, the  Illinois General Assembly recently voted to celebrate December 31,  which will be Dick's last day on the job, as Richard ``Dick'' Lockhart  Day in the State of Illinois--a well-deserved honor.   Five weeks after Dick Lockhart and others were captured, American  forces won the Battle of the Bulge, liberated Belgium, and sent the  German occupying troops back to Germany.   Two years ago, as part of the 70th anniversary of that event, Dick  Lockhart returned to Belgium. The children and grandchildren of the  Belgians who had been liberated from Nazi occupation greeted him like a  hero. He was honored by the nation's King and Queen in a castle--royal  treatment that he and all of the American soldiers richly deserved.   When Dick speaks about his experience as a soldier, he is never the  hero of any story. He reserves that role for the young men who didn't  come home.   He says: ``There is an inscription in a World War II cemetery that  reads, `When you go home, tell them of us and say that for your  tomorrow, we gave our today.' ''   At the risk of contradicting my old friend, I have to say that Dick  Lockhart is, indeed, an American hero.   This Veterans Day, we say to him and to all of the American veterans:  Thank you for your service. Thank you for our freedom. Thank you for  all of the tomorrows you purchased for us with your courage and  sacrifice.                                  healthcare    Mr. President, in 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act with  one main goal in mind--to help more Americans get quality, affordable  health insurance. And it worked.   Since the law took effect, more than 20 million previously uninsured  Americans have gained health coverage, including 1 million in Illinois.   For the first time ever, our Nation's uninsured rate is below 10  percent. Insurers can no longer deny coverage due to a preexisting  condition, charge sky-high premiums for being a woman or having a  health history, or impose annual or lifetime caps on your benefits.   Young people can stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and we  extended the life of Medicare by a decade. These are real improvements  that are saving lives.   Was the law perfect? No. But did it accomplish its primary goal of  ensuring that more Americans could obtain healthcare--regardless of  their income, gender, or medical history? Yes, it did.  [[Page S7134]]    None of that has mattered to President Trump, who has spent the past  10 months orchestrating a deliberate campaign to sabotage healthcare  for tens of millions of American families.   From his first day in office, President Trump directed Federal  agencies not to enforce the law. He cut the open enrollment sign-up  period in half. He yanked advertisements and slashed outreach and  enrollment assistance funding.   And he terminated the cost-sharing reduction subsidies that keep  costs down for 7 million Americans. As a result, individual market  premiums will increase 20 percent next year alone.   President Trump has done everything within his power to sabotage and  undermine this law.   Despite President Trump's repeated attempts at repeal and sabotage,  the Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land, and that means  that quality, affordable healthcare options are available.   And we are right in the midst of Open Enrollment. Starting last  week--on November 1--Americans who purchased their health plans in the  individual marketplace began signing up for health insurance that  covers them next year, in 2018. But you only have 6 weeks to sign up.  Open enrollment began November 1, and ends on December 15.   This is your opportunity to buy insurance that covers important  health benefits--hospitalizations, prescription drugs, doctor visits,  maternity/newborn care, mental health and substance abuse treatment.   And there is financial assistance to help you buy these plans. In  fact, 8 out of 10 people who purchase health insurance in the  individual market are eligible to receive tax credits that help make  that insurance more affordable.   In Illinois, about 350,000 people purchase their health insurance in  the individual market, and nearly 300,000 of them are eligible for tax  credits that will ensure their health plan premiums are below $100 per  month.   So, despite the frenzy in Washington over healthcare: health  insurance under the ACA is open for business, and the time to sign up  is now. Visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596. I would  encourage everyone to sign up early. Don't wait unitl the last minute.   Speaking of waiting until the last minute, I remain dismayed that  this Republican-controlled Congress has failed to reauthorize two  incredibly important Federal healthcare programs--the Children's Health  Insurance Program and the community health centers program.   Nationwide, 27 million people receive care from community health  centers. And 9 million children and pregnant women get their healthcare  through the CHIP program, including more than 330,000 kids in Illinois.   Because of congressional inaction, funding for these two programs  expired over a month ago, on October 1. And what have Republican  leaders in the Senate done over the past month, while funding has  lapsed for children, pregnant women, and our Nation's health clinics?   Well, they passed a budget resolution making it easier to give huge  tax cuts to wealthy individuals and big businesses. That is right.  While States and health centers are struggling to figure out how to  keep their programs operating, while families are worrying about when  their health coverage may run out, congressional Republicans are  focused on tax breaks for the rich.   Facing this funding uncertainty, States and community health centers  are trying to figure out how to keep their programs and clinics  operating. Ten States--plus the District of Columbia--will run out of  CHIP funding in the next month or so.   For example, later this month, the State of Colorado is planning to  send health coverage termination letters to lower income families. The  letter reads, in part: ``You are receiving this letter because members  of your household are enrolled in the [Children's Health Insurance  Program] . . . If Congress does not renew federal funding, CHIP in  Colorado will end on January 31, 2018 . . . there is no guarantee that  they will.''   Imagine how terrifying it would be to receive this letter, to learn  that your child is about to lose their health insurance coverage  because Congress is preoccupied with tax breaks for the rich.   It is beyond unacceptable that congressional Republicans abdicated  their responsibility to reauthorize these critical health programs.   If we truly want to help the communities and people we serve, let's  quickly reauthorize funding for children's health care and for  community health centers.   And remember, if you need health insurance next year, you have until  December 15 to sign up. Don't miss your chance.

The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Monday, I was in Crystal Lake, IL, in  the 6th Congressional District. I was joined by realtors and local  elected officials to talk about how the GOP tax plan would hurt  families in my home State of Illinois. The families in the 6th  Congressional District would be hit especially hard since they are in  the 12th highest district in terms of the benefit received from the  State and local tax deduction--a deduction that is gutted in the  Republican House tax plan.   Republicans released this plan last Thursday, have been marking it up  in committee this week, with the plan to have it on the House floor  next week.   It is already clear that this partisan plan does nothing more than  double-down on some of the most damaging ideas from the framework  congressional Republicans and the White House released in September-- and the bill gets worse the closer you look.   The House Republican bill would bankroll massive tax cuts for the  wealthy few and the largest corporations on the backs of hard-working  families in Illinois and across the country.   The bill eliminates some of the most vital tax breaks for people in  Illinois--making it so that struggling seniors no longer will be able  to deduct costly out-of-pocket medical expenses and that the 1.5  million Illinoisans with Federal student loan debt will no longer be  able to deduct the interest paid on those loans.   Congressional Republicans didn't stop at eliminating deductions for  medical expenses and student loan interest.   Republicans want to take away one of the most valuable deductions for  working families in this State--the State and local tax deduction.   Eliminating this deduction to fund a massive tax cuts for  corporations and the ultrawealthy was a centerpiece of the Framework  Republicans released earlier this year--a move that would raise taxes  on one-third of all taxpayers.   After strong opposition within their ranks for eliminating the State  and local tax deduction, the House Republican plan released last week  proposes a ``compromise'' to obtain the support of congressional  Republicans that represent States like Illinois.   This so-called compromise eliminates the tax deduction for State and  local income taxes, and caps the deduction for property taxes, so  instead of eliminating the deduction altogether, they just gut it. If  you ask me, that is no compromise at all.   The result is still the same: middle-income families would still be  double taxed when it comes to income, sales, and some property taxes-- once by the Federal Government and again by the State.   This would make it more expensive for families to fund services at  the local level like the local schools, police and fire departments,  and local roads and bridges.   Make no mistake, in Illinois--the State with the fifth highest number  of taxpayers claiming the State and local tax deduction--would be hit  especially hard. Nearly 2 million Illinoisans--roughly one-third of  taxpayers in the State--claimed more than $24 billion in State and  local tax deductions in 2015 alone.   If Republicans are successful in eliminating or gutting this  deduction, it will mean a tax hike for working families across  Illinois.   If completely eliminated, a family of four living in a place like  Crystal Lake making around $76,000 per year would pay more than $1,400  more in taxes each year.   And what do Republicans do with the money from raising taxes on one- third of middle-income families in Illinois? They give the ultrawealthy  and the largest corporations a tax cut.   That is just plain wrong.   I urge House Republicans to oppose any tax plan that would raise  taxes on middle-income families by gutting the State and local tax  deduction in order to give cuts to the largest corporations and richest  1 percent.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to thank  Judge Ann Claire Williams for her extraordinary service to our country.  After serving nearly two decades on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of  Appeals in Chicago, Judge Williams announced she would be retiring from  the judiciary later this year.   Ann Claire Williams is a trailblazer. She is the first African  American to serve on the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals--an  accomplishment that one judge called: ``the desegregation of the 7th  Circuit.'' This was just another in a series of firsts for Judge  Williams. She was one of the first two African-American women to clerk  for judges on the Seventh Circuit. In 1985, Judge Williams became the  first African American woman to become a U.S. District Court judge for  the Northern District of Illinois. She served as chair of the Court  Administration and Case Management Committee of the United States  Judicial Conference--making her the first African American chair of a  Judicial Conference committee. Judge Williams also became the first  African American president of the Federal Judges Association. Simply  put, almost every step of her career has broken new ground.   Born in Detroit, MI, Ann Claire Williams began her career as a third  grade music teacher after graduating from Wayne State University with a  bachelor's degree in elementary education and master's degree from the  University of Michigan in guidance and counseling. Inspired by the  television show ``Perry Mason'' the only lawyer she knew growing up-- and a competitive spirit, Ann decided to attend law school. She chose  the University of Notre Dame and the rest is history--or more  appropriately, the rest of her career made history.   Judge Williams has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards.  Here are just a few: Chicago Lawyer 2000 Person of the Year; the  Arabella Babb Mansfield Award from the National Association of Women  Lawyers; the National Bar Association's Gertrude E. Rush Award; the  American Bar Association's Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement  Award; Chicago Inn of Court's Joel M. Flaum Award; American Judicature  Society's Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award; the  Black Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago's Pioneer Award;  the Leadership Institute for Women of Color Attorneys, Inc.'s Breaking  the Glass Ceiling Award; and was recognized by Newsweek Daily Beast as  one of 2012's 150 Fearless Women in the World.   Judge Williams has always been proud of breaking barriers and her  history of firsts, but she doesn't want to be the last. Throughout her  career, she has been committed to training young lawyers. As a founding  member of the Black Women Lawyers in Chicago, Judge Williams uses her  story to inspire the next generation--and makes clear through her  experiences that young women today can follow the path she paved to  reach the top of their fields. She also serves as chairwoman of the  Just The Beginning Foundation to help guide more minority law students  into the legal profession. Under Judge Williams' leadership, the  organization has grown to include programs for students in high school  and middle school across the country. For all her achievements, it is  her commitment to the future that is truly inspiring.   Recently, Judge Williams said.         You want to be nourished by people that understand your       story and your experience. But once you're nourished that       means you have to go out and deal with the broader world.    Well, Judge Williams has done just that. She serves on the board of  Equal Justice Works, a nonprofit dedicated to creating a just society  by training lawyers committed to working in the public interest, and  despite her busy schedule, she has made time to travel to Ghana,  Rwanda, Liberia, and Uganda to train judges and attorneys.   Judge Williams' career is groundbreaking, and she is a role model for  countless young women of color--and an inspiration to the rest of us. I  am proud to call her a friend.   I want to congratulate Judge Williams on an outstanding career and  thank her for all she has done--and all she will continue to do. The  country is grateful for her service. I wish her and her family all the  best in her next chapter.  [[Page S7152]]                                ____________________
