 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 40 years of  community revitalization in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.   When Kincheloe Air Force Base closed in 1977, a renewal of the Saulte  Ste. Marie community began as it transitioned from military to civilian  use. These 40 years stand as a testament to the hard work and  resilience of the folks of Chippewa County, who have overcome the job  loss and revenue loss associated with Kincheloe's closing.   The transition from military to civilian is not always an easy one,  but I am proud to represent a region that has remained focused on  investing in the future of our communities. On this anniversary, we not  only celebrate our current successes, but we also remember the  contributions of our past.   Kincheloe Air Force Base played a significant role in shaping our  national defense and making our community into what it is today. We are  forever grateful to the Chippewa County community for preserving that  history throughout these 40 years.                            ____________________
