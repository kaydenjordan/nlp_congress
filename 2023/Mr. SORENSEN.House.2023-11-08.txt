 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a local leader in  broadcast news and fellow Quad citizen.   For more than 40 years, families in our region could count on the  friendly demeanor and seasoned professionalism of Paula Sands on KWQC  TV 6 News.   Paula boasts an accomplished career, taking the helm as the region's  youngest woman to host her own TV show at the age of 23. Since then,  and for the past three decades, she hosted ``Paula Sands Live'', a news  show dedicated to current events and local businesses.   She is an Emmy award winner. She has taken a seat in the National  Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Silver Circle.   All the while, Paula served her hometown as a trusted voice.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to enter the contributions of such a  legendary figure into the Record. I wish Paula Sands my sincerest  gratitude and well-wishes as she enters retirement.                            ____________________
