 Mr. Speaker, in the State of Michigan, there have been  over 16,000 COVID-19 cases just this month. Nearly 200 people have  died. Death and illness and viruses should not be politicized.   In both Wayne and Oakland Counties, we are still seeing nearly 3,000  cases per week, so the pandemic is far from over. We have residents  being hospitalized and families having to say good-bye to their loved  ones because of this deadly virus.   This pandemic is not over. The pandemic is still preventing people  from going to work and school, disrupting everyday lives.   By ending resources and policies that have surely saved lives, we are  leaving our residents and communities to fend for themselves. They  cannot do this alone.   We must continue to provide resources to combat COVID-19 and the  impacts of long COVID, from testing to treatment and care.   We can continue to save lives together. Continuing to provide  resources is not only the right and sensible thing to do, but it is the  moral thing to do.   Please, again, we must vote ``no'' on H.R. 382.
