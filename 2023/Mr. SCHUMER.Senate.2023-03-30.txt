 First, on our work period recap, well, 66 to 30, that is  the final count of yesterday's vote to repeal the Iraq AUMF of 2002 and  1991, a bipartisan success years in the making. That was a very good  moment here on the floor yesterday--a sign that Senators on both sides  want to see bipartisanship continue in this Chamber.   We can see it again if Members work together on issues that Americans  care about, like lowering costs, preserving America's competitiveness,  and in yesterday's case, stopping endless wars in the Middle East.   It is my hope that the AUMF repeal can be a model, a blueprint for  how the Senate operates in the coming years. It is not easy, but it is  very much possible, and I thank my Republican colleagues, particularly  Senator Young, for their cooperation.   The AUMF repeal was the conclusion of a successful busy work period-- 5-week work period that we just completed in the Senate--a busy and  successful work period on and off the floor.   We confirmed another 14 highly qualified judicial nominees to  lifetime appointments to the bench, 13 district and one circuit court  judge, bringing our total to 119 new judges--119 new judges; that makes  us proud--under President Biden.   I also want to recognize our committee chairs for their good work  over the past month or so in holding hearing after hearing, day after  day, on important issues that Americans care about, like rail safety,  the health of our banks, the rights of working Americans, the  President's budget, and more.   The Senate will hit the ground running when we return from the April  State work period by taking up the much needed Fire Grants and Safety  Act. It is my hope that yesterday's 96-0 vote in favor of moving  forward portends for swift action and argues very strongly against  dilatory tactics. Let's do the same thing we did on the AUMF. We are  willing to allow some amendments, but we have got to move forward. This  is something that is supported broadly, as shown by the 96-0 vote.   Just this week, 29 fire emergency service groups warned Congress that  with summer around the corner, local fire departments of all kinds are  woefully understaffed, underfunded, and underequipped to meet their  obligations to keep people safe. So, when we return, the Senate must  move quickly to pass fire grants legislation without unnecessary delays  to this overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the Senator from Alabama's holding up  military nominations, the Senator from Alabama continues his hold on-- more than 180 now--promotions, military promotions, blatantly ignoring  the many warnings of the harm he is causing to our national security.  It is reckless. It is just reckless.   Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned that blocking  [[Page S1062]]  these promotions ``creates a ripple effect through the force that makes  us far less ready than we need to be.''   Do you hear that, the Senator from Alabama? The Secretary of Defense  is saying that what you do makes us far less ready than we need to be  at a time when China and Iran and Russia are all causing all kinds of  security problems and threats.   But Secretary Austin also emphasized another point, a very important  point: The Senator's stonewalling is having consequences--bad  consequences, heart-wrenching consequences--for our military families.  By blocking these promotions, the Senator from Alabama is blocking pay  raises for these officers and their families. By blocking these  promotions, the Senator from Alabama is blocking military kids from  starting at new schools, setting them back in their educations.   When a member of the military serves, their family serves, too. Does  the Senator from Alabama understand the disruption and chaos he is  causing for military families?   These are people serving us. They are not political. They have worked  hard. They have done a good job. They got a promotion. A promotion  means moving--a change of venue, a change of school. It means a career  path--how long you have been at one rank and then to another.   The Senator from Alabama is playing havoc with so many military  families, who are nonpolitical, who have served our country well, who  thought they were ready for promotions until this cruel act of the  Senator from Alabama stopped them. These military families have done  nothing--nothing--to deserve the disrespect and disdain shown by the  Senator from Alabama. It is insulting to our servicemembers that one  Senator--just one--is holding up what has long been a routine and  nonpartisan process.   Again, I urge my colleague from Alabama to think this through and  stand down. We understand he has passion on the issue. We disagree with  it vehemently; so do most Americans. But passion on the issue is not an  excuse for causing havoc in the military in terms of force and in terms  of the lives of the families.   I would again plead with my Republican colleagues, whether it is  public or private, to go to the Senator from Alabama and dissuade him  from his folly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the budget and debt ceiling and ``show  us your plan,'' House Republicans are themselves starting to see why  their attempts to threaten default to secure spending cuts has been a  terrible idea from the start. It is not only reckless; it is not only  dangerous--it turns out they can't even follow through on it.   This week, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee  admitted that he doesn't even see a path to an agreement for lifting  the debt ceiling, and at least 16 Republicans have never voted to raise  the debt ceiling at all, even under President Trump. That is true.   But the problem here isn't that there isn't a path. Of course, there  is a path. It is staring Republicans in the face. The solution is what  we Democrats have said from the start: Instead of threatening default,  instead of brinksmanship, Republicans should work with us on a clean  extension of the debt ceiling. We did it three times under Donald  Trump. We have already done it under President Biden, and we should do  it again.   If Republicans want to push a separate discussion on the budget, that  is their prerogative. In fact, it has been done many times by both  parties in the past. But the Republicans would be reckless to take the  full faith and credit of the United States hostage in order to force a  conversation on the budget, particularly when there is an alternative  tried-and-true path that has been used before: Separate the debt  ceiling and raising the ability of us to pay our debts and discuss  things on the budget--on taxes and on spending--which we always do. It  is tying the two together that is reckless.   So it is becoming clearer and clearer to Republicans themselves--even  those in the House--that the only legitimate path forward is this:  Let's have a bipartisan and clean extension of the debt ceiling, as we  have done many times before, and then Republicans can push a separate  discussion on the budget.   The American people have listened to us. A month and a half ago, I  started telling the Republican leader: Show us your plan.   President Biden, Hakeem Jeffries, and many others have joined in on  that call, and it is resonating from one end of America to the other.  Of course, you can't sit down and discuss something if you don't have a  plan. Speaker McCarthy just says: Let's meet. But what are they going  to do--discuss the weather? the rearrangement of the furniture?   Come on. Do it the right way.   You are beginning to see what we have said all along--that the best  way to do this is with no hostage-taking, no brinksmanship on the debt  ceiling, but with a strong, avid, and passionate discussion on spending  issues--one separate from the other.   House Republicans cannot show us their plan, and as we said--as I  predicted 2 months ago--a month and a half ago--it is going to be very  hard for them to get 218 votes on any plan.   So come on. Look in the mirror. See what is going on, and do it the  right way.   Speaker McCarthy, today is March 30. It has been long enough. You  still haven't come up with a single specific cut that makes any  difference in the debt that you want to do. Show us your plan. Drop the  brinksmanship. Join Democrats on a clean extension of the debt ceiling.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on H.R. 1, the House is expected  today to vote on Republicans' partisan, unserious, and so-called energy  package that they call H.R. 1.   First, once again, I want to make it clear: H.R. 1 is dead on arrival  in the Senate, not because of politics but because it is so ridiculous  and has been drawn up by a bunch of pro-oil Senators who have no regard  for anyone else. No Democrat has been consulted. Obviously, the  Republicans knew that in the House when they passed it, but they seem  to want to go back. In H.R. 1, they go back to the MAGA supporters back  home--the big oil companies, the oil wildcatters, and so many of the  oil States that don't want to pay any taxes and that don't want  anything to do with moving us forward as the climate gets worse and  worse.   The Senate is not going to waste our time on a bill that sets America  back decades in our transition to clean energy. All it takes is a brief  glance at H.R. 1 to realize it is just a giveaway to Big Oil. House  Republicans' so-called energy package just guts important safeguards,  environmental safeguards, on fossil fuel projects. It would lock  America into expensive, erratic, and dirty energy sources while setting  us back more than a decade on our decision to move forward on clean  energy, which this Nation fully supports. Transmission, of course, is  hugely important to increasing access on clean energy, but the  Republican plan hardly even mentions it.   So, again, the way to do this, Republicans in the House, is in a  bipartisan way. We have a Republican House. We have a Democratic  Senate. No party is going to be able to jam its way through without  consulting the other side. That is true on the debt ceiling. That is  true on the budget, and it is certainly true on H.R. 1.   There are Republicans in the House and Democrats in the House, and  there are Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Senate who  want to sit down and do a serious energy package. We need to do it.  Let's stop this brinksmanship. Let's stop this political game-playing.  Let's stop this throwing of bones to the MAGA hard right, which  represents, maybe, 5 percent of America. Let's roll up our sleeves.  Let's get down to work and get something done on energy and on so many  other issues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I  ask that it be reported by number.
