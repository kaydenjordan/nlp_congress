 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2410,  the Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and  Treatment Act.    I want to commend my friends Representative  Danny Davis and  Representative Dr.  Michael Burgess for their tireless work in this  space. Both of these men have a lifetime of service in the delivery of  healthcare, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) and the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess). I thank both of them for their  incredible work.   I have been a lifetime advocate, Mr. Speaker, for addressing sickle  cell disease, and I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I have done so in  previous Congresses.   Sickle cell disease is the most common genetic blood disorder. It  affects approximately 100,000 individuals, primarily African Americans,  throughout the country.   Sickle cell disease awareness is significant to me for many reasons.  One, because this disorder affects many of my constituents in North  Carolina. It is significant, Mr. Speaker, because I had a dear cousin,  whose name was Rubie Butterfield Mizell, who, in 1972, passed away from  this disease in Opa-locka, Florida.   People with sickle cell disease have red blood cells with abnormal  types of hemoglobin, often causing anemia, jaundice, and the formation  of gallstones.   What is truly frightening is that sickle cell disease does not have a  cure. The most widely used treatment for sickle cell disease was modern  medicine 20 years ago that can reduce the number of episodes but does  not eliminate them or their severity.   The health challenges facing people with sickle cell disease are  enormous. The disease is widespread. The consequences can be dire, and  that is why the Congressional Black Caucus and the Health Brain Trust  of the Congressional Black Caucus have made these a priority in our  agenda over the years under the leadership of the gentlewoman from  Chicago, Illinois (Ms. Kelly).                                time  1745    People with sickle cell disease have a much shorter life expectancy,  with median ages of death for males of only 33 years and for females of  only 36 years. These patients are also more likely to have additional  health complications, including stroke, blood clots, loss of vision,  and lung and kidney failure.   There are approximately 4,400 people with sickle cell disease in  North Carolina. I am sure that, Mr. Speaker, in the State of Texas, it  may be even more. My hope is that someday there will be none.   That is why we must reauthorize the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment  Demonstration Program to enable the Secretary of HHS to support  research to increase our understanding of the disease, and create a  grant program to study the prevalence of sickle cell and identify ways  to prevent and treat sickle cell disease effectively.   Sixty-five percent of individuals with this disease in North Carolina  have at least one emergency room visit per year. That is no way to  live. I am sure Dr. Burgess, when he practiced medicine in his home  State, saw many, many patients who were similarly situated.   We should do all that we can to help improve patients' lives, advance  treatment, and find a cure. I am grateful for the opportunity to move  this bill through the House, and I hope that my colleagues will join me  in supporting it.   I thank Dr. Burgess, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Green for their work. All of  these gentlemen have done a great job in this space.
