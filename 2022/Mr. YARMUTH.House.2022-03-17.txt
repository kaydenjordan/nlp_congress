 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the best college  basketball team not in a bracket this weekend. The Bellarmine Knights  did what no team has done before, winning a Division I championship  just 2 years removed from Division II, a title that should come with a  big dance invitation.   Instead, this Cinderella story was cut short by an NCAA which, as it  often does, played wicked stepmother, upholding a bizarre rule  preventing teams elevating too quickly from Division II to championship  contender.   Who they think they are serving, I don't know, but they cannot take  away the Knights' extraordinary achievements or the pride they brought  their school and hometown. They entered the season as afterthoughts and  finished as ASUN champions and just the tenth team since 2007 to win 20  games against a top-5 schedule.   This incredible feat for the players is a triumph for Coach Scotty  Davenport, who has won championships in Louisville for 35 years at  every level and seems like he could for 35 more.   Scotty noted that each season ends with just two teams left standing,  the NCAA and NIT champs. This year, the season ends with three. Please  join me in honoring the Bellarmine Knights, the first NCAA team to  finish this basketball season as champions.                            ____________________
