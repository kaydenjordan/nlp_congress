 Mr. Speaker, the number one issue that my constituents  have asked me to address is the price of healthcare and, especially,  the cost of prescription drugs. It is long past time for commonsense  legislation to end the ban on price negotiation for drugs for our  Nation's Medicare patients.   This one action will hold Big Pharma accountable and encourage more  competition. That is why the special interests have opposed H.R. 3,  because it forces them to lower their prices for U.S. patients.   We can use the money saved to lower premiums, cap out-of-pocket costs  for our Nation's seniors, and invest in the National Institutes of  Health's lifesaving research and innovation.   These are decisions that impact real people. Take my constituent from  Rosemount. He has Crohn's disease and takes a medication called Canasa.  When he started taking the drug, it was $100 for a 30-day supply. Over  the past 10 years, that has skyrocketed to $1,500 a month. In Canada,  that same drug costs $75 a month.   It is time to stop talking and take action.                            ____________________
