 Madam Speaker, this weekend, tens of  thousands of law enforcement officers from across the country will  arrive in Washington for National Police Week.   Established by a joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National  Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers  who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and  protection of others.   National Police Week is a collaborative effort of many organizations  dedicated to honoring America's law enforcement community. The National  Peace Officers' Memorial Service and Candlelight Vigil will take place  later this evening, allowing the Nation to pause and remember the  officers who have made that ultimate sacrifice.   This week honors the men and women in blue who gave everything to  protect their country and their communities.   Earlier this year, Pennsylvania mourned the loss of two State  troopers, Martin Mack III and Branden Sisca, who were killed in the  line of duty on March 21, 2022.    Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be  in harm's way at any moment.   On behalf of a grateful Nation, thank you to all our officers who  serve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for yielding.   Today, we have the great opportunity to move one step closer to  reducing poverty across the Nation. The community services block grant  is the only Federal program with the explicit and overreaching goal of  reducing poverty regardless of its cause.   Originally, created in 1964, the program established local community  action agencies to help identify why people were in poverty and how to  address it using public and private resources. It was a public-private  partnership. Community action agencies are governed by boards that are  largely made up of business and industry community leaders in those  counties.   Funds for this program help families and individuals achieve self- sufficiency, find and retain meaningful employment, attain an  education, make better use of available income, obtain housing, and  achieve greater participation in community affairs. Virtually every  county in the United States has a community action agency which helps  low-income individuals and families move from poverty to independence.   CSBG has not been reauthorized in more than two decades, and today's  vote will renew our commitment to reducing poverty and strengthening  communities across the country.   H.R. 5129 reauthorizes the community services block grant program for  10 years at an annual level of $1 billion for the first 5 years. It  maintains local control of community action planning and activities. It  is largely business and industry leaders that constitute those boards.  It authorizes a broadband navigator program to respond to the broadband  and digital needs of low-income families and communities to find  pathways out of poverty.   Madam Speaker, it does so much more.   CSBG requires some modernization to allow agencies the ability to tap  their full potential and better serve families and communities. While  this program has a strong history of bipartisan support, some of my  colleagues have alleged faith-based organizations will no longer be  able to participate in the CSBG program if this bill becomes law. This  is simply untrue.   Faith-based organizations are longstanding and essential partners in  community action networks. They serve as incredible forces of good in  their communities.   Philippians 2:4 tells us, ``Let each of you look not only to his  interests, but also to the interests of the others.''   Madam Speaker, as a man of faith and longtime member of the  Congressional Prayer Caucus, the last thing I would do is support  legislation that removes faith-based organizations entirely from  actively and equally participating in CSBG. There have been  longstanding Federal regulations which were expanded under the George  W. Bush administration that allow faith-based organizations to partake  in Federal programs without compromising their religious beliefs. These  regulations now apply to nine Federal departments and agencies,  including HHS.   The Trump administration also reaffirmed these regulations through  the final rule titled Equal Participation of Faith-Based Organizations  in the Federal Agencies' Programs and Activities.    This bill makes Federal policy clearer, and it maintains the same  protections for faith-based providers in CSBG-funded activities.   Madam Speaker, it is time for Congress to reaffirm our Nation's  commitment to reducing poverty by reauthorizing the CSBG, and I urge my  colleagues to support the passage of this righteous legislation.
