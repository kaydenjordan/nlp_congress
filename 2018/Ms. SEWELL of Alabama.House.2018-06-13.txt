 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out for the  millions of American families who have been impacted by the opioid  epidemic.   Every day we hear another story of parents who have lost their child  to a heroin overdose or of young children who are left behind without  care as their parents struggle with addiction.   In Alabama, which has the highest rate of opioid prescription use in  this Nation, residents average 1.2 prescriptions per person.   Mr. Speaker, this epidemic doesn't discriminate by age or income or  gender. The opioid epidemic has taken from families of every  background.   Now, more than ever, these victims need our help. It is our job to  help them find treatment not as criminals, but as patients in need of  care.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that we are finally seeing as a society  that addiction is not something to be criminalized but, rather,  addiction is, indeed, a public health crisis. It is not a crime. It is  a chronic neurological  [[Page H5103]]  disorder, and it does make sense for us to find help for those who need  it and not to put them in jail.   Unfortunately, during the 1980s and 1990s during the crack addiction,  we criminalized that addiction and destroyed so many families, many of  whom are in my district. But, Mr. Speaker, I am glad that we see that  the opioid epidemic is, indeed, a public health crisis. I am equally  glad that, Mr. Speaker, we are finally working in a bipartisan way to  actually find the needed help that these families need in order to  break such addictions.   Today I am glad to see that Republicans and Democrats working  together in Congress are trying to solve the opioid epidemic and to  help those in need. At a time when Congress is struggling with partisan  gridlock, I am glad and happy to see that this week has been declared  by my Republican colleagues as Opioid Week, where we will talk about  bipartisan bills in order to solve this crisis.   I am proud to have introduced bipartisan legislation with Republican  Congressman Peter Roskam. Our bill, the Preventing Addiction for  Susceptible Seniors Act, helps prevent abuse among seniors without  limiting access to needed medication.   For an at-risk senior, our legislation requires part D to create a  lock-in plan that prevents patients from doctor shopping. Our  legislation would also streamline communications between CMS and part C  and part D plans regarding program integrity.   Mr. Speaker, bipartisan solutions like these are a step forward in  our work to solve the opioid crisis. I look forward to my bill with Mr.  Roskam coming before this body next week. I truly believe that we have  the power to end this epidemic.   I have heard reports from Alabama groups that our poison control  center is getting fewer calls about opioid emergencies. A new study  shows that the opioid prescription rate in Alabama has finally begun to  decrease.                                time  1045    States have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs that  have proven successful, and many pharmacists have limited opioid  prescriptions to 7 days.   If we are going to put a stop to the opioid crisis, we need to  collaborate with every stakeholder. We also need to make sure that our  societal safety net is working effectively to give a path out of  addiction, rather than letting them fall through the cracks.   I want to take a moment to share a story about a person in my  district, Jessica, a constituent from Alabama.   Jessica was a victim of parental abuse as a child. She was introduced  to opioids by a doctor for a sports injury in high school. By 17, she  was crushing and snorting pills. She received 330 pills a month.   Jessica had three children and lost custody of all three at different  points. She started using heroin after losing custody of her youngest  son. Then her brother died of a heroin overdose.   I share this story because I believe Jessica's story speaks to the  financial stresses that working-class Americans recovering from  addiction feel every day. Now in recovery, Jessica works 10-hour night  shifts at Burger King. Given the hours she works, Jessica falls into  our State's Medicaid gap. She doesn't qualify to receive Medicaid, so  she doesn't have health insurance.   Jessica has been clean for over a year. But, Mr. Speaker, because she  doesn't have health insurance, this makes her addiction problem and  fighting it much harder.   The bills that we are considering this week and next week are a step  toward this. There are no silver bullets. But, Mr. Speaker, I do  believe that we as a body can help to address this horrible epidemic. I  am glad that we are finally seeing that addiction is not criminal, but  rather a public health crisis, and we are seeking to solve it.                            ____________________
