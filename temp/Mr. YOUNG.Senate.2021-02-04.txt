 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 54 and ask that it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment to  ensure that any new round of economic impact payments does not go to  those in this country illegally.   It would establish a dangerous precedent if the Federal Government  were to give a direct cash payment to those who have jumped the line  and subverted our Nation's immigration system to enter the United  States.   Now, I want to emphasize that this amendment is not a change. It is  not a change from the way this body has approached EIPs during the last  two rounds. Moreover, it does not affect the important fix that  Congress implemented, with the leadership of Mr. Rubio, in December to  ensure mixed-status families are not negatively impacted.   This amendment would simply make certain that Democrats do not loosen  the existing eligibility requirements moving forward if there is a new  round of EIPs.    Mr. President, how much time do I have to respond?    Mr. President, we have consulted with legal counsel. The  gentleman from Illinois' statements, assertions are inaccurate. This  would not impact mixed-status families.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote aye on  this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 54    I ask for the yeas and nays.
