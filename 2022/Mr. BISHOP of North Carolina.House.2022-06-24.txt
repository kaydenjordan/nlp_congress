 Mr. Speaker, in Dobbs earlier this  great morning, and in the New York State RPA decision yesterday, the  Supreme Court declared something astonishing, which has electrified the  country and left radicals seething: The Constitution means what it  says.   In New York State RPA, the Court reiterated what Heller decided in  2008. To paraphrase, the decision said: Like we told you the first  time, the Second Amendment protects an individual, fundamental right  weighed and decided upon by the people at the founding.   But just as most of the courts of appeals flouted Heller by  reweighing that right over and over for more than a decade, the Senate  again flouts the new decision before the ink is dry.   What is the historical analog from the founding era under which the  right to bear arms could be targeted for complete deprivation upon less  than complete process rights? Name it. Name the historical analog. That  is Congress' burden.   The renewed assault on the Second Amendment is more than sufficient  grounds to oppose this bill, but even the constitutionally permissible  components repeat the terrible misjudgment that has afflicted this type  of legislation for far too long.   I have said before that you are not grappling with the issue: 60  years of targeted destruction of the American culture by the secular  and postmodernist left. Foremost in that destruction has been the  unrelenting assault on the family.   So what does this ``do something'' bill do?   It displaces families further by building a massive new mental health  delivery bureaucracy into public school agencies; it connects Medicaid  and CHIP directly to schools for early and periodic screening,  diagnostic, and treatment services in schools; and it supports the  provision of culturally competent and trauma-informed care in school  settings.                                time  1230    Americans who have been watching will hear a familiar refrain in that  jargon. It means beyond the reach of parents and the reach of common  sense.   Who is it that is delivering this double down on woke to your child  at school? Republican Senators.   Moms and dads across the country, if you thought that Washington has  heard you loud and clear, you are sorely mistaken.   Washington has yet to recognize that it is the author of the  devastation we confront, and Washington is still failing to grapple  with the core issue. They are taking another step down the long path we  have trod that has transformed America just as they want.    Mr. Speaker, this bill is, at the same  time, an attack on constitutional rights and a dangerous, poorly  thought out, ill-defined improvisation.   Wringing your hands and doing something instead of the right thing  will continue having the same result it has had since the 1960s.   Show that honesty and courage does not reside only in the Supreme  Court building across the street. Defeat this bill.
