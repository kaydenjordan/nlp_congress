 Thank you, Madam President. I will be speaking in  just a moment, but I understand the minority leader, Senator Schumer,  is on his way to speak before me, so he should be here within moments.    Madam President, I want to begin by thanking the  minority leader for bringing this issue as straightforwardly and as  clearly as he has. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I  demand to know from the Acting Secretary of Defense and other relevant  officials why we have deployed these American military assets,  including an aircraft carrier group, a number of bombers and Patriot  missile units to one of the most dangerous parts of the world, where  they may unexpectedly provoke act of war.   We are on a dangerous path without a strategy. We are embarked on a  course of potential war without informing the Congress or the American  people. We have demanded repeatedly that we be briefed, and it must be  in public.   This situation has reached a point of potential conflagration. The  tinderbox of the Middle East is no place to operate on impulse or whim.  That is the appearance this administration has created by lacking a  clearly articulated strategy for the American people to know and  assess. On the Armed Services Committee, we have asked repeatedly for  this kind of information, and so far the administration has refused to  provide it. So this kind of open hearing is necessary to be open  information for the American people, and they deserve and need no less.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, I turn now to a topic that is of great consequence  to the American people for their health and their economic well-being.   As we all know and as the senior Senator from Minnesota, my great  friend Amy Klobuchar, has very eloquently and powerfully described, the  high cost of essential medicines in this country is a national  disgrace. It is immoral. For the greatest country in the world to  compel ordinary Americans to choose between covering the cost of their  rent and putting food on the table or paying for their medicine needed  to stay alive is absolutely abhorrent and unacceptable.   The only people who benefit under the current system are the high- paid executives, whose pay is increased even more by this unjust and  intolerable system. It yields them greater profit without any greater  help to the American people.   It has to stop, and the good news is, we have bipartisan agreement  that it must stop. After years of disagreement, we are starting to see  Republicans and Democrats coming together and confronting the  skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. Drug companies' price-gouging,  their manipulation of their monopolistic power to raise those prices  and make the industry's practices noncompetitive and to exclude even  new products from coming to market--all of these abuses have become so  extreme and so outrageous that there is now bipartisan consensus that  we need to stop it.   I am proud today to support the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients  Act. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation, and it will finally put a  stop to some of the most egregious monopolistic and predatory tactics  within the drug industry. These tactics would make even the robber  barons of the Gilded Age blush with guilt and embarrassment for the  obvious anti-consumer effects that impact the average American.   These patent abuses go by colorful names like ``patent thicketing''  and ``product hopping,'' but these names obscure their very pernicious  purpose. Patent thicketing and product hopping are only the tip of this  monopolistic iceberg. While these terms may be unfamiliar to many  Americans, almost everyone is familiar with the harmful effects these  predatory practices produce.   The fault here is with the people who take advantage of shortages and  market power. They exploit them in the same way that anti-trust abuses  have been done over the decade, and they are the reason we have anti- trust laws. Now, to confront this even more egregious example of abuses  of market power, we need these new laws.   According to one study in 2017, across the top 12 grossing drugs in  America, drugs companies filed an average of 127 patent applications  per drug. By creating a thicket, a genuine thicket of patents around  their drugs, drug companies are able to double the number of years of  market exclusivity that they have before a competitor can enter the  market.   During this time, these drug companies are able to charge consumers  extraordinarily high prices for drugs they desperately need. If you use  HUMIRA or have rheumatoid arthritis, you should be deeply concerned  about patent thicketing. According to one study, the manufacturer of  HUMIRA has filed 247 patents so it can exclude competitors from the  market. It keeps those competitive adversaries from producing drugs and  can do so for a total of 39 years. During those 39 years, the cost of  HUMIRA in the future--they will do it for 39 years--is just going to  keep climbing. According to reports, between 2012 and 2015 alone, the  average amount that Medicare and Medicaid spent on each patient using  HUMIRA more than doubled--from $16,000 to $33,000. Things will only get  worse in the years to come.   Rheumatoid arthritis patients are hardly the only ones who should be  concerned about patent thicketing. A large number of patents have been  filed  [[Page S2870]]  to protect the market exclusivity of drugs that treat conditions like  cancer, stroke, blood clots, diabetes, multiple myeloma, and macular  degeneration.   Patent thickets will keep competitors off the market. It will cost  consumers thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars, each  year. It isn't only the patients who use the drugs who suffer these  effects; we all pay the cost of higher insurance when those insurers  have to pay higher costs for drugs. It hits all of us, not just the  patients who suffer from these medical conditions.   Unfortunately, this obviously anti-competitive practice is not the  only way drug companies abuse the patent system to keep drug prices  high. Just before the protections for their first drug expire, brand- name drug companies pull a bait-and-switch, pushing consumers onto a  new, slightly different drug. That means any generic competition coming  to market will struggle to penetrate the market, and consumers will be  stuck with the brand-name drug for even longer, likely at a  significantly higher cost. In this way, the brand-name company succeeds  in gouging customers and keeping their profits growing. That is their  objective--not better product, not better health, not better patient  experiences, only higher profits.   One of the most famous examples of product hopping--the practice I  have just described--concerns Namenda, a drug to treat Alzheimer's.  This drug was produced by a company called Actavis. When Actavis  originally released Namenda, it was usually taken by patients twice a  day, but a number of years before Namenda's market exclusivity was  going to expire, Actavis went to the FDA to approve a new version of  Namenda, this one taken just once a day. A new drug? No. A different  way of taking it? Maybe. To improve patient health? No. To increase  profits? Yes.   Although the FDA had approved this drug in 2010, Actavis  strategically waited 3 years to introduce this, with the apparent goal  of extending its exclusivity in the U.S. market. Once the new drug was  introduced, Actavis pushed all of its customers onto it, while pulling  the old drug from the market. As a result, Actavis was able to continue  charging monopoly prices on essentially the same drug long after  Namenda's first patent was expected to expire.   We have reached the time to stop patent thicketing and product  hopping once and for all. We have reached the time to bring sanity and  fairness to the drug market so consumers can see lower prices.   I am proud to be joining with Senator Cornyn of Texas to introduce  the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. It will fight these  abusive practices and give consumers some much needed relief from  higher drug costs. I thank Senator Cornyn for his leadership. We joined  in this partnership, and it has taken many months to draft and  introduce this measure. I thank his staff, as well as my own, for all  of their hard work on this bill reaching this bipartisan consensus.   This legislation will embolden and encourage our anti-trust forces to  pursue pharma companies that are getting away with anti-competitive  practices. It will also give clear guidance to our courts to allow them  to quickly and easily distinguish between product hopping and patent  thicketing from truly innovative, truly inventive conduct that benefits  patients.   This legislation makes sure that any company caught redhanded  engaging in these harmful practices will have to pay and be held  accountable.   This legislation will also lower healthcare costs for millions of  Americans by increasing competition in the market. If we pass this  legislation, millions of Americans may no longer have to choose between  food on the table, their rent payment, and the medicine they need and  deserve. That is a choice no one should ever have to make in the  greatest country in the history of the world.   We cannot allow drug companies to continue their monopolistic  practices and predatory abuses that only increase the profit of those  companies. We cannot allow those drug companies to reap massive  personal benefits for their executives, while Americans are struggling  to make ends meet. I urge the Senate to immediately take up this  legislation to protect American patients today.   I happily yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  town of Litchfield, CT, as it celebrates 300 years of local government.   Incorporated in 1719 by an act of the Colonial Assembly of  Connecticut, Litchfield was first settled the following year and  consisted of a mere home lots. Before long, the town grew thanks to a  breadth of small industries, its significant position as part of two  stagecoach lines, and its 1751 designation as the county seat.   A beautiful, welcoming place to live and flourish, Litchfield is  located in the bucolic hills of western Connecticut and is home to a  multitude of historic places of interest.   One of the most notable parts of the town are its historical houses.  These remarkable structures are not only fascinating because of their  fine, antique architecture and design, but also for their many famous  residents. Some held temporary visitors, such as Sheldon's Tavern,  where George Washington slept during the American Revolution. Others  were the homes of important Connecticut luminaries including  Revolutionary War patriot Ethan Allen, Governor and signer of the  Declaration of Independence Oliver Wolcott, cofounder of the Litchfield  China Trading Company Alexander Catlin, and Continental Army Colonel  Benjamin Tallmadge.   Litchfield has a number of other wonderful historical attractions,  including the Tapping Reeve Law School. Started in 1775, Tapping Reeve  began with Aaron Burr as its first student. Throughout its 58 years as  a functioning law school, it educated over 1,200 students from  throughout the Nation. Tapping Reeve counts Connecticut Governor Samuel  A. Foot, U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun, Connecticut Governor Roger  Sherman Baldwin, and Levi Woodbury, the first U.S. Supreme Court  justice to attend law school, among its alumni. Now the restored law  school building and Tapping Reeve House are available for public tours,  thanks to the Litchfield Historical Society.   The Connecticut General Assembly recognized Litchfield's rich past  and important role throughout our State's history by designating the  borough of Litchfield a historic district in 1959. Litchfield remains a  constantly growing yet still peaceful part of our State, which is  highly regarded by residents and visitors alike. I have greatly enjoyed  visiting Litchfield on numerous occasions and appreciating its  quintessential New England characteristics.   A town with a commendable dedication to its impressive past and a  positive, thoughtful look toward the future, Litchfield is an  extraordinary Connecticut town. I hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating Litchfield on three centuries of distinction, and I send  my best wishes for the town's future success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my  legislative fellow, Adam Bradlow, be granted floor privileges until the  end of July of 2019.
