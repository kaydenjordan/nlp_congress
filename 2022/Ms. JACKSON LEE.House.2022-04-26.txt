 Madam Speaker, I was pleased to join the Hoyer codel  to Europe, which included a number of countries and also the border  between Poland and Ukraine. That is why I am stunned by the remarks of  Foreign Minister Lavrov, who indicates that, ``Russia warns of nuclear  war risks as Ukraine talks go on.''   Let me speak directly to Foreign Minister Lavrov. Maybe Russia should  stop the bestiality, the cruelty, the brutality of this war, the  killing of children and seniors, and leaving people to starve, and  leaving their soldiers on the battlefield.   It is important that peace talks have an opportunity but saber- rattling gets you nowhere. And frankly, you would be as much afraid of  a nuclear outright war than anyone else. Ukraine has a right to be a  sovereign-free nation. Their children have a right to grow up free in  this world, and democracy has a right to exist over autocracy.   I believe this is Putin's war, a senseless, vile, and violent war.   Thank you to the strength of the people of Ukraine. It is important  that the Biden administration do as they have done. We should applaud  them for what they are doing, as well as acknowledge what Germany is  now doing in providing the air-to-ground weapons.   Stand with Ukraine and stop the saber-rattling.   Russia, stop the war.                            ____________________
