 Madam President, this year, in addition to celebrating  the bicentennial of the State of Maine, we are also commemorating the  bicentennial of the first major find in North America of the treasured  semiprecious stone tourmaline in the mountains of western Maine. It is  a fascinating historical coincidence that the State of Maine and the  discovery of its official State gemstone share the same anniversary.   Maine became our Nation's 23rd State on March 15, 1820. In late  autumn of that year, college students Elijah Hamlin and Ezekiel Holmes  were pursuing their studies in mineralogy on an expedition to Mount  Mica in Paris, ME. As they headed down the mountain at sunset, they  spotted a vivid green sparkle amid the tangled roots of a fallen tree.  The beautiful crystal was an exciting find, but the encroaching  darkness prevented further exploration.   Their plan to continue their search the next morning was cancelled by  an overnight snowfall that blanketed the ground until spring. When the  two students did return months later, they were astonished by the  amount and variety of the crystals among the rocky ledges. The many  shades of green, red, white, and yellow translucent stones they found  explain why the word ``tourmaline,'' which comes from an ancient  language of Sri Lanka, roughly translates to ``many colors.''   News of the discovery spread, and the region soon became the foremost  hunting grounds in North America for these remarkable gems, rivaling  famous sites in South America and Asia. Among the early Maine rock  hounds was Elijah Hamlin's younger brother Hannibal, who four decades  later would serve as President Lincoln's first Vice President.   Today, Maine tourmaline is treasured by jewelers, artists, and  collectors. Our distinctive watermelon tourmaline, which combines pink,  white, and green in one stone, is especially prized. Residents and  visitors alike delight in searching for these gorgeous stones amid the  marvelous scenery of our western mountains.   The Hamlin Necklace, containing stones of various colors from the  original find, can be seen at the Harvard  [[Page S7035]]  University Mineralogical Museum. In 1972, a spectacular discovery in  Newry, ME, yielded hundreds of pounds of red and green crystals,  including the ``Jolly Green Giant,'' a 10-inch crystal now in the  Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History collection. The State  of Maine tourmaline necklace was designed using Newry gems and  presented to the State in 1975 by the Maine Retail Jewelers  Association.   On Presidents Day 2010, a major discovery included a 120-carat blue  tourmaline crystal, among the most rare of hues. This was named ``The  President'' and was cut into nine gems. The largest was presented as a  gift from the State of Maine to President Barack Obama when he visited  that year.   How and why such large deposits of tourmaline are found in Maine, so  distant from the usual locales, remains a puzzle for geologists to  solve. It is worth noting, however, that tourmaline is said to bestow  on its bearer fearlessness, happiness, and self-confidence--qualities  that define the people of our State.   Mr. President, Maine is renowned for the stunning beauty of its  mountains, forests, and seacoast. The 200th anniversary of the  discovery of tourmaline is a reminder that some of the most beautiful  things are not as readily apparent but are well worth looking for.                            ____________________
