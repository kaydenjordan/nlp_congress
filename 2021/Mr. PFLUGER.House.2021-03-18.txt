 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6.   Bringing an amnesty bill to the floor this week in the middle of a  complete and total crisis on our southern border is not only tone-deaf;  it is wrong.   I traveled to the border on Monday and surveyed the facilities, the  border, and the environment. It is a mess. Thousands of people are  coming across our borders illegally.   If we really cared about children, we would be looking at the  policies that are incentivizing the drug cartels, the traffickers, the  coyotes that are bringing them across, exploiting them in every way. It  is heartbreaking.   Some wish our Nation harm, including the individuals who have been  found out to be on the terror watch list who have been apprehended  crossing the border.   This bill will only incentivize more illegal crossings. What a week  to put this bill to a vote.   We cannot begin to address the issues we are facing when our border  is broken. I implore my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  work with us in a bipartisan manner to secure the border and then move  on.                                time  1400
