 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember  Darby Worth, an activist, a community member of my hometown, and most  importantly, she was one of the teachers at my elementary school.   Mrs. Worth, as I knew her, worked 20 years at Tularcitos Elementary  School, the school where I went and my daughters go today. Now, I  didn't know that at the time, but many years ago before she was a  teacher, she was well versed in environmental and social activism.   By the time she did take up teaching, she had already traveled to San  Francisco many times to protest the Vietnam war. Well after she retired  from Tularcitos, Darby was unrelenting in her commitment to social  justice, women's rights, challenging corporate power, and, yes,  fighting climate change.   She had many movements that she was behind, and it is understandable  considering that she felt strongly that everything is interconnected.  That is why, at 90, she was already planning and fighting the county to  be buried in her front yard.   Madam Speaker, I am not sure if she was laid to rest in that  location, but I do know that Mrs. Worth will always be remembered not  for just being a teacher to children, but because of her  interconnectivity to all of us. She was somebody that we all learned  from.                            ____________________
