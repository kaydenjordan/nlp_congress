 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this week, the President has been traveling across the  country telling Americans how appreciative they should be that  Washington Democrats are spending, or have spent, $1.9 trillion in  borrowed dollars, money they are using to bail out States run by the  President's political buddies and to reward devastating lockdowns that  have destroyed hundreds of thousands of small businesses and kept kids  out of schools; billions on policies that will reduce private-sector  employment in this country; billions on foreign aid.   And out of all the money, less than 9 percent goes towards healthcare  spending to crush the virus and to put vaccinations in people's arms.   The massive debt-inducing spending package also threatens billions in  cuts to seniors on Medicare, including $36 billion starting next year.  My guess is that the President is probably not going to be bragging to  seniors he meets on the road that the bill he signed into law is  cutting billions of dollars from their Medicare, just as I am sure he  won't bother to mention that the economic recovery he wants to take  credit for is already underway; that the economy is steadily projected  to reach the level of real GDP growth we saw prior to the pandemic by  the middle of this year; that we are on track this year, in fact, to  have the largest economic growth in more than 15 years, all without one  dime used from the nearly $2 trillion bailout package that the  Democrats passed in the last week.   In other words, just as President Biden has desperately tried to take  credit for the incredible, truly historic work President Trump did to  ensure that we have vaccines going into the arms to save lives, he is  trying to take credit for an economic recovery put in place by the  policies signed into law by President Trump. Don't listen to the words.  Watch his actions.   In fact, it was under President Trump's leadership that Operation  Warp Speed delivered multiple vaccines in record time with planning to  get those shots in the arms of the American people. Meanwhile, the  Biden administration has spent an inordinate amount of time running  afoul of fact checkers with their shameless rhetoric meant to dismiss  the incredible work done by the previous administration.   Nevertheless, we are here today because Democrats want to fix one of  the many problems caused by President Biden and the House Democrats in  the $1.9 trillion bailout: Those cuts to Medicare. And they want to do  so by erasing almost $2 trillion in spending from the Nation's books;  pretending $2 trillion in spending is not going to happen.    That, of course, serves two purposes for our Democrat colleagues.  First, it avoids the immediate cuts, which they caused and they chose  to happen. Second, it gives them a clean slate on which they are  reportedly already planning to add trillions more in spending in the  months to come.   Given all of this, I would ask my colleagues to move forward with a  much better approach, one that stops their Medicare cuts and does so in  a more responsible way. Let's work together to protect seniors and to  cut waste from their bailout bill that the American people clearly  don't want, such as stopping billions in benefits and payments to  prisoners and illegal immigrants--billions in payments to prisoners and  illegal immigrants; stopping funds they recklessly jammed into the  bailout for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National  Endowment for the Humanities; stopping special handouts to Federal  employees; rescinding billions in bailouts that go to State governments  that do not need it, and reward their continued lockdowns.   Mr. Speaker, put people before politics. Put people before politics.  Put seniors ahead of the Democrats' special interests and their  political class. This is the responsible way to address the Medicare  cuts caused by my Democrat colleagues. It is a far better approach than  to simply pretend $1.9 trillion in spending is not happening. It is a  far more honest approach given the fact that the President is traveling  the country bragging about the same nearly $2 trillion in spending.   Mr. Speaker, $1.9 trillion, such a big number, is hard to put in  proper perspective. But this year, when the American people pay their  Federal income taxes, every single penny--every  [[Page H1591]]  single penny of their hard-earned money the IRS collects will total  less than the cost of this $1.9 trillion bailout to their friends,  donors, and political allies.   Let's do the responsible thing: Protect seniors by rolling back some  of the most wasteful and wrong policies embedded in the Democrat's  bailout bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind the gentleman from New Jersey that  the folks in southeast Missouri, a family of four who makes less than  $55,000 a year, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had zero in tax  liability because of what the Republicans passed.   I don't think a family of four, who makes $55,000 or less, is  considered the wealthy. But apparently maybe someone from New Jersey  might think someone who makes $55,000 for a family of four is wealthy.  It is surely not in southeast Missouri.   I also would like to point out that the gentleman from New Jersey did  not help support in waiving this provision back in 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the body  that the reason we are here today is because of the reckless behavior.  All of these cuts on Medicare are because House Democrats forced  through a nearly $2 trillion spending bill. The reason we have the  paygo statutory provision is because President Obama signed it into law  and House Democrats passed it. So the cuts are the result today of all  the policies that Democrats have been doing since 2010.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), who is the newest member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), one of the leading doctors of the  Republican Conference and a great member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind the  gentlewoman from Illinois that actions speak louder than words, and  that the Democrats did not help the folks in 2017, since the  gentlewoman tried to point out the hypocrisy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I have introduced an alternative, a  more responsible approach that protects our seniors and rolls back some  of the most wasteful and absurd parts of the Democratic bailout bill.   I would encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put  America's seniors ahead of their special interest allies. Join us in  finding a solution that protects and respects America's seniors and the  working class. We will offer such a solution as a motion to recommit.  If adopted, it will instruct the Budget Committee to consider an  amendment to make the sensible cuts in waste offered in H.R. 1999, the  Protect Seniors and Cut Waste Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, let's put the healthcare of our  seniors ahead of prisoners, illegal immigrants, and the political  class.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
