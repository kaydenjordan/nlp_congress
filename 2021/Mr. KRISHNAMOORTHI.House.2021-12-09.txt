 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  good friend, Fred Andes, of Chicago, on receiving J Street's highest  honor, the Tzedek v'Shalom Award. This is the Justice and Peace Award.   No one is more deserving than Fred. I am honored to call him a good  friend and be close with his family, including his lovely wife,  Melanie.   He is empathetic, Fred is generous, and he is a leader in the  community. Fred practices the ancient expression ``tikkun olam'' every  day in repairing the world.   He serves as a co-chair of the U.S. International Advisory Committee  for EcoPeace Middle East. He is also a lay co-chair of the Joint Israel  Committee for the Reconstructing Judaism movement. And he has served as  a critical member of J Street's Chicago Executive Committee.   Fred is one of those people whose actions speak louder than words. We  are so honored by his presence in the community.   Congratulations to Fred, again, in receiving the Tzedek v'Shalom  Award.                            ____________________
