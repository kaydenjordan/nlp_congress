 Madam President, I want to extend the thanks of all  Members of the U.S. Senate and the American people to the men and women  who are serving our Nation at the National Security Agency based at  Fort Meade, MD, the Defense Special Missile and Astronautics Center. It  has been in existence since 1964. It is a 24/7 operation. I mention  that because it was the work done here in the State of Maryland--and I  am proud to represent that State--that gave the early warning  information that allowed us to get information to our American forces  in Iraq and to the Iraqis that, literally, saved lives.   I want to thank them for their dedicated service. We have the best  intelligence information and the best trained people protecting our  Nation, and I just wanted to pause for one moment to thank those who  are serving at the National Security Agency who are keeping us safe.
