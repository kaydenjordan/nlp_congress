 Madam Speaker, I rise today as the proud sponsor of the  resolution honoring Earth Day.   For over 50 years, people have come together on April 22, which is  tomorrow, to support protections for our air, water, and land, and to  increase appreciation for Mother Earth.   But every day, not just on Earth Day, we must commit ourselves to  protecting our planet. We must embrace our shared responsibility to  preserve our Earth, not only by increasing environmental and climate  literacy but by building upon efforts like the Paris Agreement to  ensure that future generations inherit a livable, sustainable, and  ecologically rich planet.   Throughout the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated our  Nation. However, our natural environment, including parks and green  spaces, has been a haven for communities to come together safely.   This past year has reinforced the importance of protecting these  natural spaces and ensuring the continued cleaning and greening of all  communities.   Like those who celebrated the first Earth Day in 1970, tomorrow we  must continue our work to address environmental challenges, large and  small, from climate change to litter; to educate friends, neighbors,  and elected representatives about the need for year-round action; and  to honor the stewardship ethic that serves as the foundation of this  special day.   Together, we can protect our planet, public health, and overall well- being of all people and wildlife.                            ____________________
