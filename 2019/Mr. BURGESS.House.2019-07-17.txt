 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, back home in Texas, 1,500 people  gathered at the Highland Park United Methodist Church on the campus of  SMU to honor the life and legacy of H. Ross Perot.   We lost Mr. Perot just a little over a week ago, at the age of 89.  Mr. Perot had an outsized influence on our State and, indeed, our  Nation.   Mr. Perot was remembered by his children in very touching tributes.   Mr. Perot's accomplishments were too numerous to go into in the space  of a 1-minute talk, but I did want to acknowledge all of the work that  he did on behalf of the United States prisoners of war and, certainly,  his efforts to elucidate the cause and, yes, some treatment for what  was then known as Gulf War Syndrome.   Mr. Perot was a driving force in that, and he should be remembered  for all of the efforts that he put forward for our Nation's  servicemembers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle for yielding the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage  Act.   This legislation would raise the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,  a 107 percent increase over the current rate of $7.25 an hour.   An increase of this magnitude could harm American businesses, could  harm American consumers, and certainly will harm American workers.   The legislation does not consider the labor market, it  disincentivizes job growth, and it has the potential to leave nearly 4  million workers unemployed.   Let us consider the data. The Congressional Budget Office recently  released a report on the effects of mandating a Federal minimum wage in  the United States.    The report explains how more than doubling the minimum wage would  increase unemployment up to 4 million individuals. Four million workers  would have to be laid off to increase wages for a little over 1 million  people.   That means, for each person lifted out of poverty due to a wage  increase, another three individuals will lose their jobs. Why?   I ask my colleagues: Is this a fair tradeoff? This bill creates false  hope for low-wage earners who will be counting on a wage increase and  keeping their job. But what if they don't keep their job? Then it is no  wage at all.   In addition, those who are most likely to lose their jobs are likely  to be minorities, women, and our young people.   Increasing the Federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would have  unintended secondary effects, particularly increasing the risk of  inflation. As wages increase, the cost of doing business will rise as  well. Businesses will be forced to pass on these increased costs by  raising the price of their goods and services. As the costs are passed  on to the consumer, who will be hurt the most?   It is those vulnerable populations at the lower wage scale that this  bill supposedly helps: the Americans who live in poverty.   Congress cannot, in good conscience, pass this legislation, at least,  without understanding the full effects.   In January, the American Enterprise Institute released a report  detailing how the costs of goods have changed over the past 20 years,  controlled for inflation. This study included everything from  televisions to furniture to housing and more.   Unsurprisingly, the products with the most government involvement-- let's use as examples healthcare and education--saw the most rapid  increase in cost.   Is it the intent of the majority to increase prices of many consumer  products and services beyond what would be natural economic inflation?   Congress must also consider how this legislation will impact  different parts of the country in different ways.   Many urban areas have already raised their minimum wage to similar  levels. By the end of this year, New York City and San Francisco will  have minimum wages of $15 an hour. Seattle's two-tiered minimum wage  system goes even further by requiring small employers to pay $15 an  hour and large employers to pay $16 an hour.  [[Page H5928]]    However, in many parts of the country, they simply cannot handle the  burden of a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Rural areas with small mom-and- pop businesses and significantly lower costs of living do not have the  same needs or purchasing priorities as urban dwellers.   A Federal minimum wage should be a floor for all workers, not the  floor for those working and living in the heart of the most expensive  areas of the country.   Even the progressive think tank, The Third Way, lobbied for a  regional minimum wage in place of an across-the-board increase.   If this legislation goes into effect as currently written, it should  be renamed the ``Rural Jobs Killer Act'' because this one-size-fits-all  policy would accomplish just that.                                time  1230    Another consequence of this legislation will be the pricing-out of  individuals who seek to enter the workforce.   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half of low-wage  earners are under 25 years of age. Increasing the Federal minimum wage  to $15 an hour will make it harder for these individuals to compete,  meaning that many will not be able to find work.   As a teenager growing up in Denton, Texas, I worked a lot of  different jobs. I bailed hay, delivered pizzas, and mowed lawns to earn  money for my education. Passing this legislation will eliminate such  opportunities for the young people of today.   With this concern in mind, I offered an amendment to the Raise the  Wage Act to protect opportunities for entry-level workers. My amendment  would ensure that those individuals with less than a year of work  experience have the opportunity to compete in the job market by  allowing an entry-level wage for workers with less than 1 year's  experience.   The initial wage would be set at the current minimum of $7.25 an hour  for the first year. Following that year, the Secretary of Labor would  be authorized to update the entry-level minimum wage using a market- based analysis. The Secretary would be tasked to update this wage every  5 years to keep up with the changing labor and business environment,  instead of a heavyhanded government mandate.   Young Americans and new workers deserve a chance to gain experience  without being priced out of the job market by more experienced job  seekers.   The final downside of a significantly higher Federal minimum wage is  the risk this action has on the rapid automation of many jobs  throughout the economy. Automation in stores, vehicles, and assembly  lines could make many of our everyday tasks more efficient and  convenient. However, the new technologies will likely displace those  who are not trained for other occupations.   There is a compelling commercial that one of our fast-food franchises  has today that details the path of a young woman who gets her first job  at one of these restaurants. Then, it sort of details her progress in  every stage along the way. They say her name, and she gets the job. She  gets promotions. She gets into school. She is the first in her family  to walk across the stage at graduation.   But wouldn't it be ironic if, instead of that young woman's name,  they would have a kiosk from the same fast-food franchise. The kiosk is  actually advancing through the university, the artificial intelligence  university. Eventually, the kiosk may sit in the Speaker's chair one  day.   Look, that is not the future we want. We want to empower our young  people. We want to be able to give them work experience and allow them  to work and grow.   It is a beautiful commercial. I think they have done a wonderful job  telling that experience. But ironically, I think of that now when I go  into that same restaurant. I am able to order a cup of coffee off the  kiosk, and I never have to interact with an actual human at all.   Increasing the minimum wage by 107 percent across the country will  expedite this process quicker than the pace of innovation ever would.   My fellow Texas Representative, freshman Representative Ron Wright,  brought this concern to the attention of his colleagues at the House  Education and Labor Committee. During consideration of this bill, Mr.  Wright offered an amendment that required the Government Accountability  Office to study the impact of the minimum wage on the loss of jobs due  to automation and would stop the minimum wage hike if this job loss  rose to half a million jobs. That seems reasonable.   Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the dais in the  Education and Labor Committee rejected his concerns and his amendment.   With that said, I commend my Democratic colleagues for their efforts  to support the disability community with the inclusion of H.R. 873, the  Transformation to Competitive Employment Act.   Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Department of Labor is able  to grant employers 14(c) certificates. These certificates give  employers the legal right to pay disabled employees' wages below  minimum wage, officially called subminimum wages. This unfair policy  enables individuals with disabilities to be exploited under the guise  of integrating them into society.   However, a 2001 GAO report found that only 5 percent of disabled  workers at workshops that used the 14(c) certificates found employment  outside of these facilities. Little to no training took place, and  there was minimal integration into our modern society. Some workers,  unfortunately, were paid as little as 4 cents an hour.   This issue was brought to my attention by a constituent of mine,  Blake Pyron. Blake is a hardworking Texan. He owns his own business in  Sanger, Texas.   Blake happens to have Down syndrome. He was the first person with  Down syndrome in the State of Texas to start his own business, and he  has been an advocate for those with disabilities for years. Blake is  proof that being differently abled does not change the value of one's  life or one's labor.   Congress should continue to allow real wage growth to take place  through a thriving labor market. By avoiding burdensome Federal  mandates, by reducing expenses, by reducing red tape, Americans will  see gains in productivity and wages, allowing for more employment, not  less.   We don't have to look very far to see an example of this. Over the  past 2 years, the United States has seen unprecedented low levels of  unemployment and record-high rates of wage growth. Due to comprehensive  tax reform passed by the last Congress in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  American companies have been able to reinvest in their employees and  projects like never before.   Due to the Trump administration's effort to reform and rein in  overbearing and obstructive Federal regulations, the economy is no  longer being held back.   With 7 million unfilled jobs in the United States today, the best way  to raise wages is to let the power of capitalism work and allow  companies to compete for workers. I urge opposition to the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes for the purpose of  response.   The gentleman, Mr. Morelle, was not here in 2007, the last time the  minimum wage vote was taken.   The Speaker of the House was the same Speaker of the House that we  have now. The minimum wage was raised. I don't know if the gentleman  remembers what happened in the year and a half following that, but job  losses in this country were staggering. I am not saying it was a one- to-one relationship, but it certainly set the stage. The economy may  have already been softening, but it really did accelerate the job  losses that occurred in the recession of 2008.   Now, the gentleman correctly points out that 1.3 million people would  get a raise. That comes at the expense of 4 million people who would  see their employment eliminated by raising the minimum wage. Is that  really the direction we want to go?   His jurisdiction has raised the minimum wage. Any jurisdiction that I  represent is free to raise the minimum wage to whatever level it wants.  A city in my district may say that it is not going to negotiate with a  contractor that pays less than $15 an hour. That is fine. That is its  job. That is its prerogative. It may do so, but it will find itself in  competition with other jurisdictions that perhaps will not be so  onerous.   Look, I was an employer not too terribly long ago, and I recognized,  in the full-employment economy of the 1990s, that if I posted a job,  the most entry-level job in my medical practice, for a minimum wage  hire, I was wasting my money. No one was going to respond to that ad  because no one worked for minimum wage in the late 1990s during the  tech boom. Everyone had jobs that paid higher than the minimum wage.    That should be our aspirational goal, to have an economy that pays  more than what a baseline economy would pay.   I sat on the Joint Economic Committee for the first several years of  the Obama administration. It was a difficult time in this country.  Christina Romer and Mr. Summer would tell us that the country's best  days were behind us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Now, we find ourselves emerging into a new area of our economy, a new  area of economic freedom. Why don't we embrace that?   Look, if we really wanted to do something to help people at the lower  end of the wage scale, we would be working seriously on border  security. We wouldn't have off-the-books labor competing with the  lowest wage earners in this country. We would fix that problem as a  United States Congress. That might have been a better effort than what  we spent our day doing yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to read from  the Congressional Budget Office report.   The paragraph that says, ``Effects of the $15 option on employment  and income,'' ends with the sentence ``a reduction of 3.7 million  workers.'' And there is also the little item of an $8.7 billion loss in  family income.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, first, just want to remark that--I think, the last 11 months are  the last figures I saw--over the last 11 months wage growth in this  country has increased more than at any time in recent memory.   Wage growth is a lagging indicator, but it is happening, and that is  a good thing, and we should celebrate that. There would be no reason to  put the brakes on that that I can see.   I think we should be encouraged that that is happening, and I don't  think we should be doing things to the economy that would be  detrimental and reverse that trend.   But let me just say at this point, if we defeat the previous  question, Republicans will amend the rule to immediately bring up H.R.  748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act, or Cadillac Tax  Repeal Act, and include the text of H.R. 1398, the Health Insurance Tax  Relief Act, and H.R. 2207, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, or the  medical device tax repeal.   Legislation in previous Congresses to repeal the Cadillac tax has  gathered strong support and brought employers and labor unions together  in their efforts to eliminate this tax.   Since the Cadillac tax is calculated only based on insurance  premiums, it could unfairly target those already struggling with higher  healthcare costs and affect middle-income workers, including teachers  and nurses, due to the continuing rise of health insurance costs.   H.R. 748 would repeal this tax in its entirety.   I would also like to note my support for the repeal of the medical  device tax and to delay the health insurance tax.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my good friend.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text  of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, with this bill, the Democrats seek to  increase wages for millions of low wage earners, but the Congressional  Budget Office estimates that it will also result in nearly 4 million  lost jobs. These job losses will disproportionately impact entry-level  workers and students.   That is why I offered an amendment to allow a market-based entry- level wage for workers with less than a year of experience, but  Democrats on the Committee on Rules rejected that amendment during the  Rules meeting. There was no reason not to make the amendment in order;  they just rejected it.   A $15 Federal minimum wage is a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate  that does not consider differences in cost of living or employment  patterns across the country.   Federal assistance is meant to be a temporary hand up to aid  individuals on the path to a better economic future, but rather than  pulling people up, this bill will leave more Americans reaching for  assistance.   Republican concerns with this bill are not partisan; they are  American.   If the majority is serious about increasing the wages of all  Americans throughout the country, they should work--they should work-- in a bipartisan manner to draft a bill that has a chance of passing in  the Senate and making it to the President's desk. Unfortunately, this  bill is another partisan political priority that really has no chance  of becoming law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
