 Madam Chair, I will speak briefly to two amendments  that were included in the MILCON appropriations bill.   Specifically, one, amendment 24 ensures the funding for Veterans  Health Administration, it ensures that we are dedicated to assisting  veterans with disabilities and those with mental health and substance  abuse challenges. Of course, as a Nation, we owe a great deal of  gratitude to these men and women, and regardless of whether these are  emotional or physical scars, this amendment ensures that we continue to  provide appropriate access.   Additionally, amendment 25 ensures funding for the VA electronic  health records which, of course, is critically important to our  veterans, that we continue to modernize the system to help  transitioning veterans access and receive top-quality care at VA  facilities.   At the same time, we need to ensure the safety and effectiveness of  updating this program. The VA and Congress must work in lockstep to  create a system that better serves our veterans and taxpayers.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues for consideration of these  amendments.
