 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of this joint  resolution.   Earlier today, our colleagues in the United States Senate  overwhelmingly passed this bill. I believe it was 83-16.   At this point in time, I would like to begin by thanking my  colleagues in the House: Mrs. Lowey, the chairman of the committee; Ms.  Roybal-Allard, the distinguished subcommittee chairman; and Ms.  Granger, the ranking member. And I have been privileged to serve, Mr.  Speaker, as the ranking member, the highest Republican, on the House  Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee.   Where were we? From time to time, in our great Republic, we hit a  blip; we have a problem; we run into a difficulty. We did that in this  shutdown. This was a very odd situation. We had actually passed five  appropriations bills, and seven were left remaining.   Mr. Speaker, that put us in a very awkward situation where there was  a partial government shutdown. I heard the rhetoric on both sides of  the aisle, and I know it was sincere, but it hurt. It hurt our country,  and it hurt workers. But we reopened the government.   In the interim, Members of the House from both parties and Members of  the Senate from both parties came together and convened. There was a  wide, wide difference of opinion on that first day. I heard it. I was  in that room. Everyone was acting in good faith, strong-held  convictions.   A lot of naysayers and skeptics and cynics said we weren't going to  get there, but we owed it to the American people to get there. And, Mr.  Speaker, we got there.   We didn't get there with a bill that I would have drawn. My bill,  candidly, would look more like the bill that President Trump would have  wanted: more money for border security and more money for ICE. But we  came up with an agreement that the vast majority of Americans could  support and the vast majority of Members in both Houses could support.                                time  2015    And that is what I think the American people need to look to: Where  did we agree?   We agreed in this great bill for increased funding for our beloved  ally in the Middle East, Israel.   Just in this Chamber the other day, Members of both parties condemned  anti-Semitism, as we must. We backed that commitment up with our full  support and unprecedented funding for our ally, Israel. We can all be  proud of that.   We, Mr. Speaker, came together with a compromise bill that will have  some new border wall--not as much as I would have wanted. We will have  more ICE beds--not as many as I would have wanted.   But, Mr. Speaker, I have been in this Chamber for 8 years. I saw us  come together and work together. My colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, sometimes our differences are bipartisan, sometimes our  differences are bicameral. Today, we are going to come together as  Americans and pass this bill.   It is not a great bill, but it is a good bill. It represents  compromise, and it will, I believe, restore the faith of the American  people, not only in our institutions, but in our great Republic.   We can be proud that we came together when they said ``can't'' and we  said ``can.''   So I will vow to continue, as we work forward, to work with Ms.  Roybal-Allard, a very fine lady. We view the world sometimes  differently; sometimes we view it in a very similar light. But as we go  into 2020 and we fall under the draconian Budget Control Act, the  dreaded sequester, we will have to address that. We will have a debt  ceiling vote.   The American people need to know our work will not be easier; it will  be harder. But let our resolve be to do the work of the American  people, as we have done today and we will do in the future.   May God bless the United States of America.
