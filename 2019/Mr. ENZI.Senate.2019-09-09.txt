 Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, PL 16-37,  included an instruction to the chairman of the Senate Committee on the  Budget to file allocations, aggregates, and budgetary levels in the  Senate as soon as practicable. Today, I rise to submit the required  filing found in that act.   Specifically, sections 204 and 206 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019 require the chairman to file, No. 1, allocations for fiscal year  2020 for the Committee on Appropriations; No. 2, allocations for fiscal  years 2020, 2020 through 2024, and 2020 through 2029 for committees  other than the Committee on Appropriations; No. 3, aggregate spending  levels for fiscal year 2020; No. 4, aggregate revenue levels for fiscal  year 2020, 2020 through 2024, and 2020 through 2029; No. 5, aggregate  levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2020 through 2024,  and 2020 through 2029 for Social Security; and, No. 6, a list of  accounts eligible to receive advance appropriations.   The figures included in this filing are consistent with the  discretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019 and the Congressional Budget Office's May 2019 baseline, as  adjusted to reflect legislation enacted since the publication of the  baseline. In instances where enforceable discretionary levels are  required to be adjusted for spending designated as an emergency  pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, as  amended, including funding in both the Additional Supplemental  Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019, PL 116-20, and the  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance  [[Page S5355]]  and Border Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019, PL 116-26, those  adjustments are included.   In addition to the update for enforceable limits above, section 204  of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 allows for the deficit-neutral  reserve funds included in title III of the fiscal year 2018  congressional budget resolution--H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress--to be  updated by 2 fiscal years. Pursuant to this authority, all deficit- neutral reserve funds in the aforementioned title of the fiscal year  2018 congressional budget resolution are updated and available for use.   For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is  found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all  fiscal years.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables detailing  enforcement in the Senate be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   ALLOCATION OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS                           FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020   [Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and      Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 ($ Billions)] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Budget Authority       Outlays ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Appropriations:     Revised Security Category                 666.500                n/a      Discretionary Budget      Authority \1\................

The budget authority for the revised   nonsecurity category and outlays have been adjusted in this table ($8   million in budget authority and $6,251 million in outlays, in total)   to reflect enactment of the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for   Disaster Relief Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-20) and the Emergency Supplemental   Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the   Southern Border Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-26), both of which included   appropriations that were designated as emergencies pursuant to section   251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA.
