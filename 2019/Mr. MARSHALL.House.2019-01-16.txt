 Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a small town in Kansas, and  perhaps the most respected person in the city was our family physician,  Dr. Norman Oberholtzer.   Dr. Oberholtzer delivered my brother, my sister, and, of course, me.  He saved my life. He had saved many people's lives. By the time I was  in 9th grade, I knew I wanted to be a physician just like Dr.  Oberholtzer. I worked hard and with the support of my family and  friends was able to get into medical school, and by the time I was a  second-year resident, I was supposed to decide what type of physician  was I going to be.   Go back to February of 1987, and we had our first baby, a little girl  named Lauren. And the second she was born, the moment I heard her first  cry, I said: This is what I want to do. I want to deliver babies the  rest of my life.   So as an obstetrician for the next 30 years, every day I got to see  10, 20, 40, sometimes 50 pregnant women. It was a great experience and  there were some very special visits that I really looked forward to  with those moms. Their first visit for a first-time mom was always a  special moment.   The moms came in. They had a twinkle in their eyes and they may have  been throwing up for 3 or 4 or 5 days already, but there was still a  sparkle in their eye and excitement.                                time  1100    Sometimes I would get to do a sonogram at that first visit. Believe  it or not, about a month after conception, Mr. Speaker, you can see a  baby's heartbeat. They would come back at about 12 weeks for their next  visit. By then, their nausea was improving, and we could hear a baby's  heartbeat on the Doppler for the first time.   They came back again at about 18 weeks, and I would ask them: Do you  feel the baby move yet?   Again, the mom's eyes would sparkle that they are feeling that baby  move. I would notice when I would touch the mom and when I would touch  the baby, the baby would push back. If there was maybe a brother or a  sister in the room, if that brother or sister spoke, I could feel the  baby move, and I could actually hear the heart rate increase of that  little baby inside that mom.   Then, of course, later on, the favorite moment of my entire life was  always getting to hear that first cry of that newborn and give that  baby to a proud mom and dad.   So those are great, great times.   Mr. Speaker, I am often asked when I think life begins. I hope you  can relate from the stories I just shared that I don't have any other  choice but to believe that life begins at conception and that those  babies are people, and they deserve our respect and our protection.   Mr. Speaker, this week, we will be welcoming 200,000 people to  Washington, D.C., for the March for Life.   I especially salute some students who are coming from Beloit, Kansas,  and Concordia, Kansas. Like many students, they will be riding a bus  for 24 hours. I am so proud of them, and I look forward to seeing them.  I appreciate their efforts to put their words into actions.  [[Page H612]]    Mr. Speaker, as a doctor for over 25 years, I have delivered  thousands of babies. I certainly understand the responsibility I have  as a Member of Congress to protect the life of the unborn. In the last  2 years, this House, thanks to a Republican majority, has passed  countless bills to limit abortion, end taxpayer-subsidized abortion,  and prohibit abortions of unborn babies over 20 weeks. Unfortunately,  these bills never made it to the President's desk.   Today, the United States is one of seven countries in the world that  allows babies old enough to feel pain and survive outside the womb to  be torn limb from limb. This list of seven includes China, North Korea,  Singapore, Vietnam, and a list of other human rights offenders that our  Nation, this country, should not be proud to be part of.   Each year, more than 600,000 abortions are performed across this  country, costing our country precious lives. The fact is, only one in  seven Americans support legal-under-all-circumstances Roe v. Wade, and  still, Congress refuses to act.   Over the course of my first term, I made it a top priority to fight  for those who can't fight for themselves, and I will continue to do so.  Abortions are an injustice to the unborn and are a complete disregard  for life. Congress should prevent taxpayer money from ever being  funneled into immoral organizations like Planned Parenthood and finally  put an end to abortion. I will unapologetically stand with the  children, with these babies, who do not have a voice of their own to  fight.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on April 3, 1968, the Reverend Martin  Luther King gave what the world didn't know would be his final speech.  Seven times in that address, Dr. King said, ``But I wouldn't stop  there,'' as he spoke of his dreams for a better world.  [[Page H664]]    This Martin Luther King Jr. Day, it is critical that we not forget  the many lessons Dr. King taught us, lessons that emphasize ways to  treat our peers and our neighbors with respect, despite our  differences, in order to make the dream of a better and more unified  tomorrow possible.   That message should resonate today more than ever to my peers in this  Chamber.   I have been thinking of this a lot lately, what Dr. King might say if  he was here with us today, as he might see the divisive partisanship  that lives among these halls, and I think he would deliver one clear  message: We must unify to make meaningful changes. We must bridge the  gaps that divide our Nation by working together to find common good  civilly.   It is no secret that division brings pain and disables our capacity  to solve problems.   As Martin Luther King said in his last speech in Tennessee, ``I  wouldn't stop there.''                            ____________________
