 Mr. Speaker, every time I visit Israel, I have such  mixed feelings. It is a land of positive opportunities surrounded by  intractable controversies.   The big question looming is how to achieve a two-state solution for  the Israelis and the Palestinians with appropriate integrity so that  they are actually separate countries. This has raised additional  questions because of the ambiguity from the Trump administration about  whether or not what, for years, has been American policy supporting a  two-state solution is any longer a priority of theirs.   For several years, I have been deeply concerned about the looming  environmental crisis in Gaza. This is a small strip of land about twice  the size of Washington, D.C., but it is home to 1.9 million people,  most of whom are leading a wretched existence, even more so since  Hamas, the political faction, has seized control. That is Israel's  implacable enemy which now controls Gaza.   They have little regard for their own people, using them as pawns,  spending scarce resources, digging tunnels to try to kidnap Israeli  children and soldiers, and launching rockets to terrorize Israeli  communities in the surrounding areas.                                time  1015    Gaza has reached a crisis point in dealing with water and sanitation.  The groundwater is so polluted that virtually all the water is unfit to  drink--polluted by sewage, waste runoff, and seawater encroachment.  They are pumping four times as much water out of the aquifer than can  be replaced naturally, and seawater from the Mediterranean is  encroaching.   We are told that, by the end of the year, there will probably be no  sources of drinking water that are fit to drink. By 2020, the entire  water system will be permanently damaged. Because of problems with  drinking water that is not fit and raw sewage that is not treated,  there is a real likelihood that we could have an outbreak of something  like cholera, threatening not just the people in Gaza, but the Israelis  as well.   Several times recently, sewage from Gaza has washed up on Israeli  beaches and forced the shutdown of water treatment plants from  desalinization. The Israeli military thinks this is a security threat.   In the course of this visit, I had an opportunity to put the question  directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu; Jibril Rajoub, the number three  person in the Palestinian Authority; and United States Ambassador  Friedman about this pending crisis and the need for urgent action.  Sadly, each of those conversations revealed I won't say indifference,  but certainly a lack of urgency and no willingness for anybody to take  the lead and break the impasse.   This is not a problem that is beyond our ability to solve. There are  opportunities to increase electricity for pumping water and treating  sewage. There is the capacity to build some smaller reservoirs to be  able to mix saltwater with freshwater and extend the supplies.   For Israel, water is a mystery they have solved. They are the most  water-rich country on the face of the planet, with very sophisticated  technology. They could provide additional resources. Around the edges,  the United States does some work with USAID, but it is not a priority  for the United States at this point.   Mr. Speaker, I return perplexed. We will continue to push with the  Israelis, the United States Government, the Palestinians, and with NGOs  whenever we have the opportunity. But it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, if  we cannot bring people together to solve a pending crisis with tools  that are available to us now, at a relatively modest cost, what hope do  we have of being able to work cooperatively to implement the two-state  solution and be able to bring peace and security to Israel and the  Palestinians?   I would hope my colleagues would lend their voices to this question.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 505, line 21, strike ``The'' and insert ``Subject to       the limitation in subsection (c), the''.        Page 506, after line 14, insert the following new       subsection:        (c) Limitation.--The program of record in subsection (a)       shall not be established, and none of the funds authorized to       be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for       fiscal year 2018 for this section may be obligated or       expended, until--        (1) the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional       defense committees, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives that--        (A) a Nuclear Posture Review has been completed after       January 20, 2017;        (B) a ground-launched intermediate-range missile is the       preferred military system, in terms of cost, capability, and       command, control, and communications arrangements, for       ensuring that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's       overall deterrence and defense posture remains credible,       flexible, resilient, and adaptable in the face of a deployed       Russian ground-launched intermediate-range missile; and        (C) a ground-launched intermediate-range missile is the       preferred military system for maintaining strategic stability       with the Russian Federation at reasonable cost, while hedging       against potential technical problems or vulnerabilities; and        (2) the Secretary of State certifies to the congressional       defense committees, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives that--        (A) the program of record established in subsection (a),       and the expenditure of funds to research or develop such a       ground-launched intermediate-range missile, is necessary to       the Secretary of State's efforts to verifiably return Russia       to full compliance with the INF Treaty;        (B) at least one NATO Member State government, within a       range appropriate to provide counterforce capabilities to       prevent intermediate-range ground-launched missile attacks       against any NATO Party or to provide countervailing strike       capabilities to enhance the forces of the United States or       allies of the United States, has completed the necessary       legal and constitutional requirements for an agreement to       host a ground-launched intermediate-range missile; and        (C) the North Atlantic Council has endorsed the deployment       of a ground-launched intermediate-range missile.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Chair, my amendment deletes language in this bill  that would mandate a program of record, green lighting this proposal  for road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges that, if  tested or deployed, would violate the United States' obligations under  the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.   For more than four decades, the United States and Russia have worked  through bilateral agreements to reduce their nuclear weapons  stockpiles, saving money, and making the world safer.   Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were at the forefront  of this effort with the START 1 and START II treaties.   There is a longstanding precedent of carefully negotiating these  treaties in a bipartisan fashion because these leaders knew that a  world with less of these weapons meant a safer world for all of us.   Yet over the last several years, our nuclear weapons proliferation  has continued on autopilot. Right now we are on track to spend $1.2  trillion on unneeded nuclear weapons. In fact, the Pentagon has  concluded that already the United States' security needs could be met  with one-third fewer strategic warheads deployed than New START limits  of 1,550.   We can and should safely right-size the arsenal as envisioned by  Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush. That is why these treaties  are so important. They hold us and our adversaries accountable.   We see some confusing signals from the administration, at times  appearing to favor nuclear escalation, but at the same time being  deeply concerned about managing costs.   President Trump has demonstrated a lack of clear understanding of  these treaties, but even his administration is fearful that the  language undermining the treaty in this bill ``unhelpfully ties them to  a specific missile system.''   Congress should be playing a lead role in getting us back on track  with smarter defense spending, not working to abandon this nuclear  nonproliferation legacy that Ronald Reagan and Bush, Sr., fought so  hard for.   We can't simply fund every weapons program on the list while  fulfilling other critical obligations like providing for our military  personnel, ensuring we have adequate cybersecurity protections,  strengthening our command and control infrastructure, not to mention  our non-Defense Department programs like foreign assistance and  diplomacy.   We have a poor track record when it comes to carefully managing and  budgeting implementation of our weapons programs.   The House continues this poor record now. Why would we establish a  program of record for something that our military, our diplomats, and  our NATO allies haven't asked for?   Rather than rushing to adopt this program and abandoning a key  international treaty in the process, let's think this through. Let's do  our homework to make sure our allies, the Departments of Defense and  State are all on the same page, and develop a coherent approach to  bring Russia back into compliance, rather than throw money at yet  another unnecessary weapons program and undercut that regime.   This takes our eye off the ball and could have unintended and, I  think in some instances, devastating consequences.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  amendment for smarter defense spending and the protection of a landmark  treaty that is part of the legacy of Ronald Reagan and George H. W.  Bush.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the amount of time I  have remaining?   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Chair, the question is how to get Russia into  compliance. Walking away from our obligations? I think not.   The amendment allows going ahead if the Department of Defense  certifies to Congress that it has completed a new nuclear posture  review to make sure this program fits in the overall strategy; that it  certifies that it prefers this program to ensure that NATO's overall  deterrence and defense posture remains credible; that the Department of  Defense certified it prefers this missile for maintaining strategic  stability; that State certifies the program of record is necessary to  help verifiably return Russia to compliance; that at least one NATO  member state has proven it is serious about hosting the missile; and  State certifies that the full Atlantic Council has endorsed deployment  of this missile.   Those are the conditions in the amendment, and I would think they are  reasonable conditions that the gentleman should not object to. If he  truly believes in the merit of his argument, there is no reason that  that cannot be complied with. And if not, it should not proceed.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed.           Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Wilson of South Carolina    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add the following       new section:       SEC._12_. RESTRICTION ON FUNDING FOR THE PREPARATORY                     COMMISSION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR-TEST-                    BAN TREATY ORGANIZATION.         (a) Statement of Policy.--Congress declares that United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2310 (September 23, 2016)       does not obligate the United States nor does it impose an       obligation on the United States to refrain from actions that       would run counter to the object and purpose of the       Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.        (b) Restriction on Funding.--        (1) In general.--No United States funds may be made       available to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive       Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.        (2) Exception.--The restriction under paragraph (1) shall       not apply with respect to the availability of United States       funds for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty       Organization's International Monitoring System.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the amendment to  restrict the funding from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  Organization while still providing funds for the international  monitoring system.   The purpose is simple. Congress never ratified the Comprehensive  Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. It is irresponsible to the taxpayer and  contradictory for the United States to financially support an  organization that the United States has never officially joined or  contributed funds for a treaty that was never enacted.   The amendment clearly continues to fund the international monitoring  system to improve our global and nuclear detection capability, and  returns us to the longstanding responsible policies from President  George W. Bush's administration.   This amendment makes it clear that protecting American families is  the job of Congress, not an unaccountable international body. As we see  a rise in threats around the world, our nuclear deterrence capability  is crucial to promote our ability to preserve peace. It is also  important that the United States does not require adherence to this  treaty in order to continue our self-imposed moratorium on testing  nuclear weapons of any size or of any kind.   However, as we live in a world of increasing threats, we should not  bind the United States to an agreement that other nuclear powers like  China and Russia do not adhere to.   The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has never been enacted so  there is no change in policy or outcome by supporting this amendment,  just a saving of taxpayers' dollars.  [[Page H5731]]    Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        At the end of subtitle G of title XVI, add the following       new section:       SEC. 16__. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR LONG-RANGE STANDOFF                     WEAPON.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, in any fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense may not       obligate or expend more than $95,600,000 on development of       the long-range standoff weapon or any other nuclear-capable       air-launched cruise missile, and the Secretary of Energy may       not obligate or expend more than $220,253,000 on the life       extension program for the W80-4 warhead, until the Secretary       of Defense, in consultation with the heads of other relevant       Federal agencies, submits to the appropriate congressional       committees a Nuclear Posture Review that includes a detailed       and specific assessment of the following:        (1) The anticipated capabilities of the long-range standoff       weapon to hold targets at risk beyond other already existing       and planned nuclear-capable delivery systems.        (2) The anticipated ability of the long-range standoff       weapon to elude adversary integrated air and missile defenses       compared to the B-21 bomber.        (3) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff       weapon on strategic stability relative to other nuclear-armed       countries.        (4) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff       weapon on the offensive nuclear weapons capabilities and       programs of other nuclear-armed countries.        (5) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff       weapon on the response of other nuclear-armed countries to       proposals to decrease or halt the growth of their nuclear       stockpiles.        (6) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff       weapon on the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.        (b) Form.--The Nuclear Posture Review required by       subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but       may include a classified annex.        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on       Foreign Relations of the Senate; and        (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, it is time to insert fiscal sanity into our nuclear  weapons planning. We are set to spend $400 billion over the next decade  and $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years to recapitalize our entire  nuclear arsenal. This nuclear escalation will build a force far  exceeding what the Pentagon and security experts have said is necessary  to deter a nuclear threat.   A stronger nuclear program is not going to help us deal with the  strategic challenges we face today, like the fight the against Islamic  State, but it will result in having to crowd out Army, Navy, and Air  Force conventional priorities.   We need to revisit the strategy. We are here in Congress to make hard  decisions about how to spend taxpayer dollars. The Pentagon should  provide long-term cost reports and tell us what certain weapons will  actually add to our existing capacity.   My amendment deals with one particular outrageous piece of this  unsustainable escalation: the long-range standoff weapon, or the LRSO.  Now, this weapon is projected to cost $20 billion to $30 billion.   This amendment would lock the LRSO funding at fiscal year 2017 levels  until the administration submits a Nuclear Posture Review to Congress  that includes a detailed assessment of why we need this weapon. It  wouldn't prevent it. It would just keep the funding at the current  level until they can tell us why we need it.   Until the administration carefully examines the utility of the LRSO,  why should we rush its development? After all, the father of this  device, former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, has argued there is  scant justification for spending tens of billions of dollars on that  weapon. General Mattis has stated numerous times that he is not sold on  the LRSO.   We shouldn't risk making tens of billions of dollars in commitments  like this with potential failure to follow through all while forfeiting  other critical priorities. Before we continue this nuclear escalation  on autopilot, let's make sure.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the ranking  member.    Mr. Chairman, I am stunned to think that this is  somehow the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.   The amendment says that the funding level for this new program would  remain at the current fiscal year level until the administration  submits a nuclear posture review to Congress that indicates a detailed  assessment of why we need the weapon.   If what the gentleman says is true--and I get mixed signals from the  Secretary--then they can easily do that. They are not cut off. It has  nothing to do with unilateral disarmament. We have more than enough  nuclear weapons to destroy these countries many times over.   My friend, Mr. Smith, talks about other priorities, from  cybersecurity to what is happening with ISIS. Lavishing funds on  programs that have not yet been justified and can't meet this test is  not worthy. You have other things that you want to help the Department  of Defense do, which I think we share.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge approval of this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will  be postponed.                  Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. McClintock    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14  printed in part B of House Report 115-212.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        Strike section 2702.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, our current defense spending is about  where it was at the very peak of the Reagan defense buildup after  adjusting for inflation. It is about the same as the next eight most  powerful military forces on the planet, combined. Six of those eight  are already our allies.   The President has proposed adding $54 billion to this. That is the  equivalent of adding more than the entire military establishment of  Great Britain to what we already have.   Yet we are told, and I do not doubt, that much of our military force  is ill equipped and unready for combat. If that is the case, it is not  a fiscal problem; it is a management problem. We seem to care how much  money is being spent, but not how it is being spent. That is a  catastrophic failure of congressional oversight.   In recent years, the Pentagon has warned that its infrastructure is  22 percent bigger than necessary. It has asked Congress for another  round of Base Realignment and Closure reviews. Just last month,  Secretary Mattis urged resumption of BRAC. He believes it will save $2  billion a year and $20 billion over 10 years. That is enough money to  buy 120 FA-18 Super Hornets, 300 more AH-64 helicopters, or four  Virginia class submarines if only Congress would get out of the way and  allow unneeded bases to close or consolidate.   The Pentagon has the authority to close or consolidate bases on  foreign soil, but in the NDAA Congress blocks its authority to close or  consolidate unnecessary bases on our own soil.   My amendment removes the NDAA prohibition on this needed process and  allows BRAC to move forward as our President has requested. His  Statement of Administration Policy on NDAA is crystal clear: ``While  the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to authorize a Base  Realignment and Closure round, which would result in substantial  recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force  reduction.''   I have heard three objections:   First, we are told the upfront costs of consolidation can be high.  But the results are now in, and the first four  [[Page H5736]]  BRAC rounds are saving us $7 billion a year.   Second, we are told local economies depend on these bases, but  experience tells us that communities rapidly recover by freeing these  assets for productive commercial use.   Third, we are told to wait until we finished expanding our forces,  but the excess capacity estimate already assumes force expansion, and a  new round of BRAC will only wring out a small portion of the  overcapacity.   When we squander billions of defense dollars keeping obsolete  military bases open in order to satisfy congressional constituencies,  we directly rob our military forces of the resources that we are  constantly reminded that they desperately need.   There is an old saying that you can't fill a broken bucket by pouring  more water in it. At some point, you have got to fix the bucket. That  is our responsibility. We need to take it more seriously.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the efforts by Mr. McClintock,  but simply put, now is not the time to consider a Base Realignment and  Closure.   In the past, BRAC has been used without conducting a thorough study,  has incurred significant costs and jeopardized valuable military  communities, such as those of the Midlands of South Carolina  surrounding Fort Jackson or the Aiken-Barnwell community that I  represent adjacent to Fort Gordon, Georgia.   If facilities are shuttered, the existing secure assets will not be  reasonably replicated. In testimony before the House Armed Services  Committee just last month, Secretary Jim Mattis stated that he also has  reservations about the BRAC assessments.   It is also important to be clear: BRAC is not a proven cost-saving  measure. The last BRAC cost 67 percent more than planned to carry out,  dramatically reducing any projected savings.   It would be undermining to our national security and to communities  around the Nation to close down military installations without a  comprehensive study, especially as the military works to grow the force  to address emerging threats around the globe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member.
