 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans have made it clear  that they do not support liberty, justice, and equal protection under  the law for all.   Last week, the majority passed an extremist defense bill that bans  gender-affirming and reproductive care for servicemembers, guts support  for our servicemembers of color, and prohibits Pride flags from being  displayed in any workspace, common access area, or public area of the  Department of Defense.   However, they decided that the homophobia and discrimination can't  stop there.   This week, Republicans voted to strip critical funding to enhance  career development opportunities, provide meals to low-income seniors,  create affordable and transitional housing units for vulnerable  populations in need, and more.   These projects, led by Representatives Boyle, Pressley, and Houlahan,  were vetted months ago to ensure they meet the rigorous community  project funding guidelines and are responsible uses of taxpayer  dollars.   So why were these projects denied? Because recipients had LGBTQ in  their name, and they served communities that the other side demonizes  daily. It is hypocritical, it is homophobic, and it damages the idea of  liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________
