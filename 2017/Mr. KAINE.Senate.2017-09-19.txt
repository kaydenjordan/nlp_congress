 Mr. President, I rise to talk about a topic that is  consuming much attention--our efforts to improve healthcare for  Americans. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010,  Americans with preexisting conditions faced serious barriers. Since  2010, the rate of uninsured Americans has declined to a historic low,  with 20 million more Americans--the combined population of 16 or 17  States--getting access to health insurance coverage.   Over 410,000 Virginians have received care through individual  marketplaces just last year. An additional 400,000 would be eligible to  receive Medicaid if Virginia ever chooses to expand it. Since being put  on the HELP Committee or being notified I would be put on it in  December, I visited community health centers, medical schools,  behavioral treatment centers, nursing programs all across Virginia  talking to people about their healthcare needs. I am committed to  working together with my colleagues to improve the healthcare of  Virginians and Americans. There is a right way and a wrong way to do  it.   After there was the failure of an effort in late July or early August  to pass a partisan repeal and replacement of ObamaCare using the budget  reconciliation process, the success of which would have taken health  insurance away from 20 million Americans, I am disappointed that we  haven't learned the lesson about the right way to do this and are  apparently poised to explore yet again doing it the wrong way.  [[Page S5843]]    There is a proposal on the table that is designated the Graham- Cassidy proposal, and it is just as threatening as the ACA repeal we  voted on just 2 months ago. It restructures traditional Medicaid  funding using per capita caps and block grants. The core of this bill  is an effort to dramatically go after, restructure, and shrink  Medicaid, which is critical to so many people.   It ends protections for people with preexisting conditions by  allowing States to essentially rewrite essential health benefits. It  would eliminate Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act  subsidies and replace them with a block grant that would be  insufficient to cover the needs of Virginians. Even that block grant  funding would end after 2026--as if the need to help low- and moderate- income people afford coverage would dramatically disappear overnight.   The proposal is new and is newly on the floor. There isn't a full CBO  analysis of it, but initial indication has led groups like the American  Medical Association and the AARP to come out against it. They are  worried it will leave insurance out of the reach of millions of  Americans. In Virginia alone, more than 301,000 marketplace enrollees  would have their tax credits to help them afford insurance jeopardized.    What would it mean for the healthcare system? We are not completely  sure. At least on the earlier versions we voted on, we had CBO scores  telling us how many millions might lose insurance. There seems to be a  desire to rush this through prior to a full CBO analysis. I can't  understand why. But we do know it would be devastating to those on  Medicaid. Sixty percent of those on Medicaid in Virginia are children,  but the majority of spending on Medicaid is for our parents and  grandparents, the elderly, and folks with disabilities.   I was just in Bristol, VA, on the Virginia-Tennessee border this  weekend. I heard very palpable requests for the need for better  healthcare, especially in rural Virginia.   Here is what we know about the Graham-Cassidy proposal, at least  based on the analysis of it thus far by my State healthcare officials.  We will see a $1.2 billion cut in Medicaid under this plan over the  next number of years, and the cuts would impact families like those I  visit as I travel around Virginia.   I recently had a roundtable in Northern Virginia with parents of  children with severe disabilities who, though they have disabilities,  are doing some remarkable things because they receive support from  Medicare for assistive technologies and in school programs.   A mother, Corinne, told me about her son Dylan. Dylan has a very rare  neuromuscular condition SMARD--spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory  distress. He has a tracheostomy tube and relies on a ventilator to  breathe. He also gets all of his nutrition through a G-tube. He  requires in-home skilled nursing services, and he also requires a nurse  to attend school with him. But he goes to public school, and he is a  successful student because Medicaid funding enables him to go. Medicaid  helps reimburse the school system for the services they provide him.   ``For us, affordable and quality healthcare means that Dylan can lead  a fairly normal life despite his medical issues.'' That is what his mom  said. He can lead a fairly normal life on a ventilator with a  tracheostomy tube in a wheelchair with a nurse. He can lead a fairly  normal life, despite his medical issues. He can live at home, go to  school, and participate in activities any kid his age enjoys. Without  the assistance of Medicaid, he wouldn't be able to do those things.   Reducing Medicaid spending would limit States' abilities to provide  waivers for medically complex kids. The mother adds that ``the possible  return of lifetime caps and limitations on preexisting conditions would  be devastating.''   I also met with a mother, Amy, from Richmond, who has a son, Declan.  Medicaid covers her son's care, therapy, and medical supplies. Medicaid  helps her son have the best quality of life possible and helps him with  the prospect she prays deeply for--that one day, despite his medical  condition, he can live independently as a productive adult. The Graham- Cassidy funding cuts to Medicaid could take away this protection for  countless Virginians, especially these children.   Here is what I ask for: Why don't we have an open process to truly  debate improvements to our healthcare system, instead of a rushed,  closed, secretive process that threatens mothers like Amy and children  like Declan?   After the efforts last summer, I hoped that the colleagues in the  world's greatest deliberative body would stop a secretive, harmful rush  and, instead, embrace dialogue, hearing from experts and witnesses as  we would improve healthcare, attempting to stabilize the individual  marketplace, lower premiums, and expand care rather than reduce it.   We gave a standing ovation on the floor of the Senate in late July  when our colleague, Senator John McCain, returned from a very difficult  diagnosis of brain cancer. We gave him a standing ovation after he  spoke to us, and here is what he said. He talked about the fact that we  had a challenge on healthcare. He talked about the skinny repeal bill  that was on the floor of the Senate. He said:         We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind       closed doors in consultation with the administration, then       springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them       it's better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and       force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is       going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.        Why don't we try the old way of legislating in the Senate,       the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. If this       process ends in failure, which seems likely, then let's       return to regular order.        Let the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee       under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray hold       hearings, try to report a bill out of committee with       contributions from both sides. Then bring it to the floor for       amendment and debate, and see if we can pass something that       will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing       to implacable partisans on either side, but that might       provide workable solutions to problems Americans are       struggling with today.    To my great satisfaction, after the skinny repeal bill went down--and  this body decided that it didn't want to precipitously take healthcare  away from 20 million people--that is the course that this body  embraced. It is what our heroic colleague suggested that we embrace.  The HELP Committee--which, as a member of this, I am very aware had  refused to hold a hearing on any of the proposals in the House or in  the Senate around the repeal of ObamaCare--decided finally to do what  the HELP Committee should do. The ``H'' is for ``Health.'' To pass a  bill reorienting one-sixth of the American economy around the most  important expenditure that anybody ever makes in their life without  letting the HELP Committee hear from it was foolish to start with.   So now we have embraced doing it the right way. Under the leadership  of Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, we have had four robust  bipartisan hearings. We invited Governors to come from around the  country. They had to turn their schedules topsy-turvy to do it-- insurance regulators, insurance executives, patients, doctors,  hospitals. There were four hearings, each with multiple witnesses. We  turned their schedules topsy-turvy. We had them here. We had coffees  before each hearing and invited all Members of the Senate, not just  those on the HELP Committee, to interact and hear from these experts.  We have gotten advice from them on what we need to do to stabilize the  individual insurance market and what we can do in the long term to make  healthcare better for everyone. We should take advantage of those  recommendations.   When the fourth hearing was completed last week, the chairman of the  Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, Senator Murray,  with the support of this very diverse committee--left, right and  center, Democrats and Republicans--have embarked on a bipartisan  process to find, after a full and transparent airing of the issues, a  way to stabilize the individual insurance market. We are on the verge  of doing that.    Yet what we are told is, instead of going through our committee  process and hearing and airing it before the public, now there is a new  bill that has just recently come out with no full CBO score. The idea  is to force that through, with no CBO score, with no full committee  process that would enable us to hear from witnesses, with no  [[Page S5844]]  opportunity for members of any of the committees--Finance or HELP--to  offer amendments, with no meaningful floor debate, and with no  opportunity for amendments on the Senate floor.   Why did we give Senator McCain a standing ovation just 6 weeks ago  when he suggested that when it comes to something as important as  healthcare, we should treat it with seriousness, so we can get it right  and not rush and get it wrong?   I stand here--and I hope I am on my feet a good bit more between now  and the end of the month--to ask this question: Why backslide? Why go  backward when we had embraced a process of bipartisan discussion?   I am fully aware that as a Member of the minority party, I have no  power except my ability to convince Republicans that I actually have a  good idea. But a one-party process on the floor that tries to end run  the relevant HELP Committee is guaranteed to fail. It might pass, but  it is guaranteed to fail because it is guaranteed to hurt people. It is  guaranteed to have some consequences that are harmful and known and  other consequences that are harmful and unknown because it has been  rushed, and it hasn't been done in the view of the public with the  ability to fully listen to them. Just think about it this way: What  does it say about your commitment to your legislation if you are not  willing to have it subjected to a normal review by the committees that  have jurisdiction over it?   The Graham-Cassidy bill has some provisions in it that are relevant  to the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, but Finance is apparently not  going to do a markup of the bill, and they are not really going to hear  from experts about the bill.   There are other provisions in Graham-Cassidy dealing with essential  benefits that are squarely within the jurisdiction of the HELP  Committee, but the HELP Committee isn't going to have a hearing either.  So in spite of the good recommendation we were given by our senior  colleague who was just on the floor--who was characteristically here to  talk in kind words about the public service of someone who has worked  with his staff for 30 years--we gave him a standing ovation, and we are  prepared to violate everything that he just suggested we do.   As I conclude, I will just say this. This isn't about healthcare.  Healthcare is important enough. No one ever spends a dollar on anything  that is more important than their health. It is the most important  thing that anyone ever spends a dollar on--health, my health, the  health of my family. I think we can all share that. Nothing is more  important. It also happens to be one of the largest sectors of the  American economy. Between 15 and 20 percent of America's GDP is  healthcare. This is a very important issue. If you are trying to  reorient one-sixth or one-fifth of the economy, if you are touching the  expenditure of priority that is the single most important priority in  anyone's life, that is important enough.   I would argue, in closing, that there is something I think is equally  important; that is, this body. We celebrated the 230th anniversary of  the Constitution this past Sunday. James Madison and others in  Philadelphia, tried to figure out how this government should work. They  made a very unusual decision that would be different from the decisions  that are made in many countries; that is, they put the legislative  branch first.   There are three coequal branches. In most societies, the executive is  first, but not here--first among equals. We are meant to really play an  A game. We are really meant not to be an article-II-and-a-half branch  reacting to a Presidential tweet or encouragement; we are supposed to  be an article I branch.   In the legislative branch in article I, the Senate is given a very  particular role. We are called the world's greatest deliberative body.  We are the saucer into which the partisan heat of the day is poured and  allowed to cool, so the decisions made in the Senate are supposed to be  more careful and more deliberate.   This is a great body that has been sadly hobbled by partisan  gridlock, and we have not achieved what the Senate should achieve. We  learn in math as we grow up that the whole is equal to the sum of the  parts, but what you find in life is that often the math doesn't work  out. Sometimes the whole can be equal to or greater than the sum of the  parts in life if teams work well together. But sometimes--and this  describes the Senate now--there are 100 wonderful, accomplished people  in this body. Yet again and again, and now for years, the whole has  been equal to less than the sum of the parts.   We have done very little of meaning, very little of substance. Yet  now we are poised to tackle the most important issue that most affects  people and the biggest sector of the American economy. If we get it  right, we can send a message to the public that the Senate will once  again be the Senate. We will once again be a deliberative body. We will  once again do what we are supposed to do.   I think this country now needs to see some adults in the room, some  group of people willing to work together--Democratic and Republican--to  solve problems and do the right thing for the American public. If we do  this right, we can send that message. If we do it wrong, we will hurt  people, and we will also hurt the credibility of this institution in a  way that I think will last for years.   We have a choice. It is up to us. We either follow the advice that  our colleague gave us on the floor 6 weeks ago, which we gave him a  standing ovation for, and we gave him the ovation because we knew he  was right--we either follow that advice or we decide to ignore it and  continue the downward spiral of a great body.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
