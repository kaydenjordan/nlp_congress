 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute in  morning business.    Mr. President, in this town, political arguments often  change places very quickly. Actually, observers could get whiplash when  that happens.   Now, just think about just a few months back. Before this election,  we had elected Democrats scaring voters with irresponsible conspiracy  theories that President Trump was going to somehow use his office to  interfere with State elections or that he was in cahoots with the  Postal Service not to deliver ballots.   Remember back after the 2016 election, the irresponsibly worded  talking point was that Russia ``hacked our elections,'' leading to  polls 2 years later showing that 67 percent of Democrats believed  falsely that ``Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald  Trump elected.''   Now let's turn to the 2020 election just completed. Those same people  are now earnestly warning of the dangers of Americans questioning  certified election results. Think just for a minute. Those who  supported hashtag ``resist'' after Trump's election are now lecturing  others about the need for faith in elections.   It is kind of disturbing to me--the hutzpah of some of the people  around here, what they said in 2016 and after versus what they are  saying now.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
