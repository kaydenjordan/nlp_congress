 Mr. Speaker, in all of my 35 years in Congress, this is  one of the most deceitful bills I have ever seen.   It is deceitful when Republicans say the bill is focused on the  middle class while it is really aimed at making the very wealthy even  wealthier and forcing millions of middle class families to pay higher  taxes.   It is deceitful when they say it makes the Tax Code simpler, even as  the legislation creates complicated new loopholes while allowing  existing ones, such as carried interest, to continue.   It is deceitful when the bill will increase the outsourcing of  American jobs by providing a lower tax rate on foreign investment  compared to investing here.   It is deceitful about the debt. Republicans say don't worry about the  expiring tax provisions, but extending them would raise the bill's  already devastating effect on the deficit to $2.3 trillion.   Republicans are rushing this bill, but, even in their haste, they are  already too late. The majority of the American people already say this  bill is a deceitful sham.
