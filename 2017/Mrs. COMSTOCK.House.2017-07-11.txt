 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1397,  which would authorize this Federal land exchange between the National  Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration.   As has been discussed, at issue is the jurisdiction of an access road  adjacent to the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, a privately funded living  history museum which is part of the National Park Service and in my  district in McLean, Virginia.   Claude Moore Farm is a wonderful way to experience what life was like  on a small family farm for the average family in the late 1700s, not  the plantations that we often see preserved, but a very small, average  family farm.   Claude Moore Farm is tucked in right next to the CIA, as has been  mentioned, and the jurisdiction of this particular access road off of  George Washington Memorial Parkway has not been clear and has resulted  in confusion and unnecessary security concerns.   Over the years, general use of this access road has set off security  alarms at Langley. And this confusion has not only been difficult for  security personnel; it has also cost taxpayer resources.   On September 11, 2002, the National Park Service and the Federal  Highway Administration entered into an agreement under which the  transfer of administrative jurisdiction, management, and maintenance of  the lands in question were agreed upon. Since then, the two parties  have been abiding by these rules.   What this agreement does now is make this permanent in a legislative  fix. It is a commonsense, bipartisan bill. We worked on this with  Senator Warner also. Last year he was able to get it attached to the  energy package, but that did not pass, so we now need this to move  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this straightforward,  noncontroversial bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding.
