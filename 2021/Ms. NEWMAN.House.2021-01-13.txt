 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to speak today. So, today,  I stand with this body to impeach this President.   I agree with my Democratic colleagues. I also agree with my  Republican colleagues: Let's unite.   Let's unite to address this pandemic and start by simply wearing a  mask. Let's unite to bring back the economy and start by putting $2,000  checks in people's pockets. And let's unite to hold these domestic  terrorists accountable and impeach this President.
