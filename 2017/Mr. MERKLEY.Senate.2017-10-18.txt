 Mr. President, our Nation was founded on a principle  encapsulated in the first three and most important words of our  Constitution: ``We the People.'' Our Founders wanted to have a nation  that didn't work for the benefit of the powerful and the privileged,  but for decisions of the people, by the people, and for the people, as  President Lincoln so eloquently described our Nation. He did not  describe a nation by and for the powerful, not a nation by and for the  privileged, but by and for the people.   Tomorrow, a bill is coming to the floor that couldn't be more of a  ``by and for the powerful'' bill than we have seen on the floor of the  Senate before. It is a bill completely contrary to the fundamental  values embedded in our Constitution.    This bill is a budget bill, and at its heart, it says: We are going  to do $5 trillion of tax cuts almost completely for the richest  Americans, and we are going to do so by gutting programs that make  America work for working Americans.   The President said: When it comes to tax reform, I want to help the  middle class; I am not going to do anything for the rich and powerful.   Then why, I ask you, is this bill coming to the floor of the Senate  completely for the rich and powerful?   President Trump, come before the American people and explain how you  can make a promise that you are going to do tax reform for the middle  class and then put a bill on the floor of the Senate that is all about  benefits--raiding the National Treasury--for the rich and powerful. How  do you explain this complete opposite?   What a complete pretense we have, to say this bill is about helping  American workers when it is all about the rich and powerful.   The Republican budget plan not only has $5-plus trillion, virtually  all in tax giveaways, a raid on the National Treasury for the rich and  powerful, but it proceeds to cut healthcare for older Americans, a cut  of $1 trillion in Medicaid for working Americans. There will be a lot  of damage done to ordinary Americans who just want peace of mind that  when their loved one gets sick, when their loved one gets injured, they  will get the care they need. Is peace of mind too much to ask of our  national healthcare system? Are my colleagues so callous, so out of  touch, so cruel that they want to fund tax cuts for the richest  Americans by destroying healthcare and diminishing healthcare for our  seniors?   It is not just our seniors, it is our citizens on Medicaid. In  Oregon, it is the Oregon Health Plan. It serves the poorest among us,  many of them working part-time jobs that have no healthcare plan, many  of them working shifts that are determined at the last second. Some of  the most stressful jobs in America are at the very bottom, some of the  most stressful work schedules are at the very bottom, and we are going  to cut not just $1 trillion from Medicaid but half a trillion from  Medicare. Wow.   Let's look at the other programs that would be devastated by this  Republican budget in order to fund that $5 trillion in tax cuts, almost  all for the wealthiest Americans.   The Senate Budget Committee Democratic staff said that if those cuts  in the Republican budget are extended evenly, distributed reductions,  it would have the following impact: It would eliminate housing  assistance for more than 1 million families. It would eliminate heating  assistance for nearly 700,000 seniors on fixed incomes. It would  eliminate nutrition assistance by more than $100 billion--a 33-percent  cut. In other words, to translate that, there would be a lot more  hunger in an already hungry America. It would slash Pell grant funding  by more than $100 million, eliminate Head Start services for 25,000  children in an average year, cut mandatory transportation funding by  $200 billion, cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by $37  billion--all to give a massive tax giveaway to the richest Americans.   If the President is proceeding to say that this is a plan for the  middle class, then we would expect virtually all the benefit to go to  the middle class, but what do we actually have? Four out of five  dollars of benefits go to the top 1 percent, and 40 percent of that  goes to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Why should there be one single  penny going to the very richest Americans in a nation in which we  should be striving for a foundation for every family to thrive?   We know that to thrive, our children have to have food to eat, we  need to have healthcare programs that create peace of mind, and we need  to make sure our seniors have a strong foundation in their retirement,  but instead we see all those programs--including the opportunity for  college and Pell grants--being raided for this massive giveaway to the  top 1 percent.   President Trump, come before the American people and explain how it  is possible that you can claim you are doing a plan for middle-class  America, and you are sending virtually the entire benefit to the top 1  percent of Americans.   This budget resolution's associated tax plan is one of the most  egregious examples of rigging the system of America for the powerful  and privileged rather than a government of, by, and for the people.   I am here today to stand up and say: Not one penny to the top 1  percent. If you want a fair plan for America, it would be not one penny  to the top 1 percent. If you want a plan that strengthens the middle  class, there would be not one penny to the top 1 percent. Not one penny  for billionaires while we gut Medicare and Medicaid. Not one penny for  billionaires when middle-class families' taxes will go up under this  plan. Not one penny for our billionaires while we destroy programs,  safety nets, and opportunities for education, from Head Start to Pell  grants to attend college.   We could do a great deal of good to invest in America. We could  invest in transportation. We have an incredible number of bridges and  roads that need repairs. We can put an incredible number of people to  work building middle-class jobs and middle-class incomes through  building infrastructure instead of a giveaway of the National Treasury  to the top 1 percent. By investing more than $1 trillion, we can create  millions of good-paying American jobs.   There are more than 56,000 bridges in America. One out of eleven is  structurally deficient. Engineers estimate that we could easily spend  $123 billion on repairing bridges and $420 billion modernizing highways  and that we would get a return back to our economy, with lower vehicle  maintenance, decreased delays, lower fuel consumption, improved safety,  lower long-term maintenance costs, lower emissions--all benefits of  investing in transportation, in addition to the fact that it will  strengthen our economy.   We can think about the investment we need to make in our water  infrastructure, the water supply systems and certainly wastewater  treatment--a problem in virtually every town across America. What about  all those lead pipes that need to be replaced? Two thousand years ago,  the Romans were poisoned by their own water because they lined their  aqueducts with lead, and here we are, 20 centuries later, poisoning our  citizens with lead pipes. Why aren't we spending money to take care of  that problem? It is not just a problem in Flint; it is a problem in  hundreds of cities across this country.   If we want America to thrive, why not invest in rural broadband? Why  not create high-speed broadband in every rural town and village across  this Nation, which would strengthen that economy, which would give  people the ability to build their businesses in smalltown, rural  America, instead of spending trillions of dollars in tax giveaways to  the very richest Americans?   How about an investment in our students--not decreasing Pell grants  but strengthening Pell grants to make it possible for more people to  attend college without ending up with a debt the  [[Page S6500]]  size of a home mortgage? It is a real possibility to create debt-free  college in our public universities. Why don't we do that? That will  strengthen the foundation for every family to thrive.   Good jobs, good education, good infrastructure, not a theft from the  American Treasury of $4 trillion to $5 trillion for the very richest  Americans--that is what is being proposed here. Has there ever been a  train robbery as audacious as this theft of the National Treasury for  the richest Americans? Has there ever been a bank robbery as audacious  and outrageous as this theft of the American Treasury for the richest 1  percent of Americans?   Here on the floor, we should be wrestling with how to create a  foundation for every family in America to thrive, not considering a  bill that wipes out healthcare, wipes out Pell grants, does damage to  every conceivable thing that would make this Nation stronger in order  to give the billionaires more zeroes in their bank accounts.   This bill is destructive, it is shameful, and it is contrary to the  very principle of our Constitution of government of, by, and for the  people. This bill is government of, by, and for the 1 percent. It must  not stand.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, I want to recognize the articulate,  thoughtful, and passionate comments that have just been delivered by  the Senator from Nevada. She has already served so effectively on  committees and effectively on legislation, and now she brings her voice  here to this Senate Chamber, where, over the history of our country, so  many important conversations and dialogues have taken place, wrestling  with the challenges we have and looking for the path to build the  future we desire. So I welcome her. Of course, she has been here for  some time now, but I welcome her now, being a part of the dialogue in  this Chamber, which is an honor and something that is granted to only a  few people in our Nation to come and to voice the concerns of our  fellow Americans, of our home State constituents, striving to persuade  colleagues to join in the effort to make our Nation and this world a  better place.
