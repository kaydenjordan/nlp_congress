 Mike Enzi, the Senator from Wyoming, is a friend of  mine. He comes from a beautiful rural State--Wyoming. I come from a  beautiful rural State--Vermont. That is probably the end of our  commonality. We look at the world very differently, and I hope that in  the course of this debate, the American people will see the very  profound differences we have not only on health care, not only on tax  policy, not only on the deficit, but on many other important issues.   What we are looking at right now is a budget process whose ultimate  goal is to remove health insurance from tens of millions of Americans.  Let's be clear. Today, the United States of America is the only major  country on Earth that--I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border.  Many of us have visited Europe. We are the only major country on Earth  that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right. It is  something I passionately believe in. I believe that health care for all  is a human right. I had hoped we would work together to figure out what  is a complicated issue as to how we can move forward to guarantee  health care to all people in a cost-effective way, but that is not what  we are debating today.   Let's be very clear. The Republican plan--their budget plan--lays the  groundwork for ending the Affordable Care Act, which will remove tens  of millions of Americans from the health insurance they get. There is  nothing wrong with change. We can always improve.   I hope that during the course of this debate, my Republican friends  who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act will come down and tell us  what their plan is, how, in fact, they are going to provide quality,  cost-effective health care to all Americans. Well, you know what. They  all voted against the Affordable Care Act. Senator Enzi is right--we  did not get one Republican to vote for it. They have had 8 years to  think about how they are going to come up with a new plan, and I would  hope but I do not expect one Republican to come to the floor and say:  Oh yeah, we are going to throw 20, 30 million people out of their  health insurance. This is our new plan. This is how we are going to  provide health care to those people.   They have no ideas. Their theme is to repeal and then delay. Someday  they are going to come up with a new plan. You don't destroy a house  without having another house in which people can live. You don't throw  30 million people off of health care without having a plan to provide  health care to those people.   Under the Republican proposal--something many Republicans have been  talking about for years--they want to end Medicare as it presently  exists, a program that is life-and-death for millions of seniors. They  want to voucherize Medicare, give people a check, and then let them go  to the private insurance market and get the best deal they can.   Imagine that you are an 85-year-old senior citizen who has been  diagnosed with cancer and you get your check for whatever it may be. We  don't know what it will be--$7,000, $8,000, $9,000.  [[Page S34]]  You go to the insurance company and you say: I have $9,000. I am 85. I  have been diagnosed with cancer. I want you to take care of me. Give me  an insurance program that will take care of my medical needs, my  hospital needs.   The insurance agent will laugh in your face because $9,000 or $8,000  will last you, at most, for 1 week.   That is their plan.   I have been all over the country, and right now the American people  are outraged at the high cost of prescription drugs in this country-- let's be clear--because of the power of the pharmaceutical industry and  their lobbying and their campaign contributions--a power that exists,  by the way, not only influencing Republicans but too many Democrats as  well. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In  fact, one out of six Americans who goes to a doctor to get a  prescription for an illness cannot even afford to fill the  prescription. Yet, under the Republican proposal, if you eliminate the  Affordable Care Act, the doughnut hole fix, which now helps seniors pay  for their prescription drugs, will be eliminated and prescription drugs  for seniors could rise by as much as 50 percent.   By the way, at a time when we have more income and wealth inequality  than any other major country on Earth, when the very rich are getting  richer while the middle class shrinks, the Republican proposal not only  throws 20 to 30 million people off of health insurance, not only raises  the price of prescription drugs for seniors, not only moves forward to  privatize Medicare, but, shock of all shocks, our Republican colleagues  want to give massive tax breaks to the top 2 percent.   Among many other negative impacts that the repeal of the Affordable  Care Act will have will be one that will impact heavily rural States,  such as Wyoming, Vermont, and other rural States around this country;  that is, as a result of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, rural  hospitals could be forced to close their doors--not getting the funding  they need--leaving millions of Americans with nowhere to turn for  critical medical care.   I look forward to this debate. Nobody here thinks the Affordable Care  Act is perfect. Nobody believes that at all. The goal is how we repair  it, how we improve it, how we expand health care to more Americans, how  we end what has been the case for decades in this country--that we pay,  by far, the highest prices in the world per capita for health care.  Maybe we should understand that we are the only major country in the  world that allows private insurance companies to profit off of people's  illness.   The proposal being brought forth by the Republicans is not only  poorly thought out, it really is not popular. It is not what the  American people want. Go to your hometowns and ask people--at a time  when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the  bottom 90 percent, when the top 1 percent is earning 52 percent of all  new income, go out and ask your constituents whether we should give  huge tax breaks to the top 2 percent, and they don't think that is a  good idea.   According to a poll released this month by POLITICO and Morning  Consult, 80 percent of the American people think the Federal Government  should be spending more money on Medicare. Only 10 percent think we  should be spending less. Seventy-one percent of the American people  think we should be spending more on Medicaid.   So 84 percent of the American people think the Federal Government  should be spending more on Social Security. In other words, the  proposal we are seeing from the Republicans today is way, way out of  touch from where the American people are.   There is another issue out there that I find extremely interesting.  Senator Enzi mentioned--and, of course, he is right--that within a  couple of weeks we are going to have a new President. Donald Trump will  be inaugurated as President, and it is interesting that we listened to  what Donald Trump said during the campaign. The Democrats heard what he  had to say during the campaign, what he campaigned on, and more  importantly, Republicans, listened and heard what their leader had to  say about these issues. This is what Donald Trump said, and he didn't  say it once in the middle of the night. He didn't say it in an  interview. This was a central part of his campaign. This is what he  asked millions of elderly people and working-class people to vote for  him on. These are the principles that Donald Trump ran and won the  Presidency on. On May 7, 2015, Donald Trump tweeted: ``I was the first  and only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to  social security, Medicare and Medicaid.'' On April 8, 2015, Mr. Trump  said: ``Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security.''  That is not Bernie Sanders talking; that is Donald Trump talking.         They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it on       Medicaid and we can't do it. It is not fair to the people       that have been paying in for years.    That is not Bernie Sanders--Donald Trump, our soon-to-be President.   On March 29, 2016, Mr. Trump said:         You know, Paul [Ryan]--    Paul Ryan is the Republican Speaker of the House--       wants to knock out Social Security, knock it down, way down.       He wants to knock Medicare way down and frankly . . . you're       going to lose the election if you're going to do that. I am       not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages and I       am not going to do all of the things they want to do, but       they want to really cut it and they want to cut it very       substantially, the Republicans, and I am going to do that.''   What Mr. Trump said was exactly right. Here are the ``they.'' This is  the day. They want to cut Social Security. They want to cut Medicare.  They want to cut Medicaid. Mr. Trump was right, and millions of people  voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word.   Well, it seems to me that Mr. Trump right now has to do one of two  things. No. 1, if all that he was talking about was campaign rhetoric,  then what he is obliged to do now is to tell the American people: I was  lying. Yes, I said that I would not support cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid, but I was lying. It was a campaign ruse. I just  said what came to my mind to get votes. I have no intention of keeping  my word. If that is what he believes, if that is what the case was, let  him come forward and say that. But if that is not what the case is, if  he was sincere, then I would hope that tomorrow or maybe today he could  send out a tweet and tell his Republican colleagues to stop wasting  their time and all of our time and for Mr. Trump to tell the American  people that he will veto any proposal that cuts Medicare, that cuts  Medicaid, and that cuts Social Security. What we are talking about  right now--let us be clear: no debate. That is exactly what this goal  is. That is what this budget proposal is. It is to move toward the  voucherization and privatization of Medicare, to make massive cuts in  Medicaid and throw millions of people off health insurance.   So there is a lot of responsibility on Mr. Trump's shoulders, but I  would hope that he could save us a whole lot of time by telling the  American people that he was sincere in what he said during the  campaign, that he was not lying. If that is the case, we can end this  discussion, get into the serious business of how we create a quality  health care system guaranteeing health care to all people in a cost- effective way.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Texas.    Will my colleague from Michigan yield for a moment?    Will my colleague from Michigan yield for a moment?    Will my colleague from Michigan yield for a moment?    I want to thank my colleague for her very thoughtful  presentation talking about the implications of simply repealing  ObamaCare.   The assumption that many of my colleagues seem to start from is that  before ObamaCare, the health care system was great in America, that  everybody had health care in a cost-effective way and then ObamaCare  came along and all of these problems arose.   What the Senator from Michigan just told us--and I want people to  remember it--8 years ago, if you were diagnosed with cancer and you  walked into an insurance company, they would say: Why would we give you  insurance? We will lose money on you. Your cancer may recur.   You are a woman and you want maternity coverage? What do you think is  going on? Why should we do that?   You are a family with a kid who is 21 years of age and you want his  insurance on your policy? Well, you couldn't have it.   I think what the Senator from Michigan pointed out is not that anyone  thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect--nobody thinks it doesn't  need improvement. But to simply throw out all of the benefits, for 30  million people to be thrown off of health insurance--during the budget  hearings a couple of years ago that Senator Enzi chaired, I asked a  question of my colleagues when this idea came up, and I would ask it  again to my good friend from Wyoming. What are the studies you have  seen in terms of the number of people who will die when they lose their  health insurance? How many thousands of people will die because they no  longer have health insurance and they cannot go to the doctor and the  hospital? The studies I have seen suggest that many thousands of people  will die. That is common sense. If you throw 30 million people off of  health insurance, they are going to die. How do you go forward  providing a death penalty to thousands of people without having any  solution to it?   Further, I would add to the excellent points made by the Senator from  Michigan. Senator Enzi and the Senator from Texas before him talked  about the impact of health care problems in rural areas. I come from a  rural area. Michigan has large parts of the State that are rural. The  Senators from rural areas on the Republican side have said they want to  make sure their constituents in rural areas can see a doctor. That is  certainly a modest proposal. Of course they should be able to see a  doctor.   If that is the case, my Republican friends should understand what the  Federation of American Hospitals and the American Hospital Association  said about repealing the Affordable Care Act. These are major hospital  organizations. According to a very recent report, what they said is  that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act will mean a reduction in  payments to rural hospitals of over $165 billion over a 10-year period.  According to the hospital associations, rural hospitals will suffer an  additional loss of $289 billion from their inflation updates.   This is a report from the Federation of American Hospitals and the  American Hospital Association, major health care institutions in  America. They said in their report: ``This reversal of health coverage  would represent an unprecedented public health crisis.'' Furthermore,  they said: ``The magnitude of reductions would threaten hospitals'  ability to serve patients.''   So when we talk about the needs of rural Americans, I would hope my  colleagues listen to what the Federation of American Hospitals and the  American Hospital Association have to say.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jenna Sablan  and Natalie Rico, detailees to the Budget Committee, be granted floor  privileges during the consideration of S. Con. Res. 3.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mike Jones  and Josh Smith from my staff be given all-access floor passes for the  Senate floor during consideration of the budget resolution, S. Con.  Res. 3.
