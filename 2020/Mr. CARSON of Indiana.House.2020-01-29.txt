 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank  Congresswoman Tlaib for her leadership, for her friendship, for all  that she does not for just her constituents, but for Muslims, non- Muslims, and Americans.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the NO BAN Act, which was a  great opportunity for me to be a coauthor, and I urge Congress to  swiftly pass this legislation.   Madam Speaker, in the 3 years since President Trump implemented his  Muslim ban, its dangerous impact is clearer than ever: Families remain  torn apart, America is less respected around the world, and our country  isn't any safer.   But for this President and for all of those who crafted this ban,  this policy was never about national security. Since his first day in  office, he has worked to advance a dangerous white nationalist agenda,  and the Muslim ban is its cornerstone.   It is no surprise, then, that he may be planning to expand this ban  to even more countries, many in Africa, which he has previously  described in some of the most vulgar and offensive ways.   As a Muslim and as a Black man, it pains me to witness this low  moment in our country. It is not the only time America has shut its  doors to people in need simply because of their race, ethnicity, and  nationality; but, thankfully, we can make it the last time. Madam  Speaker, that is why it is so important that we pass the NO BAN Act to  end the Muslim ban and make sure history no longer repeats itself in  this way.   Our legislation has more than 200 cosponsors in the House and the  endorsement of nearly 400 diverse civil rights, faith, national  security, and community organizations. Americans of all backgrounds are  behind this great bill and are demanding Congress to pass it, to take a  bold stand against bigotry. So I am extremely pleased that the NO BAN  Act is expected to be taken up by the Judiciary Committee next month.   As my colleague, Congresswoman Tlaib said, and I want to reaffirm,  Muslims are part of what makes this country great.                                time  2045    Muslims have been a part of this country since the inception of what  we now know to be America. Ever since those West African slaves were  brought here to America, Muslims have contributed to our country.   Go to any major courtroom, and you will find a Muslim lawyer, maybe a  judge. Go to any major hospital in this great country, and you will  find a Muslim physician. There are Muslim engineers, Muslim scientists,  Muslim educators, Muslim politicians. You have three in Congress. We  will see more in the future, God willing.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues and all Americans who believe in  equality for all people to support the NO BAN Act. Together, we will  get it passed and begin a new chapter in our country's history.
