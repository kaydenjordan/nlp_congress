 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Andrew  Burk for being named St. Johns County Teacher of the Year.   Mr. Burk received this honor for his work as band director and  teaching sixth, seventh, and eighth grade music classes at Valley Ridge  Academy. Teaching since 2017, he has received awards for both  outstanding educational leadership and high academic classroom  achievement.   Mr. Burk uses innovative teaching methods to help students learn  faster and play advanced music earlier in their musical development.  Outside of the classroom, he was also a cofounder of the Collegiate  Music Education Day at the Florida Capitol.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank  Mr. Burk for his dedication to educating the students of northeast  Florida and for his commitment to the success of his students and peers  alike.                Congratulating the FOAR From Home Rowing Team     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the FOAR  From Home rowing team for crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 51 days, 11  hours, and 41 minutes.   The team of four from Fernandina Beach rowed more than 3,000 miles,  beginning in the Canary Islands and ending in Antigua. This  unbelievable accomplishment was part of an annual race that takes place  in December and included 30 different rowing teams.   The FOAR From Home team consisted of four American veterans: Billy  Cimino of the United States Army, Cameron Hansen of the United States  Air Force, A.M. Huppmann of the United States Navy, and Paul Lore of  the United States Marine Corps.   The team raised money to help end veteran suicide, with proceeds  going to K9s for Warriors, an organization in northeast Florida that  pairs service dogs with veterans suffering from PTSD.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank  FOAR From Home for their individual service to our Nation, and I  congratulate them on a once-in-a-lifetime team accomplishment.                            ____________________
