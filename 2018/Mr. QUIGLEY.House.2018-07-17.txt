 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I first want to thank Chairman Graves, whom I had the  privilege of working with for a second year in managing this bill. Our  discussions have been both passionate and productive, and I thank him  for always allowing for vigorous debate throughout the process.   And, of course, I would again like to thank the staff on both sides  for their work behind the scenes that went into preparing this bill for  floor consideration. In particular, I would like to recognize and thank  committee staff on the minority side, Lisa, Chris, Angela, Martha, as  well as Doug from my personal office.    But with that said, I continue to strongly oppose the bill before us  today.   Given its flat allocation of $23.4 billion, this bill does not  adequately meet the growing needs of our small businesses, taxpayers,  and middle class consumers and investors.   To be fair, I do want to acknowledge how pleased I was to see  increased funding for the Office of Terrorism and Financial  Intelligence, Federal Defender Services, and the Small Business  Administration, three very different priorities, each critical in its  own right; but this does not negate the cuts suffered by some of our  most important agencies tasked with missions ranging from policing Wall  Street to supporting investment in our most underserved communities.   After losing over a billion dollars in funding and 18,000 staff  between 2010 and 2017, my friends in the majority have reversed course  and have begun providing the IRS with additional funds to implement  their new law, yet taxpayer service is cut by $15 million. GSA's  funding for new construction is cut by over $400 million, and funds for  major and basic repairs and alterations come in at $194 million below  the requested amount.   The SEC, which is tasked with protecting investors and ensuring  fairness in our capital markets, is cut by over $200 million, even  though the Commission's budget is financed by industry fees.   The CDFI Fund, after receiving increased funding of $250 million in  fiscal year 2018, was inexplicably cut by $59 million in the original  draft. With an additional $25 million for CDFI approved in committee,  it is still not enough. Failing to fully fund the program means fewer  resources to spur economic growth and revitalization in our most  underserved communities.   In addition to these cuts, the bill contains a long list of partisan  riders, both old and new, blocking the IRS from enforcing the Johnson  amendment and restricting the SEC from requiring companies to disclose  political contributions. It would interfere in the local affairs of  D.C. in an infinite number of ways, which simply must stop.                                time  1930    Let's talk about the business at hand. I was heartened to see  Republicans speak out against the President's performance in Helsinki.  The reaction to the President not understanding the full breadth and  width of the Russian attack on our democratic process was  extraordinary. The Russians attacked us. They will be back. Most  likely, they probably never left. But those tweets are one thing. You  have to put your dollars and your votes where your tweets are.   After providing the States with $380 million in grants to help  fortify and protect election systems from cyber hacking, this bill  zeroes out that fund for 2019. I have made this argument time and  again, but it is worth repeating that the $380 million that has been  allocated is a step in the right direction, but it is only a down  payment. For a majority of the 13 States that still use voting machines  with no paper trail, at most, the funds they receive only cover half  the replacement costs. Forty States use old equipment, which cannot  handle modern anti-cyber hacking software.   The entity that manages these grants, EAC, has announced that every  State has requested funding, showing overwhelming demand for these  resources. That is why I offered an amendment in the committee markup  to restore funding for the program. Unfortunately, it failed in a  party-line vote.   Let me emphasize, again: We must do more to protect our democratic  process from those who wish us harm, not just for the upcoming  midterms, but for 2020 and beyond.   Most States maxed out the amount of money they could request from  this program. Obviously, many other States, I suspect, would be a  little more enthusiastic if the President didn't tell them this was a  witch hunt or a hoax.   So there is much more we can do toward that end. Let's remind  ourselves of the last time we had an election debacle of this  magnitude: Bush-Gore. This government spent $3.4 billion. Why? Because  we treasure the democratic process. We want every vote to count, and we  certainly don't want a foreign adversary to be able to detract from  that.    Madam Chair, I just ask my colleagues, let us join  together. There was never a more important time to treasure our  democracy and fund the programs that protect them.
