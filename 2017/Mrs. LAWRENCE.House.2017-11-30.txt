 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the EQUALS Act.   As a former Federal employee, I served in many capacities, from a  letter carrier to a manager, and I know the dedication of those who  serve in our civil service jobs. This bill is an insult to Federal  employees and is completely unnecessary.   Mr. Chairman, I say this is a bill in search of a problem. What are  we fixing?   This is not good-government legislation. It just makes it easier to  fire Federal employees without due process. By arbitrarily extending  probationary periods, this bill takes away civil servants' employment  rights and due process protections for at least 2 years.   Mr. Chairman, do you realize that benefits that career employees are  entitled to are held in abeyance while they are on probation? They are  given a different classification as being probationary than they are as  being a career employee.   What are we trying to achieve?   They also give up the right to receive 30 days' notice before they  are fired or furloughed, and they do not receive their rights as  whistleblowers as probationary employees. This bill simply takes away  workers' rights.   How many Members of Congress' parents worked as Federal employees to  put them through college and to make a difference in America?   Here we are assaulting the legacy of Federal employees who work every  day to make this country an amazing place to live.   This is not the way to address performance issues in the Federal  workplace. As a Federal employee who had the responsibility to perform  probationary evaluations, you need to talk to the supervisor if they  are not doing their job conducting the proper evaluations.   We must continue to support accountability measures and tools. In  addition, we must keep the spotlight on gross mismanagement.
